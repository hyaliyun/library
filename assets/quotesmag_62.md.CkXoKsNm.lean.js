Founded in 1968 as a magazine, the organization has continued to expand to include conference and seminar programming. The organization continues to publish a magazine twice a year, maintains an online journal, and hosts two annual national conferences: the International Conference and the Design Nation Conference. History =Origins= Business Today was founded as a magazine in 1968 by Steve Forbes, Michael Mims, and Jon Perel, who were students at Princeton University at the time. Created in an era where business and finance was facing backlash from the public, Forbes, Mims, and Perel's magazine immediately caught the attention of the outside world. Later in 1968, the three co-founders were interviewed on the Today Show with Hugh Downs, giving the magazine nationwide notoriety. =1970s= In 1971, Business Today became a nonprofit foundation. The same year, the organization hosted its first conference, ‚ÄúBusiness Tomorrow,‚Äù which would eventually evolve into the present-day International Conference. This first conference lasted from October 20‚Äì22. Speakers included Richard Clarke and Ralph Nader. The event was held in Sheraton Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. The conferences originally happened sporadically and in cities around the country, but by the mid-to-late 70s, they became more regular and concentrated geographically. In 1974, the first official annual International Conference was held in New York City, inviting students from around the globe to participate. In 1976, Meg Whitman became Vice President of Business Today. =1980s to 2000s= In 1988, Wendy Kopp became President of Business Today. She brainstormed the idea of Teach for America during an International Conference. In 2007, Michael Kratsios became President of Business Today. =2010s= In the 2010s, Business Today began greatly expanding its programming for college students, as well as increasing its editorial capacities. In 2012, Business Today hosted the Start @ a Startup conference. During the same year, Business Today published its Online Journal, which features editorial pieces, interviews, career pieces, seminar coverage, and conference coverage. In 2013, Business Today launched its Women in Business Conference, which would eventually become rebranded as HerVentures. In 2017, Mihika Kapoor spearheaded the first Design Nation conference for undergraduate students. Business Today also launched its first annual Breakout trip, allowing for 15 students to visit companies around New York City. In 2018, Business Today celebrated its 50th Anniversary. Business Today Magazine Business Today is an American magazine created by and for college students. It was founded in 1968 by three students at Princeton University‚ÄîJonathan Perel, Steve Forbes, and Michael Mims. Currently, Business Today is the largest student-run magazine in the United States. It is published twice a year, and has a distribution base of over 200,000 college students and business executives.ULM Presidential Lyceum Series International Conference The Business Today International Conference is the organization's largest and signature event. Held annually in New York City, the all-expenses-paid event brings 150 distinguished undergraduate students from around the world together with current business and world leaders to discuss and share perspectives on relevant business issues. Past keynote speakers at the conference have included Gerald Ford, Andrea Jung, Brad Smith, and Henry Kissinger. The conference also holds a social entrepreneurship pitch competition, the Impact Challenge, which awards $15,000 in seed funding to the top student-created venture. This challenge is judged by finance professionals. In 2018, the 44th Annual International Conference attracted around 4000 applications and the conference itself focused on the theme of The Future of Work. A Writing Competition was also launched to offer alternative entrance into the conference; it published the top three winners in Business Today's Magazine and Online Journal.

He made his professional debut in May 1961 and reached a highest rank of sekiwake in May 1967. He was a runner-up in two top division (makuuchi) tournaments, finishing three wins behind Tamanoshima in May 1968 and losing a playoff to ozeki Kiyokuni in July 1969. He earned four kinboshi for defeating yokozuna and won seven special prizes. After his retirement in 1972 at the age of 26 he became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and took over as head coach of Isenoumi stable in 1982. He left the Sumo Association in 2011 upon reaching 65 years of age. Career He joined professional sumo upon graduating from Takushoku University Daiichi High School in 1961. He initially wrestled under his own surname, Morita. He won the makushita division championship or yusho in November 1965 with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record. He reached the juryo division in January 1966 and the top makuuchi division in November 1966, one of the first wrestlers born after World War II to achieve this. One of his stablemates at Isenoumi stable was yokozuna Kashiwado Tsuyoshi. In just his third top division tournament March 1967 he defeated a yokozuna, earning his first kinboshi, won two special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique, and scored 12 wins against three losses. He was rewarded with promotion to the sanyaku ranks for the first time, at sekiwake. He was demoted after one tournament after scoring only 7‚Äì8 and only made the rank one more time in 1970, although he was ranked at komusubi on several other occasions. He was runner-up in two tournaments, in May 1968 (although he only scored 10‚Äì5) and July 1969 (after losing a play- off to Kiyokuni after both had finished on 12‚Äì3). He was popular with sumo fans and was nicknamed \\"Ima-Ushiwaka\\", a reference to the samurai warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune. On the sixth day of the July 1971 he suffered an injury to his left leg in a match with Yoshinohana, which led to him withdrawing from the tournament and being demoted to the juryo division. He felt he had to return to action in the next tournament to win back his rank despite not being fully healed, and withdrew again. It was partly in response to his slump in form due to his injury that the Sumo Association introduced the kosho seido or public injury system, whereby a wrestler injured in competition could sit out the next tournament without an effect on his rank. Fujinokawa did eventually manage to return to the top division in July 1972 but withdrew once again during the following tournament in September 1972 and never fought again. Retirement from sumo He retired in November 1972 at the age of just 26, and after working as an assistant coach for some years under the elder name Tatekawa, he became Isenoumi Oyakata and head coach of the Isenoumi stable in December 1982 upon the death of the previous head, former maegashira Kashiwado Hidetake. He produced the top division wrestlers Kitakachidoki, Tosanoumi and Oikari. In February 2002 he was elected to the board of directors of the Japan Sumo Association. He commented about the suspension of Asash≈çry≈´ in August 2007. He apologized to Japan's vice sports minister Kenshiro Matsunami on behalf of the Sumo Association over the case of Junichi Yamamoto in February 2008. He also worked as the head of the Sumo Association's general planning department, looking after the health of the wrestlers, and he has warned that their increasing size and reliance on training machines instead of traditional head-to-head kawaigari training has made them more susceptible to injury. He stood down from the board in February 2010. He was responsible for developing in 2011 questionnaires to assess the wrestlers' fighting spirit that are handed out to the public on tournament match days. On September 25, 2011, NHK's live sumo broadcast contained coverage of Isenoumi oyakata's retirement press conference. He announced that he would be turning 65 the following day and thereby reach the mandatory retirement age of a sumo coach. He named his replacement as head coach as Katsunoura Oyakata, the former Kitakachidoki. In March 2018 he was appointed as a Hyogi-in-kai or outside voter in the Sumo Association, although he has no oyakata status.

This was the first time U.S. warships faced an air raid since the end of World War II. The Battle for ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi Gulf involved fierce firefights when Navy ships attempted to stop North Vietnamese troops and supplies transiting the coast highway in North Vietnam from reaching the battle front in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. The air raid described here marked the end of daylight raids by the Navy. Within a few weeks, however, all North Vietnamese resistance at ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi was suppressed. Battle The U.S. warships involved were the 7th Fleet flagship, guided missile cruiser , the guided missile frigate , and destroyers and . The American warships operating in the Gulf of Tonkin were shelling North Vietnamese coastal targets around ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi, Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province, North Central Coast region near the DMZ along the 17th parallel, the provisional borderline between South Vietnam and North Vietnam when they were attacked by VPAF MiGs in the first air attack on U.S. naval forces in the Vietnam War. At approximately 17:00, USS Sterett detected three hostile aircraft approaching the navy ships. One of the MiG-17s scored a direct hit on USS Higbee with a BETAB-250 () bomb, after failing to hit its target twice on two previous attack runs. The explosion destroyed the aft gun mount which was empty, as the 12-man crew having been evacuated following a \\"hang fire\\" (a round stuck in one of the barrels). Another MiG-17 simultaneously aimed its bombs at USS Oklahoma City but missed the target. According to U.S. claims, one of the MiGs was shot down by a Terrier surface-to-air missile from USS Sterett. One more MiG disappeared from Steretts radar along with a Terrier missile fired at it from the frigate, indicating a probable kill. A North Vietnamese Styx anti- ship missile was alleged to have been fired and intercepted, but this was not confirmed by official documentation. At approximately 18:00 as the US ships withdrew to the northeast, USS Sterett detected two surface targets shadowing the US ships, after 30 minutes, Sterett opened fire on the targets with its 5-inch guns destroying the two suspected North Vietnamese P 6-class torpedo boats. Aftermath USS Higbee showing the aft 5\\"/38 gun mount bombed during the battle of ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi The North Vietnamese claimed the sortie involved two MiG-17s piloted by L√™ Xu√¢n D·ªã and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£y \\"B\\", of which all returned safely to their base, and that the North Vietnamese navy had not participated in any engagement until August 27. The attack crippled Higbees 5-inch gun turret, impaired its steering and propulsion, and wounded 4 sailors on deck. Oklahoma City only sustained minor damage on its stern. The U.S. later responded by bombardment against Vinh and ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi on April 19 and 20, and an air strike by 33 aircraft on April 22 at the Khe G√°t Airfield, from which the attacking MiG-17s had taken off, destroying one MiG and damaging another on the ground. Although the losses inflicted were superficial, the North Vietnamese attack had forced the Americans to employ more of their strength to prevent future incidents against the background of downscaling U.S. military activities in the area.

She was trained at the Bolshoi School and graduated in 1941. She immediately joined the Kirov Ballet where she remained until her retirement in 1970. According to Meisner, \\"her flawless technique, allied to a sensitive reticence, fitted the Maryinsky's elegant purity and they invited her to join\\". She was half-Jewish with an exceptional, dark-eyed beauty - earning the nickname the Black Pearl. She then became a teacher of the company until her death. She married twice: first to Nikolai Zubkovsky - whose name she kept for the stage - before divorcing him and marrying Sviatoslav Kusnetsov. Both her husbands were dancers. and her daughter, Katerina, and her son, Nikolai, both became dancers in the Maryinsky. Zubkovskaya was unusual as she was a Kirov dancer with a Bolshoi background. This arose as she was evacuated to Perm, a wartime haven for Soviet artists and arts institutions, where she joined the Kirov Ballet. She danced many major roles of the classical repertory, including Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, Nikiya in La Bayad√®re, Kitri in Don Quixote, the Lilac Fairy in The Sleeping Beauty and the title role of La Esmeralda. The roles she created include the classic role of Phrygia in Leonid Jacobson's version of Spartacus in 1956 and Mekhmene-Banu in Yuri Grigorovich's Legend of Love in 1961. Jacobson also made Shuraleh for her and she scored an enormous success in his Choreographic Miniatures, dancing the Eternal Idol, based on a Rodin sculpture. Zubkovskaya did not dance frequently in the West, although in 1961 when the Kirov made its first appearances outside Russia, she was the first-cast Odette-Odile in Swan Lake and was partnered by Vladilen Semyonov. She opened the New York season in that role at the Metropolitan Opera House on 11 September 1961. Other notable roles included the Lilac Fairy in The Sleeping Beauty and as the Mistress of the Copper Mountain in Grigorovich's The Stone Flower. Zubkovskaya and her second husband, Sviatoslav Kusnetsov, played the title roles in the Russian film Aleko which was released in 1953.Inna Zubkovskaya Filmography She was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1951, among other honours. She coached many famous dancers during her teaching career, including: Altynai Asylmutova, Larissa Lezhnina, Elvira Terasova, and Veronika Part.

During his long life, he greatly expanded his clan's territories and influence. Sources There is little authority for the existence and life of Alexander which pre-dates the (frequently unreliable) clan histories written in the 17th century.See generally the enlightening discussion by Douglas Hickling, published in the Canadian Chapter Magazine of the Clan MacKenzie Society in the Americas, in particular in March 2004. MS 1467, a 15th-century genealogy, demonstrates that the Mackenzies were by then already recognised as a family of long standing, but does not refer to Alexander himself.See the online presentation and translation of the manuscript by M√°ire and Ronnie Black. The historicity of Alexander was for a long time based on two alleged charters in his favour dated 1463 and 1477. J.R.N. Macphail KC cast doubt on these: > According to Mr. P. J. Anderson (Scots Peerage, vol. vii. p. 497) he had a > charter of Killin and other lands from the Earl of Ross in 1463, and a crown > charter in 1477 of Strathconan and other lands forfeited by the Earl. But > the authority cited is only an Inventory of the Allangrange Papers. He does > not appear in the Register of the Great Seal or other public > records.Highland Papers, volume 2 (Publications of the Scottish History > Society, 1916), at page 13. However, the inventory recording the charter of 1463 (a list of the charters in the possession of Colin Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth) has been in existence since about 1627 and its authenticity is implicitly accepted by Aonghas MacCoinnich.MacCoinnich, A. (2003) \\"Kingis rabellis\\" to Cuidich 'n' Righ; the emergence of Clann Choinnich, c. 1475-1508. In: Boardman, S. and Ross, A. (eds) The Exercise of Power in Medieval Scotland, 1200-1500. Four Courts Press, Dublin, pp. 175‚Äì200 In any event, although the existence and terms of these two charters may be doubtful, it is established that \\"Alexander McKennye de Kintail\\" did witness a charter executed by John of Islay, Earl of Ross at Dingwall in 1471.Jean and R.W.Munro, Acts of the Lords of the Isles: 1336-1493 (Scottish History Society, 1986), at pages 160-161; discussed by Hickling, op.cit. He also appears in a papal marriage dispensation dated 13 September 1465, which was granted to his son, who was styled as \\"Kenneth, son of Alexander, family of Kenneth\\".Jean and R.W.Munro, Acts of the Lords of the Isles: 1336-1493 (Scottish History Society, 1986), at page 244; discussed by Hickling, op.cit. In the following year, Alexander himself sought dispensation in terms which recorded that he had been married to \\"Catherine, daughter of John, son of Ranald\\" for about thirty years and that they had offspring. Early life According to the traditional clan genealogy, Mackenzie was the son of Murdoch Mackenzie (5th of Kintail) and Finguala, daughter of Malcolm Macleod of Harris. He was allegedly among the Western barons summoned to Inverness in 1427 to meet King James, who promptly seized them on arrival, executing some and imprisoning others. The king sent Mackenzie, then a mere youth, to the High School at Perth, regarded at that time as the principal literary seminary in Scotland. According to traditional histories of the Clan Macrae, he was prevailed upon by Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd to return from school in order to deal with three illegitimate uncles, who were disturbing his tenants in Kinlochewe. Downfall of the Lord of the Isles In the long- running conflict between the Lord of the Isles and the Scottish crown, Mackenzie chose the side of the latter. The course of events, as they affected Mackenzie, is allegedly summarised in the two charters in his favour which are referred to above. On 7 January 1463, Mackenzie received a charter from John of Islay, Earl of Ross, confirming him in his lands of Kintail, with a further grant of the \\"5 merk lands of Killin, the lands of Garve, and the 2 merk lands of Coryvulzie, with the three merk lands of Kinlochluichart, and 2 merk lands of Ach-na-Clerich [Achnaclerach], the 2 merk lands of Garbat, the merk lands of Delintan, and the 4 merk lands of Tarvie, all lying within the shire and Earldom of Ross, to be holden of the said John and his successors, Earls of Ross.\\" However, in 1462, John of Islay had over-reached himself by entering into a treacherous agreement with Edward IV of England and Mackenzie later played a significant part in the negotiations between John of Islay and James III that led to the former's surrender of the Earldom of Ross in 1476. Mackenzie was rewarded in 1477 with a charter from the Crown to some of the lands renounced by the Earl of Ross, namely Strathconan, Strathbraan, and Strathgarve, and was confirmed in his lands in Kintail. It was probably at this point that Mackenzie moved his family's chief residence from Eilean Donan in Kintail to Kinellan Castle, near Strathpeffer.John L. Roberts, Feuds, Forays and Rebellions: History of the Highland Clans 1475-1625 (Edinburgh University Press, 1999), at page 121 After this the Barons of Kintail held all their lands quite independently of any superior but the Crown. At some point between 1485 and 1491, Mackenzie's son Kenneth led the Mackenzies to victory over Alexander Macdonald of Lochalsh at the Battle of Blar-na-Pairc. This battle may be regarded as a seal upon the rise of the Mackenzies at the expense of their former Macdonald overlords. Earldom of Ross The Earl of Sutherland had been on friendly terms with Mackenzie, and appointed him as his deputy in the management of the Earldom of Ross, which devolved on him after the forfeiture. On one occasion, the Earl of Sutherland being in the south at Court, the Strathnaver men and the men of the Braes of Caithness took advantage of his absence and invaded Sutherland. It is said that an account of their conduct soon spread abroad, and reached the ears of the Chief of Kintail, who at once with a party of six hundred men, passed into Sutherland, where, the Earl's followers having joined him, he defeated the invaders, killed a large number of them, forced the remainder to sue for peace, and compelled them to give substantial security for their peaceful behaviour in future. The Earl of Cromartie said: :‚Äú‚Ä¶as his prudent management in the Earldom of Ross showed him to be a man of good natural parts, so it very much contributed to the advancement of the interest of his family by the acquisition of the lands he thereby made; nor was he less commendable for the quiet and peace he kept among his Highlanders, putting the laws punctually in execution against all delinquents.\\" Other clan disputes Mackenzie also involved himself in the affairs of his neighbours. According to the Earl of Cromartie, he intervened to assist Allan Macdonald of Moidart (with whom he had previously been at loggerheads) against Allan's brother, who had usurped some of the Moydart estates, and there are also traditional accounts of his involvement in about 1452 in the Battle of Bealach nam Broig between a western force of MacIvers, Maclennans, Macaulays and Macleays against a force of Frasers, Munroes of Foulis and Dingwalls of Kildun. Family, death and posterity Alexander was the first of the family who lived on the island in Loch Kinellan, near Strathpeffer, while at the same time he had Brahan as a mains or farm, both of which his successors for a time held from the King at a yearly rent, until they were later feued. Alexander's marriages have been the subject of genealogical controversy. The weight of traditional clan history is to the effect that he married, first, Anna, daughter of John Macdougall of Dunollie, and, secondly, Margaret, daughter of Macdonald of Morar (a cadet of Macdonald of Clanranald), but Aonghas MacCoinnich has pointed out the difficulties which Alexander's supplication for dispensation in 1466 (referred to above) presents for the traditional account. MacCoinnich speculates that Catherine, who was recorded in the supplication as Alexander's wife, may have been the granddaughter of Ranald, the eponym of Clanranald. By his first wife, Alexander had Kenneth, his heir and successor, and Duncan, progenitor of the Mackenzies of Hilton. By his second wife (if he had one), he had Hector Roy (or \\"Eachainn Ruadh\\"), from whom are descended the Mackenzies of Gairloch, and a daughter who married Allan Macleod, Hector Roy's predecessor in Gairloch. He is also said to have had a natural son (or, in some sources, a brother), Dugal, who became a priest and was Superior of Beauly Priory, which he repaired about 1478, and in which he is buried. The date of Alexander's death is uncertain, though it is clear that he had died by 1488,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Mackenzie family of Kintail since his eldest son was served heir in the lands of Kintail at Dingwall on 2 September 1488.Sir James Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage; Volume 7 (1910); Mackenzie, Earl of Seaforth Aonghas MacCoinnich suggests that Alexander may in fact have died by July 1479, as his son was by then already being held responsible for rental payments in the king's dukedom of Ross.

It stars Rupert Grint, Kimberley Nixon, Robert Sheehan and James Nesbitt. Filming began on location in Belfast on 7 July 2008, and lasted four weeks. The film includes nudity, drinking, drugs, shop-lifting and car theft. It was released to DVD on 23 August 2010 in the United Kingdom. It premiered in the United States in September 2009 at the Los Angeles Irish Film Festival. The film's theme song is \\"Cherry Bomb\\" by The Runaways. Cherrybomb premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, but was initially unable to find a distributor. An online campaign by Grint's fans was credited with helping to secure a deal for distribution in the United Kingdom. Plot Malachy McKinny is a straight-A teenager working at the Titanic Leisureplex, a sports training complex owned and run by Dave. His best friend is Luke, a drug dealer living with his drug-addicted father. The two boys find themselves entranced by Michelle, a beautiful and charismatic teen who has just moved from London to live with her father, Dave. Luke and Malachy attempt to win Michelle's affections by outdoing each other on a wild ride of sex, drugs, vandalism, shoplifting, and fighting. However, all three teens find that they are in over their heads when they throw a party in the Titanic Leisureplex, which turns disastrous when Dave walks in to find his place trashed. Blaming Malachy, he almost beats him to death. Malachy is saved by Luke, who smacks Dave over the head with a pole. Stunned, Dave slowly turns to look at Luke, and receives a second blow to the head. While Malachy is covered in blood and bruises, he gets up and tells Luke that he does not want to leave, since Michelle is grieving for her dead father. Luke, being a \\"supportive\\" friend, stays with Malachy until the paramedics and police show up and take them in for questioning. The ending of the film turns out to be the opening sequence to the film. Although we only see bits and pieces of the ending interrogation, the audience gets to hear of Malachy's and Luke's final words on the incident before the film cuts out.

The financial institution broke up in 2012 among allegations of irregularities and failure by the relevant control organ of the Government of Navarre to audit the savings bank for several years. On an yearly basis, UPN's regional Government was handed over a copy-paste, two-page long activity report by Caja Navarra, as revealed in 2014. History The bank resulted from the merger of the Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad Municipal de Pamplona (founded by the Pamplona city council in 1872) and the Caja de Ahorros de Navarra (founded by the Provincial Government of Navarre in 1921) on January 17, 2000. In August 1924, the Federation of Basque-Navarrese Savings Banks was established with a view to mutually assisting and progressing together in the face of growing competition from the rising Basque banks. The Savings Banks of Pamplona joined almost immediately in 1925. On accession of Miguel Sanz to regional office in Navarre (1996), the merger of both traditional savings banks took place to form Caja Navarra. In short time it became one of the three banks that merged to become Banca Civica.Corporate Governance. Vol. 7, No. 4, 2007. p. 436.Caja Navarra The merger came after proposals to form a powerful financial holding within the Basque context put forward by like savings banks in the Basque Autonomous Community failed to materialize. Political objections raised by the Navarrese party in office UPN prevented any moves in that direction. Banking context In Spain, savings banks or cajas are private financial institutions organized as foundations. When they were created, their identifying features were their concern for saving, focus on the poorer classes, concentration in a geographical area, and allocation of a significant part of their profits to community and charity projects.Corporate Governance. Vol.7, No.4, 2007. p. 434. Under the 26/2013 Act passed by the Spanish Conservative Government that year, all savings banks were required to change their legal status, most of the times into a bank foundation. On its last stage prior to its 2012 disappearance, Caja Navarra developed under Enrique Go√±i as CEO. The Caja Navarra scandal A series of decisions made during several years led to the crash of the Caja Navarra as a savings bank, and its conversion into a foundation. In the Navarre political arena, mismanagement and obscurantism accusations emerged early on, even before the eventual fall of the financial institution. A parliamentary investigation panel was established in January 2015 to determine possible responsibilities. Notes References * http://www.can.es/en/ * Corporate Governance.

When they are ready to buy real estate, the fund managers issue a capital call, requiring investors who have committed money to the fund to transfer that money over. The fund might also borrow funds instead of using the investor's money. This allows the fund to benefit from leverage. The financing of the real estate purchase is realized through borrowing from banks. When the fund has reached a certain level of return, capital calls are issued and the borrowing is paid off.

On the death of his brother, Emir Ahmad II ibn Muhammad, Abd ar-Rahman and his other brother Abd al-Karim quarreled over who would succeed, and Abd ar-Rahman gained the throne first with the help of the Babille Oromo who dwelled to the east of Harar. However, while returning from an unsuccessful campaign to extract tribute from the Ala Oromo in 1825, he was betrayed to these people and Abd al-Karim made himself Emir. Abd al-Rahman appealed for help from his Babille allies, who helped him resist his deposition.

The mercenaries ran out of ammunition, and losing twenty of their number retired to Harar. The Oromo captured Abd al-Karim and Abd Ar-Rahman, seized the throne and with the aid of the inhabitants started to murder the Arab mercenaries. The mercenaries, however, defended themselves and would have restored Abd al-Rahman as Emir, had Abd ar-Rahman not declined their offer; the Arab mercenaries then drew their pay and marched off to Zeila.Richard Burton, First Footsteps in East Africa, 1856; edited with an introduction and additional chapters by Gordon Waterfield (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 189, note R.A.

It is now headed by the Duke of Leuchtenberg, descendant in male line of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. History Arms of Dukes of Leuchtenberg of the House of Beauharnais Originating in Brittany, the Beauharnais (or Beauharnois) became established in the fourteenth century in Orl√©ans. When that city was besieged in 1429, Jehan Beauharnais played a role in its defence and by doing so witnessed to the process of Joan of Arc's rehabilitation. The Beauharnais provided the kingdom with soldiers and magistrates, and contracted alliances in several spheres, including that of the university of law in Orl√©ans. In the 16th century, there were Beauharnais in Orl√©ans as magistrates, merchants, canons and other professions. From the end of the 16th century to the end of the 17th, the offices of president and of lieutenant g√©n√©ral to the bailliage and si√®ge pr√©sidial of Orl√©ans were handed down hereditarily through the Beauharnais family. The most eminent of these magistrates was Francis IV de Beauharnais, sieur of la Grill√®re (at Vouzon, Loir-et-Cher), born in Orl√©ans in 1630, and dying there in 1681. At the end of the 17th century, the office of lieutenant g√©n√©ral du bailliage d'Orl√©ans was ceded to an allied branch, the Curaults. The most eminent of the Beauharnais thus turned to careers in the navy and the colonial administration in the Americas. Another Fran√ßois de Beauharnais (1665‚Äì1746) became intendant of New France (i.e. Canada), where a seigneurie was granted to him in 1707. His nephew, Francis V de Beauharnais, was made chef d'escadre des arm√©es royales, then governor of Martinique. The Beauharnais of Orl√©ans were also great landholders thanks to their many seigneuries in the region. In the 15th century they were seigneurs of la Chauss√©e (or Miramion), fief of the parish of Saint-Jean-de-Braye, in the suburbs of Orl√©ans. They also had interests at Sologne until the early 16th century, and Guillaume de Beauharnais held the estate of Villechauve, at Sennely. Some years later, the Beauharnais acquiring the neighbouring seigneurie of la Grill√®re, at Vouzon, with they held until the beginning of the 18th century (when it passed, by the marriage of a female Beauharnais, to the Choiseul-Gouffier family). On 20 April 1752, Francis V, marquis de Beauharnais (1714‚Äì1800), governor of Martinique, maternal great-grandfather of the future Napoleon III of France, bought the seigneurie of La Fert√©-Avrain, in Sologne. He was raised to a marquis by letters patent dated July 1764 with the title of La Fert√©-Beauharnais, a name the commune still bears (d√©partement of Loir-et-Cher).

Location Royale-les-Eaux is a seaside resort, described in Casino Royale as being \\"just north of Dieppe\\"Ian Fleming, Casino Royale, Ch. 2 and lying \\"near the mouth of the Somme before the flat coastline soars up from the beaches of southern Picardy to the Brittany cliffs which run on to Le Havre\\".Ian Fleming, Casino Royale, Ch. 5 This would seem to place the town in the d√©partement of Somme, which takes its name from the river, but a telegram addressed to Bond in the same novel gives the d√©partement as the more southerly Seine-Inf√©rieureIan Fleming, Casino Royale, Ch. 1 (which was renamed Seine-Maritime on 18 January 1955). References in On Her Majesty's Secret Service suggest yet another d√©partement: when driving northwards along the N1 (now the D901), James Bond passes a Michelin road sign saying \\"Montreuil 5, Royale-les-Eaux 10, Le Touquet-Paris-Plage 15\\". After passing through Montreuil and over the √âtaples-Paris railway just to the north of the town, the turning for Royale-les-Eaux is on the left.Ian Fleming, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Ch. 2 This would put Royale-les-Eaux on the coast just south of Le Touquet, perhaps in the vicinity of Stella-Plage, and in the d√©partement of Pas-de-Calais, to the north of Somme. History The town's history is outlined in Casino Royale. Formerly just a small fishing village named \\"Royale\\", it rapidly became fashionable as a tourist destination during the Second Empire. However the subsequent rise in popularity of Le Touquet meant a loss in custom for Royale. A parallel is drawn between the history of Royale and that of Trouville, a once-popular destination which was eclipsed by Deauville. The fortunes of Royale seemed to be recovering at the turn of the 20th century, when a spring in the hills behind the town was found to contain enough sulphur to make it marketable as mineral water. Royale reinvented itself as a spa town, renamed itself \\"Royale-les-Eaux\\" and began exporting \\"Eau Royale\\", in a torpedo-shaped bottle. This success was short- lived, and following lawsuits from Vichy, Perrier and Vittel sale of Eau Royale became merely local once more. The town thereafter survived on seaside holidaymakers in the summer and its small fishing fleet in the winter, as well as \\"the crumbs which fell to its elegantly dilapidated Casino from the table at Le Touquet\\". Royale's renaissance came after the Second World War. Encouraged by the post-war revival of Brighton and Nice, in 1950 Royale-les- Eaux was identified as a potential source of revenue by a Paris syndicate which invested funds on behalf of exiled Vichyites. The Casino, the public gardens and the two main hotels were refurbished and Paris jewellers and couturiers were given rent-free sites on which to establish branches. For the year in which the events of Casino Royale take place, the Soci√©t√© des Bains de Mer de Royale has succeeded in securing bookings from \\"a considerable number of the biggest operators in America and Europe\\", and leased some of the baccarat tables to a group of Egyptians, the Mahomet Ali Syndicate. This is the context in which Casino Royale opens.

History and overview  The oldest ones known are from about the 5th or 6th century BCE. They consist of sheets of gold 3-5mm thick, of various sizes, with inscriptions consisting of square or round stamps in which there are one or two characters. They have been unearthed in various locations south of the Yellow River indicating that they were products of the State of Chu. One of the characters in their inscription is often a monetary unit or weight which is normally read as yuan (). Pieces are of a very variable size and thickness, and the stamps appear to be a device to validate the whole block, rather than a guide to enable it to be broken up into unit pieces. Some ying yuan contain the Chinese characters ying yuan (ÈÉ¢Áà∞). Another inscription that is sometimes found on these ancient gold coins is chen yuan (Èô≥Áà∞). Some specimens have been reported in copper, lead, or clay. It is probable that these were funeral money, not circulating coinage, as they are found in tombs, but the gold coins are not.

The building is on the corner of Newnham Road and Malting Lane and overlooks the Mill Pond and Sheep's Green. The Malting House School (also known as the Malting House Garden School) was an experimental educational institution that operated from 1924 to 1929. It was set up by the eccentric and, at the time, wealthy Geoffrey Pyke in his family home in Cambridge and it was run by Susan Sutherland Isaacs. Although it was open for only a few years, the radical ideas explored in this institution have remained influential up until the present day. It is now owned by Darwin College, Cambridge where it is used as accommodation.  Creation  Geoffrey Pyke came to public attention when he escaped from internment in Germany during World War I. He had travelled to Germany under a false passport but he was soon arrested and interned. The story of his escape and return to Britain was widely published. In March 1918, Pyke met Margaret Amy Chubb; she was intelligent, pretty, and attracted to Pyke's unconventional good looks and wilful unconventionality. They were married within three months of meeting. After the war, Pyke tried his hand at a number of money-making schemes. For a while, he made a lot of money speculating on the commodity market using his own system of financial management instead of more conventional techniques. Geoffrey and Margaret Pyke had a son, David (1921‚Äì2001). Geoffrey Pyke became preoccupied by the question of his son's education. He wanted to create an education that promoted curiosity and equipped young people to live in the twentieth century ‚Äì an education that would be utterly different from his own unhappy experience. To do this he set up an infants' school in his Cambridge home. Founded in October 1924, the school was funded by Pyke's City speculations. His wife, Margaret, was a strong supporter of the school and its ideas. Pyke placed advertisements in a number of journals, including the New Statesman and Nature: > :WANTED‚Äîan Educated Young Woman with honours degree‚Äîpreferably first > class‚Äîor the equivalent, to conduct education of a small group of children > aged 2-1/2‚Äì7, as a piece of scientific work and research. :Previous > educational experience is not considered a bar, but the advertisers hope to > get in touch with a university graduate‚Äîor someone of equivalent > intellectual standing‚Äîwho has hitherto considered themselves too good for > teaching and who has probably already engaged in another occupation. :A > LIBERAL SALARY‚Äîliberal as compared with research work or teaching‚Äîwill be > paid to a suitable applicant who will live out, have fixed hours and > opportunities for a pleasant independent existence. An assistant will be > provided if the work increases. :They wish to obtain the services of someone > with certain personal qualifications for the work and a scientific attitude > of mind towards it. Hence a training in any of the natural sciences is a > distinct advantage. :Preference will be given to those who do not hold any > form of religious belief but this is not by itself considered to be a > substitute for other qualifications.Drummond quotes Pyke's advertisement Pyke recruited psychologist Susan Sutherland Isaacs to run the school; although Pyke had many original ideas regarding education, he promised her that he would not interfere. Both Pyke and Isaacs had had unconventional and unhappy experiences of growing up. Pyke's father, Edward Lionel Pyke, was a Jewish lawyer who died when he was only five years old, leaving his family with no money. His mother quarrelled with relatives and made life \\"hell\\" for her children. She sent Geoffrey to Wellington, a snobbish private school mainly catering to the children of Army officers; here, she insisted that Pyke maintain the dress and habits of an Orthodox Jew. While there, he was a victim of persecution that instilled him with a hatred of and contempt for The Establishment. After two years at Wellington he was withdrawn, tutored privately and then admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge to study law. Isaacs' mother died when she was six years old. Shortly afterwards she became alienated from her father after he married the nurse who had attended her mother during her illness. At the age of fifteen, Isaacs was removed from school by her father because she had converted to atheistic socialism; her father refused to speak to her for 2 years. She stayed at home with her stepmother until she was 22. Besides Geoffrey Pyke and his wife, the other leading figures in the school were Susan Isaacs and her second husband, Nathan Isaacs; and Evelyn Lawrence who arrived two years into the experiment. In April 1927, the school advertised again: > :WANTED‚ÄîA SCIENTIST of the first order, if necessary of senior standing, but > as young as possible, with a knowledge of the theory of science, to > investigate and conduct the introduction of young children, 4¬Ω‚Äì10, to > science and scientific method.Wanted‚ÄîA Scientist of the first order... > (Advertisement), The Times newspaper, 26 April 1927 p10 column E. This advertisement indicated that Ernest Rutherford, Percy Nunn and J.B.S. Haldane had agreed to assist the directors of the school in the final selection of candidates.  Premises  The Malting House was originally exactly that: a malthouse, Oast house, and small brewery owned, in the 1830s, by the Beales family ‚Äì a well-known Cambridge trading dynasty. In 1909, the then Dean of Trinity College (Dr Stewart) bought the buildings and converted most of them into an Arts & Crafts house and two or three years later the remaining buildings were converted into a small hall to host musical evenings. During the 1920s it was the Malting House School. In later years the house reverted to a family home. The buildings were purchased by Darwin College of Cambridge University to serve as student accommodation, the cost of purchase and conversion being estimated as ¬£1.5M. Maurice and Sylia Dobb lived in a cottage behind the Malting House ‚Äì he had a position at Trinity College ‚Äì Ludwig Wittgenstein was lodging with them at the time, at the invitation of Bertrand Russel.  Operation  In an advertisement for residential pupils, in July 1927, some of the operating principles of the school were explained. > :The method employed at Cambridge with children ranging from 3 to 7 to > forward this result is on the one hand to eliminate the arbitrary authority > of the pedagogue and to substitute for it the attitude of the co- > investigator (\\"Let's find out\\" and not on any verbal information is the > answer given to most questions), and on the other hand to provide an > environment with more than usual scope for activity, intellectual and > social, including apparatus which shall both set problems and provide their > solution. For instance: a lathe, simulative poser of many arithmetical and > geometrical questions ‚Äî apparatus showing the expansion of materials under > heat where nothing visible may happen except with patience ‚Äî a garden with > plants (which may without taboo be dug up every day to see how they are > getting on, leading mainly to the discovery that that is a temptation best > resisted if growth is desired) ‚Äî animals which breed ‚Äî weighing machines > graded from a see-saw with weights, through kitchen scales, to a laboratory > balance ‚Äî typewriters to bridge the gap between writing and reading ‚Äî > double-handed saws which compel co-operation ‚Äî and clay for modelling, where > phantasy pays toll to skill and effort. It seems very likely that the form of education was influenced by the ideas of John Dewey and Maria Montessori. In the 1920s and 1930s, John Dewey became famous for pointing out that the authoritarian, strict, pre-ordained knowledge approach of traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge, and not enough with understanding students' actual experiences. Montessori's ideas gave rise to the Montessori education which the idea of children choosing the means of educating themselves. The Malting House School fostered the individual development of children; children were given great freedom and were supported rather than punished. The teachers were seen as observers of the children who were seen as research workers. > :...Dan (5;1) was looking at a picture of a steamship, and Mrs. I. made some > remark about \\"the windows\\". Dan corrected her, emphatically, \\"They're not > windows, they're portholes\\". Mrs. I. said, \\"Yes, they're portholes, but then > portholes are windows\\". (He had not at that date seen any actual steamships, > only pictures of them.) Dan rejected this \\"egocentrically\\", and with > vehement scorn. But when Mrs. I. suggested that he should ask Christopher, > who, as Dan knew had come over from America on a steamship, he did so, and > meekly accepted Christopher's corroboration of Mrs. I.'s statement. > :The children had a bonfire of rubbish in the garden, and they remarked on > the volume of smoke coming from it, and called themselves \\"brave\\" when they > ran through it. Dan (5;2) [five years and two months] said \\"It makes me > choke when it goes down inside\\". He asked, \\"Is there any soot in the smoke?\\" > Mrs I[saacs] replied \\"Let's hold something in it and see\\". They held a white > plate in the smoke; a thin brown film was deposited, and the children said, > \\"Yes, there is soot in it\\". Mrs I. then took a candle, lit it, and held the > plate in the smoke from it. The children said, on seeing the much heavier > deposit of soot, \\"There's much more soot in that\\". Dan said, \\"You've burnt > the plate\\". Mrs I. washed the plate, and he saw that the soot came off and > that the plate itself was not burnt. The school attracted the attention of a wide range of intellectuals. The children came from parents with an academic or professional background who had, in many cases, already achieved eminence in their fields. They included two sons of G. E. Moore (Cambridge philosopher and ethicist), the daughter of Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian (neurophysiologist, nobel laureate), Philip Sargant Florence (post-graduate student and later Professor of Economics). Yvonne Kapp, who described Pyke as \\"an intimate if entirely unpredictable friend\\" took her children to the school every day.  Closure  The Pykes, the Isaacs and those around them were dedicated to the teachings of Freud. The ethos of the school was that children should, as far as possible, not have harmful inhibitions pressed upon them. This philosophy extended to permitting the children to express a full range of feelings including aggression and curiosity about bodily functions. The adults also tried to live their lives without reference to traditional, outmoded, norms of behaviour. The Pykes took Frank Ramsey into their family, taking him on holiday, asking him to be the godfather of their young son. In 1923, Margaret Pyke found herself to be the object of Ramsey's affection and he made sexual overtures to her. In 1924, Geoffrey became infatuated with Susan and before long they began an affair with Margaret blessing and encouraging the relationship ‚Äì although Nathan was kept in the dark. Margaret eventually turned down Frank's advances. A year or so after it had started, Geoffrey and Susan's affair petered out. As young David reached the age of six, Pyke extended the remit of the school and expanded its ambition. He supported the school lavishly and employed Nathan Isaacs the school's researcher at large on a salary of ¬£500 per year (equivalent to ¬£ in .). At the end of 1927, Susan Isaacs left the school. It is not clear exactly why Susan Isaacs left, one possibility is that Pyke began to interfere with the day-to-day running of the school but the developing emotional and sexual tangle of relationships between Susan Isaacs, Nathan Isaacs and Evelyn Lawrence may also have been a factor. Evelyn would become Nathan's second wife after Susan's death in 1948. In 1927, Pyke lost all his money. The Maltings School was forced to close, Margaret Pyke had to take a job as headmistress's secretary; she left Geoffrey although they were never divorced. Already suffering from periodic fits of depression and burdened with huge debts to his brokers, he now withdrew from normal life altogether and existed on donations from his close friends.  Influence  For a short time The Maltings was a critical if not a commercial success; it was visited by many educationalists and it was the subject of a film documentary. Visitors to the school included Jean Piaget and Melanie Klein.

The change was officially launched by the Council of Ministers on 20 June 2007, shortly after the election of Sarkozy as President. Minister of the Interior Mich√®le Alliot- Marie,. however, was reputedly reluctant regarding this fusion and ordered the General Director of the Police Nationale, Fr√©d√©ric P√©chenard, to undertake a study of the proposal. NouvelObs, 23 ao√ªt 2007. The creation of DCRI was announced on 13 September 2007 by Alliot-Marie. The founding texts of the DCRI were adopted 7 April 2008, to become effective 1 July 2008. A fraction of the former functionaries of the Renseignement g√©n√©ral (General Intelligence, RG) were brought in from the Sub-Direction of General Information (SDIG) from the Central Direction of Public Security, represented in the departments of metropolitan France and in its overseas territories by the departmental services of General Information, in the care of the departmental directorates of Public Security.. Bernard Squarcini, director of DST, was named head of the DCRI in 2008.. He was assisted from the outset by two central adjunct directors, Ren√© Bailly, former functionary of the RG, and Patrick Calvar, former functionary of the DST.

One of the first media appearances of the new DCRI was the arrest of Julien Coupat in the context of the \\"Tarnac Affair\\". In December 2008, the leadership of the DCRI made priority of surveilling an impending plot orchestrated by an Islamist in the region of Paris. By a decree of May 31, 2012, Patrick Calvar, former adjunct operational director of the DCRI and director of intelligence at the DGSE since 2009, was named central director of interior intelligence, replacing Squarcini... = Direction g√©n√©rale de la S√©curit√© int√©rieure (DGSI) = Along with the change in majority politics in spring 2012, the executive and legislative powers sought to re-assess the role of the DCRI. In May 2013, a parliamentary report on the intelligence services was presented by the deputy PS Jean-Jacques Urvoas and his colleague UMP Patrice Verch√®re.. The report was critical of the DCRI's functioning and particularly the treatment of the tueries de mars 2012 √† Toulouse et Montauban. On June 17, 2012, the Minister of the Interior Manuel Valls announced a reform pertinent to French domestic intelligence. This reform was officialised by the decree no. 2014-445 from April 30, 2014, which started vigorously on May 12, 2014. The DCRI became the Direction g√©n√©rale de la S√©curit√© int√©rieure (DGSI), is no longer situated under the authority of the General Director of the Police Nationale but under that of the Minister of the Interior, with more authority.

The current effects of global warming in the United States are widespread and varied. In 2012, the United States experienced its warmest year on record. , the thirteen warmest years for the entire planet have all occurred since 1998, transcending those from 1880.There‚Äôs Still Hope for the Planet July 21, 2012 The New York Times by David LeonhardtBy The Numbers: The U.S.'s Warmest Year Yet January 31, 2013 Popular Science Different regions experience widely different climatic changes. Changes in climate in the regions of the United States appear significant. For example, drought conditions appear to be worsening in the southwest while improving in the northeast. Some research has warned against possible problems due to American climate changes such as the spread of invasive species and possibilities of floods as well as droughts. Climate change is seen as a national security threat to the United States. The United States is among the most significant emitters of greenhouse gasses in the world. In terms of both total and per capita emissions, it is among the largest contributors. As of April 2019, 69% of Americans think that climate change is happening and 55% think that it is mostly human caused. In 2015, according to The New York Times and others, oil companies knew that burning oil and gas could cause global warming since the 1970s but, nonetheless, funded deniers for years. 2016 was a historic year for billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in U.S. Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States The United States emitted 5.4 billion metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas in 2018, the second largest in the world after greenhouse gas emissions by China. This is over 15 tonnes per person and, amongst the top ten emitters, is the second highest country by greenhouse gas emissions per person after Canada. Because coal-fired power stations are gradually shutting down, in the 2010s emissions from electricity generation fell to second place behind transportation. Current and potential effects of climate change in the United States The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website provides information on climate change: EPA Climate Change. Climate change is a problem that is affecting people and the environment. Human-induced climate change has, e.g., the potential to alter the prevalence and severity of extreme weathers such as heat waves, cold waves, storms, floods and droughts.EPA Climate Change and about Extreme weather A report released in March 2012 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that a strong body of evidence links global warming to an increase in heat waves, a rise in episodes of heavy rainfall and other precipitation, and more frequent coastal flooding. The U.S. had its warmest March‚ÄìMay on record in 2012.USA had warmest March-May on record, June 6, 2012 (See March 2012 North American heat wave) According to the American government's Climate Change Science Program, \\"With continued global warming, heat waves and heavy downpours are very likely to further increase in frequency and intensity. Substantial areas of North America are likely to have more frequent droughts of greater severity. Hurricane wind speeds, rainfall intensity, and storm surge levels are likely to increase. The strongest cold season storms are likely to become more frequent, with stronger winds and more extreme wave heights.\\"Weather and Climate Extremes in a Changing Climate US Climate Change Science Programme June 2008 Summary = National temperature, sea level, and precipitation = This graph shows average drought conditions in the contiguous 48 states, according to the EPA, with yearly data going from 1895 to 2011. The curve is a nine-year weighted average. The general effect of climate changes has been found in the journal Nature Climate Change to have caused increased likelihood of heat waves and extensive downpours. Concerns exist that, as stated by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study in 2003, increasing \\"heat and humidity, at least partially related to anthropogenic climate change, suggest that a long-term increase in heat-related mortality could occur.\\" However, the report found that, in general, \\"over the past 35 years, the U.S. populace has become systematically less affected by hot and humid weather conditions\\" while \\"mortality during heat stress events has declined despite increasingly stressful weather conditions in many urban and suburban areas.\\" Thus, as stated in the study, \\"there is no simple association between increased heat wave duration or intensity and higher mortality rates\\" with current death rates being largely preventable, the NIH deeply urging American public health officials and physicians to inform patients about mitigating heat-related weather and climate effects on their bodies.Davis et al, Changing Heat-Related Mortality in the United States, National Institutes of Health In terms of U.S. droughts, a study published in Geophysical Research Letters in 2006 about the U.S. reported, \\"Droughts have, for the most part, become shorter, less frequent, and cover a smaller portion of the country over the last century.\\" It also stated that the \\"main exception is the Southwest and parts of the interior of the West\\" where \\"drought duration and severity... have increased.\\" Sea level rise has taken place in the U.S. for decades, going back to the 19th century. As stated in research published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, west coast sea levels have increased by an average of 2.1 millimeters annually. In English notation, that equates to 0.083 inches per year and 0.83 inches per decade. As shown in the adjacent image, wet and rainy conditions versus moments of drought in the U.S. have varied significantly over the past several decades. Average conditions for the 48 contiguous states flashed into extreme drought in the mid-1930s 'dust bowl' era as well as during the turn of the 20th century. In comparison, the mid-2000s decade and mid-1890s experienced only slight drought and had mitigating rainy periods. The National Drought Mitigation Center has reported that financial assistance from the government alone in the 1930s dry period may have been as high as $1 billion (in 1930s dollars) by the end of the drought. Climate scientists have hypothesized that the stratospheric polar vortex jet stream will gradually weaken as a result of global warming and thus influence U.S. conditions.Baek-Min Kim, et al., Weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex by Arctic sea-ice loss, Nature Communications 5, Article number: 4646 A Wacky Jet Stream Is Making Our Weather Severe; Extreme summers and winters of the past four years could become the norm Jeff Masters Scientific American December 2014 issue Volume 311, Issue 6Persistent Warming Drives Big Arctic Changes; The latest Arctic Report Card details the changes due to long- term climate change December 17, 2014 Scientific American This trend could possibly cause changes in the future such as increasing frost in certain areas. The magazine Scientific American noted in December 2014 that ice cover on the Great Lakes had recently \\"reached its second-greatest extent on record\\", showing climate variability. In July 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that the 12-month period July 2011 to June 2012 was the warmest 12-month period on record in the continental United States, with average temperature 3.23 ¬∞F above the average for the 20th century. Earlier it was reported that exceptionally warm months between January and May 2012 had made the 12 month previous to June 2012 the warmest 12-month block since record keeping began,High U.S. Temperatures Shatter Records This Year by Tennile Tracy, The Wall Street Journal, June 7, 2012 but this record was exceeded by the July 2011 to June 2012 period. NOAA stated that the odds of the July 2011 to June 2012 high temperatures occurring randomly was 1 in 1,594,323. Other effects of both general climatic change and man-made climate change combine with the temperature precipitation effects of climate change to exacerbate conditions.

Global analyses show that the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has in fact increased due to human-caused warming. This extra moisture is available to storm systems, resulting in heavier rainfalls. The number and severity of high-cost extreme weather events has increased in the 21st century in the United States. By August 2011 alone, the NOAA had registered nine distinct extreme weather disasters for that year, each totalling $1 billion or more in economic losses. Total losses for 2011 were evaluated as more than $35 billion before Hurricane Irene. Though the costs and frequency of cyclones have increased on the east coast, it remains unclear whether these effects have been driven primarily by climate change. When correcting for this, a comprehensive 2006 article in Geophysical Research Letters found \\"no significant change in global net tropical cyclone activity\\" during past decades, a period when considerable warming of ocean water temperatures occurred. However, the study found major regional shifts, including a general rise of activity in the North Atlantic area, including on the U.S. eastern coast. From 1898 through 1913, there have been 27 cold waves which totalled 58 days. Between 1970 and 1989, there were about 12 such events. From 1989 until January 6, 2014, there were none. The one on the latter date caused consternation because of decreased frequency of such experiences. Looking at the lack of certainty as to the causes of the 1995 to present increase in Atlantic extreme storm activity, a 2007 article in Nature used proxy records of vertical wind shear and sea surface temperature to create a long-term model. The authors found that \\"the average frequency of major hurricanes decreased gradually from the 1760s until the early 1990s, reaching anomalously low values during the 1970s and 1980s.\\" As well, they also found that \\"hurricane activity since 1995 is not unusual compared to other periods of high hurricane activity in the record and thus appears to represent a recovery to normal hurricane activity, rather than a direct response to increasing sea surface temperature.\\" The researches stated that future evaluations of climate change effects should focus on the magnitude of vertical wind shear for answers. The frequency of tornadoes in the U.S. have increased, and some of this trend takes place due to climatological changes though other factors such as better detection technologies also play large roles. According to a 2003 study in Climate Research, the total tornado hazards resulting in injury, death, or economic loss \\"shows a steady decline since the 1980s\\". As well, the authors reported that tornado \\"deaths and injuries decreased over the past fifty years\\". They state that addition research must look into regional and temporal variability in the future. = Human effects: health, economy and agriculture = The 2018 the Fourth National Climate Assessment notes that regional economies dominated by agriculture or tourism may have additional vulnerabilities from climate change. Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prize-winning economist, notes that climate- related disasters in 2017 cost the equivalent of 1.5% of GDP. Crop and livestock production will be increasingly challenged. Threats to human health will increase. A 2012 report in Nature Climate Change stated that there is reason to be concerned that American climate changes could increase food insecurity by reducing grain yields, with the authors noting as well that substantial other facts exist influencing food prices as such as government mandates turning food into fuel and fluctuating transport costs. The researchers concluded that U.S. corn price volatility would moderately increase with American warming with relatively modest rises in food prices assuming that market competition and integration partly mitigated climate affects. They warned that biofuels mandates would, if present, widely increase corn price sensitivity to U.S. warming.  Environmental Racism  There is a growing Climate Gap and prevalence of Environmental racism in the U.S. Climate change will change the United States' current systems/opportunities for low paying jobs typically held by BIPOC and low SES people, such as agriculture and tourism. Job opportunities in these fields are expected to decrease and become more taxing on workers due to harsher conditions. Based on a study done on Environmental inequities in California, people of color and people of low socioeconomic status populate the cities with the worst air quality in the state, putting these groups at increased risk for being exposed to harmful air pollutants. Additionally, many low SES individuals may not have adequate access to healthcare to rectify their disproportionate exposure, causing long-term health issues. Racialized families spend higher percentages of their income on basic necessities, and will be disproportionately challenged by rising food prices and other basic necessities, further widening the wealth gap between social classes in the US. One of the most prevalent contributors to health inequity in the food system is climate change. (See also: Food Sovereignty). Higher food prices will continue to contribute to low SES individuals experiencing an increase in food insecurity, and diets that contribute to malnutrition and obesity. The food system will also see an increase in the spread of diseases such as cholera and filariasis. Based on a study done on California's population, low SES neighborhoods and neighborhoods occupied by people of color experience heatwaves more frequently, and they effects there are most harsh due to being situated in the middle of cities, a phenomenon called the Heat Island Effect. Additionally, racialized individuals are less likely to have access to air conditioning and transportation to relief stations, doubling the African American mortality rate caused by heat waves in Los Angeles. Policy Federal, state, and local governments have all debated climate change policies, but the resulting laws vary considerably. The U.S. Congress has not adopted a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions reduction scheme, but long-standing environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act have been used by the executive branch and litigants in lawsuits to implement regulations and voluntary agreements. The federal government has the exclusive power to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, but has granted the state of California a waiver to adopt more stringent regulations. Other states may choose to adopt either the federal or California rules. Individual states retain the power to regulate emissions from electrical generation and industrial sources, and some have done so. Building codes are controlled by state and local governments, and in some cases have been altered to require increased energy efficiency. Governments at all levels have the option of reducing emissions from their own operations such as through improvements to buildings, purchasing alternative fuel vehicles, and reducing waste; and some have done so. Political opponents to emissions regulations argue that such measures reduce economic activity in the fossil fuel industry (which is a substantial extractive industry in the United States), and impose unwanted costs on drivers, electricity users, and building owners. Some also argue that stringent environmental regulations infringe on individual liberty, and that the environmental impact of economic activity should be driven by the informed choices of consumers. Regulatory proponents argue that the economy is not a zero-sum game, and that individual choices have proven insufficient to prevent damaging and costly levels of global warming. Some states have financed programs to boost employment in green energy industries, such as production of wind turbines. Areas heavily dependent on coal production have not taken such steps and are suffering economic recession due to both competition from now lower-priced natural gas and environmental rules that make generation of electricity from coal disadvantageous due to high emissions of CO2 and other pollutants compared to other fuels. =History of federal policy and international agreements= The United States, although a signatory to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, under President Clinton, neither ratified nor withdrew from the protocol. In 1997, the U.S. Senate voted unanimously under the Byrd‚ÄìHagel Resolution that it was not the sense of the senate that the United States should be a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, and in March 2001, the Bush Administration announced that it would not implement the treaty, saying it would create economic setbacks in the U.S. and does not put enough pressure to limit emissions from developing nations.Alex Kirby, US blow to Kyoto hopes, 2001-03-28, BBC News (online). In February 2002, Bush announced his alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, by bringing forth a plan to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gasses by 18 percent over 10 years. The intensity of greenhouse gasses specifically is the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions and economic output, meaning that under this plan, emissions would still continue to grow, but at a slower pace. Bush stated that this plan would prevent the release of 500 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, which is about the equivalent of 70 million cars from the road. This target would achieve this goal by providing tax credits to businesses that use renewable energy sources.Bush unveils voluntary plan to reduce global warming , CNN.com, 2002-02-14. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency that EPA regulation of carbon dioxide is required under the Clean Air Act. President Barack Obama proposed a cap-and- trade program as part of the 2010 United States federal budget, but this was never adopted by Congress. President Obama committed in the December 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, 42% below 2005 levels by 2030, and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050.NRDC: From Copenhagen Accord to Climate Action: Tracking National Commitments to Curb Global Warming Data from an April 2013 report by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), showed a 12% reduction in the 2005 to 2012 period. Just over half of this decrease has been attributed to the recession, and the rest to a variety of factors such as replacing coal-based power generation with natural gas and increasing energy efficiency of American vehicles (according to a Council of Economic Advisors analysis). Executive Order 13514 set various requirements for energy efficiency in federal buildings and operations, including goals for 2015. That year, Executive Order 13693 set requirements for federal operations generally. In an address to the U.S. Congress in June 2013, the President detailed a specific action plan to achieve the 17% carbon emissions cut from 2005 by 2020, including measures such as shifting from coal-based power generation to solar and natural gas production.Barack Obama pledges to bypass Congress to tackle climate change 25 June 2013 Some Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed concern at the idea of imposing new fines and regulations on the coal industry while the U.S. still tries to recover from the world economic recession, with Speaker of the House John Boehner saying that the proposed rules \\"will put thousands and thousands of Americans out of work\\".Obama‚Äôs ‚Äòwar on coal‚Äô carries risks in battleground states - FT.com Christiana Figueres, executive director of the UN's climate secretariat, praised the plan as providing a vital benchmark that people concerned with climate change can use as a paragon both at home and abroad.Obama's climate speech: 'It is time for Congress to share his ambition' Was it enough? Experts give their verdict on the US president's long-awaited speech addressing climate change 25 The Guardian June 2013 After not participating in previous climate international treaties, the United States signed the Paris Agreement on April 22, 2016 during the Obama administration. Though this agreement does not mandate a specific reduction for any given country, it sets global goals, asks countries to set their own goals, and mandates reporting. The U.S. submitted its action plan in March, 2015, ahead of the treaty signing. Reaffirming the November 2014 announcement it made with China, the United States declared it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. This is to be accomplished by several executive actions: * Clean Power Plan - regulating sources of electricity (put on hold by the Supreme Court in February, 2016, pending the outcome of a lawsuit) * New emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles, finalized by EPA in March, 2016 * Department of Energy efficiency standards for commercial buildings, appliances, and equipment * Various actions to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, including regulation and voluntary efforts related to methane from landfills, agriculture, coal mines; and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) reduction through domestic regulation and amendment of the Montreal Protocol In June 2017, President Donald Trump announced United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, although the exit process specified by the treaty (which Trump said the U.S. would follow) will last until at least November 4, 2020. Trump states that dropping out the agreement will create more job opportunities in the United States, but it may actually have the opposite effect by stifling the renewable energy industries. At the same time, Trump administration shut down the United States Environmental Protection Agency's climate change web pages and removed mentions of the topic elsewhere on the site. In April 2018, the Trump administration cancelled NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) program, which helped with the monitoring of CO2 emissions and deforestation in the United States and in other countries. The Trump administration has also moved to increase fossil fuel consumption and roll back environmental policies that are considered to be burdensome to businesses. For offsetting the dismantlement of the Clean Power Plan approximately 10 billion trees would need to be planted. Activists try to plant this number of trees. In January 2020 Trump announced that the USA would join the Trillion Tree Campaign. Climate activists critiqued the plan for ignoring the root causes of climate change. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva critiqued the plan as ‚Äúa feel-good participatory gesture‚Äù without a broader portfolia of environmental actions surrounding it. In June 2020, Democrats proposed a plan for climate action in USA aiming to not sell greenhouse gas emitting cars by 2035, reach zero emissions from the energy sector by 2040 and reduce to zero all the greenhouse gas emission of the country by 2050. The plan includes some actions to improve environmental justice. In 2016, 38% of adults in United States thought that stopping climate change are a top priority, in 2020 52% think like that. Many Republicans share this opinion. =Role of the US military= The US military is an unequivocal validator of climate science, and its current efforts to value true costs and benefits of energy conservation and increased use of renewables can serve as drivers of change, according to a 2014 study from the University of Pennsylvania Legal Studies Department. A 2014 report described the projected climate change as a ‚Äúcatalyst for conflict‚Äù. The DOD had issued a Fiscal Year 2012 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap, in which it outlined its vulnerabilities, yet the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found, that installation officials rarely proposed projects with climate change adaptation, because the processes for approving and funding military construction do not include climate change adaptation in the ranking criteria for projects. =State and regional policy= Across the country, regional organizations, states, and cities are achieving real emissions reductions and gaining valuable policy experience as they take action on climate change. According to the report of America's Pledge, 65% of the American population, 51% of the GHG emissions and 68% of the GDP, are now part of different coalitions that support climate action and want to fulfill the commitments of USA in the Paris Agreement. The coalitions include We Are Still In, US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors and more. These actions include increasing renewable energy generation, selling agricultural carbon sequestration credits, and encouraging efficient energy use. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program is a joint program of over twenty U.S. cabinet departments and federal agencies, all working together to investigate climate change. In June 2008, a report issued by the program stated that weather would become more extreme, due to climate change. States and municipalities often function as \\"policy laboratories\\", developing initiatives that serve as models for federal action. This has been especially true with environmental regulation‚Äîmost federal environmental laws have been based on state models. In addition, state actions can significantly affect emissions, because many individual states emit high levels of greenhouse gases. Texas, for example, emits more than France, while California's emissions exceed those of Brazil. State actions are also important because states have primary jurisdiction over many areas‚Äîsuch as electric generation, agriculture, and land use‚Äîthat are critical to addressing climate change. Many states are participating in Regional climate change initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States, the Western Governors' Association (WGA) Clean and Diversified Energy Initiative, and the Southwest Climate Change Initiative. Inside the ten northeastern states implementing the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, carbon dioxide emissions per capita decreased by about 25% from 2000 and 2010, as the state economies continued to grow while enacting various energy efficiency programs.Report Urges NJ to Rejoin Regional Greenhouse-Gas Initiative - NJ Spotlight  Cost and consequences  In 2013 there were 11 weather and climate disaster events with losses over $1 billion each in the United States. In total these 11 events losses were over $110 billion. 2013 was the warmest year ever in the contiguous United States and about one-third of all Americans experienced 10 days or more of 100-degree heat. These increasingly common and severe weather events have put pressure on existing disaster-relief efforts. For instance, the increasing rate of wildfires, the increasing length of the fire season, and increasing severity have put pressure on national and international resources. In the US, federal firefighting efforts surpassed $2 billion a year for the first time in 2017, and this expense was repeated in 2018. At the same time, internationally shared capital, such as firefighting planes, has experienced increasing demand, requiring new investment. = Impact on agriculture = Increasing floods (such as the 2019 Midwestern U.S. floods), heat waves, and droughts have brought economic problems to farmers business and increased product prices.Obama to unveil historic climate change plan to cut US carbon pollution USDA research indicates that \\"climate change is likely to drive down yields for some crops, harm milk production, and lead to a drop in nutrient density for key crops like rice and wheat.\\" Public response = Public opinion about climate change= In April 2019, 69% of Americans thought that climate change is happening and 55% think that it is mostly human caused. In September 2019 approximately 75% thought that climate change is real and man made. In November 2016, 69% of registered voters said that USA should remain in Paris Agreement. 13% said that it should leave the agreement =Education= At least three US high schools have objected to mention of climate change in 2019 graduation speeches by students. =Political ideologies= Historical support for environmental protection has been relatively non-partisan. Republican Theodore Roosevelt established national parks whereas Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Soil Conservation Service. This non-partisanship began to change during the 1980s when the Reagan administration stated that environmental protection was an economic burden. Views over global warming began to seriously diverge among Democrats and Republicans when ratifying the Kyoto Protocol was being debated in 1998. Gaps in opinions among the general public are often amplified among the political elites, such as members of Congress, who tend to be more polarized. A 2017 study by the Center for American Progress Action Fund of climate change denial in the United States Congress found 180 members who deny the science behind climate change; all were Republicans. Beyond politicians, there is a variety of views by each political party.A Republican Meteorologist Tries to Remove Liberal Label from Climate Concern, March 30, 2012 In March 2014, Gallup found that among Democrats, 45% say they worry a great deal about the quality of the environment while the number drops to 16% for Republicans. Political disagreement is also strongly rooted in our potential solutions to addressing climate change. Strategies such as a Cap and Trade system are still a heated argument. On January 20, 2017, within moments of Donald Trump's inauguration, all references to climate change were removed from the White House website. The U.S. has been considered the most authoritative researcher of this information, and there is concern amongst the scientific community as to how the Trump administration will prioritize the issue. In early indications to news media of the first federal budget process under Donald Trump's administration, there are signs that most efforts under the Obama administration to curb U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would effectively be rolled back. In July 2018 the Trump Administration released its Draft Environmental Impact Statement from the NHTSA. In it was the prediction that on our current course the planet will warm a disastrous seven degrees Fahrenheit (or about 3.9 degrees Celsius) by the end of this century. Many pages were created to examine and compare the views of the candidates in the presidential election 2020 on climate change. The League of Conservation Voters create a special site, entirely dedicated to the issue called: \\"Change the Climate 2020\\". Similar pages were created in the site of NRDC, Ballotpedia, Boston CBS, the Skimm =Business community= In 2015, according to The New York Times and others, oil companies knew that burning oil and gas could cause global warming since the 1970s but, nonetheless, funded deniers for years. A review, published in 2016, of academic literature that explores the potential for greenhouse emissions related liability, calculated that climate change related liability could reach trillions of dollars based on lost revenue from nations that would forced to evacuate because of sea level rise.

In Signal Processing Letters, Volume 14, Issue 3, March 2007 157‚Äì160 it is useful to estimate the differential entropy of a system or process, given some observations. The simplest and most common approach uses histogram-based estimation, but other approaches have been developed and used, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.J. Beirlant, E. J. Dudewicz, L. Gyorfi, and E. C. van der Meulen (1997) Nonparametric entropy estimation: An overview. In International Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Volume 6, pp. 17‚Äì 39. The main factor in choosing a method is often a trade-off between the bias and the variance of the estimateT. Sch√ºrmann, Bias analysis in entropy estimation. In J. Phys. A: Math. Gen, 37 (2004), pp. L295‚ÄìL301. although the nature of the (suspected) distribution of the data may also be a factor. Histogram estimator The simple way of evaluation of a probability distribution f(x) of biological variable with the entropy normalized by its maximum value (H_\\\\text{max}=\\\\log n), : H(X) = - \\\\frac {\\\\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)\\\\log f(x_i)} {H_\\\\text{max}} demonstrates advantages over standard physiological indices in the estimation of functional status of cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. Another approach uses the idea that the differential entropy, :H(X) = -\\\\int_\\\\mathbb{X} f(x)\\\\log f(x)\\\\,dx can be approximated by producing a histogram of the observations, and then finding the discrete entropy : H(X) = - \\\\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{f(x_i)}{w(x_i)} \\\\right) of that histogram (which is itself a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of the discretized frequency distribution ), where w is the width of the ith bin. Histograms can be quick to calculate, and simple, so this approach has some attractions. However, the estimate produced is biased, and although corrections can be made to the estimate, they may not always be satisfactory.G. Miller (1955) Note on the bias of information estimates. In Information Theory in Psychology: Problems and Methods, pp. 95‚Äì100. A method better suited for multidimensional probability density functions (pdf) is to first make a pdf estimate with some method, and then, from the pdf estimate, compute the entropy. A useful pdf estimate method is e.g. Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM), where the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to find an ML estimate of a weighted sum of Gaussian pdf's approximating the data pdf. Estimates based on sample- spacings If the data is one-dimensional, we can imagine taking all the observations and putting them in order of their value. The spacing between one value and the next then gives us a rough idea of (the reciprocal of) the probability density in that region: the closer together the values are, the higher the probability density. This is a very rough estimate with high variance, but can be improved, for example by thinking about the space between a given value and the one m away from it, where m is some fixed number. The probability density estimated in this way can then be used to calculate the entropy estimate, in a similar way to that given above for the histogram, but with some slight tweaks. One of the main drawbacks with this approach is going beyond one dimension: the idea of lining the data points up in order falls apart in more than one dimension. However, using analogous methods, some multidimensional entropy estimators have been developed.E. G. Learned-Miller (2003) A new class of entropy estimators for multi-dimensional densities, in Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP‚Äô03), vol. 3, April 2003, pp. 297‚Äì300.I. Lee (2010) Sample- spacings based density and entropy estimators for spherically invariant multidimensional data, In Neural Computation, vol. 22, issue 8, April 2010, pp. 2208‚Äì2227. Estimates based on nearest-neighbours For each point in our dataset, we can find the distance to its nearest neighbour. We can in fact estimate the entropy from the distribution of the nearest-neighbour-distance of our datapoints. (In a uniform distribution these distances all tend to be fairly similar, whereas in a strongly nonuniform distribution they may vary a lot more.)  Bayesian estimator  When in under-sampled regime, having a prior on the distribution can help the estimation. One such Bayesian estimator was proposed in the neuroscience context known as the NSB (Nemenman‚ÄìShafee‚ÄìBialek) estimator.Ilya Nemenman, Fariel Shafee, William Bialek (2003) Entropy and Inference, Revisited. Advances in Neural Information ProcessingIlya Nemenman, William Bialek, de Ruyter (2004) Entropy and information in neural spike trains: Progress on the sampling problem. Physical Review E The NSB estimator uses a mixture of Dirichlet prior, chosen such that the induced prior over the entropy is approximately uniform.  Estimates based on expected entropy  A new approach to the problem of entropy evaluation is to compare the expected entropy of a sample of random sequence with the calculated entropy of the sample. The method gives very accurate results, but it is limited to calculations of random sequences modeled as Markov chains of the first order with small values of bias and correlations. This is the first known method that takes into account the size of the sample sequence and its impact on the accuracy of the calculation of entropy.Marek Lesniewicz (2014) Expected Entropy as a Measure and Criterion of Randomness of Binary Sequences In Przeglad Elektrotechniczny, Volume 90, 1/2014, pp. 42‚Äì 46.Marek Lesniewicz (2016) Analyses and Measurements of Hardware Generated Random Binary Sequences Modeled as Markov Chains In Przeglad Elektrotechniczny, Volume 92, 11/2016, pp. 268-274.

Biography  Brunner grew up in a rural area which is often named as a source of his inspiration. Besides the environment and the Lower Bavarian landscape, the population is also a direct influence to his work.Passauer Neue Presse: Rund um die Welt und doch tief verwurzelt, 04.12.2013 This is true for the artist in general and for his alias Recondite in particular. In this surrounding Brunner created his first tracks in a small home studio. Following this early musical creative period, the young producer moved to Berlin in 2009. Brunner founded Plangent Records in 2011 and published tracks under the name Recondite. Already the first four-track EP (PLAN 001) received very positive national and international feedback. In the same year Recondite got his first gig at Panorama Bar/Berghain in Berlin. Further releases on his own label, as well as on Scubas Label hotflush, followed expanded concert inquiries at home and abroad. Increased attention was given to Recondite by the album On Acid, which was released in 2012 via the US label Absurd Recordings. Those tracks, influenced by the typical acid sounds, extended the musical diversity Brunners to another facet. The music press referred particularly to the fact that Brunner gave his own imprint to the previously known acid and created a \\"incredibly listenable\\" record. The appreciative echo that gave the music journals and the online portals, along with the ongoing success of his live shows, led Recondite to his first US gig at New York in 2012. With his second long-player Hinterland, released in 2013 on the US label Ghostly International, Recondite became a worldwide-booked live act. Since then he has constantly been seen on stages in Europe, America, Asia, and Australia. Among other shows, he performed live between Sven V√§th and Richie Hawtin on the Time Warp Festival 2014. In the very same year he became a Resident-DJ of Richie Hawtin's ENTER.Ibiza 2014. Recondite does major events such as Melt!, Amsterdam Dance Event and Time Warp just as club shows in smaller and mid- sized venues with correspondingly more intimate atmosphere. Recondite released his third album Iffy in November 2014, his fourth album Placid in November 2015, and his fifth album Daemmerlicht in February 2018.  Musical style  Recondite's diversity of appearances is reflected by releases on various labels such as Dystopian and Innervisions. These are driven by different variations of electronic music, but at the same time characterized by Brunner's own sound. Recondite performs live and is known for his sets adapted to the prevailing mood of the audience as well as to the divergent local conditions. This earned him a nomination for the DJ Awards 2014 in the category \\"Electronic Live Performance\\". His musical style is attributed as ambient, deep house and techno/acid techno. In fact, Brunner's musical output blurs the boundaries between these categories. The released Albums and EPs include melancholy and gloomy tracks, with a typically low bpm, and also veritable techno tracks created for the dancefloor. According to this, the music press has difficulties in categorizing his style into a subgenre. The press has called Recondite's musical style e.g. \\"moll techno\\", \\"John Carpenter-House\\" (Groove), \\"meditative techno\\" (Resident Advisor), \\"Bayreuth in 4/4\\" and \\"G√∂tterd√§mmerung in 808\\" (De:Bug). Recondite uses field recording and synthesizers. He works with the native operator synthesizer from Ableton, which combines analog sounds and frequency modulation synthesis. Except in the acid test productions, no further synthesizer are used by Brunner.

Goyer under his pseudonym Cynthia Verlaine,The Dialogue: An Interview With David Goyer and is also Mark Wahlberg's first acting role and credited as \\"Marky Mark\\", due to his successful hip hop career. Plot High school English teacher Gayle Richardson finds out that her husband is cheating on her with one of her students. She murders both him and his mistress in an outburst of rage, sets their house on fire, and flees into the night. One year later, Gayle has moved to another town and takes a job as a substitute English teacher at another high school under the assumed name Laura Ellington. One of the students, named Josh Wyatt, becomes infatuated with \\"Laura\\" and on her first day, he gives her a ride back to her motel room where she seduces him, but discards him the following day. As the scorned Josh seeks to find a way to get revenge against Laura for using him, she meets and begins having an affair of her own with Josh's widowed father, Ben, who is also infatuated with the mysterious and attractive teacher. While Josh seeks to keep his brief tryst with Laura a secret, he also recruits his unsuspecting girlfriend, Jenny, to help him find any evidence against Laura when she moves into the house across the street from him and his father. Things become more complicated when news about her past starts to re-emerge, forcing Laura to embark on yet another killing spree to protect her identity and her crimes. When Laura learns that the teacher she is substituting for will be returning early, she breaks into her house and shoves her down a staircase, causing the teacher to die from a heart attack. But Laura is witnessed entering the house by one trouble-making student, named Ryan Westerberg, who attempts to blackmail her. However, Laura kills Ryan and covers it up to make it look like a gang killing. Convinced that Laura is responsible for the two mysterious deaths, Josh begins to uncover Laura's past by sneaking into her house one evening during a school dance and finds evidence of her former alias as Gayle Richardson. But Josh cannot convince anyone, not even his skeptic father, that Laura is not who she claims to be. When Josh inadvertently reveals his tryst with Laura to Jenny, she breaks up with him. When Jenny tells Ben about Josh's cheating on her and of his personal investigation into Laura, she walks in on them. Later, Laura follows Jenny into the school and attempts to murder her too by chasing her under the bleachers in the school gym and pushes the automatic button to make the bleachers fold up, nearly crushing Jenny to death. Jenny survives long enough to be brought to the hospital where she tells Josh what Laura did. After looking up old newspaper records at a library, Josh finally learns of Laura's past and real identity. When Ben Wyatt confronts Laura that same evening in her classroom as she is attempting to pack up to flee town, she attacks and stabs him with a glass shard just as Josh walks in. He chases and confronts Laura on the roof of the school as the police arrive. Momentarily blinded by a police searchlight that's beamed onto her, Laura loses her balance and falls off of part of the roof to land some distance below on another part of the building. Leaving her for dead, Josh leaves the school building and is relieved to learn that his father is alive and will recover from his stab wound. But when the police venture to the roof, they find that Laura is gone. In the final scene, Laura/Gayle is now at another high school in another state, and another a new alias, applying for a job as an English teacher at the school.

Her parents were Emperor Dom Pedro I, the first ruler of Brazil, and Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg. The only child of her father's second marriage, Maria Am√©lia was born in France after Pedro I abdicated the Brazilian throne in favor of his son Dom Pedro II. Before Maria Am√©lia was a month old, Pedro I went to Portugal to restore the crown of the eldest daughter of his first marriage, Dona Maria II. He fought a successful war against his brother Miguel I, who had usurped Maria II's throne. Only a few months after his victory, Pedro I died from tuberculosis. Maria Am√©lia's mother took her to Portugal, where she remained for most of her life without ever visiting Brazil. The Brazilian government refused to recognize Maria Am√©lia as a member of Brazil's Imperial House because she was foreign-born, but when her elder half-brother Pedro II was declared of age in 1840, he successfully intervened on her behalf. Maria Am√©lia became engaged to Archduke Maximilian of Austria in early 1852, but before the marriage could take place she contracted tuberculosis, and was taken to the town of Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira. Despite its reputedly healthy climate, her health continued to deteriorate, and she died on 4 February 1853. Her body was taken to mainland Portugal and interred in the Pantheon of the House of Braganza; almost 130 years later, her remains were taken to Brazil. In honor of her daughter, Maria Am√©lia's mother financed the construction of the \\"Princesa D. Maria Am√©lia\\" hospital in Funchal. Maria Am√©lia's fianc√©, Maximilian, made a pilgrimage to Brazil and Madeira, a journey that influenced his acceptance of the throne of Mexico in 1864.  Early life  = Birth = Maria Am√©lia was born on 1 December 1831 in Paris and christened Maria Am√©lia Augusta Eug√™nia Josefina Lu√≠sa Teodolinda El√≥i Francisco Xavier de Paula Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga. She was the only daughter of Dom Pedro, the Duke of Braganza, and his second wife Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg. Through her father, Maria Am√©lia was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragan√ßa), and was referred to by the honorific Dona (Lady) from birth. She was the granddaughter of the Portuguese King Jo√£o VI. Maria Am√©lia's mother was the daughter of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg and the stepson of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte of France. Eug√®ne was married to Princess Augusta, eldest daughter of King Maximilian I of Bavaria. Pedro had formerly been the first Emperor of Brazil, as Pedro I, and also King of Portugal, as Pedro IV. He was succeeded on the Portuguese throne by his eldest daughter, Maria II, Maria Am√©lia's elder half-sister. The young Queen was the child of Pedro's first marriage to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria. In 1828, Maria II's crown was usurped by Dom Miguel I, Pedro's younger brother. Eager to restore his daughter to her throne, Pedro abdicated the Brazilian crown in April 1831 and departed for Europe with Am√©lie, who was pregnant with Maria Am√©lia. To acknowledge Maria Am√©lia's rights as a Brazilian princess, Pedro invited several guests to observe her birth, including the Brazilian diplomatic envoy to France. The newborn's godparents were the French King Louis Philippe I and his consort Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, after whom she was named. Pedro sent a letter to his children who had remained in Brazil‚Äîincluding his son, child- emperor Dom Pedro II‚Äîwith the message: \\"Divine Providence wanted to lessen the sorrow that my paternal heart feels in the separation from Y.I.M. [Your Imperial Majesty], giving me one more Daughter, and to Y.I.M., one more sister and subject\\". = Brazilian princess = Maria Am√©lia with her mother, c. 1840 When Maria Am√©lia was only 20 days old, her father departed France to invade Portugal. For almost two years, she lived in Paris with her mother and half- sister Maria II. When news arrived that the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, had fallen to Pedro's forces, Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg left Paris with her infant daughter and stepdaughter for Portugal. They arrived in Lisbon on 22 September 1833 and disembarked the next day. Charles John Napier, a British naval officer who had fought alongside Pedro, wrote about the emotional reunion: With Miguel I defeated and in exile, and Maria II restored to the throne, Maria Am√©lia and her family remained in Portugal, first residing in Ramalh√£o Palace, and later in the Royal Palace of Queluz near Lisbon. But the war had taken its toll on Pedro's health, and he was dying of tuberculosis. Maria Am√©lia, who was not yet three years old, was taken during the early hours of 24 September 1834 to Pedro's deathbed. Very weak, Pedro raised his hands to bless her and said: \\"Always tell this child of the father who loved her so dearly ... not to forget me ... always to obey her mother ... those are my last wishes\\". Pedro died in the early afternoon of the same day. The widowed Am√©lie never remarried, and spent her time overseeing her daughter's upbringing in Portugal, where they remained despite not being members of the Portuguese Royal Family, though closely related. Neither Am√©lie nor her daughter ever visited Brazil, but Am√©lie unsuccessfully petitioned the Brazilian government to recognize her daughter as a member of Brazil's Imperial Family, which would have entitled her to an income. Maria Am√©lia's half-brother Pedro II was a minor, and the government of Brazil was in the hands of a precarious regency. The government refused to acknowledge Maria Am√©lia as a Brazilian princess owing to her foreign birth, and forbade both her and her mother from setting foot in Brazil. The situation would only change after Pedro II was declared of age in 1840 and was in a position to insist that she be recognized as a member of his household. Aureliano Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba), the Minister of Foreign Affairs, requested the Brazilian parliament to grant Maria Am√©lia recognition, which occurred on 5 July 1841. = Education and engagement = A drawing made by Maria Am√©lia With the purpose of refining her education, Maria Am√©lia moved with her mother in the middle 1840s to Munich, capital of Bavaria, where many of her relatives lived. A dedicated student, she was given classes that encompassed a broad array of subjects that included rhetoric, philosophy, history, geography, German literature, mathematics and physics. She learned to speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also in English, French and German. She became highly skilled in drawing, painting and playing the piano. An intelligent young woman with a fiery temper and shrewd mind, Maria Am√©lia was described by a teacher as having, \\"without knowing, an exceptional talent for dialectic, an ability that would make the fortune of a young law student.\\" The memory of her father apparently motivated Maria Am√©lia's dedication to her education. The late Duke of Braganza cast a large shadow in her life, and was always remembered by his daughter, who would often ask the people around her: \\"and my father, who looks at me from heaven, shall he be pleased with his daughter?\\" She was never quite able to cope with her father's death and it deeply touched her. Maria Am√©lia remarked after she saw a garden where Pedro planted a sycamore: At the end of 1850 Maria Am√©lia and her mother returned to Portugal, and settled in the Janelas Verdes palace. In early 1852, her cousin the Austrian Archduke Maximilian, then serving in the Austrian navy and on a stopover in Portugal, paid a visit to her. Maximilian's mother was the younger half-sister of Maria Am√©lia's maternal grandmother, and both women were members of the House of Wittelsbach from Bavaria. He was also related to Maria Am√©lia's older half- siblings, as his father was the younger brother of Brazilian Empress Leopoldina. They had met previously at a family reunion in Munich in 1838, when she was only a child. In this second meeting, however, they fell in love. Maximilian was enthralled by Maria Am√©lia, a kind young woman with blue eyes and blonde hair \\"of striking beauty as well as cultivated intelligence\\". They were betrothed, but the engagement was never made official as a result of her early death.  Later years  = Death = Maria Am√©lia's last moments with her mother at the bedside In February 1852, Maria Am√©lia contracted scarlet fever. As the months passed, she did not recover and developed a persistent cough, the onset of tuberculosis. On 26 August, the princess departed from the Janelas Verdes palace, where she lived, and traveled to the island of Madeira. The island's climate had a salutary reputation, as Maria Am√©lia noted: \\"the fevers disappear, they say, as if by magic!\\" Maria Am√©lia and her mother, who had accompanied her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, the capital of Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: \\"If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay a long time in this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!\\" But her health worsened, and by the end of November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: \\"My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it ... we are reaching the beginning of the end.\\" A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Am√©lia tried to comfort her mother: \\"Do not cry ... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!\\" She died later that morning at around 04:00. The princess's body remained in a chapel next to the house where she died until it was taken back to the Portuguese mainland on 7 May 1853. On 12 May, the coffin was disembarked at Lisbon, and a grandiose funeral followed. Her remains were interred next to her father's in the Braganza Pantheon, located in the Monastery of S√£o Vicente de Fora. Almost 130 years later, in 1982, Maria Am√©lia's remains were carried to Brazil and placed in the Convento de Santo Ant√¥nio (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio de Janeiro, where other Brazilian royals are interred. = Legacy = Hospital Princesa D. Maria Am√©lia Emperor Pedro II had never met his younger sister in person, but had developed a strong relationship with her through her letters. He wrote in his journal seven years after her death: \\"I heard the mass for my sister [Maria] Am√©lia with whom I was so close and feel so sorry for never having met.\\" Am√©lie visited her daughter's tomb every 4 February until her own death, and financed the construction of a hospital in Funchal called \\"Princesa D. Maria Am√©lia\\" in her daughter's honor; the hospital is still in existence. Am√©lie bequeathed her properties in Bavaria to Archduke Maximilian, \\"whom [she] would [have felt] happy having as a son-in-law, had God conserved [her] beloved daughter Maria Am√©lia\\". Archduke Maximilian was haunted by the memory of Maria Am√©lia, and after his marriage to Charlotte of Belgium he made a pilgrimage in 1859‚Äì60 to locations connected to his ex-fianc√©e. Upon reaching the island of Madeira, he wrote: \\"Here died, of tuberculosis, on 4 February 1853, the only daughter of the Empress of Brazil, an extraordinarily gifted creature. She left this flawed world, pure as an angel who returns to Heaven, her true native land.\\" Maximilian visited the hospital in Funchal that bore Maria Am√©lia's name, and until his death financed the maintenance of a double hospital room there. He also donated a statue of Our Lady of Sorrows in memory of Maria Am√©lia. Next he visited the house (called Quinta das Ang√∫stias, or Anguished Villa) where she died; he wrote: \\"for a long time I stood silent amidst thoughts of sorrow and longing under the shadow of a magnificent tree that enfolds and protects the house where the angel, so bitterly wept for, ceased to exist\\". In his memoirs, Maximilian also mentioned the island of Madeira, where \\"the life [was] extinguished that seemed destined to guarantee my own tranquil happiness\\". Following his arrival in Brazil on 11 January 1860 Maximilian became fascinated by the country, the only monarchy in South America, and then under the rule of his deceased fianc√©e's elder brother. Inspired by the stability and prosperity he saw there, on 10 April 1864 he agreed to become emperor of the newly founded Mexican Empire, believing he could achieve the same results in Mexico. But instead Maximilian was executed on 19 June 1867, after being captured by Mexican republicans. In a last homage to Maria Am√©lia, as he was stripped of his belongings to face a firing squad, Maximilian asked that the small medallion of the Blessed Virgin Mary she had given to him, and which he wore around his neck, be sent to her mother. While Maria Am√©lia's life had little effect on events in either Brazil or Portugal, her death had significant, if indirect, repercussions on the history of Mexico.

Early life and education Rhoades is from Louisville, Kentucky. He attended high school in Forest Park, Georgia, a south suburb of Atlanta. Career Rhoades' musical career began in 1968 when he was a senior in high school as the drummer in a cover band, Celestial Voluptuous Banana, that played the Catacombs and Piedmont Park along with other bands such as the Hampton Grease Band. By 1975 he had formed the Hahavishnu Orchestra, a 12-piece musical comedy troupe which performed nationally until 1978. The music of the Orchestra is often compared to The Fugs, Frank Zappa and even The Tubes. The group's name is wordplay on the name of John McLaughlin's 1970s jazz fusion group The Mahavishnu Orchestra. During this period, Kurt Loder (of Rolling Stone and later also MTV) was quoted proclaiming Rhoades as \\"one of the most savagely gifted writer/performers in the country today\\". On New Year's Eve 1977, Rhoades and the orchestra appeared on the James Brown Future Shock television show on fledgling WTBS. In January 1978, Rhoades performed with the opening act for the American debut of the Sex Pistols. Rhoades' first LP, Burgers From Heaven, was released in 1979. Its title song appears in the Jim Varney film, Fast Food (1988). Rhoades performed the title song on the now cult classic Bill Tush WTBS late-night comedy sketch show Tush during 1980‚Äì81 in the early days of cable television. The music was performed as the Idolators on Georgia Championship Wrestling as the ring music for wrestler Austin Idol. The Outlaws recorded a cover of Rhoades' \\"The Lights Are On (But Nobody's Home)\\" on the 1979 album In The Eye of the Storm. Although the period 1981‚Äì1984 is obscure for Rhoades, by 1985, he assembled The Men from Glad and released his second LP, Better Dead Than Mellow. In 1989, Rhoades began his comedy career. In 1991 he released Before and After His Time, a compilation of his first three albums. In 1992 he released his fifth album, Cowpokin' & Udder Love Songs, which received airplay across the US. Working continuously and receiving airplay from syndicated radio shows such as The Dr. Demento Show and The John Boy & Billy Big Show helped to create a large fanbase, leaving little time for Rhoades to perform with musical groups. He performs on rare occasions as the drummer for The Electrifyin' Sissies, which include record producer Brendan O'Brien, Rick Richards from the Georgia Satellites, and radio personality/rock historian Rex Patton. In 1994 he released his sixth LP, The Lean Years 1950‚Äì1994. The album received even more airplay with his infamous U Suck Beer commercials which have become his trademark in his stand-up performances. In April 1999 he released his seventh LP titled Radio Daze...The Shroud of Tourin'. This CD is a parody of radio deejays from all over the US, with satire of bad gospel music, commercials, and unfunny morning radio shows. Close to 40 different performers appear on the album. In May 2001, Rhoades released Rhoades....All Over The Map, his eighth comedy and music recording. As its title alludes, the album contains various musical styles such as jazz, country, swing, heavy metal, rockabilly and more. Also, on this CD are versions of a couple of his songs recorded live in a rare radio interview and recorded live stand-up from the Punchline comedy club in Atlanta. In 2008, Rhoades released his eleventh CD Weapons of Mass Deception which features Peter Stroud and Tim Smith (Sheryl Crow Band), Rick Richards (Georgia Satellites), Col. Bruce Hampton (multiple legendary groups and the film Slingblade) Deborah Reece (former Randall Bramblett band member) and other southern musicians. On September 12, 2009, Rhoades regrouped many of the original members of the Hahavishnu Orchestra for a celebration at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta. Also in 2009, Rhoades played drums in the Santa Fe scenes in the 2010 academy winning movie, Crazy Heart. In 2014 Rhoades released another album, Teenagers in Heat, that is part sketch comedy, part social satire, part rock 'n' roll scrapbook.

Biography Armitage was born in 1913, in the town of Hoylake on the Irish Sea, county of Cheshire. When he died there in 1998, it was part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. In 1939 he married Catherine Buckle, who died in 1988. They had two daughters. Armitage studied at Liverpool School of Art, taught at Wallesey School of Art, and joined the Navy in 1940. He took the name Ionicus for his first cartoon that was published in Punch, 29 March 1944, after two ionic columns in the drawing. Over 40 years he contributed 358 drawings to the magazine.

Broken Slavey is based primarily on the Slavey language with elements from French, Cree, and perhaps to a lesser extent English. However, there is some disagreement among sources: Petitot (1889) states that it lacks English, Dene Suline (Chipewyan), or Gwich'in (Kutchin) elements in contrast to the neighbouring Loucheux Pidgin (or Loucheux Jargon), while Dall (1870) states that it includes English elements and McClellan (1981) states that it contained Dene Suline influences. Later sources have ignored the earlier accounts and assumed that \\"Broken Slavey\\" is merely French vocabulary (loanwords) used in northern Athabascan languages. Michael Krauss has suggested that French loanwords in Athabascan languages may have been borrowed via Broken Slavey. A further difference among sources is that Petitot distinguishes the Broken Slavey trade language spoken along the Mackenzie River from a different trade language called Loucheux Pidgin that was spoken along the Peel (a tributary of the Mackenzie) and Yukon rivers. Other contemporary sources as well as later sources do not make a distinction between Broken Slavey and Loucheux Pidgin, which may explain their inclusion of English, Dene Suline, and Gwich'in as influences on Broken Slavey. The native languages of speakers who used Broken Slavey (known in Alaska as 'Slavey') were Dene Suline, French, Gwich'in, Inuktitut, Slavey. One notable speaker of Slavey Jargon was Antoine Hoole, the Hudson's Bay Company translator at Fort Yukon. Hoole (or Houle) was a professional servant of the Company who served for well over twenty years at Peel River and at Fort Yukon. Having a French-speaking father and a M√©tis mother, Hoole was born in 1827 and raised in a household where at least two languages were spoken. He originally came from Fort Halkett on the Liard River in what is now the southern Yukon Territory. He probably spoke South Slavey because that was the Native American language spoken around the Liard River, although Sekani and Kaska people also frequented the area. Hoole died in Fort Yukon at the age of forty-one, on October 22, 1868. The Gwich'in apparently stopped speaking the jargon in the early 20th century. The gold rush, with its massive influx of English speakers into the region beginning in 1886, probably provided a death blow. One speaker, Malcolm Sandy Roberts of Circle, Alaska, continued to use it in a diminished form until his death in 1983.Mishler, 2008. The best written historical documentation of Slavey Jargon shows its actual use was for preaching the gospel and for teasing and harassing clergymen, and for interpersonal relationships. For all these reasons, it seems inaccurate to characterize it strictly as a trade jargon. Broken Slavey has recently been documented with a few vocabulary items and phrases (collected in Petitot's work) and only a little of its grammar and lexicon. However, more information may yet be discovered in archives through missionary records and traders' journals. References Bibliography * Bakker, Peter. (1996).

J√°nos Kem√©ny, offspring of a Transylvanian family of Hungarian aristocrats, held various political and military positions in the Principality of Transylvania, during the reign of princes G√°bor Bethlen and George I R√°k√≥czi. As he writes, the family descends from Kemeny Simon, who disguised himself as Hunyadi J√°nos and was killed by the Turks instead of his master. The story is recorded by Heltai Gaspar's work, Magyar Cronica, a Hungarian translation/rewriting of the Latin of Antonio Bonfini published in 1560s. Under George II R√°k√≥czi, he became the chief advisor of the prince, and leader of the military campaigns to Moldavia in 1653 and Poland in 1657, the latter being aimed at obtaining the Polish crown for R√°k√≥czi. The Turks strongly opposed to R√°k√≥czi's Polish ambitions and prohibited any military action. In the face of Turkish prohibition, Kem√©ny also objected to the prince's ill- conceived Polish undertaking, and unwillingly took the leadership of the campaign that ended in disaster; Kem√©ny's army, deserted by the Swedish allies, was captured by the Crimean Tatar allies of the Turks. Kem√©ny was held captive by the Tatars until August 1659, when he was released for a huge ransom. During his captivity in Bakhchisaray he wrote his Autobiography (in Hungarian), one of the most excellent masterpieces of the Transylvanian memoirist literature of the 17th century. When he returned to Transylvania, he found a country torn by the ambitions of George II R√°k√≥czi, unwilling to resign, a number of would-be princes, and a Turkish Porte vengeful for the unauthorized military campaign. The Sublime Porte now openly disregarded the Transylvanian Estates' right to elect the prince; Kem√©ny saw this, and the successional invasions of Transylvania by the Turks and their Crimean Tatar allies, as an end of Transylvania's autonomy, which he thought could be prevented only with reliance on Habsburg help. Kem√©ny was elected prince by the Transylvanian Diet on 1 January 1661, after √Åkos Barcsai, backed up by the Turks, was forced to resign. In April 1661, the Transylvanian Diet, led by Kem√©ny, proclaimed the secession of Transylvania from the Ottoman Empire and called on for help from Vienna. In turn, an overwhelming Turkish and Tatar army attacked Transylvania in June, defeating Kem√©ny's army and driving him to Royal Hungary. The Turks installed Mih√°ly Apafi as prince; Kem√©ny, initially supported by Austrian general Montecuccoli returned to Transylvania in early September. However, the Austrian army soon deserted him, and Kem√©ny was killed by the Turks in the battle of Nagysz≈ëll≈ës. His renaissance family castle is now in half-ruin, due to neglect of the government, in Aranyosmeggyes - visible from the main road Cluj-Napoca-Turda.

Between 1987 and 2015, except for a period between 2010 and 2012, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) for four constituencies, first for the Labour Party and later the Respect Party. Galloway was born in Dundee to a Scottish father and Irish mother. After becoming the youngest ever chair of the Scottish Labour Party in 1981, he was general secretary of the London-based charity War on Want from 1983 until elected as MP for Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) at the 1987 general election. In 2003, Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party for bringing the party into disrepute, including having called on Arabs to fight British troops. In 2004, Galloway became a member of Respect‚ÄìThe Unity Coalition, later known as the Respect Party, becoming party leader by late 2013. Having decided not to seek re-election for Glasgow Kelvin, he stood for Respect at the 2005 general election for Bethnal Green and Bow, defeating the sitting Labour MP, Oona King, and served for one parliamentary term. He did not fight the 2010 general election and returned to the House of Commons at the Bradford West by-election in 2012, but lost his seat at the 2015 general election. He stood as a Respect candidate in the 2016 London mayoral election, but lost to the Labour nominee, Sadiq Khan; Galloway finishing in seventh place with 1.4% of the vote. He stood as an independent candidate for Manchester Gorton in 2017 and for West Bromwich East in 2019. Following the 2019 general election, he founded the Workers Party of Britain. Galloway was initially an opponent of Saddam Hussein, but has been accused by David Aaronovitch and Christopher Hitchens of supporting the Iraqi leader when it became Western policy not to, a charge he denies. Galloway testified to the United States Senate in 2005 over alleged illicit payments from the United Nations' Oil for Food Program. Galloway supports the Palestinian side in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, opposes Zionism, and was involved in the Viva Palestina aid convoys. Galloway supported Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election and during Corbyn's leadership of the party. In the 2016 EU membership referendum, he advocated a \\"Leave\\" vote, campaigning with the cross-party, pro-Brexit organisation Grassroots Out, while before the 2019 European Parliament election he announced on Twitter, \\"for one-time only\\", he would support Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.  Early life and career  = Background and education = Galloway was born in Dundee, Scotland to teetotal parents George Galloway senior, a Scottish trade unionist, and Sheila (n√©e Reilly), who is of Irish descent; the eldest of three children, he has a brother, Graham, and a sister, Colette. Initially raised in Lochee, Dundee, he has described himself as \\"born in an attic in a slum tenement in the Irish quarter of Dundee, which is known as Tipperary.\\" His father began as an electrician, before becoming an electro-mechanical engineer at NCR. After being made redundant, he retrained as a teacher. His mother was a cleaner, and then a factory worker. According to Galloway, his father was patriotic, while his mother had Irish nationalist sympathies, and was critical of perceived British pretensions in the world. Galloway took his mother's side in arguments, and has been a long-time supporter of Sinn F√©in and Irish reunification. David Morley, Galloway's biographer has written that people who knew both father and son have said that they shared similar Marxist opinions, common in the local Labour movement of the time.Morley, p. 7 He grew up in Charleston, Dundee and attended Charleston Primary and then Harris Academy, a non-denominational school, playing for the school football team as well as for West End United U12s, Lochee Boys Club U16s and St Columbus U18s. According to Galloway, he grew a moustache at the age of 15, and refused to shave it off when his headmaster objected. He decided, at the age of 18, never to drink alcohol; the reason was originally derived from comments by his father, and he has described alcohol as having a \\"very deleterious effect on people\\". = Labour Party organiser = Galloway joined the Labour Party Young Socialists aged just 13 (although he said he was 15) and was still a teenager when he became secretary of the Dundee Labour Party. He recalled in 2007: \\"As a teenager, I fell in love with the example of Che Guevara\\", the Argentinian revolutionary. Galloway wrote in the same year that he still admires Guevara. Galloway became vice-chairman of the Labour Party in the City of Dundee and a member of the Scottish Executive Committee in 1975. On 5 May 1977, he contested his first election campaign in the Scottish district elections, but failed to hold the safe Labour Gillburn ward in Dundee being defeated by the independent Bunty Turley.; Morley Gorgeous George, pp. 30‚Äì32 He became the secretary organiser of the Dundee Labour Party in 1977 and at 26 was the youngest ever chairman of the Scottish Labour Party in March 1981,Morley, p. 44-5, 70 a post he held for a year after holding the vice-chairman post over the previous year. After a trip to Beirut, Lebanon during 1977, Galloway became a passionate supporter of Palestine, stating during his libel case against The Daily Telegraph in 2004 that \\"barely a week after my return I made a pledge, in the Tavern Bar in Dundee's Hawkhill District, to devote the rest of my life to the Palestinian and Arab cause.\\" He supported Dundee City Council when it flew the Palestinian flag over the City Chambers building, and was involved in the twinning of Dundee with the Palestinian West Bank town of Nablus (Shechem) in 1980. \\"Unbelievably controversial, and I did it without preparing people properly for the storm\\", he recalled more than 30 years later. In late 1981, Galloway was interviewed for the Scottish Marxist in which Galloway supported the affiliation of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) to the Labour Party, in the same way as the Fabian Society does. Believing that a deficiency in political theory was being filled by the entryist infiltration of the party by the Trotskyists (such as the Militant group), Galloway thought the problem was better resolved by communist thinking from members of the CPGB.Morley, p.74-75 (He was later opposed to the expulsion of members of Militant.) In response, Denis Healey, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, tried and failed to remove Galloway from the list of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates. Healey lost his motion by 13 votes to five. Galloway once quipped that, to overcome a ¬£1.5 million deficit which had arisen in Dundee's city budget, he, Ernie Ross, and leading councillors should be placed in the stocks in the city square: \\"we would allow people to throw buckets of water over us at 20p a time.\\" In 1983, Galloway attempted to stand for the safe Labour seat of Rhondda after the Welsh Transport and General Workers' Union and the National Union of Miners had both nominated him to succeed Alec Jones, who had died. He hoped to be selected in the newly created seat of Dunfermline East where no incumbent was standing. Galloway failed to be selected for either seat, with Rhondda selecting Allan Rogers and Dunfermline East selecting future Chancellor of the Exchequer and later Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. Standing as a candidate for a place on the Labour Party National Executive Committee in 1986, in a large field of 18 candidates, Galloway finished in 16th place.Morley, p. 141 = War on Want = From November 1983 to 1987, Galloway was the general secretary of War on Want, a British charity campaigning against poverty worldwide. In this post he travelled widely, and wrote eye-witness accounts of the famine in Eritrea in 1985 which were published in The Sunday Times and The Spectator.'Glasgow Hillhead' (PA number 263) in \\"General Election Constituency Guide\\", BBC Data, 1987. His deputy at the charity, Simon Stocker, recalled: \\"If you went into a fight with George, you knew you would never walk out with a win.\\" On 28 October 1986, the Daily Mirror, in a front-page story by Alastair Campbell, claimed Galloway had spent ¬£20,000 in expenses and had been \\"enjoying a life of luxury.\\"Morley, pp. 129‚Äì30 An internal investigation, and later, an independent auditor, both cleared him of the accusation of any misuse of funds, although he did repay ¬£1,720 in contested expenses. The official history of War on Want comments about Galloway that \\"even though the problems were not all of his own making, his way of dealing with them heightened tensions\\".  Political career (1987‚Äì2005)  = Member of Parliament for a Glasgow seat = At the 1987 general election, Galloway was elected as the MP for Glasgow Hillhead gaining the seat for Labour from the SDP defeating Roy Jenkins with a majority of 3,251 votes. Although known for his left-wing political views, Galloway was never a member of the Campaign Group. In a 2002 Guardian interview, Galloway said he had supported the Soviet Union and asserted that its end was \\"the biggest catastrophe of my life\\". Galloway told Robert Chalmers of The Independent on Sunday in June 2012: \\"I am not a pacifist. I am a revolutionary. I am a Socialist who doesn't like Capitalism and who likes Imperialism less. I am a revolutionary and I support the armed struggle where there is no alternative.\\" At a press gathering for War on Want in September 1987, when Galloway had stood down as general secretary of the organisation, a journalist asked him about his personal arrangements during the previous year's War on Want conference on the Greek island of Mykonos. The new MP replied: \\"I travelled and spent lots of time with people in Greece, many of whom were women, some of whom were known carnally to me. I actually had sexual intercourse with some of the people in Greece.\\" By then separated from his first wife, Galloway made front-page headlines in the tabloid press at the time. Many years later, in a 2016 New Internationalist interview, he speculated that an incident of sexual abuse from a colonel, which he suffered when he was 12, has led to a \\"lifelong fear of being gay and this led me into ostentatious, rapacious heterosexual promiscuity\\". In February 1988, the executive committee of his constituency Labour Party passed a vote of no confidence in him by 15 to 8.Morley, p. 175 The constituency's general management committee voted 54-to-44 in favour of the motion a fortnight later on 22 February, although just three of the 25 members in the trade union section supported it. According to Tam Dalyell in 2003, the new Member of Parliament \\"was [the] only one MP that I can recollect making speeches about human rights in Iraq\\" in the House of Commons. Galloway gained re-selection when challenged by Trish Godman (wife of fellow MP Norman Godman) in June 1989, but failed to get a majority of the electoral college on the first ballot. This was the worst result for any sitting Labour MP who was reselected, but in the final vote, Galloway gained 62% in total. In his acceptance speech, Galloway assured his party there would be a \\"summer of peace and reconciliation\\", but this did not happen. Many members of the party who had supported Godman reportedly refused to work for Galloway in the next election, including Johann Lamont, who later became Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2011.Morley, p. 283 The following August, 13 of the 26 members of the constituency party's executive committee resigned, including Lamont. According to her, Galloway \\"has done nothing to build bridges with the Members of the Executive [Committee of the Constituency Labour Party] who opposed his selection.\\" She told a journalist from The Guardian: \\"The quarrel we have is all about accountability, and democracy ... working in harmony, rather than any personal matters.\\"Morley, p.284 The Labour Party leadership election in 1992 saw Galloway voting for the eventually successful candidates, John Smith for leader and Margaret Beckett as deputy leader. In 1994, after Smith died, Galloway declined to cast a vote in the leadership election (one of only three MPs to do so). In a debate with the leader of the Scottish National Party, Alex Salmond, Galloway responded to one of Salmond's jibes against Labour by declaring \\"I don't give a fuck what Tony Blair thinks\\". In 1997, Galloway's Glasgow Hillhead constituency was abolished and, although facing a challenge for the Labour nomination as the candidate for Glasgow Kelvin at the 1997 general election, Galloway defeated Shiona Waldron. He was unchallenged for the nomination for the 2001 general election. Galloway was elected with majorities of 16,643 and 12,014 votes respectively. During the period he was Labour MP for Glasgow Kelvin, from 1997 to 2003, he voted against the whip 32 times, five votes out of 665 (0.8%) in the 1997‚Äì2001 parliament and the majority (27 votes out of 209 or 12.9%) in the period before he was expelled from the Labour Party. During the 2001‚Äì02 session, he was the ninth most rebellious Labour MP. Galloway was one of several politicians arrested in February 2001 during a protest at the Faslane nuclear base in Scotland, and in July 2002 he was convicted of a breach of the peace and fined ¬£180. = Iraq from 1991 =  The first Gulf war  Galloway opposed the 1991 Gulf War and was critical of the effect that the subsequent sanctions had on the people of Iraq. In his book I'm Not the Only One (2004), Galloway expresses the opinion that Kuwait is \\"clearly a part of the greater Iraqi whole, stolen from the motherland by perfidious Albion\\", although Christopher Hitchens claimed the state existed before Iraq had a name. This essay is reprinted in The text of Galloway's book differs in reprints. The massacre of Kurds and Shias just after the 1991 Gulf war, was according to Galloway, \\"a civil war that involved massive violence on both sides\\". Writing for The Observer in April 2003, David Aaronovitch speculated that Galloway changed his opinion of Saddam Hussein under \\"the belief that my enemy's enemy is my friend. Or, in the context of the modern world, any anti-American will do. When Iraq stopped being a friend of the West it became a friend of George's.\\"  Meeting with Saddam Hussein in 1994  In January 1994, Galloway faced some of his strongest criticism on his return from a Middle Eastern visit during which he had met Saddam Hussein. At his meeting with the Iraqi leader, he reported the support given to Saddam by the people of the Gaza Strip which he had just visited: \\"I can honestly tell you that there was not a single person to whom I told I was coming to Iraq and hoping to meet with yourself who did not wish me to convey their heartfelt, fraternal greetings and support.\\"The entire speech is contained in David Morley Gorgeous George: The Life and Adventures of George Galloway, London: Politicos, 2007, pp. 210‚Äì11 He ended his speech with the statement \\"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.\\" Galloway has asserted that he was saluting the Iraqi people rather than Saddam Hussein in the speech, which was translated for the Iraqi leader. As news of the incident reached the UK, Labour leader John Smith, in a statement, said: \\"I deeply deplore the foolish statement made in Iraq by Mr. George Galloway. In no way did he speak for the Labour Party and I wholly reject his comments.\\" Shortly after his return, Galloway was given a \\"severe reprimand\\" by the Labour Chief Whip, Derek Foster, for his unauthorised trip to Iraq. The MP apologised for his conduct and undertook to follow future instruction from the whips. For his visit with Saddam, Galloway was dubbed the \\"MP for Baghdad North\\". Galloway said, when he spoke before the U.S. Senate on 17 May 2005, that he had \\"met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him.\\" Whereas \\"Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns\\", Galloway had \\"met him to try to bring about an end to sanctions, suffering and war.\\"  The Mariam Appeal  In 1998, Galloway founded the Mariam Appeal which was intended, according to its website's welcome page in 1999, \\"to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq\\". The campaign was named after Mariam Hamza, a child flown by the fund from Iraq to Britain to receive treatment for leukaemia. The intention was to raise awareness of the suffering and death of hundreds of thousands of other Iraqi children, due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities, and to campaign for the lifting of the Iraq sanctions that many maintained were responsible for that situation. In 1999, Galloway was criticised for spending Christmas in Iraq with Tariq Aziz, who was Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister at the time. In a 17 May 2005 hearing of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Galloway stated that he had many meetings with Aziz, and characterised their relationship as friendly. In all, he has admitted to more than 10 meetings with Aziz. The fund received scrutiny during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after a complaint that Galloway used some donated money to pay for his travel expenses. He responded by stating that the expenses were incurred in his capacity as the appeal's chairman. Although the Mariam Appeal was never a registered charity and never intended to be such, it was investigated by the Charity Commission. The report of this year-long inquiry, published in June 2004, found that the Mariam Appeal was undertaking charitable work (and so ought to have registered with the commission), but did not substantiate allegations that any funds had been misused. It emerged some years later that Galloway had appealed in a letter dated 24 April 2003 to Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, to stop the investigation into the Mariam Appeal. According to a report in The Times, after the letter was released under the Freedom of Information Act, Galloway falsely asserted that the appeal \\"received no money from Iraq\\". A further Charity Commission Report published on 7 June 2007 found that the appeal had received funds from Fawaz Zureikat that originated from the Oil For Food programme, and concluded that: Galloway, in response, stated: \\"I've always disputed the Commission's retrospective view that a campaign to win a change in national and international policy ‚Äì a political campaign ‚Äì was, in fact, a charity\\".  Iraq and Saddam Hussein  In a House of Commons debate on 6 March 2002, Foreign Office minister Ben Bradshaw said Galloway was \\"not just an apologist, but a mouthpiece, for the Iraqi regime over many years.\\"Hansard, House of Commons debates, 6 March 2002, Col. 88WH Galloway called the minister a liar and refused to withdraw on the grounds that Bradshaw's claim was \\"a clear imputation of dishonour\\", and the sitting was suspended due to the dispute. Bradshaw later withdrew his allegation, and Galloway apologised for using unparliamentary language. In an article by Ewen MacAskill published by The Guardian in March 2000 about a visit by Galloway to Iraq and the Middle East, the politician describes himself as a supporter of the Iraqi people and the Ba'ath Party, but not Saddam Hussein himself. In August 2002, Galloway returned to Iraq and met Saddam Hussein for a second and final time. According to Galloway, the intention of the trip was to persuade Saddam to re-admit Hans Blix, and the United Nations weapons inspectors into the country. asylum seekers petition, sitting on the edge of the StWC stage at the 2005 Make Poverty History rally. Giving evidence in his libel case against The Daily Telegraph newspaper in 2004, Galloway testified that he regarded Saddam as a \\"bestial dictator\\" and would have welcomed his removal from power, but not by means of a military attack on Iraq. Galloway also pointed out that he was a prominent critic of Saddam Hussein's government in the 1980s, as well as of the role of Margaret Thatcher's government in supporting arms sales to Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. In his memoir, I'm Not the Only One first published in 2004, Galloway wrote that \\"just as Stalin industrialised the Soviet Union, so on a different scale Saddam plotted Iraq's own Great Leap Forward.\\" He continued: \\"He managed to keep his country together until 1991. Indeed, he is likely to have been the leader in history who came closest to creating a truly Iraqi national identity, and he developed Iraq and the living, health, social and education standards of his own people.\\" In 2006 a video surfaced showing Galloway greeting Uday Hussein, Saddam's eldest son, with the title of \\"Excellency\\" at Uday's palace in 1999. Galloway is heard saying he will be with Uday \\"until the end\\". By his own account in I'm Not the Only One, Galloway advised members of Saddam Hussein's government about the ways to deal with a potential American invasion:  The Iraq war and Labour Party expulsion  Galloway became the vice-president of the Stop the War Coalition in 2001. Actively involved, he often delivered speeches from StWC platforms at anti-war demonstrations. After permission for a rally in Hyde Park during the international anti-war protests on 15 February 2003 was initially refused, Galloway said the government had a choice between \\"half a million people at the rally or half a million people in a riot\\". Just over a month later, Galloway said in a 28 March 2003 interview with Abu Dhabi TV that Tony Blair and George W. Bush had \\"lied to the British Air Force and Navy, when they said the battle of Iraq would be very quick and easy. They attacked Iraq like wolves,\\" and added that \\"the best thing British troops can do is to refuse to obey illegal orders\\". This incitement for \\"British troops to defy orders\\" was later among the formal reasons for his expulsion from the Labour Party. On 18 April 2003, The Sun published an interview with Tony Blair who said: \\"His comments were disgraceful and wrong. The National Executive will deal with it\\". At this time, Labour MP Tam Dalyell commented in Galloway's defence: \\"I think he is a deeply serious, committed politician and a man of great sincerity about the causes he takes up.\\" On 6 May 2003, David Triesman, then general secretary of the Labour Party, suspended Galloway from holding office in the party pending a hearing on charges that he had violated the party's constitution by \\"bringing the Labour Party into disrepute through behaviour that is prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the Party.\\" Speaking on BBC Radio, Galloway said he stood by every word of the Abu Dhabi interview. The National Constitutional Committee, responsible for internal disciplinary matters, held a hearing on 22 October 2003, to consider the charges, taking evidence from Galloway himself, from other party witnesses, viewing media interviews, and hearing character testimony from former cabinet minister Tony Benn, among others. The following day, the committee decided in favour of four of the five charges accusing Galloway of \\"bringing the party into disrepute,\\" and expelled Galloway from the Labour Party. A claim that, in a speech, he had congratulated a successful anti-war candidate from the Socialist Alliance in Preston was rejected. According to Ian McCartney, Labour Party chairman at the time, Galloway was the only Labour MP who \\"incited foreign forces to rise up against British troops\\" in the Iraq War.Morley, p. 270 Galloway said after the NCC had decided on his expulsion: \\"This was a politically motivated kangaroo court whose verdict had been written in advance in the best tradition of political show trials.\\" Galloway claimed at the time that other MPs who had opposed the war, such as: Bob Marshall Andrews and Glenda Jackson, would be expelled in due course, but no other MP was expelled from the Labour Party for their statements about the Iraq war. After an article by Galloway was published in the Morning Star attacking the Labour Party, Tony Benn wrote in his diary in June 2004, quoting from the article, that if he had persuaded the NEC not to expel him, Galloway would have remained \\"a member of a party currently run by a 'blood-splattered, lying, crooked group of war criminals'. It put me off George Galloway in a fairly fundamental way\\". In 2005, at the time of the Iraq War, Galloway called President George W. Bush the world's \\"biggest terrorist\\".  Iraq after Saddam Hussein  Galloway defended Iraqi insurgents targeting Western forces as \\"martyrs\\" during August 2005 in appearances on Middle Eastern television channels, Iraqis who were with the allies security forces he called \\"collaborators\\" and said it was \\"normal\\" for them to be the targets of suicide bombers. Galloway said: \\"These poor Iraqis ‚Äì ragged people, with their sandals, with their Kalashnikovs, with the lightest and most basic of weapons ‚Äì are writing the names of their cities and towns in the stars, with 145 military operations every day, which has made the country ungovernable. We don't know who they are, we don't know their names, we never saw their faces, they don't put up photographs of their martyrs, we don't know the names of their leaders\\". Galloway was challenged by the BBC but denied making the \\"martyrs\\" comment.\\"Galloway defends 'martyrs' remark\\", BBC News, 5 August 2005. Galloway continued to praise Tariq Aziz. In April 2005, on Al Jazeera during that year's general election campaign, he described Aziz as \\"an eminent diplomatic and intellectual person\\". In his opinion, Aziz was \\"a political prisoner\\" and Galloway advocated his release.  Oil for Food  = Daily Telegraph libel case = On 22 April 2003, The Daily Telegraph published news articles and comment describing documents found by its reporter David Blair in the ruins of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry. The documents purported to be records of meetings between Galloway and Iraqi intelligence agents, and they stated that he had received ¬£375,000 per year from the proceeds of the Oil-for-Food Programme. Galloway completely denied the claims and pointed to the nature of the discovery within an unguarded, bombed-out building as being questionable. He instigated legal action against the newspaper, which was heard in the High Court on 14 November 2004. On 2 December, Justice David Eady ruled that the story had been \\"seriously defamatory\\", and that The Daily Telegraph was \\"obliged to compensate Mr Galloway ... and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation.\\" Galloway was awarded damages of ¬£150,000 plus, after a failed appeal in 2006, legal costs of about ¬£2 million. The libel case was regarded by both sides as an important test of the Reynolds qualified-privilege defence. The Daily Telegraph did not attempt to claim justification (where the defendant seeks to prove the truth of the defamatory reports): \\"It has never been the Telegraph's case to suggest that the allegations contained in these documents are true\\". The newspaper argued that it acted responsibly as the allegations it reported were of sufficient public interest to outweigh the damage caused to Galloway's reputation. The trial judge did not accept this defence, noting that comments such as Galloway being guilty of \\"treason\\", \\"in Saddam's pay\\", and being \\"Saddam's little helper\\" caused him [the judge] to conclude that \\"the newspaper was not neutral but both embraced the allegations with relish and fervour and went on to embellish them\\"; additionally, the judge ruled, Galloway had not been given a fair or reasonable opportunity to make inquiries or meaningful comment upon the documents before they were published. The issue of whether or not the documents were genuine was likewise not at issue at the trial. Oliver Thorne, a forensic expert who had been earlier hired by Galloway's lawyers, later stated \\"In my opinion the evidence found fully supports that the vast majority of the submitted documents are authentic\\". = Other libel claims = The Christian Science Monitor also published a story on 25 April 2003, stating that it had documentary evidence that he had received \\"more than ten million dollars\\" from the Iraqi government. However, on 20 June 2003, the Monitor reported that its own investigation had concluded that the documents were sophisticated forgeries, and apologised. Galloway rejected the newspaper's apology, asserted that the affair was a conspiracy against him, and continued a libel claim against the paper. The Christian Science Monitor settled the claim, paying him an undisclosed sum in damages, on 19 March 2004. In January 2004, a further set of allegations were made in Al-Mada, a newspaper in Iraq. The newspaper claimed to have found documents in the Iraqi national oil corporation showing that Galloway received (through an intermediary) some of the profits arising from the sale of 19.5 million barrels (3,100,000 m¬≥) of oil. Galloway acknowledged that money had been paid into the Mariam Appeal by Iraqi businessmen who had profited from the UN-run programme, but denied benefiting personally, and maintained that, in any case, there was nothing illicit about this: = US Senate =  Allegations  In May 2005, a US Senate committee report accused Galloway along with former French minister Charles Pasqua of receiving the right to buy oil under the UN's oil-for-food scheme. The report was issued by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican from Minnesota. The report cited further documents from the Iraqi oil ministry and interviews with Iraqi officials. Coleman's committee said that Pasqua had received allocations worth from 1999 to 2000, and Galloway received allocations worth from 2000 to 2003. The allegations against Pasqua and Galloway, both outspoken opponents of U.N. sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s, have been made before, including in an October report by US arms inspector Charles Duelfer as well as in the various purported documents described earlier in this section. But Coleman's report provided several new details. It also included information from interrogations of former high-ranking officials in US custody, including former Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and former Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan. Among the claims is that there is new evidence to suggest that the Mariam Appeal, a children's leukaemia charity founded by Galloway, was in fact used to conceal oil payments. The report cites Ramadan as saying under interrogation that Galloway was allocated oil \\"because of his opinions about Iraq.\\" Galloway countered the charges by accusing Coleman and other pro-war politicians of covering up the \\"theft of billions of dollars of Iraq's wealth... on your watch\\" that had occurred under a post-invasion Coalition Provisional Authority, committed by \\"Halliburton and other American corporations... with the connivance of your own government.\\"  Senate hearing (17 May 2005)  On 17 May 2005, the committee held a hearing concerning specific allegations (of which Galloway was one part) relating to improprieties surrounding the Oil-for-Food programme. Attending Galloway's oral testimony and questioning him were two of the 13 committee members: the chair (Coleman) and the ranking Democrat (Carl Levin). On arriving in the US, he told Reuters, \\"I have no expectation of justice from a group of Christian fundamentalist and Zionist activists.\\" Galloway described Coleman as a \\"pro- war, neocon hawk and the lickspittle of George W. Bush,\\" who, he said, sought vengeance against anyone who did not support the war in Iraq. In his testimony, Galloway made the following statements in response to the allegations against him:  Senate report (October 2005)  A report by the then-majority Republican Party staff of the United States Senate Committee on Investigations published in October 2005 asserted that Galloway had \\"knowingly made false or misleading statements under oath\\". The report exhibits bank statements, which the authors claim show that $150,000 of proceeds from the Oil-for-Food programme had been paid to Galloway's wife Amineh Abu-Zayyad. It also asserts that Galloway (and the Mariam Appeal) received eight allocations of oil from the Iraqi government amounting to 23 million barrels from 1999 to 2003. The Mariam Appeal was also found to have improperly received $446,000 via the Oil-for-Food programme. Tariq Aziz was said to have told the investigators that oil had been allocated in the names of two of Galloway's representatives, Buhan Al-Chalabi and Fawaz Zureikat. Aziz had told the investigators: \\"These oil allocations were for the benefit of George Galloway and for Mariam's Appeal. The proceeds from the sale benefited the cause and Mr Galloway\\". Galloway reiterated his denial of the charges and challenged the US Senate committee to charge him with perjury. CNN's website reported him as saying: \\"I'm demanding to be prosecuted. I'm begging to be prosecuted for perjury\\". He claimed Coleman's motive was revenge over the embarrassment of his appearance before the committee in May. Galloway also said the claim Aziz had told investigators he had benefited financially, via Zureikat, from the Oil for Food programme had been rejected by Aziz, via his French lawyers. A contemporary UN-supported report written by Paul Volcker, the former American Federal Reserve chairman, asserted that eleven million barrels of oil had been reserved in Galloway's name. For Volcker's report, Aziz was interviewed, but his account on this occasion differed from the one he had given the Senate, a change they considered unconvincing.  Before and after the 2005 general election  = Foundation of Respect = Galloway announced in December 2003 that he would not force a by-election and did not intend to contest the next general election in Glasgow. His Glasgow Kelvin seat was to be split between three constituencies for the next general election. In one of these, the new Glasgow Central constituency, Mohammad Sarwar, the first Muslim Labour MP, wanted to be selected as the candidate. Galloway chose not to challenge him, announcing this decision at the end of May 2004 in his Mail on Sunday column. Galloway wrote in an article for The Guardian at the end of October 2003 that he would soon be part of a coalition consisting of the \\"red, green, anti-war, Muslim and other social constituencies radicalised by the war.\\" In January 2004, it emerged that Galloway would be working with the Socialist Workers Party in England and Wales, and others, under the name Respect ‚Äì The Unity Coalition, generally referred to simply as \\"Respect\\". In the opinion of Nick Cohen of The Observer it was an \\"alliance... between the Trotskyist far left and the Islamic far right.\\" After the 2004 European Parliamentary election results became known, in which Galloway stood in London, but did not gain a seat, he announced that he would stand in East London at the next general election. On 2 December, he confirmed that he was aiming to be nominated as the Respect Party candidate for Bethnal Green and Bow. = Election campaign = Galloway in September 2005 The ensuing electoral campaign in the seat proved to be a difficult one with heated exchanges between Galloway, Oona King (the incumbent Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow), and their respective supporters. Galloway and Respect threatened to sue King, whose mother is Jewish, if she repeated her assertion in the Evening Standard on 10 April 2005 which reported her as saying: \\"I have been told by several people that members of Respect have told Muslim voters \\"not to vote for me because I am Jewish\\"\\". Galloway was asked at a hustings early in the campaign why he was standing against one of only two Black female MPs to which he replied that King had \\"voted to kill a lot of women in the last few years. Many of them had much darker skins than her\\". Claiming to be the ghost of Old Labour, Galloway told Sunday Times contributor A. A. Gill that \\"we‚Äôre here to haunt new Labour\\". Bethnal Green and Bow is \\"where Labour was founded. We‚Äôre giving birth to the Labour Party all over again\\". Galloway said at a hustings event that the Labour Government had been pursuing a \\"war on Muslims\\" while King said her stance against Saddam Hussein had been \\"principled\\". Galloway received death threats from an offshoot of al- Muhajiroun (a banned extreme Islamist group). On 19 April, about 30 men forced Galloway's meeting with a tenants‚Äô association to be abandoned after claiming he was a \\"false prophet\\" for encouraging Muslims to vote.An article in The Guardian identified the group as al-Ghuraaba. See Galloway himself said the group was Hizb ut-Tahrir. See Galloway was held by the group for about 20 minutes before the police arrived at the scene. All the major candidates united in condemning the threats and violence. Both the Labour and Respect candidates were given police protection. On 5 May, Galloway gained the seat from the Labour Party with a narrow majority of 823 votes, and denounced the returning officer for alleged discrepancies in the electoral process. After the election result became known, Galloway's spokesman, Ron McKay, rejected claims that King had been racially abused during the campaign and said it was King who had brought up her Jewish background. = Result and subsequent developments = During the BBC's election night coverage, Jeremy Paxman asked Galloway about whether he was happy to have removed one of the few black women in parliament, He replied: \\"I don't believe that people get elected because of the colour of their skin. I believe that people get elected because of their record and because of their policies\\". Oona King later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she found Paxman's line of questioning inappropriate. Galloway \\"shouldn't be barred from running against me because I'm a black woman. ... I was not defined, or did not wish to be defined, by either my ethnicity or religious background\\". It emerged in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme in 2010 that the Islamic Forum of Europe, which advocates sharia law, had been involved in campaigning for Galloway in the Bethnal Green constituency. In a secretly recorded speech at a dinner shortly after his election, Galloway said that the involvement of the IFE had played \\"the decisive role\\" in his win. Although the IFE itself denied the accusation, Galloway admitted in a statement that the allegation was true. The Respect Party split in the autumn of 2007, with the Socialist Workers' Party and Galloway's wing of Respect blaming each other for what he described as a \\"car crash on the left\\". Galloway did not seek re-election in Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2010 general election, instead opting to stand in the neighbouring constituency of Poplar and Limehouse. He received 8,160 votes coming third after the Labour and Conservative candidates.  Celebrity Big Brother  In January 2006, Galloway appeared on the fourth series of the reality TV programme Celebrity Big Brother for nearly three weeks. During his time on the programme, he mimed licking imaginary milk, whilst pretending to be a cat, from the cupped hands of another housemate, actress Rula Lenska. He wrote later that his activities \\"were actually the same stunts that BBC presenters and celebs get up for Children in Need\\". Galloway faced a claim at the time from Hilary Armstrong, Labour's Chief Whip, that he should \\"respect his constituents, not his ego\\". Ron McKay, his spokesman and friend, said of the imaginary milk incident: \\"I rather wish he hadn't been given that particularly silly task\\". It had been assumed, McKay said, that Galloway's comments about politics would not be cut. Just after his eviction, Galloway told presenter Davina McCall he was positive about having taken part, although when asked if he was \\"glad\\" to have participated, he said: \\"Not after I've seen those press cuttings.\\" Galloway wrote in a column for The Independent newspaper in November 2012 writing that his \\"antics on Big Brother\\" had \\"raised tens of thousands of pounds for the\\" Interpal charity and paid for an \\"extra caseworker in my constituency\\".  Other developments (2007‚Äì2011)  = Suspension from the House of Commons (2007) = On 17 July 2007, following a four-year inquiry, the House of Commons Select Committee on Standards and Privileges published its sixth report. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, in an addendum to the report, concluded that there was no evidence that Galloway gained any personal benefit from either the former Iraqi administration, or from the Oil-for-Food Programme, but admitted that some documents had been unavailable to him. However, the Committee concluded, in the main body of the report: It found that Galloway's use of parliamentary resources to support his work on the Mariam Appeal \\"went beyond what was reasonable\\" and \\"we recommend that he apologise to the House, and be suspended from its service for a period of 18 actual sitting days.\\" Galloway's suspension was not intended to be immediate, and he was given the opportunity to defend himself in front of the committee members in the House of Commons on 23 July 2007. During the debate, Galloway repeatedly called into question the motives of the members of the Select Committee, in particular claiming that some of them were members of a political organisation named \\"Indict\\" and were persecuting him for speaking out against the Iraq War. Speaker Michael Martin warned Galloway that his accusations were not relevant to the matter at hand, but he rejected the warning and responded by saying that Martin would have to order him out of the house if he had any issue with the accusations. Martin therefore named Galloway, leading to the attending members voting to trigger his suspension from parliament that day rather than wait until after the summer recess as had been recommended. = Israel and Palestine (2005‚Äì2011) = In an interview with the American radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in September 2005, Galloway said: \\"This is the thing about Zionism. It has nothing to do with Jewishness. Some of the biggest Zionists in the world are not Jews. These people have used Jewish people. [...] They created the conditions in the Arab countries and in some European countries to stampede Jewish people out of the countries that they had been living in for many hundreds of years and stampede them into the Zionist state.\\" During an interview for Al Jazeera television on 17 November 2005, he said his election as MP earlier in the year was \\"despite all the efforts made by the British government, the Zionist movement and the newspapers and news media which are controlled by Zionism\\". In Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England, Anthony Julius cites this interview as one example of Galloway pandering to the antisemitic prejudices of his audience. According to Julius, Galloway merely refers to the \\"right-wing press\\" in the British media, whereas he has the habit of adding the word \\"Zionist\\" when speaking on television in the Arab world. A few years later, in a May 2009 speech given at a meeting in Westminster, Galloway said: \\"I do not agree with the argument that there is a shadowy Jewish influence. Israel is doing what America wants it to do and to argue otherwise is to go down the dark tunnel of racist antisemitism\\". At a 22 July 2006 demonstration (and later in a Socialist Worker op-ed), Galloway stated that \\"Hizbollah has never been a terrorist organisation. It is the legitimate national resistance movement of Lebanon\\", on the basis that they are, in his opinion, \\"freedom fighters\\".Julius, p. 574. Julius quotes from Galloway's Socialist Worker article. In addition: \\"I glorify the Hezbollah national resistance movement, and I glorify the leader of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah\\". In 2009, Galloway received a Palestinian passport from Hamas leader Ismail Haniya. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the European Union, and the US. During the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, also known as Operation Cast Lead, Galloway commented in his speech at an event in Trafalgar Square on 3 January 2009: \\"Today, the Palestinian people in Gaza are the new Warsaw Ghetto, and those who are murdering them are the equivalent of those who murdered the Jews in Warsaw in 1943\\". Jonathan Freedland in The Guardian thought \\"the effect of repeating, again and again, that Israel is a Nazi state\\" was, potentially, an incitement to attack Jews because the comparison with Nazis as \\"the embodiment of evil\\" implies that \\"the only appropriate response is hate\\". Sigrid Rausing in the New Statesman wrote: \\"The claim of moral equivalence is dangerous, not because it exaggerates the horror of Gaza (the reality of that bombardment was probably worse than we can really imagine), but because it minimises the horror of the Holocaust.\\" = Viva Palestina aid convoys = In response to the 2008‚Äì09 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict Galloway instigated the Viva Palestina aid convoy to the Gaza Strip in January 2009. \\"There is a kind of intifada among the youth. They are determined to act\\", he told Cole Moreton writing for The Independent, adding, \\"We say, 'Don't be lured by the siren voices of separatism and extremism ‚Äì join with us and express your anger politically, in a way that will be peaceful, non-violent, and not cost you your life, but will not cost other people their lives either\\". By mid-February, the organisation claimed to have raised over ¬£1,000,000 for humanitarian aid in four weeks, although the Charity Commission later found the true figure to be ¬£180,000. On 14 February 2009, Galloway and hundreds of volunteers launched the convoy comprising approximately 120 vehicles intended for use in the Strip, including a fire engine donated by the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), 12 ambulances, a boat and trucks full of medicines, tools, clothes, blankets and gifts for children. The 5,000-mile route passed through Belgium, France, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. The convoy arrived in Gaza on 9 March, accompanied by approximately 180 extra trucks of aid donated by Libya's Gaddafi Foundation. On 10 March 2009, Galloway announced at a press conference in Gaza City attended by several senior Hamas officials: \\"We are giving you now 100 vehicles and all of their contents, and we make no apology for what I am about to say. We are giving them to the elected government of Palestine\\", adding that he would personally donate three cars and ¬£25,000 to Hamas organisation \\"Prime Minister\\" Ismail Haniya. On 8 April 2009, Galloway joined Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic to launch Viva Palestina US. A third Viva Palestina convoy began travelling at the end of 2009. On 8 January 2010, Galloway and his colleague Ron McKay were deported from Egypt immediately following their entry from Gaza. They had been attempting to help take about 200 aid trucks into the Gaza Strip. They were driven by the police to the airport and placed on a plane bound for London. The Foreign Ministry of Egypt released a statement reading: \\"George Galloway is considered persona non grata and will not be allowed to enter into Egypt again\\". Shortly after his deportation, Galloway said, \\"It is a badge of honour to be deported by a dictatorship\\" and \\"I've been thrown out of better joints than that.\\" Viva Palestina was registered as a charity in April 2009 but, following its continued non-submission of accounts, ceased to be recognised as a charitable organisation in November 2013. It was taken over by the Charity Commission in October 2014, which appointed an accountant to oversee the group because of the concerns over its financial management. = Support for the Iranian government = Galloway has worked for the Iranian state-run satellite television channel, Press TV since 2008. During an event at the London School of Economics in March 2011, he said: \\"Because I don‚Äôt believe that the government of Iran is a dictatorship I have no problem about working for Press TV in London which is a British owned television station. I‚Äôm not responsible for the government of Ahmedinijad. I‚Äôm not responsible for the leadership of Press TV\\". Galloway also said: \\"There are many things wrong with Iran. One thing they do have is elections. They elected a president that you or I might not have voted for but I am in no doubt that Ahmadinejad won the presidential election\\" held in 2009. (See Television presenter below.) Galloway asserted on The Wright Stuff chat show (13 March 2008) that the executed boyfriend of gay Iranian asylum seeker Mehdi Kazemi was executed for \\"sex crimes\\" rather than for being gay. Galloway also stated on The Wright Stuff that the case of gay rights in Iran was being used by supporters of a war with Iran. Scott Long, writing in The Guardian on 31 March, criticised Galloway's claim that \\"homosexuals are not executed in Iran, just rapists,\\" pointing out that current law in the country stipulates that \\"Penetrative sex acts between men can bring death on the first conviction.\\" Gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, writing in The Guardian on 26 March, wrote that Galloway's \\"passionate opposition to a war against Iran, which I share, seems to have clouded his judgement\\" and \\"his claim that lesbian and gay people are not at risk of execution in Iran is refuted by every reputable human rights organisation, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and the International Lesbian and Gay Association\\". In August 2010, on his Press TV programme The Real Deal, Galloway interviewed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, following Galloway's participation in a conference for expatriate Iranians whose expenses were paid by Iran's government. Concerning the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian woman convicted of adultery and sentenced to stoning, which he described as \\"the so-called stoning case\\". Galloway said of Ashtiani's sentence during the interview: \\"Every so often an issue comes along which is seized upon by the enemies of Iran and it becomes a heavy problem and magnified...\\". Unattributed in the online source, but Khorsandi was the other individual involved in the non-violent incident with Galloway which is mentioned. According to Martin Fletcher in The Times, Ahmadinejad gave \\"mendacious answers\\" which \\"went unchallenged by his obsequious interlocutor\\". Galloway told Ahmadinejad: \\"I have police protection in London from the Iranian opposition because of my support for your election campaign\\" in 2009. \\"I mention this so you know where I'm coming from.\\"  Political career since 2012  = Bradford West by-election, 2012 = After the resignation of Labour MP Marsha Singh due to ill health, Galloway returned to parliament at the March 2012 Bradford West by-election in an unexpected landslide result, with Galloway calling it \\"the most sensational victory in British political history.\\" (subscription required) His 36% swing, defeating the Labour candidate Imran Hussain, was amongst the largest in modern British political history. Jeremy Corbyn, then a backbench Labour MP, congratulated him in a tweet. Galloway described the result as a \\"Bradford spring\\" (after the Arab Spring) and said that it showed the \\"total rejection\\" by voters of the three leading political parties. The election campaign was marked by controversy, in particular over the role of sectarianism, Baradari (clan) networks, and allegations about rivals' lack of \\"Islamic values\\" Bradford West byelection: George Galloway shakes up Labour relations, by Helen Pidd, The Guardian, 27 March 2012Michael Savage, Galloway bounces back with shock by-election win in safe Labour seat, pages 8-9, The Times, Saturday 30 March 2012 Andrew Gilligan noted in The Daily Telegraph that Galloway had won in wards with a predominantly white electorate as well as those with a majority Muslim population. Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, believed it was \\"a one- off political coup by a political one-off\\" in a seat which has not followed national trends in the past. The novelist Howard Jacobson in The Independent wrote that Galloway's \\"campaign shamelessly courted Muslim prejudice in smaller matters such as alcohol ‚Äì where Galloway painted himself as more Muslim than the Muslim Labour candidate whom he accused of liking, shock horror, a tipple.\\" Patrick Cockburn in The Independent on Sunday commented: \\"It says something about the comatose nature of British politics that an effective critic of ... failed wars like Mr Galloway, who beats an established party, should be instantly savaged as a self-serving demagogue.\\" In October 2013, the Total Politics magazine published an interview with Galloway in which he admitted: \\"I like elections more than I like serving\\", and said that he found being an MP was \\"2% terrifying, and 98% tedium.\\" In late 2013, Galloway became Leader of the Respect Party. = Julian Assange comments (August 2012) = Galloway was criticised for comments he made in August 2012 on the legal case involving Wikileaks' Julian Assange in a podcast released on YouTube. Galloway stated that \\"I think that Julian Assange's personal sexual behaviour is something sordid, disgusting, and I condemn it.\\" Swedish prosecutors wanted to question Assange in relation to the alleged sexual assault of two women, an accusation he has rejected. Galloway continued by stating: \\"But even taken at its worst, if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100 per cent true, and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don't constitute rape, at least not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it.\\" He also stated that \\"not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion.\\" He continued by saying that the allegations, even if true, \\"don't constitute rape\\" because initiating sex with someone who is asleep after a sexual encounter the previous night is not rape (one of the women, he said, \\"woke up to him [Assange] having sex with her again ‚Äì something which can happen, you know\\"). Galloway said that Assange's alleged actions amounted to no more than \\"bad sexual etiquette\\", and he did not believe the women's story anyway. According to British barrister Felicity Gerry, Galloway's description of rape is not correct under English law. Galloway's comments were criticised by anti-rape campaigners as \\"ignorant\\", \\"very unhelpful\\", \\"offensive\\" and \\"deeply concerning.\\" Then-Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob described Galloway's comments as \\"deeply disappointing and wrong.\\" (subscription required) She subsequently resigned from her post and the party. Yaqoob later stated that having to choose between Galloway's \\"anti- imperialist stances\\" and standing up for the rights of women was \\"a false choice.\\" Galloway subsequently lost his job as a columnist for Holyrood, a Scottish political magazine, for refusing to apologise for his remarks, and subject to a No platform policy by the National Union of Students. = Israel and Zionism (2012‚Äìpresent) =  Abruptly leaves meeting in Oxford, February 2013  On 20 February 2013, Galloway walked out of a publicised debate when he found out that his opponent had Israeli citizenship. The debate, hosted by Oxford University's Christ Church, was on the topic \\"Israel should withdraw immediately from the West Bank\\". Galloway interrupted his opponent, Eylon Aslan-Levy, a third-year PPE student, to ask whether he was an Israeli. When Aslan-Levy acknowledged his joint British-Israeli nationality, Galloway stood up and stated \\"I don't recognize Israel and I don't debate with Israelis\\" and left the meeting. Explaining his actions on his Facebook page, Galloway wrote: Galloway later claimed on his Twitter feed that he had been \\"misled\\", writing that \\"Christ Church never informed us that the debate would be with an Israeli. Simple.\\" The organiser, Mahmood Naji, denied Galloway's allegations in an open letter, explaining: \\"At no point during my email exchange with Mr Galloway's secretary was Eylon's nationality ever brought up or mentioned ... nor do I expect to have to tell the speaker what his opponent's nationality is.\\" Galloway's behaviour was criticised by Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge, the journalist, Joan Smith, and The Times. (subscription required) The Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) National Committee subsequently released a statement indicating that, while it does support a \\"boycott of Israel\\", the campaign rejects boycotting an individual \\"because she or he happens to be Israeli or because they express certain views.\\" In a debate at The Oxford Union the following October, Galloway compared the support of debating Israeli Zionists with that of supporting South African apartheid. Referring indirectly to his encounter with Aslan-Levy, Galloway said that he had worked with Jewish anti- apartheid activists in South Africa, adding \\"So Jews don't have to be on the side of apartheid\\". These remarks were criticised by Marc Goldberg, writing for The Times of Israel: \\"By identifying them as Jews, rather than by their chosen atheist ideology, Galloway makes it clear that the attempt by Jews to shed their Jewish skin and join the global brotherhood of the workers failed. Galloway is praising these people, but he is doing so by holding them up as examples of good Jews that other Jews should emulate, not as anti-apartheid campaigners that everyone should emulate.\\"  \\"Israel-free zone\\" speech in Leeds, August 2014  On 2 August 2014, during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, Galloway delivered a speech at a public meeting in Leeds. He said: Galloway's remarks drew sharp criticism from British politicians and Jewish leaders. Conservative MP and pro-Israel campaigner Robert Halfon described Galloway's words as an \\"ill-considered rant that will cause great offence to many\\" while adding that \\"most Bradford citizens are like British people as a whole: tolerant and decent ‚Äì and will ignore Mr Galloway‚Äôs demands, treating them with the contempt they deserve.\\" Jonathan Arkush, then vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews stated that Galloway \\"is so intolerant he can't bear to have someone with an opposing view in his town\\". Daniel Taub, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, visited Bradford on 18 August in response to an invitation, where he met with local councillors, faith leaders and community representatives. In an interview, Taub commented that his visit was proof that \\"the people of Bradford [have] sent a clear message that George Galloway does not represent them.\\" Galloway told a reporter from the BuzzFeed website: \\"As has just been proved, I cannot make Bradford an Israel-free zone, but I am certain that the Israeli ambassador was not welcome.\\" Galloway accused the councillors who had invited the ambassador of fraternising with a \\"mouthpiece for murder\\". West Yorkshire Police investigated two complaints to determine if Galloway's words constituted hate speech (British law prohibits discrimination based on nationality). Galloway was questioned under caution by the police and the matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. Galloway subsequently criticised the police investigation, describing it as \\"an absolute and despicable attempt to curb my freedom of speech\\". In October 2014, it emerged that Galloway would not be prosecuted for his comments on the grounds of \\"insufficient evidence\\", although West Yorkshire Police had \\"recorded this matter as a hate incident.\\" On 29 August 2014, Galloway was assaulted in Notting Hill by Neil Masterson, a convert to Judaism, and suffered a bruised rib and severe bruising on his head and face. Masterson was charged with religiously aggravated assault and sentenced to 16 months in prison. Released from prison in September 2015, he soon returned to jail for a month after breaking a restraining order forbidding him from contacting Galloway. Masterson was also fined for harassment. On 13 October 2014, Galloway abstained from a vote in the House of Commons formally recognising Palestine because the motion included the recognition of Israel as well. On the Respect website he advocated a one-state solution. = Alleged defamation = On 5 February 2015, Galloway appeared on BBC's Question Time discussion programme, recorded in Finchley, London, within a constituency with Britain's largest Jewish community. Galloway's appearance on this edition of the programme was the subject of much media coverage at the time because of his anti-Israel attitude.Alex Klineberg \\"George Galloway And The Jews (What Could Go Wrong?)\\", The Times of Israel (blog), 28 February 2015. Part of the debate discussed antisemitism and Galloway strongly objected to the insinuation that he holds anti-semitic views. (In 2008, Galloway said \\"the slur\\" was \\"categorically crushed\\" after he won a libel action against the Jewish station Jcom Radio following the broadcast of a parody of him shouting \\"Kill the Jews, Kill the Jews\\".) Five days later, Hadley Freeman, a columnist for The Guardian, tweeted: \\"Galloway has said and done things that cross the line from anti-Israel to antisemitic\\". Galloway said that he would issue a suit for defamation against her. Some who had re-tweeted Freeman's comment were then sent a letter from Chambers Solicitors, acting for Galloway, asking for an apology and ¬£5,000 plus Value Added Tax (then levied at 20%) to cover costs incurred by the letter. The Solicitors Regulation Authority, which looks into professional malpractice, was aware of the issue by early March 2015. Eric Heinze, Professor of Law at Queen Mary University of London, noted that an editor of the Media Lens website had sent a tweet to Freeman asking if she could provide evidence for her claim that Galloway is antisemitic. Heinze wrote that \\"any example she could cite would probably persuade some and not others. Even if an overwhelming majority were unpersuaded, a highly popular opinion does not create an objectively verifiable fact.\\" See also Chambers Solicitors' conduct was the subject of a warning from the SRA a year later. Initiating a libel action must begin within a year and no formal writ was issued. = 2015 General election = During a hustings meeting in Galloway's Bradford West constituency on 8 April during the 2015 general election heated exchanges occurred between Galloway and the Labour candidate, Naz Shah. Galloway accused her of lying about her forced marriage which had been the subject of an open letter written by Shah and released to the media after her selection as a candidate. He said Shah was in error in claiming she was \\"subject to a forced marriage at the age of 15. But you were not 15. You were 16-and-a-half\\". He then produced what he said was her nikah, a Muslim marriage certificate. Shah alleged at the event that Galloway's representative in Pakistan impersonated her deceased father to acquire the nikah. Ron McKay, Galloway's spokesman, has asserted that there was no dishonesty in gaining access to the document via an intermediary in Pakistan. Labour supplied media outlets with a copy of Shah's nikah which confirms that she was 15 at the time of her forced marriage. By her own account, Shah was raped during the marriage, but in an email to Helen Pidd, The Guardians northern editor, McKay disputed whether it had been a forced marriage at all. Galloway accused Shah of favouring Israel. At one point during the campaign, Galloway tweeted a picture of Israelis waving Israeli flags with the caption \\"Thank you for electing Naz Shah\\". The image was juxtaposed with another, showing Palestinians celebrating his own supposedly imminent victory. Shah said she has participated in marches supporting the Palestinian cause. Galloway was defeated at the 2015 general election. Naz Shah won a majority of 11,420 votes over him, reversing the majority of 10,000 votes he had gained at the by- election three years earlier. On 10 May 2015, Galloway announced an intention to challenge the result, alleging that false statements and malpractice related to postal votes during the campaign meant that the result of the election should be set aside, but did not do so. The Fawcett Society expressed concern that \\"the continued opposition of the unsuccessful Respect Party candidate George Galloway, to Shah's election is the culmination of a sexist electoral campaign by Galloway\\". In July 2015, Jeremy Corbyn said he thought \\"...the tactics he used against our candidate, were appalling. I was quite shocked; it was appalling.\\" It emerged in January 2017 that Galloway's reimbursed expense claim for the rent of his constituency office in Bradford West has been forwarded by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to the Metropolitan Police, which was then at the early assessment stage. = London mayoral campaign (2015‚Äì16) = During his unsuccessful 2015 general election campaign to be re-elected for Bradford West, Galloway announced that he would stand in the election for London mayor in 2016 if he lost, an intention he confirmed on Twitter on 28 May. Dave Hill, writing for The Guardian in November 2015, accused Galloway of making \\"cutting personal attacks\\" about the Labour candidate Sadiq Khan, a Muslim whom \\"Galloway [...] appears to consider [...] an inadequate practitioner of his faith\\" (a reference to Galloway's remark that Khan held the Quran in his left, not right, hand, and it \\"wasn‚Äôt missed by people who care about these things\\"). In the final result, Galloway came seventh with 37,007 (1.4%) first preference votes. After second preference were accounted for, Sadiq Khan became mayor of London. = Other developments (2015‚Äìpresent) = George Galloway poster in Longsight In July 2015, Galloway endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He tweeted: \\"Congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn MP and good fortune in the labour leadership contest. If he wins it will change everything...\\" He also said that he would become a Labour Party member \\"pretty damn quick\\" if Corbyn was elected as Labour leader. Less than a week after Corbyn became leader, a Labour spokeswoman told The Times: \\"George Galloway has not applied to rejoin the Labour party and he will not be receiving an invitation.\\" Corbyn himself said in July 2015 during an interview with New Statesman editor Jason Cowley that he was appalled at the tactics Galloway used while defending his seat against Naz Shah (Labour) during the general election. In an interview to The Huffington Post journalist Paul Waugh in December 2015, Corbyn said that Galloway's readmission to the party was a decision not within his powers. Following Ken Livingstone's much criticised comments in late April 2016 concerning Adolf Hitler and Zionism, Galloway supported Livingstone's argument. Galloway disputed that Livingstone's comments were antisemitic. \\"The Israel lobby has just destroyed the Labour Party\\", he tweeted in May 2016. \\"It is an amazing achievement\\". In July 2016, Galloway endorsed Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said: \\"If Corbyn wins a big victory ‚Äì and I think he will ‚Äì then that should be, and it's important that it is, the final burial of Blair and Blairism.\\" The Respect Party \\"voluntarily deregistered\\" from the Electoral Commission on 18 August 2016. It was announced on 21 March 2017 that Galloway was standing as an independent candidate at the Manchester Gorton by-election set for 4 May, following the death of Sir Gerald Kaufman in February. Gorton had been one of Labour's safest seats at the 2015 general election. The by- election was cancelled following the announcement of the 2017 snap general election being held on 8 June. Galloway subsequently transferred his candidacy to the general election. At the election, Labour easily retained the seat; Galloway came a distant third with 5.7% of the vote. Meanwhile, on 20 June 2016, Galloway lost a libel action brought by Aisha Ali-Khan, his assistant for six months in 2012. He had claimed that she had pursued a \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign against him and the Respect Party, and had slept at his house with her then-husband. The case was heard in the High Court. His counsel apologised on Galloway's behalf, and accepted that he had made \\"defamatory accusations\\". Ali-Khan will receive a \\"five-figure sum\\" in damages and her legal costs. As part of the settlement of their libel claim, both Galloway and Ali-Khan gave undertakings not to make any further public statement about the litigation or to defame each other. In 2018 Galloway brought an action that Ali-Khan had breached this undertaking 26 times, which Ali-Khan admitted, and in April 2018 the High Court imprisoned Ali-Khan for 12 weeks for contempt of court, describing her action as \\"deliberate, flagrant, persistent and inexcusable\\". Ali-Khan had been found guilty of contempt of court on a previous occasion. Previously, during 2017, Ali-Khan had filed a petition for Galloway's bankruptcy. In the 2019 general election, Galloway contested the Parliamentary seat of West Bromwich East as an independent, describing himself as supportive of Corbyn's leadership but also supportive of Brexit. He came 6th with 489 votes. On 14 December, Galloway launched the Workers Party of Britain, which describes itself as \\"economically radical with an independent foreign policy\\" and \\"unequivocally committed to class politics\\". Galloway is the party's leader.Workers Party of Britain Electoral Commission Register of Political Parties  Other domestic and international issues  = Syria =  Support for Bashar al-Assad  Galloway expressed support for the Syrian presence in Lebanon five months before it ended, telling the Lebanese Daily Star in August 2008: \\"Syrian troops in Lebanon maintain stability and protect the country from Israel\\". In the same article he expressed his opposition to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, which urged the Lebanese Government to establish control over all its territory. When Syria did withdraw from Lebanon, Galloway objected and said the neighbouring states presence had been entirely \\"legal\\"; Christopher Hitchens, citing the Taif Accords of 1989, disputed his comment. Of Bashar al-Assad, and the country he leads, he said during a visit to the University of Damascus in November 2005: \\"For me he is the last Arab ruler, and Syria is the last Arab country. It is the fortress of the remaining dignity of the Arabs\\". and a \\"breath of fresh air,\\" Galloway again praised the government of Assad in a leaked 2010 email to Assad's advisor Bouthaina Shaaban when asking for help in a Viva Palestina convoy and reminded her of previous help from the Syrian government for the campaign. In the correspondence, leaked by the Anonymous hacking group, she responded: \\"God bless your amazing efforts and I will be honoured to be part and parcel of it\\". \\"I knew that I could rely on you and the last Arab country in this historic endeavour\\", he wrote in response. Galloway said in a July 2011 interview on Hezbollah's Al-Manar station: \\"Bashar Assad wants reform and change, to realise the aspirations of his people\\". In the early stages of the Civil War (when Assad was reported as \\"perpetrating massacres of his own people\\"), opponents were \\"trying to pressure Syria and President Assad because of the good things that he did, such as supporting Palestinian and Lebanese resistance and rejecting to surrender to Israel\\".  Syrian civil war (2011‚Äìpresent)  A month later, in an August 2011 piece for the Al Jazeera website, Galloway wrote he \\"was never close to the Syrian regime\\" and acknowledged its \\"authoritarian character, its police state mentality\\", and the \\"rampant\\" corruption \\"much of it concentrated around his [Assad's] own family\\". \\"I fully support the Syrian revolution\\", Galloway told Christopher Silvester in November 2012. \\"I want to see the end of all the dictatorships in the Middle East and I hope that it can be achieved peacefully. But if peaceful change is not possible, then violent change is inevitable. I wholly support the Syrian people's demands for democratic government. I just don't support armed intervention in Syria, any more than I supported it in any other country in the region\\". In January 2013, Galloway criticised David Cameron's government for arming Syrian rebels linked to Salafi jihadism. Following the Ghouta chemical attack on 21 August 2013, Galloway speculated on his Press TV show that the responsibility for the atrocity lay with al-Qaeda and the rebels in Syria who had been provided with the weapons by Israel. During his speech in the House of Commons debate about the crisis in Syria on 29 August 2013, Galloway was asked about this broadcast by the Conservative MP Matthew Offord. In response, he asserted that he had \\"said no such thing\\", and was accused of lying. In the debate Galloway had stated \\"It is not that the regime is not bad enough to do it; everybody knows that it is bad enough to do it. The question is: is it mad enough to do it?\\". In a House of Commons debate on 26 September 2014 he opposed military action by the west against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgency group, which he called a \\"death cult\\", and instead advocated military action from the regional powers. Galloway told Prospect magazine in February 2016: \\"I support the decision of the Russian government to come to the aid of the government in Syria because whatever faults it [the Syrian government] may have, whatever crimes it has committed, they are considerably fewer than the crimes committed by IS or would be committed by IS were they to come to power\\". = Latin America = He has been an advocate for the Venezuelan government of Hugo Ch√°vez and, in his Fidel Castro Handbook, for the former Cuban leader. \\"You were the greatest man I ever met Comandante Fidel\\", he tweeted when Castro died in November 2016. = Scotland and the UK = Galloway has long supported devolution for Scotland, but opposes Scottish independence. In the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum, held on 18 September 2014, Galloway was dismissive of the official Better Together campaign because it also involved Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, and he believed its leader, Alistair Darling, to be ineffective. \\"My case isn't that Scotland couldn't be independent, but shouldn't\\", The Sunday Times quoted him as saying. (subscription required) Galloway's argument against independence was based on a defence of \\"class\\" over \\"nationality\\". He told Serena Kutchinsky in an interview for Prospect magazine: \\"If we lose this vote the possibility of a real Labour government, or any kind of Labour government, in the rest of UK will be gone\\". He has, however, argued in favour of greater Scottish devolution. In 2013, Galloway began a series of public meetings in Scotland using the slogan of \\"Just Say Naw.\\" On 11 September 2014, Galloway took part in Scotland Decides: The Big, Big Debate, an independence debate held in Glasgow and broadcast by the BBC during the evening. In July 2020, Galloway co-founded and established a cross-party Scottish unionist political organisation and political coalition called Alliance 4 Unity, and its goal is to try of taking down the Scottish National Party and Scottish nationalism in general for the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, by tactically vote for any Scottish unionist candidates in second place on each Scottish electoral regions. = Saudi Arabia and India = Galloway has criticised Britain's close ties with Saudi Arabia and British involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In 2017, he said: \\"It is a country with no democracy or freedom of any kind. It is a country that exports terrorism around the world and funds terrorism and extremism around the world. We should have nothing whatsoever to do with them.\\" Galloway said the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \\"has blood on his hands\\". Modi was accused of initiating and condoning the 2002 Gujarat riots against India's Muslim minority. = European Union = At a rally at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre on 19 February 2016, Galloway endorsed the Grassroots Out (GO) campaign which advocated the \\"Leave\\" option in the European Union membership referendum. He was introduced by UKIP leader Nigel Farage as a \\"special guest\\" who is \\"without doubt one of the greatest orators in this country, he is a towering figure on the left of British politics\\". Galloway's presence at the rally prompted some of those present to leave. Labour MP Kate Hoey, who was involved with GO, defended Galloway's participation. \\"George ended up getting a hugely favourable response to what he said\\". Responding to criticism of his association with Farage, Galloway tweeted: \\"We are not pals. We are allies in one cause. Like Churchill and Stalin\\". On 17 April 2019 Galloway announced he would support the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage in the May 2019 European Parliament election. In an announcement on Twitter, he said that \\"given the nature of Labour's Euro-fanatic candidates list and the crucial juncture we have reached in the fight for the full implementation of the Brexit referendum result and for one-time only I will be supporting Nigel Farage in next months elections.\\"  Television presenter  In August 2009, editions of Galloway's programmes The Real Deal and Comment programme for Press TV, a London-based news channel controlled by the government of Iran, were found by the British broadcasting regulator Ofcom to have breached its broadcasting code on impartiality. After Press TV lost its Ofcom licence in 2012, according to Galloway, the Iranian broadcaster owed him ¬£40,000, leading to his company Miranda Media entering compulsory liquidation in 2013 because of unpaid tax. Reportedly, the owed payment amounts to ¬£100,000, although Galloway disputed this in February 2016. Miranda Media, in which income from Galloway's media work was deposited, was established in September 2007 under a month before a law came into force allowing directors to receive loans from their own companies, a facility Galloway used on multiple occasions. Shortly after its foundation in June 2012, Galloway became a presenter with the Al Mayadeen television station where he presents \\"Kalima Hurra\\" ( meaning free word). Al Mayadeen reportedly has connections with Iran and the Assad government in Syria, and has been accused of supporting the Assad government, a claim Galloway has rejected. In November 2013, Galloway and his wife Gayatri began to present Sputnik for the RT network, a Russian government-backed station formerly known as Russia Today. He is a regular contributor to RT's other programming. Among the notable guests on Galloway's RT programmes have been Gilad Atzmon, and Shlomo Sand. In an overview of the broadcasting organisations Galloway works for, Tom Rogan in the National Review in April 2014 described him as being \\"a Western puppet for tyranny's propagandists\\". In the register of members' financial interests published at the end of January 2015, Galloway disclosed that he had earned ¬£293,450 from his television broadcasting in the previous year and had received almost ¬£70,000 in travelling expenses and hotel stays. See the itemised list in For the period November 2013 to February 2015, Galloway was paid ¬£100,000 for his appearances on RT, the highest payment to any British politician working for the channel.  Radio presenter  Galloway began to broadcast on Talkradio (which launched in March 2016 as a sister station to Talksport) in June 2016. Amongst his many monologues, he said that if Scotland were to leave the UK and join the EU \\"it would not be a good thing for his fellow countrymen\\", and has condemned the BBC as a \\"national disgrace\\".Amy Southall If Scotland leaves the UK and joins the EU it can only lead to misery, says George Galloway. Talkradio, 8 March 2017. Luke Dolan George Galloway: 'I consider the BBC to be a national disgrace'. Talkradio, 19 July 2017. Concerning the Iraq War, he said he would not rest \\"until Tony Blair is brought to justice\\", and in 2019 announced plans to try and prosecute Alastair Campbell.Luke Dolan George Galloway: 'I wont rest until Tony Blair is brought to justice, no matter how long it takes‚Äô. Talkradio, 17 July 2017.Holly Pine George Galloway to launch legal battle against Alastair Campbell. Talkradio, 29 May 2019. In June 2019, after Liverpool Football Club had defeated Tottenham Hotspur Football Club in the Champions League final, Galloway congratulated the people of Liverpool and tweeted \\"No #Isra√´l flags on the Cup!\\". He said that this referred to a number of Tottenham fans who were flying the flag of Israel in the crowd, showing \\"an affiliation to a 'racist state'\\". Tottenham Hotspur accused Galloway of \\"blatant anti-Semitism\\" and Talkradio sacked him saying the broadcaster \\"does not tolerate anti-Semitic views\\".  Personal life  = Marriages and children = Galloway has been married four times. In 1979, he married Elaine Fyffe, with whom he has a daughter. The couple separated in 1987 and divorced in 1999. In 1994, Galloway married Dr. Amineh Abu-Zayyad, a biologist of Palestinian origin, in an Islamic ceremony; a civil ceremony followed around 2000. Abu-Zayyad was granted a divorce in February 2009, after an estrangement of several years, on the grounds of \\"unreasonable behaviour\\"; her petition was not contested. Galloway married Rima Husseini, his former researcher, in a non-legally binding Islamic ceremony in 2005. With Husseini, who is originally from Lebanon, Galloway had two sons. On 31 March 2012, he married his fourth wife, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, in an Islamic ceremony in Amsterdam. The initial event was followed by a traditional Javanese wedding ceremony in Sumatra and a civil marriage at the House of Commons in September 2012. Gayatri (born c. 1984) is an anthropologist, born in the Netherlands of Indonesian descent, who works as a consultant for a Dutch research firm. The couple had a son in summer 2014 and a daughter in 2017. On the 8th of August 2020 Galloway announced the birth of his sixth child, a girl. = Religion = He stated at a March 2012 rally \\"We stand for justice and haqq\\" and \\"A Muslim is somebody who is not afraid of earthly power but who fears only the Judgment Day. I‚Äôm ready for that, I‚Äôm working for that and it's the only thing I fear.\\" According to Jemima Khan, writing for the New Statesman in April 2012, Galloway became a Muslim around 2000, but had not advertised this fact. Galloway denied that the ceremony had taken place: \\"I have never attended any such ceremony in Kilburn, Karachi or Kathmandu. It is simply and categorically untrue.\\" He said his religious beliefs are a \\"personal matter\\".

As WTCG evolved into SuperStation WTBS, Tush became a jack of many trades at the station, voicing over station promos and identifications, appearing in commercials, hosting movies and reading the news at 3 am, about which Turner jokingly commented, \\"we have a 100% share at this time\\". Tush would often read the news with his co-anchor Rex, a German Shepherd in shirt and tie. Because of the cult popularity of the satirical overnight newscasts, Turner gave Tush his own comedy sketch show in 1980, simply called Tush. The cast included such newcomers as SNLs Jan Hooks and Bonnie and Terry Turner (SNL writers and co- creators of 3rd Rock from the Sun and That '70s Show). The hour-long program aired at 12:05 am Eastern time on Friday and Saturday nights. Although the show ceased production one year later, reruns aired through May 28, 1983. The following week its old timeslot was filled by a six-hour music video program, Night Tracks. Ironically, though, later that year, Tush made a comedic appearance in a Night Tracks sales presentation video playing an investigative reporter.Bill Tush in a Night Tracks Sales Presentation clip from 1983 on YouTube Having no further work at WTBS for him, Turner eventually dispatched Tush to Hollywood to host a new entertainment show, People Now, on Turner's relatively new CNN channel. Eventually, Tush became senior entertainment correspondent for CNN in 1993 and relocated to New York City to host Showbiz Today. Tush retired from Turner Broadcasting System to pursue other interests, including writing and producing, in 2003. Tush returned to Atlanta, where he originally obtained fame. Tush made a rare public appearance September 12, 2009, at Atlanta's Variety Playhouse to introduce Darryl Rhoades & the Hahavishnu Orchestra Celebration. In 2014 Tush travelled to Nigeria to help launch a television station; when he returned to Atlanta in 2015, he was hired as the manager of a small multiplex movie theater in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, where he continued to work after the theater changed hands and was renovated to include a full bar and restaurant.

The assault occurred as Jewish militia sought to relieve the blockade of Jerusalem during the civil war that preceded the end of British rule in Palestine.Morris 2008, pp. 126‚Äì128. UAR) stamp issued to commemorate the Deir Yassin massacre. The villagers put up stiffer resistance than the Jewish militias had expected and they suffered casualties. The village fell after house-to-house fighting. Some of the Palestinian Arabs were killed in the course of the battle, others while trying to flee or surrender. A number of prisoners were executed, some after being paraded in West Jerusalem.Kana'ana and Zeitawi, The Village of Deir Yassin, Destroyed Village Series, Berzeit University Press, 1988.Yavne to HIS- ID, April 12, 1948, IDFA 5254/49//372 in Morris 2008, p. 127. In addition to the killing and widespread looting, there may have been cases of mutilation and rape. Despite an original boast by the victors that 254 had been killed, modern scholarship puts the death toll at far fewer. Palestinian historian Aref al-Aref counted 117 victims, seven in combat and the rest in their homes.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, Fayard Paris 2007 vol.3 p.75 The number of wounded is estimated to between 12 and 50. Five of the attackers were killed and a dozen wounded. The massacre was condemned by the leadership of the Haganah‚Äîthe Jewish community's main paramilitary force‚Äî by the area's two chief rabbis and famous Jews abroad like Albert Einstein, Jessurun Cardozo, Hannah Arendt, Sidney Hook and others. The Jewish Agency for Israel sent Jordan's King Abdullah a letter of apology, which he rebuffed. He held them responsible for the massacre, and warned about \\"terrible consequences\\" if similar incidents occurred elsewhere.Benny Morris, The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews, p. 128. The massacre became a pivotal event in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict for its demographic and military consequences. The narrative was embellished and used by various parties to attack each other‚Äîby the Palestinians against Israel; by the Haganah to play down their own role in the affair; and by the Israeli left to accuse the Irgun and Lehi of blackening Israel's name by violating the Jewish principle of purity of arms.Gelber 2006, p. 307.*For \\"purity of arms\\", see Walzer, Michael. \\"War and Peace in the Jewish Tradition\\", and Nardin, Terry. \\"The Comparative Ethics of War and Peace\\", in Nardin, Terry (ed.). The Ethics of War and Peace. Princeton University Press, pp. 107‚Äì108, 260. News of the killings sparked terror among Palestinians, frightening them to flee their homes in the face of Jewish troop advances and it strengthened the resolve of Arab governments to intervene, which they did five weeks later. Four days after the Deir Yassin massacre, on April 13, a revenge attack on the Hadassah medical convoy in Jerusalem ended in a massacre killing 78 Jews, most of whom were the medical staff.Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, O Jerusalem!, 1972, pp. 284‚Äì285, Simon & Schuster, New York; Background =Political and military situation= The attack on Deir Yassin took place a few months after the United Nations had proposed on that Palestine be divided into an Arab state and a Jewish one. The Arabs rejected the proposal, and civil war broke out. In the months leading up to the end of British rule, in a phase of the civil war known as \\"The Battle of [the] Roads\\", the Arab League-sponsored Arab Liberation Army (ALA)‚Äîcomposed of Palestinians and other Arabs‚Äîattacked Jewish traffic on major roads in an effort to isolate the Jewish communities from each other.For Battle of the Roads, see Kagan 1966, p. 52. The ALA managed to seize several strategic vantage points along the highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv‚ÄîJerusalem's sole supply route and link to the western side of the city (where 16 percent of all Jews in Palestine lived)‚Äîand began firing on convoys traveling to the city. By March 1948, the road was cut off and Jerusalem was under siege. In response, the Haganah launched Operation Nachshon to break the siege. On April 6, in an effort to secure strategic positions, the Haganah and its strike force, the Palmach, attacked al-Qastal, a village two kilometers north of Deir Yassin overlooking the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. = Irgun and Lehi militia = Israel's sixth prime minister, Menachem Begin, was Irgun leader at the time of the attack, though not present. Most of the Jewish forces that attacked Deir Yassin belonged to two extremist, underground, militias, the Irgun (Etzel, abbreviated IZL) (National Military Organization), led by Menachem Begin, and the Lehi (Fighters for the Freedom of Israel, abbreviated LHI), also known as the Stern Gang, both aligned with the right-wing revisionist Zionist movement. Often referred to as \\"revisionists\\" (or \\"dissidents\\") because their ideological alignment contrasted with the Yishuv's (Jewish community in Palestine) dominant labor Zionist movement. Formed in 1931, Irgun was a militant group that broke away from the mainstream Jewish militia, the Haganah. During the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine, in which Palestinian Arabs rose up against the British mandate authorities in protest at Jewish mass immigration into the country, Irgun's tactics had included bus and marketplace bombings, condemned by both the British and the Jewish Agency. Lehi, an Irgun splinter group, was formed in 1940 following Irgun's decision to declare a truce with the British during World War II. Lehi subsequently carried out a series of assassinations designed to force the British out of Palestine. In April 1948, it was estimated that the Irgun had 300 fighters in Jerusalem, and Lehi around 100. Both groups had committed numerous terror attacks against the British and the Arabs but Deir Yassin would be their first proper military operation and the groups were keen to show their rival the Haganah their combat prowess. It was also their first joint operation since the split in 1940. = Deir Yassin = Deir Yassin and surrounds in 1948 Deir Yassin was a Palestinian Arab village of several hundred residents, all Muslim, living in 144 houses. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that there were 400 residents; Yoav Gelber writes that there were 610, citing the British mandatory authority figures; and Begin's biographer, Eric Silver, 800 to 1,000.Gelber 2006, p. 309. The village was relatively prosperous, thanks to the excavation of limestone from its quarries, which allowed the residents to make a good living from stone-cutting. The village was situated on a hill 800 meters above sea level and two kilometers south of the Tel-Aviv highway. It bordered West Jerusalem's Jewish suburbs; Givat Shaul, an Orthodox community, just across the valley 700 meters to the northeast, and Beit HaKerem to the southeast. The closest Arab towns were Qalunya a few kilometers to the northwest and Ein Karem a few kilometers to the southwest, where the Arab Liberation Army had setup a base. Cutting through Ein Karem and Deir Yassin was the Sharafa ridge (Mount Herzl), a strategically important elevation that the Haganah had taken earlier. The only road to and from the village ran eastward passing through Givat Shaul. By most accounts, the villagers lived in peace with their Jewish neighbors, particularly those in Givat Shaul, some of whom reportedly tried to help the villagers during the Irgun-Lehi massacre. = Peace pact = On January 20, 1948, the villagers met leaders of the Givat Shaul community to form a peace pact. The Deir Yassin villagers agreed to inform Givat Shaul should Palestinian militiamen appear in the village, by hanging out certain types of laundry during the day‚Äîtwo white pieces with a black piece in the middle‚Äîand at night signaling three dots with a flashlight and placing three lanterns in a certain place. In return, patrols from Givat Shaul guaranteed safe passage to Deir Yassin residents, in vehicles or on foot, passing through their neighborhood on the way to Jerusalem.Morris 2004, p. 91. *Also see Gelber 2006, p. 308. Yoma Ben-Sasson, Haganah commander in Givat Shaul, said after the village had been captured that, \\"there was not even one incident between Deir Yassin and the Jews.\\"Milstein 1999, p. 351 The view was echoed in a secret Haganah report which stated that the village had stayed \\"faithful allies of the western [Jerusalem] sector.\\" Gelber viewed it is unlikely that the peace pact between Deir Yassin and Givat Shaul continued to hold in April, given the intensity of hostilities between the Arab and Jewish communities elsewhere. On April 4, the Haganah affiliated daily Davar reported that \\"[t]he western neighborhoods of Jerusalem, Beit Hakerem and Bayit Vagan, was attacked on Sabbath night (April 2) by fire from the direction of Deir Yassin, Ein Kerem and Colonia.\\" Over the next few days, the Jewish community at Motza and Jewish traffic on the road to Tel Aviv came under fire from the village. On April 8, Deir Yassin youth took part in the defence of the Arab village of al-Qastal, which the Jews had invaded days earlier: the names of several Deir Yassin residents appeared on a list of wounded compiled by the British Palestine police.Gelber 2006, pp. 307‚Äì318. = Arab militia = Arab militiamen had tried to set up camp in the village, leading to a firefight that saw one villager killed. Just before January 28, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni had arrived with 400 men and tried to recruit some villagers, but the elders voiced their opposition and the men moved on. The leader of the village, the mukhtar, was summoned to Jerusalem to explain to the Arab Higher Committee (AHC), the Palestinian Arab leadership, what the village's relationship was with the Jews: he told them the villagers and the Jews lived in peace. No steps were taken against him, and he was not asked to cancel the peace pact.Gelber 2006, p. 308. On February 13, an armed gang of Arabs arrived to attack Givat Shaul, but the Deir Yassin villagers saw them off, the result of which was that the gang killed all the village's sheep. On March 16, the AHC sent a delegation to the village to request that it host a group of Iraqi and Syrian irregulars to guard it. The villagers said no then, and again on April 4,Morris 2004, p. 97. though Irgun fighters said they did encounter at least two foreign militiamen during the April 9 invasion. Lapidot in his 1992 memoirs described occasional skirmishes between Deir Yassin and Givat Shaul residents, that on April 3, shots had been fired from Deir Yassin toward the Jewish villages of Bet Hakerem and Yefe Nof. He further stated that the village was defended by 100 armed men, that ditches had been dug around it, that Iraqi and Palestinian guerrillas were stationed there, and that there was a guard force stationed by the village entrance.Lapidot 1992. Morris writes that it is possible some militiamen were stationed in the village, but the evidence is far from definitive, in his view. He also notes that Begin at the time didn't mention attacks from the village or the presence of foreign militiamen as he would do years later. Gelber writes that there is no evidence of militiamen in the village and finds no reason to believe that there were any. = Witnesses = Due to the lack of technical evidence, historians' narratives of the Deir Yassin massacre are largely based on witness accounts. Either in the form of reports produced before or shortly after the attack, or in interviews conducted many years later. The following witnesses are main sources for historians: * Haganah personnel ** Meir Pa'il, 22, intelligence officer with the Palmach, who spied on Irgun and Lehi. After the war he became a politician and historian. ** Mordechai Weg, known as Yaki or Yaacov, commander of Palmach's Harel 4th brigade. He died in combat a few weeks after Deir Yassin. ** Yitzhak Levi, head of the Shai in Jerusalem. He published his memoirs Nine Measures in 1986. * Irgun fighters ** Mordechai Raanan, Irgun district commander in Jerusalem. ** Yehoshua Gorodenchik, Irgun physician whose testimony was given to the Jabotinsky archives following the war. ** Yehuda Lapidot, 19, Irgun commander, second-in-command in the attack on Deir Yassin. After the war he became an academic and in 1992 he published his memoir Besieged Jerusalem 1948: memories of an Irgun fighter. * Lehi fighters ** Ezra Yachin. * Survivors ** Fahimi Zeidan, a 12-year-old girl, testified in 1987. ** Mohamed Aref Samir, schoolteacher in Deir Yassin and later education official in Jordan. * Others ** Jacques de Reynier, a Frenchman and head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Palestine who had been staying in the country since early April. He visited Deir Yassin on April 11 and reported what he saw on April 13. Battle plans =Decision to attack= David Shaltiel, Haganah commander in Jerusalem, approved the attack.Shaltiel 1981, p. 139. Irgun and Lehi commanders approached David Shaltiel, the Haganah commander in Jerusalem, for approval. He was initially reluctant, because the villagers had signed a non-aggression pact, and suggested attacking Ein Karem instead. The Lehi and Irgun commanders complained that this would be too hard for them. Shaltiel ultimately yielded, on condition that the attackers would continue to occupy the village rather than destroying it, lest its ruins be used by Arab militias which would force the Jews to reconquer it. His approval met with resistance. Pa'il objected to violating the peace pact with the village, but Shaltiel maintained that he had no power to stop them. Pa'il said in 1998 that Levi had proposed that the inhabitants be notified, but Shaltiel had refused to endanger the operation by warning them. David Siton of Lehi claimed he also protested because the village was docile: According to Morris, it was agreed during planning meetings that the residents would be expelled. Lehi further proposed that any villagers who failed to flee should be killed to terrify the rest of the country's Arabs. Most of the fighters at the meetings, from both the Irgun and Lehi was for \\"liquidation of all the men in the village and any other force that opposed us, whether it be old people, women, or children.\\" According to Lapidot, the Irgun high command, including Menachem Begin, objected and the troops were specifically ordered not to kill women, children, or prisoners. . *For Begin's opposition to the proposals, see Statement of Yehuda Lapidot [Irgun], Jabotinsky Archives, Tel Aviv, cited in Silver 1984, pp. 90‚Äì91. Lapidot in his memoirs claimed that, in the view of Irgun and Lehi, Deir Yassin posed a threat to Jewish neighborhoods and the main road to the coastal plain. He further claimed that an assault on the village would show the Arabs that the Jews intended to fight for Jerusalem. In earlier testimony he had claimed that \\"the reason was mainly economic ... to capture booty\\" to supply Irgun and Lehi's bases with. = Pre-attack briefing = Jewish military briefing at Deir Yassin Mordechai Raanan with Menachem Begin during a visit to Washington, D.C. About 130 fighters participated in the attack of which 70 came from Irgun, according to Morris. Hogan estimates that there were 132 men; 72 from Irgun, 60 from Lehi, and some women serving in supporting roles. They met for briefings on April 8, a few hours before the attack began. Lehi would stage its attack from Givat Shaul, and the Irgun from Beit HaKerem. Lapidot writes that the mood at the Irgun meeting was festive. It was the first time a large number of underground fighters had met openly, and the collaboration between the groups increased their sense of solidarity. They chose a password to reflect the mood, \\"Ahdut Lohemet\\" (\\"Fighters' Solidarity\\"). This was the phrase that would signal the start of the attack. According to Lapidot, Raanan stressed that women, children, and the elderly must not be harmed, and that the villagers were to be warned by loudspeaker to give them a chance to escape. The road to Ayn Karim would be left open so they could head there. The scant arsenal was divided as follows. The Irgunists got one of the three Bren machine gun, Lehi got the other and the third was used for the loudspeaker vehicle. Each rifleman got 40 bullets, each person with a Sten gun 100 bullets, and each fighter two hand grenades. The stretcher bearers only got clubs. They had no communication equipment. Despite their confidence, the fighters, most of them teenagers, were by all accounts ill-prepared, untrained, and inexperienced.  Day of the attack  = Invasion = Irgun statement in Hebrew about the attackLapidot 1992. English translation After the briefing, the fighters were driven to their assigned positions. The Irgun force approached Deir Yassin from the east and south, arriving at the edge of the village at about 4:30 AM. The Lehi force was supposed to be taking their positions around the village at the same time but were in fact late. The Irgun commanders had no way to contact them, and had to assume they were on schedule. Following the Lehi group where Pa'il and a photographer. He wanted to observe the revisionists fighting capabilities. Fighting began at 04:45 when a village sentry spotted the Irgunists moving in, and called out in Arabic, \\"Mahmoud\\". One of the Irgun fighters thought he had said \\"Ahdut\\", part of the password. He responded with the second half of the password, \\"Lohemet\\". According to an Irgun fighter, the Arabs shouted \\"Yahud\\" (Jews) and opened fire.Milstein 1998, p. 358. A gunbattle then broke out. The Irgun force came under fire from a three-man village guard in a concrete pillbox, and from houses in the village as residents scrambled for their rifles to join the battle, firing out of windows. The Irgun men replied with withering fire towards the pillbox and into the village. When the Lehi force, which was late, finally arrived at the other end of the village to begin the attack, the fighting was already underway. The Lehi force was spearheaded by an armored vehicle with a loudspeaker.Sources diverge on whether the armored vehicle was a \\"truck\\" or a \\"car\\". The plan was to drive the vehicle into the center of the village and blare a warning in Arabic, urging the residents to run towards Ein Karim. Instead, the vehicle halted or overturned at a ditch directly in front of the village, and as it struggled to get out, the Arabs opened fire on it. Whether a warning was read out on the loudspeaker is unknown. Yachin stated that it was: Abu Mahmoud, a survivor, told the BBC in 1998 that he did hear the warning.Morris 2005. *For Abu Mahmoud's statement, see BBC 1998. Aref Samir stated that he didn't hear the warning: If a warning was read out it was obscured due to the sounds of heavy gunfire and few, if any, villagers heard it. Irgun and Lehi commanders had believed the residents would flee, but the fighters encountered resistance. The residents did not realize that the point of the attack was conquest, thinking it was just a raid, and failed to run while they had the chance. The villagers' sniper fire from higher positions in the west, especially from the mukhtar's house, effectively contained the attack. Some Lehi units went for help from the Haganah's Camp Schneller in Jerusalem. The men had no experience of attacking an Arab village in daylight, and lacked support weapons. Following an order from Benzion Cohen, the Irgun commander, they resorted to house-to-house attacks, throwing grenades into every house before charging in and spraying the rooms with automatic fire.Gelber 2006, p. 310. *For the reference to Ben Zion Cohen, see BBC 1998. The Lehi forces slowly advanced, engaging in house-to-house fighting. In addition to Arab resistance, they also faced other problems; weapons failed to work, a few tossed hand grenades without pulling the pin, and a Lehi unit commander, Amos Kenan, was wounded by his own men.McGowan 1998, p. 35ff. Yachin in an interview decades later, claimed: \\"To take a house, you had either to throw a grenade or shoot your way into it. If you were foolish enough to open doors, you got shot down‚Äîsometimes by men dressed up as women, shooting out at you in a second of surprise.\\" Meanwhile, the Irgun force on the other side of the village was also having a difficult time. It took about two hours of house-to-house fighting to reach the center of the village. = Irgun considers retreat = Irgun radio broadcasts at the time of the Deir Yassin massacre By 7:00 a.m., as many as four attackers had been killed. Ben- Zion Cohen, the top Irgun commander, was shot in the leg and his place was taken by Lapidot. Irgun commander Yehuda Segal was shot in the stomach and later died. Irgun commanders relayed a message to the Lehi camp that they were considering retreating. Lehi commanders relayed back that they had already entered the village and expected victory soon. Frustration over the lack of progress and Arab resistance was taken out on the prisoners which they began executing. Cohen reported that that \\"we eliminated every Arab we came across up to that point.\\" Yehuda Feder of Lehi a few days after the attack wrote that about machine gunning three Arab prisoners: \\"In the village I killed an armed Arab man and two Arab girls of 16 or 17 who were helping the Arab who was shooting. I stood them against a wall and blasted them with two rounds from the Tommy gun.\\" Gorodenchik claimed that 80 prisoners were killed: Aref Samir in 1981 stated: Gelber writes that Gorodenchik's figure was inflated and has not been corroborated. Kan'ana write that 25 villagers were executed and thrown into the quarry after the battle, which Gelber regards as accurate.Gelber 2006, p. 312. According to survivor testimony, as many as 33 civilians were executed in the morning. The large number of Jewish wounded was a problem. Zalman Meret called the Magen David Adom station for an ambulance. The fighters took beds out of the houses, and doors off their hinges, laid the wounded on them, and ordered Arab women and old men to carry the injured to the ambulance in order to discourage Arab fire. According to Gorodenchik, the Arab stretcher bearers were nevertheless hit by fire. The ambulance left with some of the wounded at 8:00 am. When the attackers ran low on ammunition, Lehi people went to Camp Schneller to request ammunition from the Haganah. Weg wasn't in the camp and his deputy Moshe Eren refused to make a decision. When Weg returned he gave them 3,000 bullets. They also asked for weapons which Weg refused them. Haganah squads also provided covering fire, firing on villagers fleeing south towards Ein Karem and preventing any Arab reinforcements from reaching the village. = Use of explosives = The doors of the houses in Deir Yassin were made of iron and not wood, as the attackers had thought, and they had difficulty breaking into the houses. Lapidot sent word to Raanan, who was watching the progress from Givat Shaul, to send explosives. Soon afterward, Raanan and his aides appeared with knapsacks filled with TNT. The Irgun fighters were instructed to dynamite houses as they advanced. Under covering fire, the dynamite teams advanced and set charges to houses. In certain instances, the force of the explosions destroyed entire parts of houses, burying the Arabs inside them. A total of 15 houses were blown up.Bell, Bowyer J.: Terror out of Zion (1976), Zeidan recalled hiding with her family and another when the door was blasted open. The attackers took them outside where they executed an already wounded man and one of his daughters. Two of her own family members were then killed: \\"Then they called my brother Mahmoud and shot him in our presence, and when my mother screamed and bent over my brother (she was carrying my little sister Khadra who was still being breastfed) they shot my mother too.\\" Whether houses were blown up or not is disputed. American historian Matthew Hogan claims that they weren't. He cites Pa'il who in his testimony said he was sure that \\"[n]o house in Deir Yassin was bombed\\" and independent visitors to the village, following its fall, who didn't mention structural damage. Among them Eliyahu Arbel, a Haganah operations officer, who recalled finding dead inside the houses but \\"with no signs of battle and not as a result of blowing up houses\\" and Irgunist Menachem Adler, who didn't participate in the attack, but visited the village a few days later, who said \\"I didn't see the destruction that is always recounted.\\" Hogan believes that \\"it is unlikely that the inexperienced and undersupplied fighters under fire efficiently maneuvered explosives around defended houses.\\" He further argues that if explosives were used, the number of wounded and dismembered bodies would have been much higher. Instead, Hogan claims that the explosives story were used by the perpetrators to explain the high number of deaths as the result of combat rather than as a deliberate massacre. = Palmach intervenes = Some time later, two Palmach units arrived, commanded by Weg and Moshe Eren in two armored vehicles and carrying two two-inch mortars. Exactly when is unclear; Milstein writes \\"at noon,\\" Hogan \\"about 10:00 am.\\" Weg described the intervention in his report: Pa'il said that it was Moshe Idelstein that asked Weg for help: The mortar was fired three times at the mukhtar's house, which stopped the sniper fire. Reviewing the situation, Weg concluded that the wounded could not be evacuated before suppressing all hostile fire. Thus, his mission expanded to capturing the village. According to one Palmach fighter, \\"six of us went house to house, throwing grenades and bursting in.\\" Lehi officer David Gottlieb said the Palmach had accomplished \\"in one hour what we could not accomplish in several hours\\". The story is corroborated by Palmach fighter Kalman Rosenblatt who said \\"Together with six [other] people I went from house to house. We threw grenades into the houses before we entered them. We met the Lehi and Etzel [Irgun] people in the middle of the village. Some of them joined us. Others said ‚ÄòUntil now, we fought, now you fight.‚Äô In the houses there were dead. The dissidents did not fight.\\" Hogan writes that Palmach's quick and injury free success and the small number of Irgun and Lehi casualties demonstrate that Deir Yassin's defenses were neither tough nor professional. = Cleanup = Thanks to the rapid work of Palmach the fighting was over by about 11:00 am. Some villagers escaped and Jewish wounded were treated. At about 11:30 am Cohen was evacuated. Meanwhile, the Palmachniks and the revisionists went house to house to \\"clean up\\" and secure them. Pa'il met Weg and urged him to get out of Deir Yassin: \\"get away from here! Don't get mixed up with the Irgun and Stern Gang [Lehi].\\" The Palmach unit withdrew to Camp Schneller soon thereafter. Pa'il regretted asking Weg to leave: \\"To this very day I am haunted by the mistake I made. I shouldn‚Äôt have let Yaki and his men leave, but I didn‚Äôt imagine there was going to be a massacre there. If those Palmach guys had stayed, the dissidents wouldn‚Äôt have dared to commit a massacre. If we saw that, we would have cocked our guns and told them to stop.\\" In 1972, Raanan told a journalist that his men had found the house were Segal had fallen. Nine people in a nearby house that the attackers intended to blow open surrendered, including a woman and a child. The person with the Bren machine gun, shouted \\"This is for Yiftah [Segal's nom de guerre]!\\" and gunned them down. Yisrael Natach was a member of the Shai and were on the day stationed in Ein Karem. He heard stories from the arriving villagers that fled Deir Yassin that one Arab fighter had disguised himself as a woman which triggered the attackers' rage: Pa'il recalled hearing the shooting start anew: Mohammed Jabar, a boy at the time, remembered hiding under a bed and observing the attackers \\"break in, drive everybody outside, put them against the wall and shot them.\\" He claimed one of the victims was a mother with her baby. Zeinab Akkel claimed she offered her life savings to an attacker in exchange for sparing her younger brothers life: \\"my husband had given me $400. I offered it ... and said, 'Please leave my brother alone, he is so young.'\\" He took the money \\"and shot him in the head with five bullets.\\" Zeidan, who was taken prisoner, recalled meeting another group of captives: \\"We walked with some other women from the village, then came across a young man and an older man, with their hands up in the air, under guard.\\" \\"When they reached us, the soldiers shot them.\\" The young man's mother was in Zeidan's group and she started hitting the fighters that killed her son, so \\"one of them stabbed her with a knife a few times.\\" Houses and corpses were pillaged and money and jewelry were stolen from prisoners. Shaltiel got reports on what was happening in Deir Yassin and sent Gichon there to convince the revisionists to stop the massacre. The revisionists were initially reluctant to let him enter: Gichon told them \\"not to throw the bodies into cisterns and caves, because that was the first place that would be checked.\\" He described beatings, looting, and the stripping of jewelry and money from prisoners. He wrote that the initial orders were to take the men prisoner and send the women and children away, but the order was changed to kill all the prisoners. The mukhtar's son was killed in front of his mother and sisters, he said.Morris 2005. The most detailed report comes from Pa'il who spied on the revisionists on behalf of the Haganah:Morris 2004, p. 238; also see footnote 564, p. 294. Pa'il writes that the Haredi people of Givat Shaul came to help the villagers at around 2 p.m., and were able to stop the killing:Interview with Meir Pa'il, BBC 1998. Pa'il went home and wrote a report about what he had seen while his photographer developed the negatives. The next day he submitted his report. Morris writes that the killing continued after April 9. Some villagers who had either hidden or pretended to be dead were apparently killed by Lehi men on April 10 or 11. = Trucking and parading of prisoners = During the day, prisoners were loaded into trucks that came to and departed from Deir Yassin. Some were paraded through the streets of West Jerusalem, where they were jeered, spat at, and stoned, some were released in East Jerusalem and some where returned to Deir Yassin were they were executed. Harry Levin, a Haganah broadcaster, reported seeing \\"three trucks driving slowly up and down King George V Avenue bearing men, women, and children, their hands above their heads, guarded by Jews armed with sten-guns and rifles.\\" Haganah intelligence officer Mordechai Gichon wrote on April 10:Morris 2004, p. 238. Pa'il reported that he saw five Arab men being paraded through the streets, and later saw their bodies in a quarry near Givat Shaul. Morris writes that this is supported by two Jewish doctors who visited Deir Yassin on April 12 and reported that they found five male bodies in a house by the village quarry.Morris 2004, footnote 564, p. 294; see Dr. Z Avigdori and Dr A. Druyan's \\"Report on Visit to Deir Yassin on 12.4.1948\\", April 18, 1948. Gelber 2006, p. 314. Fifty-five orphans from the village were left by the Jaffa Gate to fend for themselves. Fifty-five children from the village whose parents had been killed were taken to the Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem's Old City, and left there. They were found by a Palestinian woman, Hind Husseini, a member of the prominent Palestinian Husseini family. She at first rented two rooms for them, bringing them food every day, before moving them to the Sahyoun convent. In July, she moved them again, this time to her family home, a large house her grandfather had built in Jerusalem in 1891. She renamed the house Dar Al-Tifl Al-Arabi (Arab Children's House), and set up a foundation to finance it. The orphanage continues to this day.\\"The Legacy of Hind Husseini\\", United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, accessed April 15, 2011. *Also see Madsen 2003, p. 59ff. A Shai report from April 12 to Shaltiel read: \\"Some of the women and children were taken prisoner by the Lehi and transferred to Sheik Bader [Lehi's headquarter in Jerusalem]. Among the prisoners were a young woman and a baby. The camp guards killed the baby before the mother‚Äôs eyes. After she fainted they killed her too.\\" Seven old men and women, who had been taken to Jerusalem, were taken back to Deir Yassin and killed in the quarry there, he wrote, and an Arab man, believed to be a sniper, was killed and his corpse burned in front of foreign journalists. = Irgun‚ÄìLehi press conference = On the evening of April 9, the fighters invited American journalists to a house in Givat Shaul, where they served tea and cookies while explaining the attacks. A spokesman said he regretted the casualties among the women and children, but they were inevitable because every house had to be reduced by force.Schmidt 1948. Ten houses had been blown up entirely, he said, though historians doubt if that was true.Gelber 2006, pp. 310‚Äì312. Other houses had their doors blown off and hand grenades thrown inside.  The day after  At a news conference on April 10, Raanan untruthfully told reporters on April 10 that 254 Arab bodies had been counted. The figure was repeated by the BBC and the Hebrew news services by The New York Times on April 13.Morris 2004, footnote 566, p. 294. *Also see Morris 2001, p. 209. Eliahu Arbel, Operations Officer B of the Haganah's Etzioni Brigade, visited Deir Yassin on April 10. \\"I have seen a great deal of war,\\" he said years later, \\"but I never saw a sight like Deir Yassin.\\"Assad 2010, p. 114. The Arab side told de Reynier about the massacre in Deir Yassin and asked him to investigate. He was discouraged from visiting the village by Haganah and the Jewish Agency but insisted on going: \\"They advised me not to interfere, because if I were to go there, my mission might be ended. They washed their hands in advance of anything that might happen to me if I insisted. I answered that I would fulfill my duty and that I saw the Jewish Agency as directly responsible for my safety and freedom of action, because it is responsible for all territories under Jewish control.\\"  April 11  Morning April 11 de Reynier visited Deir Yassin. He reported that he had encountered a \\"cleaning-up team\\" when he arrived the village:Hirst 2003, pp. 252‚Äì253. In his memoirs, published in 1950, de Reynier wrote: He also wrote that some of the 150 cadavers had been decapitated and disemboweled.Stefan Brooks, 'Deir Yassin Massacre,' in Spencer C. Tucker, Priscilla Roberts (eds.)The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and Military History, ABC-CLIO, 2008 p.297. After his inspection, the Irgun asked him to sign a document to say he had been received courteously and thanking them for their help. When he refused, they told him he would sign it if he valued his life. \\"The only course open to me was to convince them that I did not value my life in the least,\\" he wrote. His assistant, Dr. Alfred Engel, wrote:  April 12  On April 12 before noon, two Jewish doctors, Tzvi Avigdori, the chairman of the Jerusalem branch of the Palestine Physicians Association, and his deputy, A. Druyan, visited Deir Yassin and reported: Later the same day, troops from Haganah's youth organization Gadna where ordered to the village. They were to relieve of the revisionists but not before they had disposed of the bodies, something they had refused to. The dispute almost lead to violence. Yeshurun Schiff who had accompanied the Gadna troops recalled: \\"I told the commander [of Etzel or Lehi], 'you are swine.' My people surrounded them. I spoke to Shaltiel by wireless. Shaltiel said, 'Take their weapons, and if they do not surrender their weapons, open fire.' I said, 'I cannot do that to Jews.' Shaltiel said 'That‚Äôs an order!' but then he changed his mind.\\" Eventually the revisionists left and the Gadna troops buried the bodies. Gadna counsellor Hillel Polity related: \\"The stench was awful. They brought us gloves from the city, windbreakers and kerchiefs to cover our faces. We transported the bodies, two at a time, by hand, to the quarry. A bulldozer was brought from the city and used to cover the bodies with earth.\\" Gadna commander Shoshana Shatai claimed she saw a woman with a great smashed belly: \\"I was in shock. On the following day I told the investigator what I had seen.\\"  Casualties  = Number of Arabs killed = For many decades the number of victims were believed to be around 250, based on Raanan's false estimate. Modern scholarship puts the number at about half that. Sharif Kan'ana of Bir Zeit University interviewed survivors and published figures in 1988; 107 villagers had died, 11 of them armed, with 12 wounded.Kan'ana & Zaytuni 1988, pp. 5, 57. *The findings were published in Arabic as the fourth booklet in the university's \\"Destroyed Arab Villages\\" series, part of its Destroyed Palestinian Villages Documentation Project. Yoav Gelber writes that the figures are regarded as authoritative: see Gelber 2006, p. 311. Israeli researcher Eliezer Tauber writes that a total of 101 people were killed, 61 definitely in combat circumstances (including 24 armed fighters, with the remained being their family members who were with them); 18 for whom the cause of death could not be determined; about 10 whose deaths are in a \\"grey zone\\" whose charactization can be debated; and a further 11 being members of a single family who were gunned down by a single Irgun member.Deir Yassin: Sof HaMitus, published 2017. Discussion = Number of attackers killed and injured = Yehuda Slutzky, a former Haganah officer, wrote in 1972 that four attackers were killed and 32 wounded, four of them seriously. Hogan in 2001 based on an Irgun communique from 11 April, wrote that four killed in the battle and one of the wounded later died, four seriously wounded and 28 \\"lightly wounded.\\" Gerber in 2006 wrote that 35 were wounded and five killed. Morris, also in 2006, put the number of killed to four and a dozen seriously wounded, adding that the number 30 to 40 wounded given by the attackers were likely exaggerated. Reaction =Appeals to the British= The Arab emergency committee in Jerusalem learned of the attack around nine in the morning of April 9, including reports about the killing of women and children. They requested the help of the British, but did nothing further. In the late afternoon, they started to hear reports of women and children being paraded through the streets of Jerusalem. They sent the prisoners food and again appealed to the British army to intervene, to no avail. Gelber writes that the British were not keen to take on the Irgun and Lehi, who would have fought back if attacked, unlike the Haganah. High Commissioner Sir Alan Cunningham urged that troops be sent to Deir Yassin, but Lieutenant General Sir Gordon MacMillan, General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, said he would risk British lives only for British interests. The RAF commanding officer offered to fire rockets on the Jewish forces in the village, but the light bombers had been sent to Egypt and the rockets to Iraq.Gelber 2006, p. 316. Cunningham later said the RAF had brought a squadron of Tempest aircraft from Iraq to bomb the village, but he cancelled the operation when he learned the Haganah had arrived there and had garrisoned it.Gelber 2006, p. 317. View of Albert Einstein, Jessurun Cardozo, Hannah Arendt, Prof. Herman Eisen, Zellig Harris, Sidney Hook, Bruria Kaufman, Irma Lindheim, Seymour Melman, Fritz Rohrich and others about the attack = Praise = Begin hailed the taking of Deir Yassin as a ‚Äúsplendid act of conquest\\" that would serve as a model for the future: in a note to his commanders he wrote: 'Tell the soldiers: you have made history in Israel with your attack and your conquest. Continue thus until victory. As in Deir Yassin, so everywhere, we will attack and smite the enemy. God, God, Thou has chosen us for conquest.'Lawrence Wright Thirteen Days in September: The Dramatic Story of the Struggle for Peace, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2014 p.271. =Propaganda= The Jordanian newspaper Al Urdun published a survivor's account in 1955, which said the Palestinians had deliberately exaggerated stories about atrocities in Deir Yassin to encourage others to fight, stories that had caused them to flee instead. Everyone had reason to spread the atrocity narrative. The Irgun and Lehi wanted to frighten Arabs into fleeing; the Arabs wanted to provoke an international response; the Haganah wanted to tarnish the Irgun and Lehi; and the Arabs and the British wanted to malign the Jews.Morris 2001, p. 209. *Gelber 2006, p. 315. In addition, Milstein writes, the left-wing Mapai party and David Ben-Gurion, who became Israel's first prime minister on May 14, exploited Deir Yassin to stop a power-sharing agreement with the right-wing Revisionists‚Äîwho were associated with Irgun and Lehi‚Äîa proposal that was being debated at the time in Tel Aviv., footnote 208, p. 706. Hazem Nuseibeh, the news editor of the Palestine Broadcasting Service at the time of the attack, gave an interview to the BBC in 1998. He spoke about a discussion he had with Hussayn Khalidi, the deputy chairman of the Higher Arab Executive in Jerusalem, shortly after the killings: \\"I asked Dr. Khalidi how we should cover the story. He said, 'We must make the most of this.' So he wrote a press release, stating that at Deir Yassin, children were murdered, pregnant women were raped, all sorts of atrocities.\\"\\"Interview with Hazam Nusseibeh\\", Fifty Years' War, BBC, 1998. *Also see Silver 1998. Gelber writes that Khalidi told journalists on April 12 that the village's dead included 25 pregnant women, 52 mothers of babies, and 60 girls.Gelber 2006, p. 315.  Allegations of sexual violence  A number of sources alleged there had been instances of rape. Levi wrote on April 13: \\"LHI members tell of the barbaric behavior of the IZL toward the prisoners and the dead. They also relate that the IZL men raped a number of Arab girls and murdered them afterward (we don't know if this is true)\\" Morris 2004, p. 238, and Morris 2008, p. 127. Another source of rape allegations was Assistant Inspector- General Richard Catling of the British Palestine Police Force. He led a British police team that conducted interviews with survivors in Silwan the 13th, 15th, and 16 April: Gelber suggests that either the women's testimonies were a result of \\"the Arab propaganda machine\\" or that Catling was \\"an old and bitter enemy\\" of the Irgun and Lehi and fabricated the reports. The whereabouts of Catling's original reports are unknown, according to Gelber.Lapierre and Collins 2000, footnote, p. 276. *Gelber 2006, p. 313. Gelber writes that the stories of rape angered the villagers, who complained to the Arab emergency committee that it was \\"sacrificing their honour and good name for propaganda purposes.\\"Gelber 2006, p. 314. Abu Mahmud, who lived in Deir Yassin in 1948, was one of those who complained. He told the BBC: \\"We said, 'There was no rape.' He [Hussayn Khalidi] said, 'We have to say this so the Arab armies will come to liberate Palestine from the Jews. \\"This was our biggest mistake,\\" said Nusseibeh. \\"We did not realize how our people would react. As soon as they heard that women had been raped at Deir Yassin, Palestinians fled in terror. They ran away from all our villages.\\" He told Larry Collins in 1968: \\"We committed a fatal error, and set the stage for the refugee problem.\\"Larry Collins interview with Hazem Nusseibeh, May 1968, Larry Collins papers, Georgetown University library, cited in Morris 2004, footnote 572, p. 295. A villager known as Haj Ayish claimed that \\"there had been no rape.\\" He questioned the accuracy of the Arab radio broadcasts that \\"talked of women being killed and raped\\", and instead believed that \\"most of those who were killed were among the fighters and the women and children who helped the fighters.\\" Mohammed Radwan, one of the villagers who fought the attackers, said: \\"There were no rapes. It's all lies. There were no pregnant women who were slit open. It was propaganda that ... Arabs put out so Arab armies would invade. They ended up expelling people from all of Palestine on the rumor of Deir Yassin.\\" Radwan added \\"I know when I speak that God is up there and God knows the truth and God will not forgive the liars.\\" Historian Abdel Jawad states that women at Deir Yassin spoke to British interrogators about rapes occurring and their opinion that this was the worst thing that happened. He states that it was something that could not be discussed in their society and was never talked of by the men. Citing Hasso (2000:495) Isabelle Humphries and Laleh Khalili note that in Palestine men's honour was tied to \\"the maintenance of kin women's virginity (when unmarried) or exclusive sexual availability (when married)\\", and that this culture led to the suppression of the narratives of rape victims. Hogan cites one documentary in which one female survivor nods affirmatively when asked about \\"molestation.\\"  Denying the massacre  In 1969, the Israeli Foreign Ministry published an English pamphlet \\"Background Notes on Current Themes: Deir Yassin\\" denying that there had been a massacre at Deir Yassin, that the village was the home of an Iraqi garrison, and calling the massacre story \\"part of a package of fairy tales, for export and home consumption\\". The pamphlet led to a series of derivative articles giving the same message, mostly outside Israel. Menachem Begin's Herut party disseminated a Hebrew translation in Israel, causing a widespread but largely non-public debate within the Israeli establishment. Several former leaders of the Haganah demanded that the pamphlet be withdrawn on account of its inaccuracy, but the Foreign Ministry explained that \\"While our intention and desire is to maintain accuracy in our information, we sometimes are forced to deviate from this principle when we have no choice or alternative means to rebuff a propaganda assault or Arab psychological warfare.\\" Levi wrote to Begin: \\"On behalf of the truth and the purity of arms of the Jewish soldier in the War of Independence, I see it as my duty to warn you against continuing to spread this untrue version about what happened in Deir Yassin to the Israeli public. Otherwise there will be no avoiding raising the matter publicly and you will be responsible.\\" Eventually, the Foreign Ministry agreed to stop distributing the pamphlet, but it remains the source of many popular accounts.  Meir Pa'il testimony  Israeli military historian Uri Milstein alleged in 1998 that Pa'il was not in Deir Yassin on April 9. Milstein said there were contradictions in Pa'il's claims and an absence of any mention of Pa'il in other Haganah accounts of the incident. All Irgun and Lehi veterans Milstein interviewed denied having seen Pa'il in Deir Yassin, and the Lehi intelligence officer who Pa'il claimed invited him to Deir Yassin denied having done so. In addition, Haganah members who were in the area (including the deputy commander of the Palmach force that took part in the attack), some of whom personally knew Pa'il and were specifically mentioned in his account, denied having seen him there. According to Milstein, Pa'il said he despised the \\"dissidents\\", thus giving him a political motive to submit a falsified report. Milstein also wrote that Haganah intelligence reports on the incident were doctored by the authors or their superiors to discredit the Irgun and Lehi because of political in-fighting within the Jewish community., pp. 366, 378, 382‚Äì388, cited in Morris 2004, footnote 564, p. 294; also in an interview with Morris. Morris challenges Milstein's version that Pa'il was not at Deir Yassin that day with his observation that part of Pa‚Äôil‚Äôs report, that he saw the bodies of five Arabs in a quarry, \\"is apparently reinforced by a report by two Jewish doctors, who also report having found five male bodies in a house by the village quarry\\". In a presentation to the PEACE Middle East Dialog Group, Ami Isseroff, translator of Milstein's book into English, provided side-notes critical of many aspects of Milstein's work, including much of his information about Pa'il and also about the incompleteness of his sources - \\"Both Milstein and Yitzhak Levi leave out key testimony by Yehoshua Gorodenchik, from the Jabotinsky archives, in which he admits that Irgun troops murdered about 80 prisoners ‚Äì mostly men - corresponding to accounts of refugees.\\" Pa'il, who died in 2015, defended himself in an interview in 2007: \\"What the Lehi and Etzel [Irgun] people did in Deir Yassin in April 1948 was a despicable act. It cannot be called by any other name.\\" He maintained that he was sent to Deir Yassin to gauge Lehi and Irgun's fighting capabilities which he found to be lacking: \\"they didn't know a thing about field war. Worse, I saw that they knew how to massacre and kill... They are angry with me that I said these things. Let them first be angry at themselves.\\" He also attacked Milstein for being \\"a cheap propagandist for the right-wing considerations of the Zionist enterprise,\\" adding angrily: \\"I was there, I saw the massacre with my own eyes. Why didn't he ever question me about the things I experienced there?\\" =Exodus and invasion= Golda Meir, disguised as an Arab, appealed to King Abdullah of Jordan not to invade. Maxime Rodinson argued that the massacre at Deir Yassin, and the fear of further terrorism that it inspired in the Palestinian population, was a major cause of the subsequent Palestinian flight.Rodinson, 1968, p. 50 \\"There were many causes for the Palestinian exodus, the main one being simply that which operated in Spain during the Civil War or in France in 1940: to get away from the theatre of military operations. The fear of Jewish terrorism also played a major part, even though the terror was sporadic and restricted. The massacre of Deir Yassin, despite the condemnation of it by the ruling Jewish bodies, was fearfully active as an act of terror.\\" Mapam's leaders later concluded that the fall of Deir Yassin and Haifa were the two pivotal events of the Palestinian exodus. On April 14, Irgun radio broadcast that villages around Deir Yassin and elsewhere were being evacuated. HIS intelligence reported that the residents of Beit Iksa and Al Maliha had fled. The village of Fureidis appealed for arms. The villages of Fajja and Mansura reached a peace agreement with their Jewish neighbors. Arabs fled from Haifa and Khirbet Azzun. A Haganah attack on Saris encountered no resistance, because of the fear of Deir Yassin, in the view of the British.Morris 2004, pp. 239‚Äì240. Menachem Begin, leader of the Irgun at the time of the attack, though not present at the village, wrote in 1977: Abdullah said Deir Yassin had changed things, and that invasion was now unavoidable. :::::: The Deir Yassin attack, along with attacks on Tiberias, Haifa, and Jaffa, put pressure on Arab governments to invade Palestine. News of the killings had aroused public anger in the Arab world, which the governments felt unable to ignore. Syria's foreign minister remarked that the Arab public's desire for war was irresistible. The arrival of tens of thousands of refugees further convinced them to act. A consensus favoring invasion began to emerge the day after Deir Yassin, at a meeting on April 10 in Cairo of the Arab League Political Committee.Morris 2008, pp. 127, 182. Golda Meir, disguised in an Arab robe, met king Abdullah in Amman on May 10‚Äì11, the second such meeting between them. During their first, Abdullah had agreed to a partition of Palestine to include a Jewish state. Now, he retracted, suggesting instead a Jewish canton within a Hashemite kingdom. Deir Yassin had changed things, he said. Meir reported later that Abdullah was approaching war \\"as a person who is in a trap and can't get out\\". The Arab invasion began at midnight on May 14, when Abdullah fired a symbolic shot in the air, and shouted \\"Forward!\\"Morris 2008, p. 193 (for Golda Meir); p. 209 (for Abdullah shouting \\"forward\\").  Aftermath  = Deir Yassin today = Remains of the village inside the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center. In 1949, despite protests, the Jerusalem neighborhood of Givat Shaul Bet was built on what had been Deir Yassin's land, now considered part of Har Nof, an Orthodox area. Four Jewish scholars, Martin Buber, Ernst Simon, Werner Senator, and Cecil Roth, wrote to Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, asking that Deir Yassin be left uninhabited, or that its settlement be postponed. They wrote that it had become \\"infamous throughout the Jewish world, the Arab world and the whole world\\". Settling the land so soon after the killings would amount to an endorsement of them. Ben-Gurion failed to respond, though the correspondents sent him copy after copy. Eventually, his secretary replied that he had been too busy to read their letter.Ellis 1999, p. 32; Letter of Buber, Simon, Senator, Roth to David Ben-Gurion, Israel State Archives, Pmo 5559/Gimel. In 1951, the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center was built on the village itself, using some of the village's abandoned buildings. Currently, many of the remaining buildings, located within the hospital, are hidden behind the hospital's fence, with entry closely restricted.Moreno 1959, p. 279; Khalidi 1992, p. 292. In the 1980s, most of the remaining abandoned parts of the village were bulldozed to make way for new neighborhoods, and most of the Deir Yassin cemetery was bulldozed to make way for a highway. Har HaMenuchot, a Jewish cemetery, lies to the north. To the south is a valley containing part of the Jerusalem Forest, and on the other side of the valley, a mile and a half away, lie Mount Herzl and the Holocaust memorial museum, Yad Vashem.McGowan 1998 Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi wrote in 1992: File:Remains of Deir Yassin (1).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (2).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (3).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (4).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (5).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (7).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (8).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (9).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (10).jpg File:Remains of Deir Yassin (11).jpg File:Deir Yassin and Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center.JPG File:Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center (2).JPG = Veterans benefits suit = In 1952 a group of four wounded Irgun and Lehi fighters applied to the Israeli Defense Ministry for veterans' benefits. The Ministry rejected their application stating that the Deir Yassin massacre wasn't \\"military service\\". But the decision was reversed after the group appealed. = Archival records = Archival records about the Deir Yassin massacre are believed to exist in sealed Israeli archives from the war. Among them, an eyewitness report from Pa'il and two rolls of photographs taken by the photographer who accompanied him. In 1999, the organization Deir Yassin Remembered asked Prime Minister Ehud Barak to release the records. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Israel rejected a petition by the newspaper Haaretz for the declassification of documents, reports and photographs concerning the Deir Yassin massacre. The court cited the possible damage to Israel's foreign relations and its negotiations with the Palestinians.

He acted as his own lawyer (pro se) in the United States v. Anthony Accetturo et al. RICO trial, famous for being the longest federal trial in history (at 21 months). This trial was conducted while DiNorscio was already incarcerated on separate drug charges. He was ultimately found not guilty (along with his fellow co- defendants) after a short deliberation by the jury. After the trial, DiNorscio went back to prison; he was released on November 23, 2002, after serving 17.5 years of a 30-year sentence. The film Find Me Guilty is based on this trial. DiNorscio died in November 2004, near the end of shooting. Philadelphia family The longtime Don of the Philadelphia crime family, Angelo \\"Gentle Don\\" Bruno, was killed on March 21, 1980, resulting in a huge power vacuum. Anthony Accetturo and Michael Taccetta, on the other hand, used their situation to establish a new foothold in Philadelphia as a part of the Jersey Crew, with illegal gambling and loansharking operations. Because of the bad relations between the two factions in Philadelphia's crime family, as well as both Taccetta and Accetturo taking advantage of the situation, the relationship between Philadelphia and the New York Families, especially the Luccheses, eventually turned worse than ever and cooperation between the families eventually ended. It was around this time that prominent Bruno member, DiNorscio, along with many others, defected to the New Jersey faction of the Lucchese crime family to earn greater profits and to avoid being killed. Federal RICO (and other charges) trial During the early 1980s, U.S. law enforcement started an operation to discover and prosecute all organized crime activities in the North Jersey area. After a four-year-long investigation indictments were brought up toward 20 members of the Jersey Crew.Rudolph, Robert. The Boys from New Jersey: How the Mob Beat the Feds. 1992 Accetturo was brought from Florida, the Taccetta brothers were arrested in Newark, and 17 other known members were put on trial for 76 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) predicates. These charges of criminal activity claimed that the Lucchese Family participated in loansharking, extortion, racketeering, illegal gambling, money laundering, drug trafficking, arson, thefts, as well as murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The trial began in November 1986. During the trial, DiNorscio went on to fire his lawyer and represent himself during the entire trial. Although not popular with Accetturo and Taccetta, DiNorscio is reported to have charmed the jury; as the trial ended in 1988, all twenty defendants were acquitted, with a great deal of \\"pull\\" attributed to the congenial personality demonstrated by DiNorscio while he represented himself against the charges. The prosecutors were stunned and it is claimed that the Jersey Crew went right back where they left off in their criminal enterprises before the RICO trial.

History  The radio station working in September 1996 from a passenger trailer. Within a month it became the most listened radio station in ƒåaƒçak as the election campaign was in progress for local and federal elections. Ozon was broadcasting informative and contact programs substantially different from regime stations as the only active ones in ƒåaƒçak at the time. Ozon came on regime blacklist very soon, so passenger trailer kept moving around ƒåaƒçak in order to avoid police. Since regime stations forbid or censured presentations of opposition candidates, some smaller stations took liberty to show these presentations, and Ozon was among them. Ozon was the only free radio in wide area presenting informative programs and presentations candidates of opposition parties where they could present their political views and programs and listeners actively participate with their comments and questions. At that time Ozon was continuously broadcasting (live) meetings and demonstrations, statements of political parties' leaders, public persons and citizens. It was the time when Ozon started taking over informative programs of B92 Radio, larger anti-regime station from Belgrade, though with very obscure techniques. Of course, since it wouldn't comply with regime policy of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá they were banned and there were often attempts to shut down the station and arrest staff. Federal inspector for radio communications, assisted by the police, forbade work of Ozon Radio on November 29, 1996. Five-day protests followed at the town square in ƒåaƒçak, where some 3,000 to 5,000 people gathered day after day. To people's insisting Ozon continued programs broadcasting. Due to its large influence on local people, high ratings of listening and constant struggle with regime, Ozon radio greatly contributed winning of opposition at the local elections in Cacak. With the change of local power, they finally moved from passenger trailer to a temporary studio. Ozon editors continued their fight against the regime, but now, with new local government, they started to inform people on various cases of political and financial scams of new authorities. New authorities were not interesting in further work of Ozon, as they got to manage municipal Radio ƒåaƒçak. There were many incidents with the new mayor of Cacak - Velimir Iliƒá including one, while he was sending message to Ozon members to 'watchout', his members crashed into studio of Radio Ozon. Ozon continued work with primitive technical equipment it had, moving their premises twice. Ozon radio is one of the full members of independent association of electronic media - ANEM that provided education to journalists and personnel active in marketing. Besides programs of its own production, Ozon used to take over B92 programs, BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Voice Of America VOA, Deutsche Welle DW and FE in Serbian language until this was forbidden by law. This is a non-commercial informative radio station. From the end of March 1999, Ozon temporarily discontinued work, as the state of war was declared. Two days upon forbidding B92, Federal inspector for radio communications, assisted by special police, grabbed broadcasting technical equipment of TV ƒåaƒçak and tried to do the same with Ozon Radio. But Ozon team had timely hidden their equipment and so saved it for the future.  Today  Ozon Radio continues to operate as a legal station, with the goal of bringing quick and accurate information to its audience. The station is the top-ranked news and information station in the region.  Affiliate  During 2005 company owning Ozon radio, launched weekly newspapers called ƒåaƒçanske novine. This newspaper cover local and regional topics.

From lands belonging to that colony, the present Texas counties of DeWitt, Guadalupe and Lavaca were created. The hub of the colony was primarily located, however, in what is now Gonzales County. The first battle of the Texas Revolution occurred in the DeWitt Colony. Background In 1821 the Mexican War for Independence severed the control that Spain had exercised on its North American territories, and the new country of Mexico was formed from much of the lands that had comprised New Spain, including Spanish Texas.Manchaca (2001), p. 161. Because it was sparsely populated,Vazquez (1997), p. 51. Texas was combined with Coahuila to create a new state, Coahuila y Tejas.Manchaca (2001), p. 162. The new Mexican government was bankrupt and had little money to devote to the military. Settlers were empowered to create their own militias to help control hostile Indian tribes. Mexican Texas faced raids from both the Apache and Comanche tribes, and with little military support, the few settlers in the region needed help. In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the government liberalized its immigration policies for the region, and settlers from the United States were permitted in the colonies for the first time.Manchaca (2001), p. 164. The 1824 General Colonization Law enabled all heads of household who were citizens of or immigrants to Mexico to be eligible to claim land. The law did not differentiate among races or social stature, and people who had been granted occupancy rights would be able to claim the land patent for the dwellings.Manchaca (2001), p. 187. Immigrants were required to be Roman Catholic and foreigners were expected to learn Spanish.Vazquez (1997), p. 50. Settlers were supposed to own property or have a craft or useful profession, and all people wishing to live in Texas were expected to report to the nearest Mexican authority for permission to settle.de la Teja (1997), p. 88. Approval for settlement contracts for Texas was the responsibility of the state government in Saltillo. They were soon besieged by foreign speculators wanting to bring colonists into the state.Vazquez (1997), p. 53. Coahuila y Tejas implemented the federal law in 1825.Manchaca (2001), p. 195. At this time, about 3500 people lived in Texas, mostly congregated at San Antonio and La Bahia.Edmondson (2000), p. 75. Under the new law, people who did not already possess property in Texas could claim one square league (4438 acres) of irrigable land, with an additional league available to those who owned cattle. Soldiers were given the first choice of land, followed by citizens and immigrants. Empresarios and individuals with large families were exempt from the limit. Those who had owned land under Spanish control were allowed to retain their property as long as they had not fought on the side of the Spanish during the Mexican War of Independence. Immigrants were subject to the same policies as Mexican citizens, and Indians who migrated to Texas after Mexican independence and were not native to the area would be treated as immigrants.Manchaca (2001), p. 196. Stephen F. Austin quickly became the first empresario to successfully establish a colony in Texas. Establishment In 1822, Dewitt petitioned the Mexican government for permission to settle colonists in Texas but was denied. After gaining the support of Stephen F. Austin, an influential Texas empresario, Dewitt's second petition, in 1825, was granted. He was given permission to settle 400 respectable, industrious, Catholic families in an area bounded by the Guadalupe River, San Marcos River, and Lavaca River. This colony was southwest of Austin's.Roell (1994), p. 27. Dewitt hired James Kerr as his surveyor.Roell (1994), p. 28. In the summer of 1825, Kerr, along with Deaf Smith, Brazil Durbin, Geron Hinds, John Wightman, James Musick, and a Mr. Strickland, searched for a suitable location for the colony. Kerr chose to place the capital, called Gonzales after Rafael Gonzales, provisional governor of Coahuila y Tejas, at the confluence of the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers.Roell (1994), p. 28. The original location was east of the present city of Gonzales. To create the new town, several cabins were erected. In July 1826 Francis Berry and his family became the first family to reside in the Dewitt Colony. In July 1826 Gonzales was raided by Indians who were looking for horses. One colonist, John Wightman, was killed in the raid. Most of the settlers fled temporarily to Austin's colony. Although the colonization laws specified that settlements should not be established within 10 leagues of the coast, DeWitt gained permission from the Bexar authorities to establish a temporary settlement, which they called Old Station, on Matagorda Bay near the mouth of the Lavaca River. The settlement would be allowed until enough colonists had arrived to be able to see to their own safety in Gonzales. By October 1826 40 people lived in Old Station, including Dewitt and his family.Roell (1994), p. 29. DeWitt recruited most of the settlers from Missouri. He obtained a four-year contract with a schooner called Dispatch, captained by William Jarvis Russell, and with this he made his way down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisiana. Neighbor relations Because the Mexican government had made an error and included another colony in the contract grant, DeWitt had numerous disputes with Mart√≠n De Le√≥n, who had founded a colony near present-day Victoria. In late 1826, DeWitt was arrested, on the authorization of the Mexican government, due to Mart√≠n De Le√≥n claiming tobacco being shipped into the colony was contraband.Roell (1994), p. 30. As a result of the arrest, however, Mexican authorities ordered that Old Station be abandoned, and Gonzales was reestablished. By December, 1827, DeWitt had completed the construction of a fort in the previous location of Gonzales. The construction had been hampered by numerous Comanche raids, but after its completion, all settlers relocated to that location. In 1827, DeWitt joined Austin and De Leon in signing a peace treaty with the Karankawa so that their colonies would be safe from raids. DeWitt also negotiated a peace treaty with the Tonkawa, but were unable to reach terms with the Comanche. As Comanche raids took a toll on the settlement, the political chief in Bexar sent the settlers of Gonzales a small cannon that they could use for their protection.Roell (1994), p. 31. Growth By 1828 the colony consisted of 11 families and 27 single men. Most were primarily from the southern states of Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Louisiana, with some coming from as far north as New York. By 1829 the colony had experienced a boom, expanding to 30 families and 34 single men. By 1830, the colony had 56 families, and 65 single men. In 1830 Mexican authorities passed a law prohibiting further immigration to Texas from the United States. Austin was able to secure a waiver for DeWitt's colony, but the measure made it difficult for him to recruit families. When his contract expired on April 15, 1831, he had settled a total of 166 families. Because he was unable to meet the terms of the contract, any unassigned lands in his colony reverted to the Mexican government, and DeWitt was unable to get a further contract.Roell (1994), p. 33. Legacy The lands that comprised DeWitt Colony have been partitioned into several Texas counties. These include DeWitt, Guadalupe, Lavaca, and Gonzales.

It is a collaborative project between Cancer Research UK and the National Health Service (NHS), with additional funding from the Medical Research Council (UK). One key focus of the study relates to the effects of hormone replacement therapy use on women's health. The study has confirmed the findings in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) that women currently using HRT are more likely to develop breast cancer than those who are not using HRT. Results from the Million Women Study, together with those of the WHI trial from the USA, have influenced national policy, including recent recommendations on the prescribing and use of hormone replacement therapy from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and from the Commission on Human Medicines. Study design The Million Women Study is a multi-centre, population-based prospective cohort study of women aged 50 and over invited to routine breast cancer screening in the UK. Between 1996 and 2001, women were invited to join the Million Women Study when they received their invitation to attend breast screening at one of 66 participating NHS Breast Screening Centres in the UK. At these centres, women received a study questionnaire with their invitation, which they were asked to complete and return at the time of screening. Around 70% of those attending the programme returned questionnaires and agreed to take part in the study, over 1 in 4 women in the UK in the target age group. The Million Women Study is the largest study of its kind in the world. Aims The Million Women Study was set up with the aim of recruiting 1,000,000 women in the UK into a cohort study, to provide answers to the following questions: * What effects do combined estrogen and progestogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) preparations have on breast cancer risk? * Are breast cancers detected at screening in women who have used HRT or oral contraceptives different in terms of size and invasiveness from the cancers detected in women who have never used these hormones? * How does HRT use affect the efficacy of breast cancer screening? * How does HRT use affect mortality from breast cancer and other conditions? Findings =HRT and breast cancer= Initial analysis of the results from over 1 million women in the Million Women Study appeared to confirm preliminary findings from other studies at the turn of the century finding that women currently using progestin-estrogen HRT were more likely to develop breast cancer than those who are not using HRT. This initial analysis received extensive press coverage. The initial reading of results showed that this effect is substantially greater for combined (estrogen-progestogen) HRT than for estrogen-only HRT; and that the effects were similar for all specific types and doses of estrogen and progestogen, for oral, transdermal and implanted HRT, and for continuous and sequential patterns of use. Current users of estrogen-progestogen HRT were at 2 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer, and current users of estrogen-only HRT appeared to have a 1.3 fold risk. Use of HRT by women aged 50‚Äì64 in the UK in the decade from 1993-2003 was estimated to have caused 20,000 extra breast cancers. Past users were not seen as having increased risk. A reanalysis refuting the initial conclusion that HRT increased the risk of breast cancer, was published in a 2012 paper in the Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care. The paper's authors, led by Samuel Shapiro of the University of Cape Town, claimed that the study had not in fact establish a causal relationship between HRT and breast cancer, and that the original analysis had been flawed. =HRT and endometrial (womb) cancer= It is well known that post-menopausal women who have not had a hysterectomy are at increased risk of cancer of the endometrium (the lining of the womb) if they take estrogen-only HRT. Follow up of over 700 000 women in the Million Women Study confirmed this and showed that the risk of endometrial cancer is also increased in women who take tibolone; but is not altered, or may even be reduced, in women taking combined estrogen-progestogen HRT. These effects depend also on a woman‚Äôs body mass index (BMI, a measure of obesity) such that adverse effects of tibolone and estrogen-only HRT are greatest in thinner women, and the beneficial effects of combined HRT are greatest in fatter women. =HRT and ovarian cancer= Results of the study show a small increase in risk of ovarian cancer in women taking HRT. Such an increased risk had been suspected from some previous studies, and has now been confirmed with the larger numbers available in this study. The findings come from analyses on 948,576 post-menopausal women in the study, followed up for about 5 years. Women currently taking HRT were at higher risk of developing and of dying from ovarian cancer than women not using HRT. Past users were not at increased risk. The risk in current users was increased about 1.2 fold; for every 1000 women using HRT, 2.6 developed ovarian cancer over 5 years, compared with 2.2 in those not taking HRT. The risk was the same for estrogen- only, combined estrogen-progestogen and other types of HRT (including tibolone) and did not vary by specific type of estrogen or progestogen, or between oral and transdermal (patch) administration. These results are equivalent to one extra case of ovarian cancer for every 2500 women taking HRT, and one extra death from ovarian cancer per 3300 women taking HRT, over 5 years. Publishers of these studies say that the results need to be looked at in the context of the other risks and benefits of HRT. In particular, an estimation of the overall effect of HRT use on three common cancers in women: breast cancer, endometrial (womb) cancer and ovarian cancer. Together, these cancers account for about 4 in 10 cancers in women in the UK. According to the findings, in women aged 50‚Äì69, about 19 of these cancers will develop over 5 years in every 1000 women not taking HRT. In women taking HRT the estimate is for the number of cancers to be increased to about 31. The overall increased risk is higher in women using combined estrogen-progestogen HRT than in women using estrogen-only HRT because most of the overall increase is due to an increase in breast cancer, and users of combined HRT have a higher risk of breast cancer than users of estrogen-only HRT. =Alcohol and cancer= The study has also found that low to moderate alcohol consumption increases the risk of a variety of types of cancer in women, including breast cancer. Public health implications: Impact of the Million Women Study Results from the Million Women Study, together with those from other studies such as the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative trial from the USA, have influenced national policy, including recent recommendations on the prescribing and use of hormone replacement therapy from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and from the Commission on Human Medicines. Public awareness of the study and its findings has led to significant behavioural changes, predominately resulting in the swift decline of HRT prescriptions throughout Europe and the US from 2003. In contrast to the increase in HRT prescriptions between 1991 and 1996, which remained stable through to 2001, sales of HRT fell by 50% between 2002 and 2005 following the publication of the Million Women Study and the Women's Health Initiative study. A number of recent studies have shown that the Million Women Study continues to impact women‚Äôs health and behavioural patterns in Europe. Research examining breast cancer incidence trends in Sweden between 1997 and 2007, showed that the prevalence of HRT use in women aged 50‚Äì59 years decreased from a peak of 36% in 1999 to 9% in 2007, a parallel decrease in incidence of breast cancer was also reported between 2003 and 2007. A recent report assessing breast cancer incidence in Belgium between 2007 and 2008 also showed a significant drop in breast cancer incidence attributed to the decrease in HRT use in Belgium during and leading up 2008.

As a policy regime, it is described by academics as advocating economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal-democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented mixed economy. The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to representative and participatory democracy, measures for income redistribution, regulation of the economy in the general interest and social-welfare provisions. Due to longstanding governance by social-democratic parties during the post-war consensus and their influence on socioeconomic policy in Northern and Western Europe, social democracy became associated with Keynesianism, the Nordic model, the social- liberal paradigm and welfare states within political circles in the late 20th century. It has been described as the most common form of Western or modern socialism as well as the reformist wing of democratic socialism. While having socialism as a long-term goal, social democracy seeks to humanize capitalism and create the conditions for it to lead to greater democratic, egalitarian and solidaristic outcomes. It is characterized by a commitment to policies aimed at curbing inequality, eliminating oppression of underprivileged groups and eradicating poverty as well as support for universally accessible public services like care for the elderly, child care, education, health care and workers' compensation. It often has strong connections with the labour movement and trade unions, being supportive of collective bargaining rights for workers and measures to extend decision-making beyond politics into the economic sphere in the form of co-determination for employees and stakeholders. Social democracy originated as an ideology within the labour and socialist movement, whose goal at different times has been a social revolution to move away from capitalism to a post-capitalist economy such as socialism, a peaceful revolution as in the case of evolutionary socialism, or the establishment and support of a welfare state. Its origins lie in the 1860s as a revolutionary socialism associated with orthodox Marxism. Starting in the 1890s, there was a dispute between committed revolutionary social democrats such as Rosa Luxemburg and reformist social democrats as well as Marxist revisionists such as Eduard Bernstein, who supported a more gradual approach grounded in liberal democracy and cross-class cooperation, with Karl Kautsky representing a centrist position. By the 1920s, social democracy became the dominant political tendency along with communism within the international socialist movement, representing a form of democratic socialism with the aim of achieving socialism peacefully. By the 1910s, social democracy had spread worldwide and transitioned towards advocating an evolutionary change from capitalism to socialism using established political processes such as the parliament. In the late 1910s, socialist parties committed to revolutionary socialism renamed themselves as communist parties, causing a split in the socialist movement between these supporting the October Revolution and those opposing it. Social democrats who were opposed to the Bolsheviks later renamed themselves as democratic socialists in order to highlight their differences from communists and later in the 1920s from Marxist‚ÄìLeninists, disagreeing with the latter on topics such as their opposition to liberal democracy whilst sharing common ideological roots. In the early post-war era, social democrats in Western Europe rejected the Stalinist political and economic model then current in the Soviet Union, committing themselves either to an alternative path to socialism or to a compromise between capitalism and socialism. During the post-war period, social democrats embraced the idea of a mixed economy based on the predominance of private property, with only a minority of essential utilities and public services being under public ownership. As a policy regime, social democracy became associated with Keynesian economics, state interventionism and the welfare state as a way to avoid capitalism's typical crises and to avert or prevent mass unemployment, without abolishing factor markets, private property and wage labour. With the rise in popularity of neoliberalism and the New Right by the 1980s, many social-democratic parties incorporated the Third Way ideology, aiming to fuse economic liberalism with social-democratic welfare policies. By the 2010s, social- democratic parties that accepted triangulation and the neoliberal shift in policies such as austerity, deregulation, free trade, privatization and welfare reforms such as workfare experienced a drastic decline. The Third Way largely fell out of favour in a phenomenon known as Pasokification. Scholars have linked the decline of social-democratic parties to the declining number of industrial workers, greater economic prosperity of voters and a tendency for these parties to shift from the left to the centre on economic issues, alienating their former base of supporters and voters in the process. This decline has been matched by increased support for more left-wing and left-wing populist parties as well as for Left and Green social-democratic parties that reject neoliberal and Third Way policies. Social democracy was highly influential throughout the 20th century. Starting in the 1920s and 1930s, with the aftermath of World War I and that of the Great Depression, social democrats were elected to power. In countries such as Britain, Germany and Sweden, social democrats passed social reforms and adopted proto-Keynesian approaches that would be promoted across the Western world in the post-war period, lasting until the 1970s and 1990s. Academics, political commentators and other scholars tend to distinguish between authoritarian socialist and democratic socialist states, with the first representing the Soviet Bloc and the latter representing Western Bloc countries which have been democratically governed by socialist parties such as Britain, France, Sweden and Western social-democracies in general, among others. Social democracy has been criticized by both the left and right. The left criticize social democracy for having betrayed the working class during World War I and played a role in the failure of the proletarian 1917‚Äì1924 revolutionary wave, further accusing social democrats of having abandoned socialism. Conversely, one critique of the right is mainly related to their criticism of welfare. Another criticism concerns the compatibility of democracy and socialism.  Overview  = Definition = Social democracy is defined as one of many socialist traditions. As a political movement, it aims to achieve socialism through gradual and democratic means. This definition goes back to the influence of both the reformist socialism of Ferdinand Lassalle as well as the internationalist revolutionary socialism advanced by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, from whom social democracy was influenced. As an international political movement and ideology, social democracy has undergone various major forms throughout its history. Whereas in the 19th century it was \\"organized Marxism\\", social democracy became \\"organized reformism\\" by the 20th century. In contemporary usage, social democracy as a policy regime generally means support for a mixed economy and ameliorative measures to benefit the working class within the framework of capitalism. In political science, democratic socialism and social democracy are largely seen as synonyms while they are distinguished in journalistic use. Under this democratic socialist definition, social democracy is an ideology seeking to gradually build an alternative socialist economy through the institutions of liberal democracy. Starting in the post-war period, social democracy was defined as a policy regime advocating reformation of capitalism to align it with the ethical ideals of social justice. In the 19th century, it encompassed a wide variety of non- revolutionary and revolutionary currents of socialism which excluded anarchism. In the early 20th century, social democracy came to refer to support for a gradual process of developing socialism through existing political structures and an opposition to revolutionary means of achieving socialism in favor of reformism. In the 19th century, social democrat was a broad catch-all for international socialists owing their basic ideological allegiance to Lassalle or Marx, in contrast to those advocating various forms of utopian socialism. In one of the first scholarly works on European socialism written for an American audience, Richard T. Ely's 1883 book French and German Socialism in Modern Times, social democrats were characterized as \\"the extreme wing of the socialists\\" who were \\"inclined to lay so much stress on equality of enjoyment, regardless of the value of one's labor, that they might, perhaps, more properly be called communists\\". Many parties in this era described themselves as Social Democrat, including the General German Workers' Association and the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany which merged to form the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the British Social Democratic Federation and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Social Democrat continued to be used in this context up to the time of the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, at which time Communist came into vogue for individuals and organizations espousing a revolutionary road to socialism. According to Ely: As a label or term, social democracy or social democratic remains controversial among socialists. Some define it as representing both a Marxist faction and non-communist socialists or the right-wing of socialism during the split with communism. Others have noted its pejorative use among communists and other socialists. According to Lyman Tower Sargent, \\"socialism refers to social theories rather than to theories oriented to the individual. Because many communists now call themselves democratic socialists, it is sometimes difficult to know what a political label really means. As a result, social democratic has become a common new label for democratic socialist political parties\\". According to Donald Busky: Marxist revisionist Eduard Bernstein's views influenced and laid the groundwork for the development of post-war social democracy as a policy regime, Labour revisionism and the neo- revisionism of the Third Way. This definition of social democracy is focused on ethical terms, with the type of socialism advocated being ethical and liberal. Bernstein described socialism and social democracy in particular as \\"organized liberalism\\". In this sense, liberalism is the predecessor and precursor of socialism, whose restricted view of freedom is to be socialized while democracy must entails social democracy. For those social democrats, who still describe and see themselves as socialists, socialism is used in ethical or moral terms, representing democracy, egalitarianism and social justice rather than a specifically socialist economic system. Under this type of definition, social democracy's goal is that of advancing those values within a capitalist market economy as its support for a mixed economy no longer denotes the coexistence between private and public ownership or that between planning and market mechanisms, but rather it represents free markets combined with government intervention and regulations. Social democracy has been seen by some as an essentially revision of orthodox Marxism, although this has been described as misleading for modern social democracy. Some distinguish between ideological social democracy as part of the broad socialist movement and social democracy as a policy regime. The first is called classical social democracy or classical socialism, being contrasted to competitive socialism, liberal socialism, neo-social democracy and new social democracy. Social democracy has often been conflated with an administrative command economy, authoritarian socialism, big government, Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states, Soviet-type economic planning, state interventionism and state socialism. Austrian School economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises also continually used socialism as a synonym for central planning and social democracy for state socialism, conflating it with fascism and opposing social-democratic policies, including the welfare state. This is notable in the United States, where socialism has become a pejorative used by conservatives and libertarians to taint liberal and progressive policies, proposals and public figures. Those confusions are caused not only by the socialist definition, but by the capitalist definition as well. Christian democrats, social liberals, national and social conservatives tend to support some social-democratic policies and generally regard capitalism as compatible with a mixed economy. On the other hand, classical liberals, conservative liberals, neoliberals, liberal conservatives and right-libertarians define capitalism as the free market. The latter support a small government and a laissez-faire capitalist market economy while opposing economic interventionism, government regulations and social-democratic policies. They see actually existing capitalism as corporatism, corporatocracy, or crony capitalism. This has resulted in socialism and by extension social democracy being defined in countries such as Norway and the United Kingdom as \\"what a Labour government does\\". With the rise of neoliberalism in the late 1970s and early 1980s and the Third Way between the 1990s and 2000s, social democracy became synonymous with it. Many social democrats opposed to the Third Way overlap with democratic socialists in their commitment to a democratic alternative to capitalism and a post- capitalist economy. Those social democrats have not only criticized the Third Way as anti-socialist and neoliberal, but also as anti-social democratic in practice. Some democratic socialists and others have rejected the Third Way's centrism, for the political centre moved decidedly to the right during the neoliberal years. Social-democratic parties such as the British Labour Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany have been described as effectively representing a new centre-right or neoliberal party.  Overlap with democratic socialism  Social democracy has some significant overlap on practical policy positions with democratic socialism, although they are usually distinguished from each other. While the now revised version of Clause IV to the British Labour Party Constitution which was implemented in the 1990s by the New Labour faction led by Tony Blair affirms a formal commitment to democratic socialism, describing it as a modernized form of social democracy, it no longer commits the party to public ownership of industry and in its place advocates \\"the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition\\" along with \\"high quality public services either owned by the public or accountable to them\\". Many social democrats \\"refer to themselves as socialists or democratic socialists\\" and some such as Tony Blair \\"use or have used these terms interchangeably\\". Others argue that \\"there are clear differences between the three terms, and preferred to describe their own political beliefs by using the term 'social democracy' only\\". Democratic socialism is generally defined as an anti-Stalinist left-wing big tent that opposes authoritarian socialism, rejecting self-described socialist states as well as Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and its derivatives such as Maoism and Stalinism. Besides social democrats, democratic socialists also include some anarchists, classical Marxists, democratic communists, libertarian socialists, market socialists, orthodox Marxists such as Karl Kautsky and Rosa Luxemburg as well as revisionists such as Eduard Bernstein. As a term, democratic socialism represents social democracy prior to the 1970s, when the post-war displacement of Keynesianism by monetarism and neoliberalism caused many social-democratic parties to adopt the Third Way ideology, accepting capitalism as the current status quo and redefining socialism in a way that maintains the capitalist structure intact. Like modern social democracy, democratic socialism tends to follow a gradual, reformist or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one. Policies commonly supported by both are Keynesian in nature and include some degree of regulation over the economy, social insurance schemes, public pension programs and a gradual expansion of public ownership over major and strategic industry. According to both right-wing critics and some supporters alike, policies such as universal health care and education are \\"pure Socialism\\" because they are opposed to \\"the hedonism of capitalist society\\". Partly because of this overlap, democratic socialism refers to European socialism as represented by social democracy, especially in the United States, where it is tied to the New Deal. Some democratic socialists who follow social democracy support practical, progressive reforms of capitalism and are more concerned to administrate and humanize it, with socialism relegated to the indefinite future. Other democratic socialists want to go beyond mere meliorist reforms and advocate systematic transformation of the mode of production from capitalism to socialism. During the late 20th century, those labels were embraced, contested and rejected due to the emergence of developments within the European left such as Eurocommunism, the rise of neoliberalism, the fall of the Soviet Union and Revolutions of 1989, the Third Way and the rise of anti-austerity and Occupy movements due to the global financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and the Great Recession, the causes of which have been attributed by some to the neoliberal shift and deregulation economic policies. This latest development contributed to the rise of politicians such as Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom and Bernie Sanders in the United States who rejected centrist politicians that supported triangulation within the Labour and Democratic parties. Despite the long history of overlap between the two, with social democracy considered a form of democratic or parliamentary socialism and social democrats calling themselves democratic socialists, democratic socialism is considered a misnomer in the United States. One issue is that social democracy is equated with wealthy countries in the Western world (especially in Northern and Western Europe) while democratic socialism is conflated either with the pink tide in Latin America (especially with Venezuela) or with communism in the form of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist socialism as practized in the Soviet Union and other self- declared socialist states. In the United States, democratic socialism has been described as representing the left-wing or socialist tradition of the New Deal. The lack of a strong and influential socialist movement in the United States has been linked to the Red Scare and any ideology that is associated with socialism brings social stigma due its association with authoritarian socialist states. As a term, socialism has been used as a scare word or a pejorative term without clear definition by conservatives and libertarians to taint liberal and progressive policies, proposals and public figures. Although Americans may reject the idea that the United States has characteristics of a European-style social democracy, it has been argued by other observers that it has a comfortable social safety net, albeit severely underfunded in comparison to other Western countries. It has also been argued that many policies that may be considered socialist are popular, but that socialism is not. Others such as Tony Judt described modern liberalism in the United States as representing European social democracy.  Political party  Social Democratic is the name of socialist parties in some countries. The term came to be associated with the positions of the German and Swedish parties. The first advocated revisionist Marxism while the second advocated a comprehensive welfare state. Today, parties advocating social democracy include Labour, Left and some Green parties. Most social-democratic parties consider themselves to be democratic socialists and are routinely called socialist parties. Some such as the Labour Party in the United Kingdom make reference to socialism, either as a post-capitalist order or in ethical terms as a just society, described as representing democratic socialism, without any explicit reference to the economic system. Parties such as the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Swedish Social Democratic Party describe their goal the development of democratic socialism, with social democracy serving as the principle of action. Today, European social-democratic parties represents the centre-left and most are part of the European Socialist Party while democratic socialist parties are to their left within the Party of the European Left. Many of those contemporary social-democratic parties are members of the Socialist International, including several democratic socialist parties, whose Frankfurt Declaration declares the goal of the development of democratic socialism. Others are also part of the Progressive Alliance, founded in 2013 by most of current or former member parties of the Socialist International. What socialists such as anarchists, communists, social democrats, syndicalists and some social-democratic proponents of the Third Way share in common is history, specifically that they can all be traced back to the individuals, groups and literature of the First International and have retained some of the terminology and symbolism such as the colour red. How far society should intervene and whether government, particularly existing government, is the correct vehicle for change are issues of disagreement. As the Historical Dictionary of Socialism argues, \\"there were general criticisms about the social effects of the private ownership and control of capital\\", \\"a general view that the solution to these problems lay in some form of collective control (with the degree of control varying among the proponents of socialism) over the means of production, distribution, and exchange\\" and \\"there was agreement that the outcomes of this collective control should be a society that provided social equality and justice, economic protection, and generally a more satisfying life for most people\\". Socialism became a catch-all term for the critics of capitalism and industrial society. Social democrats are anti- capitalists insofar as criticism about \\"poverty, low wages, unemployment, economic and social inequality, and a lack of economic security\\" is linked to the private ownership of the means of production. = Development = During the late 19th century and the early 20th century, social democracy was a broad labour movement within socialism that aimed to replace private ownership with social ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, taking influence from both Marxism and the supporters of Ferdinand Lassalle. By 1868‚Äì1869, the socialism associated with Karl Marx had become the official theoretical basis of the first social-democratic party established in Europe, the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany. By the early 20th century, the German social-democratic politician Eduard Bernstein rejected the ideas in orthodox Marxism that proposed specific historical progression and revolution as a means to achieve social equality, advancing the position that socialism should be grounded in ethical and moral arguments for social justice and egalitarianism that are to be achieved through gradual legislative reform. Following the split between reformist and revolutionary socialists in the Second International, socialist parties influenced by Bernstein rejected revolutionary politics in favour of parliamentary reform while remaining committed to socialization. During the 1920s and 1930s, social democracy became a dominant tendency within the socialist movement, mainly associated with reformist socialism whilst communism represented revolutionary socialism. Under the influence of politicians like Carlo Rosselli in Italy, social democrats began disassociating themselves from orthodox Marxism altogether as represented by Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, embracing liberal socialism, Keynesianism and appealing to morality rather than any consistent systematic, scientific or materialist worldview. Social democracy made appeals to communitarian, corporatist and sometimes nationalist sentiments while rejecting the economic and technological determinism generally characteristic of both orthodox Marxism and economic liberalism. By the post-World War II period and its economic consensus and expansion, most social democrats in Europe had abandoned their ideological connection to orthodox Marxism and shifted their emphasis toward social policy reform as a compromise between capitalism to socialism. According to Michael Harrington, the major reason for this was due to the perspective that viewed the Stalinist-era Soviet Union as having succeeded in propaganda in usurping the legacy of Marxism and distorting it in propaganda to justify totalitarianism. In its foundation, the Socialist International denounced the Bolshevik-inspired communist movement, \\"for [it] falsely claims a share in the Socialist tradition\\". Furthermore, core tenets of Marxism have been regarded by social democrats as having become obsolete, including the prediction that the working-class was the decisive class with the development of capitalism. In their view, this did not materialize in the aftermath of mass industrialization during World War II. During the Third Way development of social democracy, social democrats adjusted themselves to the neoliberal political climate that had existed since the 1980s. Those social democrats recognized that outspoken opposition to capitalism was politically non-viable and that accepting the current powers that be and seeking to challenge free-market and laissez-faire variations of capitalism was a more immediate concern. The Third Way stands for a modernized social democracy, but the social democracy that remained committed to the gradual abolition of capitalism, along with social democrats opposed to the Third Way, merged into democratic socialism. Although social democracy originated as a revolutionary socialist or communist movement, one distinction made to separate democratic socialism and social democracy is that the former can include revolutionary means. The latter asserts that the only acceptable constitutional form of government is representative democracy under the rule of law. Social democracy has been described as the evolutionary form of democratic socialism that aims to gradually and peacefully achieve socialism through established political processes rather than social revolution as advocated by revolutionary socialists. In this sense, social democracy is synonymous with democratic socialism and represented its original form, i.e. socialism achieved by democratic means, usually through the parliament. While social democrats continue to call and describe themselves as democratic socialists or simply socialists, with time, the post-war association of social democracy as policy regime and the development of the Third Way, democratic socialism has come to include communist and revolutionary tendencies, effectively representing the original meaning of social democracy as the latter has shifted towards mostly reformism. = Philosophy = Philosophically and etymologically overlapping with democratic socialism, social democracy is a form of reformist democratic socialism. Social democracy rejects the either/or interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. It claims that fostering a progressive evolution of capitalism will gradually result in the evolution of a capitalist economy into a socialist economy. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as education, health care, workers' compensation and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy also advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of ability/disability, age, ethnicity, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation and social class. A portrait highlighting the five leaders of early social democracy in Germany Later in their life, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels came to argue that in some countries workers might be able to achieve their aims through peaceful means. In this sense, Engels argued that socialists were evolutionists, although both Marx and Engels remained committed to social revolution. In developing social democracy, Marxist revisionist Eduard Bernstein rejected the revolutionary and materialist foundations of orthodox Marxism. Rather than class conflict and socialist revolution, Bernstein believed that socialism could be achieved through cooperation between people regardless of class. Nonetheless, Bernstein paid deference to Marx, describing him as the father of social democracy, but declaring that it was necessary to revise Marx's thought in light of changing conditions. Influenced by the gradualist platform favoured by the British Fabian movement, Bernstein came to advocate a similar evolutionary approach to socialist politics that he termed evolutionary socialism. Evolutionary means include representative democracy and cooperation between people regardless of class. Bernstein accepted the Marxist analysis that the creation of socialism is interconnected with the evolution of capitalism. August Bebel, Bernstein, Engels, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Marx and Carl Wilhelm T√∂lcke are all considered founding fathers of social democracy in Germany, but it is especially Bernstein and Lassalle, along with labourists and reformists such as Louis Blanc in France, who led to widespread association of social democracy with socialist reformism. While Lassalle was a reformist state socialist, Bernstein predicted a long-term co-existence of democracy with a mixed economy during the reforming of capitalism into socialism and argued that socialists needed to accept this. This mixed economy would involve public, cooperative and private enterprises and it would be necessary for a long period of time before private enterprises evolve of their own accord into cooperative enterprises. Bernstein supported state ownership only for certain parts of the economy that could be best managed by the state and rejected a mass scale of state ownership as being too burdensome to be manageable. Bernstein was an advocate of Kantian socialism and neo-Kantianism. Although unpopular early on, his views became mainstream after World War I. In The Future of Socialism (1956), Anthony Crosland argued that \\"traditional capitalism has been reformed and modified almost out of existence, and it is with a quite different form of society that socialists must now concern themselves. Pre-war anti-capitalism will give us very little help\\", for a new kind of capitalism required a new kind of socialism. Crosland believed that these features of a reformed managerial capitalism were irreversible, but it has been argued within the Labour Party and by others that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan brought about its reversal in the 1970s and 1980s. While the post-war consensus represented a period where social democracy was \\"most buoyant\\", it has been argued that \\"post-war social democracy had been altogether too confident in its analysis\\" because \\"gains which were thought to be permanent turned out to be conditional and as the reservoir of capitalist growth showed signs of drying up\\". In Socialism Now (1974), Crosland argued that \\"[m]uch more should have been achieved by a Labour Government in office and Labour pressure in opposition. Against the dogged resistance to change, we should have pitted a stronger will to change. I conclude that a move to the Left is needed\\". In Origin, Ideology and Transformation of Political Parties: East-Central and Western Europe Compared, V√≠t Hlou≈°ek and Lubom√≠r Kopecek explain how socialist parties have evolved from the 19th to the early 21st centuries. As the number of people in traditional working class occupations such as factory-workers and miners declined, socialists have successfully widened their appeal to the middle class by diluting their ideology. However, there is still continuity between parties such the German SPD, the British Labour Party and other socialist parties which remain part of the same famille spirituelle or ideological party family as outlined by most political scientists. For many social democrats, Marxism is loosely held to be valuable for its emphasis on changing the world for a more just, better future.  Communist split and the Third Way  Vladimir Lenin, one revolutionary social democrat who paved the way for the split between Communists and Social Democrats Before social democracy was associated to a policy regime with a specific set of socioeconomic policies, its economics ranged from communism to syndicalism and the guild socialists, who rejected or were opposed to the approach of some Fabians, regarded as being \\"an excessively bureaucratic and insufficiently democratic prospect\\". Communists and revolutionary socialists were a significant part of social democracy and represented its revolutionary wing. Although they remained committed to the concept of social democracy representing the highest form of democracy, social democracy became associated with its reformist wing since the communist split starting in 1917. The Russian Revolution further exacerbated this division, resulting in a split between those supporting the October Revolution renaming themselves as Communist and those opposing the Bolshevik development (favouring the liberal social-democratic development as argued by the Mensheviks) remaining with the Social Democrat label. Rather than abandoning social democracy, Communists simply remained committed to revolutionary social democracy, merging into communism. However, they saw Social Democrat associated to reformism, found it irredeemably lost and chose Communist to represent their views. For the Communists, the Social Democrats betrayed the world's working class by supporting the imperialist Great War and leading their national governments into the war. The Communists also criticized their reformism, arguing that it represented \\"reformism without reforms\\". This reformist‚Äìrevolutionary division culminated in the German Revolution of 1919 in which the Communists wanted to overthrow the German government to turn it into a soviet republic like it was done in Russia while the Social Democrats wanted to preserve it as what came to be known as the Weimar Republic. It was those revolutions that essentially transformed the social democracy meaning from \\"Marxist revolutionary\\" into a form of \\"moderate parliamentary socialism\\". Anthony Crosland, who argued that traditional capitalism had been reformed and modified almost out of existence by the social-democratic welfare policy regime after World War II While evolutionary and reformist social democrats believe that capitalism can be reformed into socialism, revolutionary social democrats argue that this is not possible and that a social revolution would still be necessary. The revolutionary criticism of reformism, but not necessarily of reforms which are part of the class struggle, goes back to Marx, who proclaimed that social democrats had to support the bourgeoisie wherever it acted as a revolutionary, progressive class because \\"bourgeois liberties had first to be conquered and then criticised\\". Internal rivalry in the social-democratic movement within the Second International between reformists and revolutionaries resulted in the Communists led by the Bolsheviks founding their own separate Communist International (Comintern) in 1919 that sought to rally revolutionary social democrats together for socialist revolution. With this split, the social- democratic movement was now dominated by reformists, who founded the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) in 1923. The LSI had a history of rivalry with the Comintern, with which it competed over the leadership of the international socialist and labour movement. The social-democratic Gaitskellites emphasized the goals of personal liberty, social welfare and above all social equality. The Gaitskellites were part of a political consensus between the British Labour and Conservative parties, famously dubbed Butskellism. Some social-democratic Third Way figures such as Anthony Giddens and Tony Blair, who has described himself as a Christian socialist and consider himself to be a socialist in ethical terms, adamantly insist that they are socialists, for they claim to believe in the same values that their anti-Third Way critics do. However, Clause IV's open advocacy of state socialism was alienating potential middle-class Labour supporters and nationalization policies had been so thoroughly attacked by neoliberal economists and politicians, including rhetorical comparisons by the right of state-owned industry in the West to that in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, hence nationalizations and state socialism became unpopular. In countries such as Britain, Thatcherite Conservatives were adept at condemning state-owned enterprises as economically inefficient. For the Gaitskellites, nationalization was not essential to achieve all major socialist objectives. Public ownership and nationalization were not specifically rejected, but were rather seen as merely one of numerous useful devices. According to social- democratic modernizers like Blair, nationalization policies were politically unviable by the 1990s. Some critics and analysts argue that a number of prominent social-democratic parties such as the British Labour Party and the German Social Democratic Party, even while maintaining references to socialism and declaring themselves to be democratic socialist parties, have effectively abandoned socialism in practice, whether unwillingly or not. = Policy regime = As a policy regime, it has become commonplace to reference social democracy as the European social democracies, i.e. the actually-existing states in Northern and Western European countries, usually in reference to their model of welfare state and corporatist system of collective bargaining. European social democracies represents a socio-economic order that has been variously described as starting in either the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and ending in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Henning Meyer and Jonathan Rutherford associate social democracy with the socio-economic order that existed in Europe from the post-war period up until the early 1990s. This has been accepted or adopted across the political spectrum, including conservatives (Christian democrats), liberals (social liberals) and socialists (social democrats). However, socialists see the welfare state \\"not merely to provide benefits but to build the foundation for emancipation and self-determination\\". Social democracy influenced the development of social corporatism, a form of economic tripartite corporatism based upon a social partnership between the interests of capital and labour, involving collective bargaining between representatives of employers and of labour mediated by the government at the national level. During the post-war consensus, this form of social democracy has been a major component of the Nordic model and to a lesser degree the West European social market economies. The development of social corporatism began in Norway and Sweden in the 1930s and was consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s. The system was based upon the dual compromise of capital and the labour as one component and the market and the state as the other component. From the 1940s through the 1970s, defining features of social democracy as a policy regime included Keynesian economic policies and industrial agreements to balance the power of capital and labor as well as the welfare state. This is especially associated with the Swedish Social Democrats. In the 1970s, social corporatism evolved into neo-corporatism which essentially replaced it. Neo-corporatism has represented an important concept of Third Way social democracy. Social- democratic theorist Robin Archer wrote about the importance of social corporatism to social democracy in his work Economic Democracy: The Politics of a Feasible Socialism (1995). As a welfare state, social democracy is a specific type of welfare state and policy regime described as being universalist, supportive of collective bargaining and more supportive of public provision of welfare. It is especially associated to the Nordic model. As a policy regime, social democracy rests on three fundamental features, namely \\"(1) democracy (e.g., equal rights to vote and form parties), (2) an economy partly regulated by the state (e.g., through Keynesianism), and (3) a welfare state offering social support to those in need (e.g., equal rights to education, health service, employment, and pensions)\\". In practice, social- democratic parties have been instrumental in the social-liberal paradigm lasting from the 1940s and 1970s and called as such because it was developed by social liberals, but implemented by social democrats. Since those policies were mostly implemented by social democrats, social liberalism is sometimes called social democracy. The social-liberal Beveridge Report drafted by the Liberal economist William Beveridge influenced the British Labour Party's social policies such as the National Health Service and Labour's welfare state development. This social-liberal paradigm represented the post-war consensus and was accepted across the political spectrum by conservatives, liberals and socialists until the 1970s. Similarly, the neoliberal paradigm which replaced the previous paradigm was accepted across the mainstream political parties, including social-democratic supporters of the Third Way. This has caused much controversy within the social-democratic movement.  Implementation  From the late 19th century until the mid- to late 20th century, there was greater public confidence in the idea of a state-managed economy that was a major pillar of both proponents of communism and social democracy and even to a substantial degree by conservatives and left-liberals. Aside from anarchists and other libertarian socialists, there was confidence amongst socialists in the concept of state socialism as being the most effective form of socialism. Some early British social democrats in the 19th century and 20th century such as the Fabians claimed that British society was already mostly socialist and that the economy was significantly socialist through government-run enterprises created by conservative and liberal governments which could be run for the interests of the people through their representatives' influence, an argument reinvoked by some socialists in post-war Britain. Advents in economics and observation of the failure of state socialism in the Eastern Bloc countries and in the Western world with the crisis and stagflation of the 1970s, combined with the neoliberal rebuke of state interventionism, resulted in socialists re-evaluating and redesigning socialism. Some social democrats have sought to keep what they deem are socialism's core values while changing their position on state involvement in the economy, but retaining significant social regulations. When nationalization of large industries was relatively widespread in the 20th century until the 1970s, it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European social democracies as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a socialist economy. In 1956, leading British Labour Party politician and author Anthony Crosland claimed that capitalism had been abolished in Britain, although others such as Welshman Aneurin Bevan, Minister of Health in the first post-war Labour government and the architect of the National Health Service, disputed the claim. For Crosland and others who supported his views, Britain was a socialist state. According to Bevan, Britain had a socialist National Health Service which stood in opposition to the hedonism of Britain's capitalist society. Although as in the rest of Europe the laws of capitalism still operated fully and private enterprise dominated the economy, some political commentators claimed that during the post-war period, when social-democratic parties were in power, countries such as Britain and France were democratic socialist states and the same claim is now applied to Nordic countries with the Nordic model. In the 1980s, the government of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand aimed to expand dirigism and attempted to nationalize all French banks, but this attempt faced opposition of the European Economic Community because it demanded a free-market economy among its members. Public ownership never accounted for more than 15‚Äì20% of capital formation, further dropping to 8% in the 1980s and below 5% in the 1990s after the rise of neoliberalism. One issue of social democracy is the response to the collapse of legitimacy for state socialism and state-interventionist economics of Keynesianism with the discovery of the phenomenon of stagflation which has been an issue for the legitimacy of state socialism. This has provoked re-thinking of how socialism should be achieved by social democrats, including changing views by social democrats on private property‚Äîanti-Third Way social democrats such as Robert Corfe have advocated a socialist form of private property as part of a new socialism (although Corfe technically objects to the term private property to collectively describe property that is not publicly owned as being vague) and rejecting state socialism as a failure. Third Way social democracy was formed as response to what its proponents saw as a crisis in the legitimacy of socialism‚Äîespecially state socialism‚Äîand the rising legitimacy for neoliberalism, especially laissez-faire capitalism. The Third Way's view is criticized for being too simplistic in its view of the crisis. Others have criticized it because with the fall of state socialism it was possible \\"a new kind of 'third way' socialism (combining social ownership with markets and democracy), thereby heralding a revitalization of the social democratic tradition\\". However, it has been argued that the prospect of a new socialism was \\"a chimera, a hopeful invention of Western socialists who had not understood how 'actually existing socialism' had totally discredited any version of socialism among those who had lived under it\\".  History  = First International era and origins in the socialist movement (1863‚Äì1889) = The concept of social democracy goes back to the French Revolution and the bourgeois-democratic Revolutions of 1848, with historians such as Albert Mathiez seeing the French Constitution of 1793 as an example and inspiration whilst labelling Maximilien Robespierre as the founding father of social democracy. The origins of social democracy as a working-class movement have been traced to the 1860s, with the rise of the first major working-class party in Europe, the General German Workers' Association (ADAV) founded in 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle. The 1860s saw the concept of social democracy deliberately distinguishing itself from that of liberal democracy. As Theodore Draper explains in The Roots of American Communism, there were two competing social- democratic versions of socialism in 19th-century Europe, especially in Germany, where there was a rivalry over political influence between the Lassalleans and the Marxists. Although the latter theoretically won out by the late 1860s and Lassalle had died early in 1864, in practice the Lassallians won out as their national-style social democracy and reformist socialism influenced the revisionist development of the 1880s and 1910s. The year 1864 saw the founding of the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the First International. It brought together socialists of various stances and initially caused a conflict between Karl Marx and the anarchists, who were led by Mikhail Bakunin, over the role of the state in socialism, with Bakunin rejecting any role for the state. Another issue in the First International was the question of reformism and its role within socialism. Ferdinand Lassalle, founder of the General German Workers' Association Although Lassalle was not a Marxist, he was influenced by the theories of Marx and Friedrich Engels and accepted the existence and importance of class struggle. Unlike Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto, Lassalle promoted class struggle in a more moderate form. While Marx's theory of the state saw it negatively as an instrument of class rule that should only exist temporarily upon the rise to power of the proletariat and then dismantled, Lassalle accepted the state. Lassalle viewed the state as a means through which workers could enhance their interests and even transform the society to create an economy based on worker- run cooperatives. Lassalle's strategy was primarily electoral and reformist, with Lassalleans contending that the working class needed a political party that fought above all for universal adult male suffrage. A timeline showing the development of socialist parties in Germany before World War II, including its two bans The ADAV's party newspaper was called The Social Democrat (). Marx and Engels responded to the title Sozialdemocrat with distaste and Engels once writing: \\"But what a title: Sozialdemokrat! [...] Why do they not call the thing simply The Proletarian\\". Marx agreed with Engels that Sozialdemokrat was a bad title. Although the origins of the name Sozialdemokrat actually traced back to Marx's German translation in 1848 of the Democratic Socialist Party () into the Party of Social Democracy (), Marx did not like this French party because he viewed it as dominated by the middle class and associated the word Sozialdemokrat with that party. There was a Marxist faction within the ADAV represented by Wilhelm Liebknecht, who became one of the editors of the Der Sozialdemokrat. While democrats looked to the Revolutions of 1848 as a democratic revolution which in the long run ensured liberty, equality and fraternity, Marxists denounced 1848 as a betrayal of working-class ideals by a bourgeoisie indifferent to the legitimate demands of the proletariat. Faced with opposition from liberal capitalists to his socialist policies, Lassalle controversially attempted to forge a tactical alliance with the conservative aristocratic Junkers due to their communitarian anti-bourgeois attitudes as well as with Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Friction in the ADAV arose over Lassalle's policy of a friendly approach to Bismarck that had incorrectly presumed that Bismarck would in turn be friendly towards them. This approach was opposed by the party's faction associated with Marx and Engels, including Liebknecht. Opposition in the ADAV to Lassalle's friendly approach to Bismarck's government resulted in Liebknecht resigning from his position as editor of Die Sozialdemokrat and leaving the ADAV in 1865. In 1869, August Bebel and Liebknecht founded the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP) as a merger of the petty-bourgeois Saxon People's Party (SVP), a faction of the ADAV and members of the League of German Workers' Associations (VDA). Although the SDAP was not officially Marxist, it was the first major working-class organization to be led by Marxists and both Marx and Engels had direct association with the party. The party adopted stances similar to those adopted by Marx at the First International. There was intense rivalry and antagonism between the SDAP and the ADAV, with the SDAP being highly hostile to the Prussian government while the ADAV pursued a reformist and more cooperative approach. This rivalry reached its height involving the two parties' stances on the Franco-Prussian War, with the SDAP refusing to support Prussia's war effort by claiming it was an imperialist war pursued by Bismarck while the ADAV supported the war as a defensive one because it saw Emperor Napoleon III and France as an \\"overreacting aggressor\\". A Parisian barricade set up by revolutionary forces of the Paris Commune in March 1871 In the aftermath of the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, revolution broke out in France, with revolutionary army members along with working-class revolutionaries founding the Paris Commune. The Paris Commune appealed both to the citizens of Paris regardless of class as well as to the working class, a major base of support for the government, via militant rhetoric. In spite of such militant rhetoric to appeal to the working class, the Paris Commune received substantial support from the middle-class bourgeoisie of Paris, including shopkeepers and merchants. In part due to its sizeable number neo- Proudhonians and neo-Jacobins in the Central Committee, the Paris Commune declared that it was not opposed to private property, but that it rather hoped to create the widest distribution of it. The political composition of the Paris Commune included twenty-five neo-Jacobins, fifteen to twenty neo- Proudhonians and proto-syndicalists, nine or ten Blanquists, a variety of radical republicans and a few members of the First International influenced by Marx. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who had great influence on the social- democratic movement In the aftermath of the Paris Commune's collapse in 1871, Marx praised it in his work The Civil War in France (1871) for its achievements in spite of its pro-bourgeois influences and called it an excellent model of the dictatorship of the proletariat in practice as it had dismantled the apparatus of the bourgeois state, including its huge bureaucracy, military and executive, judicial and legislative institutions, replacing it with a working-class state with broad popular support. The Paris Commune's collapse and the persecution of its anarchist supporters had the effect of weakening the influence of the Bakuninist anarchists in the First International which resulted in Marx expelling the weakened rival Bakuninists from the International a year later. In Britain, the achievement of the legalization of trade unions under the Trade Union Act 1871 drew British trade unionists to believe that working conditions could be improved through parliamentary means. At the Hague Congress of 1872, Marx made a remark in which he admitted that while there are countries \\"where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means\\", in most European countries \\"the lever of our revolution must be force\\". In 1875, Marx attacked the Gotha Program that became the program of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP) in the same year in his Critique of the Gotha Program. Marx was not optimistic that Germany at the time was open to a peaceful means to achieve socialism, especially after German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had enacted the Anti- Socialist Laws in 1878. At the time of the Anti-Socialist Laws beginning to be drafted but not yet published in 1878, Marx spoke of the possibilities of legislative reforms by an elected government composed of working-class legislative members, but also of the willingness to use force should force be used against the working class. In his study England in 1845 and in 1885, Engels wrote a study that analysed the changes in the British class system from 1845 to 1885 in which he commended the Chartist movement for being responsible for the achievement of major breakthroughs for the working class. Engels stated that during this time Britain's industrial bourgeoisie had learned that \\"the middle class can never obtain full social and political power over the nation except by the help of the working class\\". In addition, he noticed a \\"gradual change over the relations between the two classes\\". This change he described was manifested in the change of laws in Britain that granted political changes in favour of the working class that the Chartist movement had demanded for years, arguing that they made a \\"near approach to 'universal suffrage,' at least such as it now exists in Germany\\". Sidney Webb, a prominent and influential leader within the Fabian socialist movement A major non-Marxian influence on social democracy came from the British Fabian Society. Founded in 1884 by Frank Podmore, it emphasized the need for a gradualist evolutionary and reformist approach to the achievement of socialism. The Fabian Society was founded as a splinter group from the Fellowship of the New Life due to opposition within that group to socialism. Unlike Marxism, Fabianism did not promote itself as a working-class movement and it largely had middle-class members. The Fabian Society published the Fabian Essays on Socialism (1889), substantially written by George Bernard Shaw. Shaw referred to Fabians as \\"all Social Democrats, with a common of the necessity of vesting the organization of industry and the material of production in a State identified with the whole people by complete Democracy\\". Other important early Fabians included Sidney Webb, who from 1887 to 1891 wrote the bulk of the Fabian Society's official policies. Fabianism would become a major influence on the British labour movement. = Second International era and reform or revolution dispute (1889‚Äì1914) = The social- democratic movement came into being through a division within the socialist movement. Starting in the 1880s and culminating in the 1910s and 1920s, there was a division within the socialist movement between those who insisted upon political revolution as a precondition for the achievement of socialist goals and those who maintained that a gradual or evolutionary path to socialism was both possible and desirable. German social democracy as exemplified by the SPD was the model for the world social-democratic movement. Keir Hardie, founder of the British Labour Party The influence of the Fabian Society in Britain grew in the British socialist movement in the 1890s, especially within the Independent Labour Party (ILP) founded in 1893. Important ILP members were affiliated with the Fabian Society, including Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald‚Äîthe future British Prime Minister. Fabian influence in British government affairs also emerged such as Fabian member Sidney Webb being chosen to take part in writing what became the Minority Report of the Royal Commission on Labour. While he was nominally a member of the Fabian Society, Hardie had close relations with certain Fabians such as Shaw while he was antagonistic to others such as the Webbs. As ILP leader, Hardie rejected revolutionary politics while declaring that he believed the party's tactics should be \\"as constitutional as the Fabians\\". Another important Fabian figure who joined the ILP was Robert Blatchford who wrote the work Merrie England (1894) that endorsed municipal socialism. Merrie England was a major publication that sold 750,000 copies within one year. In Merrie England, Blatchford distinguished two types of socialism, namely an ideal socialism and a practical socialism. Blatchford's practical socialism was a state socialism that identified existing state enterprise such as the Post Office run by the municipalities as a demonstration of practical socialism in action while claiming that practical socialism should involve the extension of state enterprise to the means of production as common property of the people. Although endorsing state socialism, Blatchford's Merrie England and his other writings were nonetheless influenced by anarcho-communist William Morris‚Äîas Blatchford himself attested to‚Äîand Morris' anarcho-communist themes are present in Merrie England. Shaw published the Report on Fabian Policy (1896) that declared: \\"The Fabian Society does not suggest that the State should monopolize industry as against private enterprise or individual initiative\\". Major developments in social democracy as a whole emerged with the ascendance of Eduard Bernstein as a proponent of reformist socialism and an adherent of Marxism. Bernstein had resided in Britain in the 1880s at the time when Fabianism was arising and is believed to have been strongly influenced by Fabianism. However, he publicly denied having strong Fabian influences on his thought. Bernstein did acknowledge that he was influenced by Kantian epistemological scepticism while he rejected Hegelianism. He and his supporters urged the SPD to merge Kantian ethics with Marxian political economy. On the role of Kantian criticism within socialism which \\"can serve as a pointer to the satisfying solution to our problem\\", Bernstein argued that \\"[o]ur critique must be direct against both a scepticism that undermines all theoretical thought, and a dogmatism that relies on ready-made formulas\\". An evolutionist rather than a revolutionist, his policy of gradualism rejected the radical overthrow of capitalism and advocated legal reforms through legislative democratic channels to achieve socialist objectives‚Äîi.e. social democracy must cooperatively work within existing capitalist societies to promote and foster the creation of socialist society. As capitalism grew stronger, Bernstein rejected the view of some orthodox Marxists that socialism would come after a catastrophic crisis of capitalism. He came to believe that rather than socialism developing with a social revolution, capitalism would eventually evolve into socialism through social reforms. Bernstein commended Marx's and Engels' later works which advocated that socialism should be achieved through parliamentary democratic means wherever possible. Karl Kautsky, a prominent orthodox Marxist thinker who was nicknamed as \\"the pope of Marxism\\" The term revisionist was applied to Bernstein by his critics, who referred to themselves as orthodox Marxists, although Bernstein claimed that his principles were consistent with Marx's and Engels' stances, especially in their later years when they advocated that socialism should be achieved through parliamentary democratic means wherever possible. Bernstein and his faction of revisionists criticized orthodox Marxism and particularly its founder Karl Kautsky for having disregarded Marx's view of the necessity of evolution of capitalism to achieve socialism by replacing it with an either/or polarization between capitalism and socialism, claiming that Kautsky disregarded Marx's emphasis on the role of parliamentary democracy in achieving socialism as well as criticizing Kautsky for his idealization of state socialism. Despite Bernstein and his revisionist faction's accusations, Kautsky did not deny a role for democracy in the achievement of socialism as he argued that Marx's dictatorship of the proletariat was not a form of government that rejected democracy as critics had claimed it was, but rather it was a state of affairs that Marx expected would arise should the proletariat gain power and be faced with fighting a violent reactionary opposition. Bernstein had held close association to Marx and Engels, but he saw flaws in Marxian thinking and began such criticism when he investigated and challenged the Marxian materialist theory of history. He rejected significant parts of Marxian theory that were based upon Hegelian metaphysics and also rejected the Hegelian dialectical perspective. Bernstein distinguished between early Marxism as being its immature form as exemplified by The Communist Manifesto, written by Marx and Engels in their youth, that he opposed for what he regarded as its violent Blanquist tendencies; and later Marxism as being its mature form that he supported. Bernstein declared that the massive and homogeneous working class claimed in The Communist Manifesto did not exist. Contrary to claims of a proletarian majority emerging, the middle class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx had claimed. Bernstein noted that rather than the working class being homogeneous, it was heterogeneous, with divisions and factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. In his work Theories of Surplus Value, Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was not disappearing, but his acknowledgement of this error is not well known due to the popularity of The Communist Manifesto and the relative obscurity of Theories of Surplus Value. Eduard Bernstein, a notable Marxist revisionist who supported reformism and liberal democracy Bernstein criticized Marxism's concept of \\"irreconciliable class conflicts\\" and Marxism's hostility to liberalism. He challenged Marx's position on liberalism by claiming that liberal democrats and social democrats held common grounds that he claimed could be utilized to create a \\"socialist republic\\". He believed that economic class disparities between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat would gradually be eliminated through legal reforms and economic redistribution programs. Bernstein rejected the Marxian principle of dictatorship of the proletariat, claiming that gradualist democratic reforms would improve the rights of the working class. According to Bernstein, social democracy did not seek to create a socialism separate from bourgeois society, but it instead sought to create a common development based on Western humanism. The development of socialism under social democracy does not seek to rupture existing society and its cultural traditions, but rather to act as an enterprise of extension and growth. Furthermore, he believed that class cooperation was a preferable course to achieve socialism than class conflict. Bernstein responded to critics that he was not destroying Marxism and instead claimed he was modernizing it as it was required \\"to separate the vital parts of Marx's theory from its outdated accessories\\". He asserted his support for the Marxian conception of a \\"scientifically based\\" socialist movement and said that such a movement's goals must be determined in accordance with \\"knowledge capable of objective proof, that is, knowledge which refers to, and conforms with, nothing but empirical knowledge and logic\\". Bernstein was also strongly opposed to dogmatism within the Marxist movement. Despite embracing a mixed economy, Bernstein was sceptical of welfare state policies, believing them to be helpful, but ultimately secondary to the main social-democratic goal of replacing capitalism with socialism, fearing that state aid to the unemployed might lead to the sanctioning of a new form of pauperism. Rosa Luxemburg, a Marxist who argued in favour of revolutionary socialism Representing revolutionary socialism, Rosa Luxemburg staunchly condemned Bernstein's revisionism and reformism for being based on \\"opportunism in social democracy\\". Luxemburg likened Bernstein's policies to that of the dispute between Marxists and the opportunistic Praktiker (\\"pragmatists\\"). She denounced Bernstein's evolutionary socialism for being a \\"petty-bourgeois vulgarization of Marxism\\" and claimed that Bernstein's years of exile in Britain had made him lose familiarity with the situation in Germany, where he was promoting evolutionary socialism. Luxemburg sought to maintain social democracy as a revolutionary Marxist creed. Both Kautsky and Luxemburg condemned Bernstein's philosophy of science as flawed for having abandoned Hegelian dialectics for Kantian philosophical dualism. Russian Marxist George Plekhanov joined Kautsky and Luxemburg in condemning Bernstein for having a neo-Kantian philosophy. Kautsky and Luxemburg contended that Bernstein's empiricist viewpoints depersonalized and dehistoricized the social observer and reducing objects down to facts. Luxemburg associated Bernstein with ethical socialists who she identified as being associated with the bourgeoisie and Kantian liberalism. In his introduction to the 1895 edition of Marx's The Class Struggles in France, Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist reformists and revolutionaries in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist measures while maintaining his belief that revolutionary seizure of power by the proletariat should remain a goal. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the revisionists. Engels' statements in the French newspaper Le Figaro in which he wrote that \\"revolution\\" and the \\"so-called socialist society\\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and argued that this made \\"us socialists all evolutionists\\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also argued that it would be \\"suicidal\\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring \\"social democracy into power as early as 1898\\". Engels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of The Class Struggles in France had been edited by Bernstein and Kautsky in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism. While highlighting The Communist Manifesto's emphasis on winning as a first step the \\"battle of democracy\\", Engels also wrote to Kautsky the following on 1 April 1895, four months before his death: After delivering a lecture in Britain to the Fabian Society titled \\"On What Marx Really Taught\\" in 1897, Bernstein wrote a letter to the orthodox Marxist August Bebel in which he revealed that he felt conflicted with what he had said at the lecture as well as revealing his intentions regarding revision of Marxism. What Bernstein meant was that he believed that Marx was wrong in assuming that the capitalist economy would collapse as a result of its internal contradictions as by the mid-1890s there was little evidence of such internal contradictions causing this to capitalism. In practice, the SPD \\"behaved as a Revisionist party and, at the same time, to condemn Revisionism; it continued to preach revolution and to practice reform\\", notwithstanding its \\"doctrinal Marxism\\". The SPD became a party of reform, with social democracy representing \\"a party that strives after the socialist transformation of society by the means of democratic and economic reforms\\". This has been described as central to the understanding of 20th-century social democracy. Jean Jaur√®s, a pacifist socialist and one of the historical leaders of the French Section of the Workers' International The dispute over policies in favour of reform or revolution dominated discussions at the 1899 Hanover Party Conference of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAPD). This issue had become especially prominent with the Millerand affair in France in which Alexandre Millerand of the Independent Socialists joined the non-socialist and liberal government of Prime Minister Waldeck-Rousseau without seeking support from his party's leadership. Millerand's actions provoked outrage amongst revolutionary socialists within the Second International, including the anarchist left and Jules Guesde's revolutionary Marxists. In response to these disputes over reform or revolution, the 1900 Paris Congress of the Second International declared a resolution to the dispute in which Guesde's demands were partially accepted in a resolution drafted by Kautsky that declared that overall socialists should not take part in a non-socialist government, but he provided exceptions to this rule where necessary to provide the \\"protection of the achievements of the working class\\". Another prominent figure who influenced social democracy was French revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist Jean Jaur√®s. During the 1904 Congress of the Second International, Jaur√®s challenged orthodox Marxist August Bebel, the mentor of Kautsky, over his promotion of monolithic socialist tactics. He claimed that no coherent socialist platform could be equally applicable to different countries and regions due to different political systems in them, noting that Bebel's homeland of Germany at the time was very authoritarian and had limited parliamentary democracy. Jaur√®s compared the limited political influence of socialism in government in Germany to the substantial influence that socialism had gained in France due to its stronger parliamentary democracy. He claimed that the example of the political differences between Germany and France demonstrated that monolithic socialist tactics were impossible, given the political differences of various countries. Meanwhile, the Australian Labor Party formed the world's first labour party government as well as the world's first social-democratic government at a national level in 1910. Previously, Chris Watson was prime minister for a few months in 1904, representing the first socialist democratically elected as the head of government. Eugene V. Debs, a prominent social-democrat leader and presidential candidate for the Socialist Party of America In spite of the two Red Scare periods which substantially hindered the development of the socialist movement, left-wing parties and labour and trade union movements which advocated or supported social-democratic policies have been popular and exerted their influence in American politics. These included the progressive movement and its namesake parties of 1912, 1924 and 1948, with the Progressive presidential campaign of former Republican Theodore Roosevelt winning 27.4% of the popular vote, compared to the Republican campaign of President William Howard Taft's 23.2% in the 1912 presidential election which was ultimately won by the progressive Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson, making Roosevelt the only third party presidential nominee in American history to finish with a higher share of the popular vote than a major party's presidential nominee. Furthermore, the city of Milwaukee has been led by a series of democratic socialist mayors from the Socialist Party of America, namely Frank Zeidler, Emil Seidel and Daniel Hoan. Socialist Party of America presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs obtained 5.99% of the popular vote in the 1912 presidential election, even managing to win nearly one million votes in the 1920 presidential election, despite Debs himself being imprisoned for alleged sedition at that time due to his opposition to World War I. While Wilson's philosophy of New Freedom was largely individualistic, Wilson's actual program resembled the more paternalistic ideals of Theodore Roosevelt ideas such that of New Nationalism, an extension of his earlier philosophy of the Square Deal, excluding the notion of reining in judges. In addition, Robert M. La Follette and Robert M. La Follette Jr. dominated Wisconsin's politics from 1924 to 1934. This included sewer socialism, an originally pejorative term for the socialist movement that centered in Wisconsin from around 1892 to 1960. It was coined by Morris Hillquit at the 1932 Milwaukee convention of the Socialist Party as a commentary on the Milwaukee socialists and their perpetual boasting about the excellent public sewer system in the city. Hillquit was running against Milwaukee mayor Dan Hoan for the position of National Chairman of the Socialist Party at the 1932 convention and the insult may have sprung up in that context. = World War I, revolutions and counter-revolutions (1914‚Äì1929) = Philipp Scheidemann, a revisionist-nationalist who supported the war As tensions between Europe's Great Powers escalated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Bernstein feared that Germany's arms race with other powers was increasing the possibility of a major European war. Bernstein's fears were ultimately proven to be prophetic when the outbreak of World War I occurred on 27 July 1914, just a month prior the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Immediately after the outbreak of World War I, Bernstein travelled from Germany to Britain to meet with Labour Party leader Ramsay MacDonald. While Bernstein regarded the outbreak of the war with great dismay and although the two countries were at war with one another, he was honoured at the meeting. In spite of Bernstein's and other social democrats' attempts to secure the unity of the Second International, with national tensions increasing between the countries at war, the Second International collapsed in 1914. Anti-war members of the SPD refused to support finances being given to the German government to support the war. However, a nationalist-revisionist faction of SPD members led by Friedrich Ebert, Gustav Noske and Philipp Scheidemann supported the war, arguing that Germany had the \\"right to its territorial defense\\" from the \\"destruction of Tsarist despotism\\". The SPD's decision to support the war, including Bernstein's decision to support it, was heavily influenced by the fact that the German government lied to the German people as it claimed that the only reason Germany had declared war on Russia was because Russia was preparing to invade East Prussia when in fact this was not the case. Jaur√®s opposed France's intervention in the war and took a pacifist stance, but he was soon assassinated on 31 July 1914 by French nationalist Raoul Villain. Bernstein soon resented the war and by October 1914 was convinced of the German government's war guilt and contacted the orthodox Marxists of the SPD to unite to push the SPD to take an anti-war stance. Kautsky attempted to put aside his differences with Bernstein and join forces in opposing the war and Kautsky praised him for becoming a firm anti-war proponent, saying that although Bernstein had previously supported civic and liberal forms of nationalism, his committed anti-war position made him the \\"standard-bearer of the internationalist idea of social democracy\\". The nationalist position by the SPD leadership under Ebert refused to rescind. Ramsay MacDonald, prime minister of the United Kingdom (1929‚Äì1935) In Britain, the British Labour Party became divided on the war. Labour Party leader Ramsay MacDonald was one of a handful of British MPs who had denounced Britain's declaration of war on Germany. MacDonald was denounced by the pro-war press on accusations that he was pro-German and a pacifist, both charges that he denied. In response to pro-war sentiments in the Labour Party, MacDonald resigned from being its leader and associated himself with the Independent Labour Party. Arthur Henderson became the new leader of the Labour Party and served as a cabinet minister in prime minister Asquith's war government. After the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia in which the Tsarist regime in Russia was overthrown, MacDonald visited the Russian Provisional Government in June 1917, seeking to persuade Russia to oppose the war and seek peace. His efforts to unite the Russian Provisional Government against the war failed after Russia fell back into political violence resulting in the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks led Vladimir Lenin's rise to power. Although MacDonald critically responded to the Bolsheviks' political violence and rise to power by warning of \\"the danger of anarchy in Russia\\", he gave political support to the Bolshevik regime until the end of the war because he thought that a democratic internationalism could be revived. The British Labour Party's trade union affiliated membership soared during World War I. With the assistance of Sidney Webb, Henderson designed a new constitution for the Labour Party in which it adopted a strongly left-wing platform in 1918 to ensure that it would not lose support to the newly founded Communist Party of Great Britain, exemplified by Clause IV of the constitution. Friedrich Ebert, president of Germany (1919‚Äì1925) The overthrow of the tsarist regime in Russia in February 1917 impacted politics in Germany as it ended the legitimation used by Ebert and other pro-war SPD members that Germany was in the war against a reactionary Russian government. With the overthrow of the tsar and revolutionary socialist agitation increased in Russia, such events influenced socialists in Germany. With rising bread shortages in Germany amid war rationing, mass strikes occurred beginning in April 1917 with 300,000 strikers taking part in a strike in Berlin. The strikers demanded bread, freedom, peace and the formation of workers' councils as was being done in Russia. Amidst the German public's uproar, the SPD alongside the Progressives and the Catholic labour movement in the Reichstag put forward the Peace Resolution on 19 July 1917 that called for a compromise peace to end the war which was passed by a majority of members of the Reichstag. The German High Command opposed the Peace Resolution, but it did seek to end the war with Russia and presented the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to the Bolshevik government in 1918 that agreed to the terms and the Reichstag passed the treaty which included the support of the SPD, the Progressives and the Catholic political movement. By late 1918, the war situation for Germany had become hopeless and Kaiser Wilhelm II was pressured to make peace. Wilhelm II appointed a new cabinet that included SPD members. At the same time, the Imperial Naval Command was determined to make a heroic last stand against the British Royal Navy. On 24 October 1918, it issued orders for the German Navy to depart to confront, but the sailors refused, resulting in the Kiel mutiny. The Kiel mutiny resulted in revolution. Faced with military failure and revolution, Prince Maximilian of Baden resigned, giving SPD leader Ebert the position of Chancellor. Wihelm II abdicated the German throne immediately afterwards and the German High Command officials Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff resigned whilst refusing to end the war to save face, leaving the Ebert government and the SPD-majority Reichstag to be forced to make the inevitable peace with the Allies and take the blame for having lost the war. With the abdication of Wilhelm II, Ebert declared Germany to be a republic and signed the armistice that ended World War I on 11 November 1918. The new social democratic government in Germany faced political violence in Berlin by a movement of communist revolutionaries known as the Spartacist League, who sought to repeat the feat of Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Russia by overthrowing the German government. Tensions between the governing majority of Social Democrats led by Ebert versus the strongly left-wing elements of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and communists over Ebert's refusal to immediately reform the German Army resulted in the January rising by the newly formed Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the USPD which saw communists mobilizing a large workers' demonstration. The SPD responded by holding a counter-demonstration that was effective in demonstrating support for the government and the USPD soon withdrew its support for the rising. However, the communists continued to revolt and between 12 and 28 January 1919 communist forces had seized control of several government buildings in Berlin. Ebert responded by requesting that defense minister Gustav Noske take charge of loyal soldiers to fight the communists and secure the government. Ebert was furious with the communists' intransigence and said that he wished \\"to teach the radicals a lesson they would never forget\\". The Freikorps, the anti-communist right-wing paramilitary which Social Democrat defence minister Gustav Noske used to bloodily suppress the communist uprisings of the late 1918 and early 1919 Noske was able to rally groups of mostly reactionary former soldiers, known as the Freikorps, who were eager to fight the communists. The situation soon went completely out of control when the recruited Freikorps went on a violent rampage against workers and murdered the communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. The atrocities by the government-recruited Freikorps against the communist revolutionaries badly tarnished the reputation of the SPD and strengthened the confidence of reactionary forces. In spite of this, the SPD was able to win the largest number of seats in the 1919 federal election and Ebert was elected president of Germany. However, the USPD refused to support the government in response to the atrocities committed by the SPD government-recruited Freikorps. Due to the unrest in Berlin, the drafting of the constitution of the new German republic was undertaken in the city of Weimar and the following political era is referred to as the Weimar Republic. Upon founding the new government, President Ebert cooperated with liberal members of his coalition government to create the Weimar constitution and sought to begin a program of nationalization of some sectors of the economy. Political unrest and violence continued and the government's continued reliance on the help of the far-right and counter-revolutionary Freikorps militias to fight the revolutionary Spartacists further alienated potential left-wing support for the SPD. The SPD coalition government's acceptance of the harsh peace conditions of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919 infuriated the German right, including the Freikorps that had previously been willing to cooperate with the government to fight the Spartacists. In March 1920, a group of right-wing militarists led by Wolfgang Kapp and former German military chief-of-staff Erich Ludendorff initiated a briefly successful putsch against the German government in what became known as the Kapp Putsch, but the putsch ultimately failed and the government was restored. In the 1920 German federal election, the SPD's share of the vote significantly declined due to their previous ties to the Freikorps. Noe Zhordania (man with white beard and wearing a white hat on the left side of the car), prime minister of the newly independent Georgia, attending a meeting of the Labour and Socialist International in 1920 After World War I, several attempts were made at a global level to refound the Second International that collapsed amidst national divisions in the war. The Vienna International formed in 1921 attempted to end the rift between reformist socialists, including social democrats; and revolutionary socialists, including communists, particularly the Mensheviks. However, a crisis soon erupted which involved the new country of Georgia led by a social- democratic government led by president Noe Zhordania that had declared itself independent from Russia in 1918 and whose government had been endorsed by multiple social-democratic parties. At the founding meeting of the Vienna International, the discussions were interrupted by the arrival of a telegram from Zhordania who said that Georgia was being invaded by Bolshevik Russia. Delegates attending the International's founding meeting were stunned, particularly the Bolshevik representative from Russia Mecheslav Bronsky, who refused to believe this and left the meeting to seek confirmation of this. Upon confirmation, Bronsky did not return to the meeting. Menshevik leaders Pavel Axelrod, Julius Martov and Alexander Martinov in Stockholm The overall response from the Vienna International was divided. The Mensheviks demanded that the Vienna International immediately condemn Russia's aggression against Georgia, but the majority as represented by German delegate Alfred Henke sought to exercise caution and said that the delegates should wait for confirmation. Russia's invasion of Georgia completely violated the non- aggression treaty signed between Lenin and Zhordania as well as violating Georgia's sovereignty by annexing Georgia directly into the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Tensions between Bolsheviks and social democrats worsened with the Kronstadt rebellion. This was caused by unrest among leftists against the Bolshevik government in Russia. Russian social democrats distributed leaflets calling for a general strike against the Bolshevik regime and the Bolsheviks responded by forcefully repressing the rebels. Relations between the social-democratic movement and Bolshevik Russia descended into complete antagonism in response to the Russian famine of 1921 and the Bolsheviks' violent repression of opposition to their government. Multiple social-democratic parties were disgusted with Russia's Bolshevik regime, particularly Germany's SPD and the Netherlands' Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) that denounced the Bolsheviks for defiling socialism and declared that the Bolsheviks had \\"driven out the best of our comrades, thrown them into prison and put them to death\\". In May 1923, social democrats united to found their own international, the Labour and Socialist International (LSI), founded in Hamburg, Germany. The LSI declared that all its affiliated political parties would retain autonomy to make their own decisions regarding internal affairs of their countries, but that international affairs would be addressed by the LSI. The LSI addressed the issue of the rise of fascism by declaring the LSI to be anti-fascist. In response to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 between the democratically elected Republican government versus the authoritarian right-wing Nationalists led by Francisco Franco with the support of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the Executive Committee of the LSI declared not only its support for the Spanish Republic, but also that it supported the Spanish government having the right to purchase arms to fight Franco's Nationalist forces. LSI-affiliated parties, including the British Labour Party, declared their support for the Spanish Republic. The LSI was criticized on the left for failing to put its anti-fascist rhetoric into action. = Great Depression era and World War II (1929‚Äì1945) = Hjalmar Branting, prime minister of Sweden (1921‚Äì1923, 1924‚Äì1925) The stock market crash of 1929 that began an economic crisis in the United States that globally spread and became the Great Depression profoundly affected economic policy-making. The collapse of the gold standard and the emergence of mass unemployment resulted in multiple governments recognizing the need for macroeconomic state intervention to reduce unemployment as well as economic intervention to stabilize prices, a proto-Keynesianism that John Maynard Keynes himself would soon publicly endorse. Multiple social-democratic parties declared the need for substantial investment in economic infrastructure projects to respond to unemployment and creating social control over currency flow. Furthermore, social-democratic parties declared that the Great Depression demonstrated the need for substantial macroeconomic planning by the state while their free market opponents staunchly opposed this. Attempts by social-democratic governments to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the ensuing political instability in their countries caused by the depression. The British Labour Party became internally split over said policies while Germany's SPD government did not have the time to implement such policies as Germany's politics degenerated into violent civil unrest pitting the left against the right in which the Nazi Party rose to power in January 1933 and violently dismantled parliamentary democracy for the next twelve years. Hjalmar Branting, leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) from its founding to his death in 1925, asserted: \\"I believe that one benefits the workers so much more by forcing through reforms which alleviate and strengthen their position, than by saying that only a revolution can help them\\". A major development for social democracy was the victory of several social-democratic parties in Scandinavia, particularly the SAP in the 1920 general election. Elected to a minority government, the SAP created a Socialization Committee that supported a mixed economy combining the best of private initiative with social ownership or control, supporting a substantial socialization \\"of all necessary natural resources, industrial enterprises, credit institutions, transportation and communication routes\\" that would be gradually transferred to the state. It permitted private ownership of the means of production outside of these areas. Mohandas Gandhi, here meeting with female textile workers in Britain, was a leadership figure of India's anti-colonial Indian National Congress, a social- democratic party still active In 1922, Ramsay MacDonald returned to the leadership of the Labour Party after his brief tenure in the Independent Labour Party. In the 1924 general election, the Labour Party won a plurality of seats and was elected as a minority government, but required assistance from the Liberal Party to achieve a majority in parliament. Opponents of Labour falsely accused the party of Bolshevik sympathies. Prime minister MacDonald responded to these allegations by stressing the party's commitment to reformist gradualism and openly opposing the radical wing in the party. MacDonald emphasized that the Labour minority government's first and foremost commitment was to uphold democratic and responsible government over all other policies. MacDonald emphasized this because he knew that any attempt to pass major socialist legislation in a minority government would endanger the new government as it would be opposed and blocked by the Conservatives and the Liberals, who together held a majority of seats. Labour had risen to power in the aftermath of Britain's severe recession of 1921‚Äì1922. With the economy beginning to recover, British trade unions demanded that their wages be restored from the cuts they took in the recession. The trade unions soon became deeply dissatisfied with the MacDonald government and labour unrest and threat of strikes arose in transportation sector, including docks and railways. MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government, whose most controversial action was having Britain recognize the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British conservative tabloid press, including the Daily Mail, used this to promote a red scare by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies. Labour lost the 1924 general election and a Conservative government was elected. Although MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the Labour Party stabilized as a capable opposition to the Conservative government by 1927. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled Labour and the Nation (1928). Labour returned to government in 1929, but it soon had to deal with the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929. Rudolf Hilferding, a major figure and policymaker in the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Czechoslovak Sopade In the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist Rudolf Hilferding proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social-democratic and socialist theory. Hilferding was an influential Marxian socialist both inside the social democratic movement and outside, with his pamphlet titled Imperialism influencing Lenin's own conception of imperialism in the 1910s. Prior to the 1920s, Hilferding declared that capitalism had evolved beyond what had been laissez-faire capitalism into what he called organized capitalism. Organized capitalism was based upon trusts and cartels controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make profit within their countries' national boundaries and therefore needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism. Hilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that \\"in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state\\". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism. Originally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. By the 1920s, Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organized capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that organised capitalism is nothing less than \\"the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production\\". He went on to say that \\"the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state\\". By the 1930s, social democracy became seen as overwhelmingly representing reformist socialism and supporting liberal democracy, influenced by Carlo Rosselli, an anti-fascist and social democrat in the liberal socialist tradition. Despite advocating reformism rather than revolution as means for socialism, those social democrats had supported political revolutions to establish liberal democracy such as in Russia and social-democratic parties both in exile and in parliaments supported the forceful overthrow of fascist regimes such as in Germany, Italy and Spain. In the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards liberal socialism. After the party was banned by the Nazis in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through Sopade. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism. Curt Geyer, who was a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of Weimar Republic social democracy, liberal-democratic socialism and stated that the Sopade had held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism. Willy Brandt is a social democrat that has been identified as a liberal socialist. Alva Myrdal, a prominent figure in the Swedish Social Democratic Party in the 1930s and a pioneer in the development of the welfare state in Sweden The only social-democratic governments in Europe that remained by the early 1930s were in Scandinavia. In the 1930s, several Swedish social- democratic leadership figures, including former Swedish prime minister and secretary and chairman of the Socialization Committee Rickard Sandler and Nils Karleby, rejected earlier SAP socialization policies pursued in the 1920s for being too extreme. Karleby and Sandler developed a new conception of social democracy known as the Nordic model which called for gradual socialization and redistribution of purchasing power, provision of educational opportunity and support of property rights. The Nordic model would permit private enterprise on the condition that it adheres to the principle that the resources it disposes are in reality public means and would create of a broad category of social welfare rights. The new SAP government of 1932 replaced the previous government's universal commitment to a balanced budget with a Keynesian-like commitment which in turn was replaced with a balanced budget within a business cycle. Whereas the 1921‚Äì1923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 and the resulting economic recovery. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938. However, this policy was criticized because major unemployment still remained a problem in Sweden, even when the budget deficit had been eliminated. L√°zaro C√°rdenas, president of Mexico (1934‚Äì1940) In the Americas, social democracy was rising as a major political force. In Mexico, several social-democratic governments and presidents were elected from the 1920s to the 1930s. The most important Mexican social- democratic government of this time was that led by president L√°zaro C√°rdenas and the Party of the Mexican Revolution, whose government initiated agrarian reform that broke up vast aristocratic estates and redistributed property to peasants. While deeply committed to social democracy, Cardenas was criticized by his left-wing opponents for being pro-capitalist due to his personal association with a wealthy family and for being corrupt due to his government's exemption from agrarian reform of the estate held by former Mexican president √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. Political violence in Mexico escalated in the 1920s after the outbreak of the Cristero War in which far-right reactionary clerics staged a violent insurgency against the left-wing government that was attempting to institute secularization in Mexico. Cardenas' government openly supported Spain's Republican government while opposing Francisco Franco's Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and he staunchly asserted that Mexico was progressive and socialist, working with socialists of various types, including communists. Under C√°rdenas, Mexico accepted refugees from Spain and communist dissident Leon Trotsky after Joseph Stalin expelled Trotsky and sought to have him and his followers killed. C√°rdenas strengthened the rights of Mexico's labour movement, nationalized the property of foreign oil companies (which was later used to create PEMEX, Mexico's national petroleum company) and controversially supported peasants in their struggle against landlords by allowing them to form armed militias to fight the private armies of landlords in the country. C√°rdenas' actions deeply outraged rightists and far-right reactionaries as there were fears that Mexico would once again descend into civil war. Subsequently, he stepped down from the Mexican presidency and supported the compromise presidential candidate Manuel √Åvila Camacho, who held support from business interests, in order to avoid further antagonizing the right. Canada and the United States represent an unusual case in the Western world. While having a social-democratic movement, both countries were not governed by a social-democratic party at the federal level. In American politics, democratic socialism became more recently a synonym for social democracy due to social-democratic policies being adopted by progressive intellectuals such as Herbert Croly, John Dewey and Lester Frank Ward as well as liberal politicians such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and Woodrow Wilson, causing the New Deal coalition to be the main entity spearheading left-wing reforms of capitalism, rather than by socialists like elsewhere. CCF founding meeting in 1933 Similarly, the welfare state in Canada was developed by the Liberal Party of Canada. Nonetheless, the social- democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the precursor to the social-democratic New Democratic Party (NDP), had significant success in provincial Canadian politics. In 1944, the Saskatchewan CCF formed the first socialist government in North America and its leader Tommy Douglas is known for having spearheaded the adoption of Canada's nationwide system of universal healthcare called Medicare. The NDP obtained its best federal electoral result to date in the 2011 Canadian general election, becoming for the first time the Official Opposition until the 2015 Canadian general election. Franklin D. Roosevelt, president of the United States (1933‚Äì1945), whose New Deal policies were inspired by social democracy Although well within the liberal and modern liberal American tradition, Franklin D. Roosevelt's more radical, extensive and populist Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats led by Roman Catholic politician and former presidential candidate Al Smith fought back along with the American Liberty League, savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him and his policies with Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. This allowed Roosevelt to isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy landed interests that opposed the New Deal, strengthening Roosevelt's political capital and becoming one of the key causes of his landslide victory in the 1936 presidential election. By contrast, already with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, \\"the most significant and radical bill of the period\\", there was an upsurge in labour insurgency and radical organization. Those labour unions were energized by the passage of the Wagner Act, signing up millions of new members and becoming a major backer of Roosevelt's presidential campaigns in 1936, 1940 and 1944. Conservatives feared the New Deal meant socialism and Roosevelt privately noted in 1934 that the \\"old line press harps increasingly on state socialism and demands the return to the good old days\\". In his 1936 Madison Square Garden speech, Roosevelt pledged to continue the New Deal and criticized those who were putting their greed, personal gain and politics over national economic recovery from the Great Depression. In the speech, Roosevelt also described forces which he labeled as \\"the old enemies of peace: business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering\\" and went on to claim that these forces were united against his candidacy, that \\"[t]hey are unanimous in their hate for me ‚Äî and I welcome their hatred\\". In 1941, Roosevelt advocated freedom from want and freedom from fear as part of his Four Freedoms goal. In 1944, Roosevelt called for a Second Bill of Rights that would have expanded many social and economic rights for the workers such as the right for every American to have access to a job and universal healthcare. This economic bill of rights was taken up as a mantle by the People's Program for 1944 of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a platform that has been described as \\"aggressive social-democratic\\" for the post-war era. Harry S. Truman, president of the United States (1945‚Äì1953), whose Fair Deal was a continuation and expansion of the New Deal While criticized by many leftists and hailed by mainstream observers as having saved American capitalism from a socialist revolution, many communists, socialists and social democrats admired Roosevelt and supported the New Deal, including politicians and activists of European social-democratic parties such as the British Labour Party and the French Section of the Workers' International. After initially rejecting the New Deal as part of its ultra-leftist sectarian Third Period that equated social democracy with fascism, the Communist International had to concede and admit the merits of Roosevelt's New Deal by 1935. Although critical of Roosevelt, arguing that he never embraced \\"our essential [conception of] socialism\\", Socialist Party leader Norman Thomas viewed Roosevelt's program for reform of the economic system as far more reflective of the Socialist Party platform than of the Democratic Party's platform. Thomas acknowledged that Roosevelt built a welfare state by adopting \\"ideas and proposals formerly called 'socialist' and voiced in our platforms beginning with Debs in 1900\\". Harry S. Truman, Roosevelt's successor after his death on 12 April 1945, called for universal health care as part of the Fair Deal, an ambitious set of proposals to continue and expand the New Deal, but strong and determined conservative opposition from both parties in Congress blocked such policy from being enacted. The details of the plan became the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill, but they were never rolled out because the bill never even received a vote in Congress and Truman later described it as the greatest disappointment of his presidency. The British Labour Party released an \\"exultant statement\\" upon Truman's upset victory. It stated that \\"[w]e are not suggesting that Mr. Truman is a Socialist. It is precisely because he is not that his adumbration of these policies is significant. They show that the failure of capitalism to serve the common man [...] is not, after all, something we invented [...] to exasperate Mr. Churchill\\". Truman argued that socialism is a \\"scare word\\" used by Republicans and \\"the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies\\" to refer to \\"almost anything that helps all the people\\". Michael Joseph Savage, prime minister of New Zealand (1935‚Äì1940) and architect of New Zealand's Social Security Act 1938 In Oceania, Michael Joseph Savage of the New Zealand Labour Party became prime minister on 6 December 1935, marking the beginning of Labour's first term in office. The new government quickly set about implementing a number of significant reforms, including a reorganization of the social welfare system and the creation of the state housing scheme. Workers benefited from the introduction of the forty hour week and legislation making it easier for unions to negotiate on their behalf. Savage was highly popular with the working classes and his portrait could be found on the walls of many houses around the country. At this time, the Labour Party pursued an alliance with the MƒÅori RƒÅtana movement. Meanwhile, the opposition attacked the Labour Party's more left-wing policies and accused it of undermining free enterprise and hard work. The year after Labour's first win, the Reform Party and the United Party took their coalition to the next step, agreeing to merge with each other. The combined organization was named the National Party and would be Labour's main rival in future years. Labour also faced opposition from within its ranks. While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the so-called \\"doctrinaire\\" Harry Holland, had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. However, some within the party were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably John A. Lee, whose views were a mixture of socialism and social credit theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party's leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party's rank and file. After a long and bitter dispute, Lee was expelled from the party, establishing his own breakaway Democratic Labour Party. Savage died in 1940 and was replaced by Peter Fraser, who became Labour's longest-serving prime minister. Fraser is best known as New Zealand's leader for most of World War II. In the post-war period, ongoing shortages and industrial problems cost Labour considerable popularity and the National Party under Sidney Holland gained ground, although Labour was able to win the 1943 and 1946 general elections. Eventually, Labour was defeated in the 1949 general election. Fraser died shortly afterwards and was replaced by Walter Nash, the long-serving minister of finance. = Cold War era and post-war consensus (1945‚Äì1973) = After World War II, a new international organization called the Socialist International was formed in 1951 to represent social democracy and a democratic socialism in opposition to Soviet-style socialism. In the founding Frankfurt Declaration on 3 July, its Aims and Tasks of Democratic Socialism: Declaration of the Socialist International denounced both capitalism and Bolshevism, better known as Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and referred to as Communism‚Äîcriticizing the latter in articles 7, 8, 9 and 10. The rise of Keynesianism in the Western world during the Cold War influenced the development of social democracy. The attitude of social democrats towards capitalism changed as a result of the rise of Keynesianism. Capitalism was acceptable to social democrats only if capitalism's typical crises could be prevented and if mass unemployment could be averted, therefore Keynesianism was believed to be able to provide this. Social democrats came to accept the market for reasons of efficiency and endorsed Keynesianism as that was expected to reconcile democracy and capitalism. According to Michael Harrington, this represented a compromise between capitalism and socialism. While the post-war period of social democracy saw several social-democratic parties renouncing orthodox Marxism, they did not lose their revisionist Marxist character, nor did they stop looking at Marx for inspiration such as in the form of Marxist humanism. However, Marxism was associated with the Marxism‚ÄìLeninism as practized in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc which social democracy rejected and regarded as \\"falsely claim[ing] a share in the Socialist tradition. In fact it has distorted that tradition beyond recognition\\". Rather than a close or dogmatic Marxism, social democracy favours an open and \\"critical spirit of Marxism\\". For Harrington, social democracy believes that capitalism be reformed from within and that gradually a socialist economy will be created. The \\"social democratic compromise\\" involving Keynesianism led to a capitalism under socialist governments that would generate such growth that the surplus would make possible \\"an endless improvement of the quality of social life\\". According to Harrington, the socialists had become the \\"normal party of government\\" in Europe while their \\"conservative opponents were forced to accept measures they had once denounced on principle\\". Although this socialist pragmatism led in theory and practice to utopias hostile to one another, they all shared basic assumptions. This \\"social democratic compromise\\" goes back to the 1930s, when there was \\"a ferment in the movement, a break with the old either/or Kautskyan tradition, a new willingness to develop socialist programs that could work with and modify capitalism, but that fell far short of a \\"revolutionary\\" transformation\\". Clement Attlee, prime minister of the United Kingdom (1945‚Äì1951) After the 1945 general election, a Labour government was formed by Clement Attlee. Attlee immediately began a program of major nationalization of the economy. From 1945 to 1951, the Labour government nationalized the Bank of England, civil aviation, cable and wireless, coal, transport, electricity, gas and iron and steel. This policy of major nationalizations gained support from the left faction within the Labour Party that saw the nationalizations as achieving the transformation of Britain from a capitalist to socialist economy. The Labour government's nationalizations were staunchly condemned by the opposition Conservative Party. The Conservatives defended private enterprise and accused the Labour government of intending to create a Soviet-style centrally planned socialist state. Despite these accusations, the Labour government's three Chancellors of the Exchequer, namely Hugh Dalton, Stafford Cripps and Hugh Gaitskell, all opposed Soviet-style central planning. Initially, there were strong direct controls by the state in the economy that had already been implemented by the British government during World War II, but after the war these controls gradually loosened under the Labour government and were eventually phased out and replaced by Keynesian demand management. In spite of opposition by the Conservatives to the nationalizations, all of the nationalizations except for that of coal and iron soon became accepted in a national post-war consensus on the economy that lasted until the Thatcher era in the late 1970s, when the national consensus turned towards support of privatization. The Labour Party lost the 1951 general election and a Conservative government was formed. There were early major critics of the nationalization policy within the Labour Party in the 1950s. In The Future of Socialism (1956), British social-democratic theorist Anthony Crosland argued that socialism should be about the reforming of capitalism from within. Crosland claimed that the traditional socialist programme of abolishing capitalism on the basis of capitalism inherently causing immiseration had been rendered obsolete by the fact that the post-war Keynesian capitalism had led to the expansion of affluence for all, including full employment and a welfare state. He claimed that the rise of such an affluent society had resulted in class identity fading and as a consequence socialism in its traditional conception as then supported by the British Labour Party was no longer attracting support. Crosland claimed that the Labour Party was associated in the public's mind as having \\"a sectional, traditional, class appeal\\" that was reinforced by bickering over nationalization. He argued that in order for the Labour Party to become electable again it had to drop its commitment to nationalization and to stop equating nationalization with socialism. Instead of this, Crosland claimed that a socialist programme should be about support of social welfare, redistribution of wealth and \\"the proper dividing line between the public and private spheres of responsibility\\". In post-war Germany, the SPD endorsed a similar policy on nationalizations to that of the British Labour government. SPD leader Kurt Schumacher declared that the SPD was in favour of nationalizations of key industrial sectors of the economy such as banking and credit, insurance, mining, coal, iron, steel, metal- working and all other sectors that were identified as monopolistic or cartelized. Upon becoming a sovereign state in 1947, India elected the social democratic Indian National Congress into government, with its leader Jawaharlal Nehru becoming the Indian prime minister. Upon his election as prime minister, Nehru declared: \\"In Europe, we see many countries have advanced very far on the road to socialism. I am not referring to the communist countries but to those which may be called parliamentary, social democratic countries\\". While in power, Nehru's government emphasized state- guided national development of India and took inspiration from social democracy, although India's newly formed Planning Commission also took inspiration from post-1949 China's agricultural policies. In 1949, the newly independent and sovereign state of Israel elected the social-democratic Mapai. The party sought the creation of a grassroots mixed economy based on cooperative ownership of the means of production via the kibbutz system while rejecting nationalization of the means of production. The kibbutz are producer cooperatives which have flourished in Israel through government assistance. Willy Brandt, Chancellor of Germany (1969‚Äì1974) In 1959, the SPD instituted a major policy review with the Godesberg Program. The Godesberg Program eliminated the party's remaining orthodox Marxist policies and the SPD redefined its ideology as freiheitlicher Sozialismus (liberal socialism). With the adoption of the Godesberg Program, the SPD renounced orthodox Marxist determinism and classism. The SPD replaced it with an ethical socialism based on humanism and emphasized that the party was democratic, pragmatic and reformist. The most controversial decision of the Godesberg Program was its declaration stating that private ownership of the means of production \\"can claim protection by society as long as it does not hinder the establishment of social justice\\". By accepting free-market principles, the SPD argued that a truly free market would in fact have to be a regulated market to not to degenerate into oligarchy. This policy also meant the endorsement of Keynesian economic management, social welfare and a degree of economic planning. Some argue that this was an abandonment of the classical conception of socialism as involving the replacement of the capitalist economic system. It declared that the SPD \\"no longer considered nationalization the major principle of a socialist economy but only one of several (and then only the last) means of controlling economic concentration of power of key industries\\" while also committing the SPD to an economic stance which promotes \\"as much competition as possible, as much planning as necessary\\". The decision to abandon the traditional anti-capitalist policy angered many in the SPD who had supported it. After these changes, the SPD enacted the two major pillars of what would become the modern social-democratic program, namely making the party a people's party rather than a party solely representing the working class and abandoning remaining Marxist policies aimed at destroying capitalism and replacing them with policies aimed at reforming capitalism. The Godesberg Program divorced its conception of socialism from Marxism, declaring that democratic socialism in Europe was \\"rooted in Christian ethics, humanism, and classical philosophy\\". The Godesberg Program has been seen as involving the final victory of the reformist agenda of Eduard Bernstein over the orthodox Marxist agenda of Karl Kautsky. The Godesberg Program was a major revision of the SPD's policies and gained attention from beyond Germany. At the time of its adoption, the stance on the Godesberg Program in neighbouring France was not uniform. While the French Section of the Workers' International was divided on the Godesberg Program, the Unified Socialist Party denounced the Godesberg Program as a renunciation of socialism and an opportunistic reaction to the SPD's electoral defeats. Economist John Kenneth Galbraith has been described as an \\"American liberal but European social democrat\\". For Galbraith, \\"it was possible to see social democracy as fulfilling its promise to be the extension and successor of liberalism\\" because \\"it sought to universalize the benefits of Western societies to all their citizens\\" and therefore \\"to make their economies work in the public interest\\". John F. Kennedy has been called \\"the first Keynesian president\\" and socialists such as Michael Harrington were called to assist the Kennedy administration's New Frontier and the Johnson administration's War on Poverty and Great Society social programs during the 1960s. Socialists such as A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin and Martin Luther King Jr. also played important roles in the civil rights movement. The Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA), an association of reformist democratic socialists and social democrats, was founded in 1972. The Socialist Party had stopped running independent presidential candidates and begun reforming itself towards Keynesian social democracy. Consequently, the party's name was changed because it had confused the public. With the name change in place, the SDUSA clarified its vision to Americans who confused social democracy with authoritarian socialism and communism in the form of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, harsly opposed by the SDUSA. Olof Palme, prime minister of Sweden (1969‚Äì1976, 1982‚Äì1986) During the 1970s, the Swedish Rehn‚ÄìMeidner model allowed capitalists who were owning highly productive and efficient firms to retain excess profits at the expense of the firms' workers, exacerbating income inequality and causing workers in these firms to agitate for a share of the profits in the 1970s. At the same time, women working in the public sector also began to assert pressure for better wages. Under the leadership of \\"revolutionary reformist\\" and self-described democratic socialist prime minister Olof Palme, economist Rudolf Meidner established in 1976 a study committee that came up with a proposal, called the Meidner Plan. It entailed the transferring of the excess profits into investment funds controlled by the workers in the efficient firms, with the intention that the firms would create further employment and pay more workers higher wages rather than unduly increasing the wealth of company owners and managers. Earlier in the 1960s, Einar Gerhardsen established a planning agency and tried to establish a planned economy. In 1982, the Social Democratic government adopted the Meidner Plan of Meidner to pursue a gradualist socialist agenda to first pursue the enhancement of political democracy and citizenship; second, to pursue entrenching social rights; and third, to then be able to implement economic democracy and social ownership. The plan focused on a twenty percent annual taxation of private enterprise to be used to create investment funds that were to be owned collectively by employees. Meidner stated that his plan was a gradualist socialism that would result in wage-earners gaining a controlling share in their enterprises within twenty-five to fifty years. The Meidner Plan was cancelled after the Social Democrats were defeated in the 1991 general election to a conservative government that scrapped the plan. Capitalists and conservatives had immediately denounced this proposal as \\"creepy socialism\\" and launched an unprecedented opposition and smear campaign against it, including the threat of calling off the class compromise established in the 1938 Saltsj√∂baden Agreement. The social democracy practized by parties such as the Singaporean People's Action Party (PAP) during its first few decades in power were of a pragmatic kind as characterized by its rejection of nationalization. Despite this, the PAP still claimed to be a socialist party, pointing out its regulation of the private sector, state intervention in the economy and social policies as evidence of this. The Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew also stated that he has been influenced by the democratic socialist British Labour Party. Originally, there was infighting between moderates and radicals, including a left-wing and communist wing in the party which saw many imprisoned. While being the most right-wing of the Singaporean parties, the party has been described as centre-left and at times adopted a left tack in certain areas in order to remain electorally dominant. = Response to neoliberalism and Third Way (1973‚Äì2007) = Indira Gandhi, prime minister of India (1966‚Äì1977, 1980‚Äì1984) The economic crisis in the Western world in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis during the mid- to late 1970s resulted in the rise of neoliberalism and several politicians were elected on neoliberal platforms such as British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and United States president Ronald Reagan. The rise in support for neoliberalism raised questions over the political viability of social democracy, with sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf predicting the \\"end of the social democratic century\\". In 1985, an agreement was made between several social- democratic parties in the Western Bloc countries of Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands and with the communist parties of the Eastern Bloc countries of Bulgaria, East Germany and Hungary to have multilateral discussions on trade, nuclear disarmament and other issues. In 1989, the Socialist International adopted its present Declaration of Principles which addressed issues concerning the internationalization of the economy and defined its interpretation of the nature of socialism. The Declaration of Principles stated that socialist values and vision include \\"a peaceful and democratic world society combining freedom, justice and solidarity\\" while arguing that [n]either private nor State ownership by themselves guarantee either economic efficiency or social justice\\". The Socialist International defined the rights and freedoms it supported as follows: \\"Socialists protect the inalienable right to life and to physical safety, to freedom of belief and free expression of opinion, to freedom of association and to protection from torture and degradation. Socialists are committed to achieve freedom from hunger and want, genuine social security, and the right to work\\". It also clarified that it did not promote any fixed and permanent definition for socialism, arguing: \\"Socialists do not claim to possess the blueprint for some final and fixed society which cannot be changed, reformed or further developed. In a movement committed to democratic self-determination there will always be room for creativity since each people and every generation must set its own goals\\". By the 1980s, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as Ronald Reagan in the United States, Margaret Thatcher in Britain, Brian Mulroney in Canada and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, the Western welfare state was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained. With the fall of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism in Africa and Eastern Europe, most of those countries adopted liberal democracy and the former ruling parties moved away from Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and towards social democracy. Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel and leader of the Israeli Labor Party, shaking hands with Yasser Arafat, the Chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and founder of Fatah, in the presence of United States president Bill Clinton after having signed the Oslo Accords in 1993 The 1989 Socialist International congress was politically significant in that members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the reformist leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev attended the congress. The Socialist International's new Declaration of Principles abandoned previous statements made in the Frankfurt Declaration of 1951 against Soviet-style socialism. After the congress, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's newspaper Pravda noted that thanks to dialogue between the Soviet Union and the Socialist International since 1979 that the positions of the two organizations on nuclear disarmament issues \\"today virtually coincide\\". The Revolutions of 1989 and the resulting collapse of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states in Eastern Europe after the end of the Cold War led to the rise of multi-party democracy in many of these countries which resulted in the creation of multiple social-democratic parties. Although the majority of these parties initially did not achieve electoral success, they became a significant part of the political landscape of Eastern Europe. In Western Europe, the prominent Italian Communist Party transformed itself into the post-communist Democratic Party of the Left in 1991. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, supporters of the Third Way In the 1990s, the ideology of the Third Way developed and many social democrats became adherents of it. The Third Way has been advocated by its proponents as an alternative to capitalism and what it regards as the traditional forms of socialism (Marxian socialism and state socialism) which Third Way social democrats reject. It officially advocates ethical socialism, reformism and gradualism which includes advocating a humanized version of capitalism, a mixed economy, political pluralism and liberal democracy. For Giddens and others, there is really no significant difference between revisionism, Lassallian socialism and the Third Way. In each case, they advocated government policies that would immediately help working people rather than revolution and in both cases their critics accused them of having sold out to the establishment and not being real socialists. In particular, the Third Way has been strongly criticized within the social- democratic movement for being neoliberal in nature. Left-wing opponents of the Third Way claim that it is not a form of socialism and that it represents social democrats who responded to the New Right by accepting capitalism. Supporters of Third Way ideals argue that they merely represent a necessary or pragmatic adaptation of social democracy to the realities of the modern world, noting that post-war social democracy thrived during the prevailing international climate of the Bretton Woods consensus which collapsed in the 1970s. Tony Blair, prime minister of the United Kingdom (1997‚Äì2007) When he was a British Labour Party MP, Third Way supporter and former British prime minister Tony Blair wrote in a Fabian pamphlet in 1994 about the existence of two prominent variants of socialism, with one based on a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist economic determinist and collectivist tradition that he rejected and the other being an ethical socialism that he supported which was based on values of \\"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\\". New Labour under Blair sought to distance Labour from the conventional definition of socialism and create a new one representing a modern form of liberal-democratic socialism. However, New Labour sought to avoid regular public use of the word socialism even in this new definition, out of concerns that it would remind the British electorate of the strongly left-wing political strategy of the Labour Party in the early 1980s. Later, One Nation Labour was born as a critique of New Labour. It challenged some of the Third Way policy developments created by New Labour while accepting and modifying others. Like New Labour, One Nation Labour advocated a non-conventional definition of socialism, with Miliband endorsing a form of \\"capitalism that works for the people\\" for the time being while declaring support for a \\"form of socialism, which is a fairer, more just, more equal society\\". Unlike New Labour, One Nation Labour used the term socialism more publicly. Anthony Giddens, a prominent proponent and ideologue of the Third Way that arose in the 1990s Prominent Third Way proponent Anthony Giddens views conventional socialism as essentially having become obsolete. However, Giddens claims that a viable form of socialism was advocated by Anthony Crosland in his major work The Future of Socialism (1956). He has complimented Crosland as well as Thomas Humphrey Marshall for promoting a viable form of socialism. Giddens views what he considers the conventional form of socialism that defines socialism as a theory of economic management‚Äîstate socialism‚Äîas no longer viable. Giddens rejects what he considers top-down socialism as well as rejecting neoliberalism and criticizes conventional socialism for its common advocacy that socialization of production as achieved by central planning can overcome the irrationalities of capitalism. According to Giddens, this claim \\"can no longer be defended\\". He argues that with the collapse of the legitimacy of centrally planned socialization of production, \\"[w]ith its dissolution, the radical hopes for by socialism are as dead as the Old Conservatism that opposed them\\". Giddens writes that although there have been proponents of market socialism who have rejected such central planned socialism as well as being resistant to capitalism, \\"[t]here are good reasons, in my view, to argue that market socialism isn't a realistic possibility\\". Giddens makes clear that the Third Way as he envisions it is not market socialist, arguing that \\"[t]here is no Third Way of this sort, and with this realization the history of socialism as the avant-garde of political theory comes to a close\\". Giddens contends that Third Way is connected to the legacy of reformist revisionist socialism, writing: \\"Third way politics stands in the traditions of social democratic revisionism that stretch back to Eduard Bernstein and Karl Kautsky\\". Giddens commends Crosland's A Future of Socialism for recognizing that socialism cannot be defined merely in terms of a rejection of capitalism because if capitalism did end and was replaced with socialism, then socialism would have no purpose with the absence of capitalism. From Crosland's analysis, Giddens argues that the common characteristic of socialist doctrines is their ethical content, based on the critique of individualism. Giddens defines socialism as \\"the pursuit of ideas of social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality‚Äîideas brought together by a condemnation of the evils and injustices of capitalism\\". For Giddens, socialism depends on a belief in \\"group action and participation\\" as well as \\"collective responsibility for social welfare\\". Romano Prodi, the two-time prime Minister of Italy, former president of the European Commission and founding father of the Democratic Party Giddens dissociated himself from many of the interpretations of the Third Way made in the sphere of day-to-day politics‚Äîincluding New Labour‚Äîas he reiterated that the point was not a succumbing to neoliberalism or the dominance of capitalist markets, but rather to get beyond both market fundamentalism and top-down socialism to make the values of the centre-left count in a globalizing world. However, Paul Cammack has condemned the Third Way as conceived by Giddens as being a complete attack upon the foundations of social democracy and socialism in which Giddens has sought to replace them with neoliberal capitalism. Cammack claims that Giddens devotes a lot of energy into criticizing conventional social democracy and socialism‚Äîsuch as Giddens' claim that conventional socialism has died because Marx's vision of a new economy with wealth spread in an equitable way is not possible‚Äîwhile at the same time making no criticism of capitalism. Cammack condemns Giddens and his Third Way for being anti-social-democratic, anti-socialist and pro-capitalist that he disguises in rhetoric to make it appealing within social democracy. British political theorist Robert Corfe, a social-democratic proponent of a new socialism free of class-based prejudices, criticized both Marxist classists and Third Way proponents within the Labour Party. Corfe has denounced the Third Way as developed by Giddens for \\"intellectual emptiness and ideological poverty\\". Corfe has despondently noted and agreed with former long-term British Labour Party MP Alice Mahon's statement in which she said that \\"Labour is the party of bankers, not workers. The party has lost its soul, and what has replaced it is harsh, American style politics\\". Corfe claims that the failure to develop a new socialism has resulted in what he considers the \\"death of socialism\\" that left social capitalism as only feasible alternative. Some critics and analysts alike have characterized the Third Way as an effectively neoliberal movement. Oskar Lafontaine, co-founder of Germany's political party The Left, had been chairman of the SPD, but he resigned and quit the party due to his opposition to the SPD's turn towards the Third Way under Gerhard Schr√∂der Former SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine condemned then-SPD leader and German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der for his Third Way policies, saying that the SPD under Schr√∂der had adopted a \\"radical change of direction towards a policy of neoliberalism\\". After resigning from the SPD, Lafontaine co-founded The Left in 2007. The Left was founded out of a merger of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and the Labour and Social Justice ‚Äì The Electoral Alternative (WASG), a breakaway faction from the SPD. The Left has been controversial because as a direct successor to the PDS it is also a direct successor of former East Germany's ruling Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Socialist Unity Party (SED) that transformed into the PDS after the end of the Cold War. However, the PDS did not continue the SED's policies as the PDS adopted policies to appeal to democratic socialists, feminists, greens and pacifists. Lafontaine said in an interview that he supports the type of social democracy pursued by Willy Brandt, but he claims that the creation of The Left was necessary because \\"formerly socialist and social democratic parties\\" had effectively accepted neoliberalism. The Left grew in strength and in the 2009 federal election gained 11 percent of the vote while the SPD gained 23 percent of the vote. Lafontaine has noted that the founding of The Left in Germany has resulted in emulation in other countries, with several Left parties being founded in Greece, Portugal, Netherlands and Syria. Lafontaine claims that a de facto British left movement exists, identifying the Green Party of England and Wales MEP Caroline Lucas as holding similar values. Jack Layton, former leader of the New Democratic Party from 2003 to 2011, led the party to become the second largest Canadian political party for the first time Others have claimed that social democracy needs to move past the Third Way, including Olaf Cramme and Patrick Diamond in their book After the Third Way: The Future of Social Democracy in Europe (2012). Cramme and Diamond recognize that the Third Way arose as an attempt to break down the traditional dichotomy within social democracy between state intervention and markets in the economy, but they contend that the 2007‚Äì2012 global economic crisis requires that social democracy must rethink its political economy. Cramme and Diamond note that belief in economic planning amongst socialists was strong in the early to mid-20th century, but it declined with the rise of the neoliberal right that attacked economic planning and associated the left with a centralized command economy, conflating it with the administrative-command system and Soviet-type economic planning akin to the Soviet Union and other Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states. They claim that this formed the foundation of \\"the Right's moral trap\\" in which the neoliberal right's attacks on economic-planning policies provokes a defense of such planning by the left as being morally necessary and ends with the right then rebuking such policies as being inherently economically incompetent while presenting itself as the champion of economic competence and responsibility. Cramme and Diamond state that social democracy has five different strategies both to address the economic crisis in global markets at present that it could adopt in response, namely market conforming, market complementing, market resisting, market substituting and market transforming. Cramme and Diamond identify market conforming as being equivalent to British Labour Party politician and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden's desire for a very moderate socialist agenda based above all upon fiscal prudence as Snowden insisted that socialism had to build upon fiscal prudence or else it would not be achieved. Democratic and market socialists alike have criticized the Third Way for abandoning socialism, arguing that the major reason for the economic shortcomings of Soviet-type economies was their authoritarian nature rather than socialism itself and that it was a failure of a specific model, therefore social democrats should support democratic models of socialism rather than the Third Way. Economists Pranab Bardhan and John Roemer argue that Soviet-type economies failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their administrative, command allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects dictatorship and authoritarian allocation whilst supporting democracy could work and prove superior to free-market capitalism. = Decline and rejection of the Third Way (2007‚Äìpresent) = Alexis Tsipras, whose anti- austerity SYRIZA party led as example for like-minded left-wing populist social-democratic parties Beginning in the 2000s, with the global economic crisis in the late 2000s and early 2010s, the social-democratic parties that had dominated some of the post-World War II political landscape in Western Europe were under pressure in some countries to the extent that a commentator in Foreign Affairs called it an \\"implosion of the centre-left\\". The Israeli Labor Party went into gradual decline in the early 2000s following the October 2000 riots and the violence of the al-Aqsa Intifada. The first European country that saw a similar development was Greece in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the ongoing Greek government-debt crisis. Support for the Greek social-democratic party PASOK declined from 43.9% in the 2009 Greek legislative election to 4.68% in the January 2015 Greek legislative election. The decline subsequently proved to not be isolated to Greece as it spread to a number of countries in Europe, a phenomenon many observers described as Pasokification. Pablo Iglesias Turri√≥n, General Secretary of Podemos, a left- wing populist social-democratic party In 2017, support for social-democratic parties in other countries such as Denmark and Portugal was relatively strong in polls. Moreover, the decline of the social-democratic parties in some countries was accompanied by a surge in the support for other centre-left or left-wing parties such as Syriza in Greece, the Left-Green Movement in Iceland and Podemos in Spain. Several explanations for the European decline have been proposed. Some commentators highlight that the social-democratic support of national fragmentation and labour market deregulation had become less popular among potential voters. Others such as the French political scientist Pierre Manent emphasize the need for social democrats to rehabilitate and reinvigorate the idea of nationhood. In a 2017 article in The Political Quarterly, J√∂rg Michael Dostal explains the decline in Germany with electoral disillusionment with Third Way and neoliberal policies, or more specifically Gerhard Schr√∂der's embrace of the Hartz reforms which recommended the privatization and reduction of the welfare state as well as the deregulation of the labour market and curtailing of workers rights. According to Dostal, the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition (i.e. blue- collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups) while efforts to attract centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains. Furthermore, the article concludes that the only possible remedy is for the SPD to make efforts to regain former voters by abandoning neoliberalism and offering credible social-welfare and redistributive policies. Earlier in 2016, a research article in Socio-Economic Review found that the longer-term electoral effects of the Hartz plan and Agenda 2010 on relevant voter groups were limited, but that it had helped to entrench The Left as a permanent political force to its left. After the Labour Party's surprising loss in the 2017 Norwegian parliamentary election, commentators such as the editor of Avisenes Nyhetsbyr√• highlight that the party had ignored a strong surge in discontent with mass immigration among potential voters. Hanne Skartveit of Verdens Gang claimed that social democrats have been struggling because the sustainability of the welfare state is challenged by mass immigration. Skarstein emphasize the contrast between social democrats' strong commitment for helping people on the international scene on one side and their strong commitment in favour of welfare policies for the nation's own population on the other. Spain is one of the countries in which the PSOE, the main social- democratic party, has been governing for a longer period of time than any other party since the transition to democracy in 1977. However, it has also declined like the European social-democratic parties, losing half of its electorate between 2010 and 2015 to Podemos and gaining its worst ever result in the 2015 Spanish general election since the restoration of democracy in Spain. Despite this loss, the PSOE returned to power in June 2018 after the government of Mariano Rajoy was ousted in a vote of no confidence in the aftermath of a corruption scandal, with Pedro S√°nchez leading the party. Some authors consider his government the last hope for Europe to retain its social democratic heritage and believe they would act as an example to like-minded politicians in other countries. By 2019 and 2020, Denmark, Finland and Italy saw a return of their main social-democratic party back in power while Portugal, Spain and Sweden confirmed their social-democratic governments. In the case of Italy and Spain, the centre-left parties allied with anti- establishment, populist and other left-leaning parties in coalition governments. Jeremy Corbyn, who won the 2015 Labour Party leadership election on a campaign based on the rejection of austerity and Blairite policies within the Labour Party itself Several social-democratic parties such as the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn have outright rejected the Third Way strategy and moved back to the left on economics and class issues. After running in the 2014 PSOE primary election as a centrist profile, Pedro S√°nchez later switched to the left in his successful 2017 bid to return to the PSOE leadership in which he stood for a refoundation of social democracy in order to transition to a post-capitalist society, putting an end to neoliberal capitalism. A key personal idea posed in S√°nchez's 2019 Manual de Resistencia book is the indissoluble link between social democracy and Europe. Other parties such as the Danish Social Democrats also became increasingly skeptical of neoliberal mass immigration from a left-wing point of view. The party believes it has had negative impacts for much of the population and it has been seen as a more pressing issue since at least 2001 after the 11 September attacks that has intensified during the 2015 European migrant crisis. The perception of the party being neoliberal and soft on immigration during the era of neoliberal globalization contributed to its poor electoral performance in the early 21st century. In a recent biography, the Danish Social Democrats party leader and prime minister Mette Frederiksen argued: \\"For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes\\". Frederiksen later shifted her stance on immigration by allowing more foreign labour and reversing plans to hold foreign criminals offshore after winning government. A 2020 study disputed the notion that anti-immigration positions would help social-democratic parties. The study found that \\"more authoritarian/nationalist and more anti-EU positions are if anything associated with lower rather than greater electoral support for social democratic parties\\". Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, whose policies are said to be more in line with Nordic model-esque social democracy In 2016, Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, made a bid for the Democratic Party presidential candidate, gaining considerable popular support, particularly among the younger generation and working-class Americans, but he ultimately lost the presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton, a centrist candidate. Sanders ran again in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, briefly becoming the front-runner in February until Super Tuesday in March and suspending his campaign in April. Nonetheless, Sanders would remain on the ballot in states that had not yet voted to influence the Democratic Party's platform as he did in 2016. Since his praise of the Nordic model indicated focus on social democracy as opposed to views involving social ownership of the means of production, several political commentators have argued that democratic socialism has become a misnomer for social democracy in American politics. Sanders previously advocated for some form of public ownership, supports workplace democracy, an expansion of worker cooperatives and the democratisation of the economy. Sanders' proposed legislation include worker- owned businesses, the Workplace Democracy Act, employee ownership as alternative to corporations and a package to encourage employee-owned companies. While seen as part of the liberal New Deal or social-democratic tradition, Sanders associates the New Deal as part of the socialist tradition and claimed the New Deal's legacy to \\"take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion\\". In an August 2018 poll conducted by Gallup, a majority of Americans under the age of 30 in the United States stated they approved of socialism. 57% of Democratic leaning voters viewed socialism positively and 47% saw capitalism positively. 71% of Republican leaning voters who were polled saw capitalism under a positive light and 16% viewed socialism in a positive light. A June 2019 Harris Poll found that socialism is more popular with women than men, with 55% of women between the ages of 18 and 54 preferring to live in a socialist society while a majority of men surveyed in the poll chose capitalism over socialism. A November 2019 YouGov poll found that 7 out of 10 millennials in the United States would vote for a socialist presidential candidate and 36% had a favorable view of communism. Progressive reforms and social-democratic policies have been proposed, including the United States National Health Care Act to enact universal single-payer health care and the Green New Deal. In November 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a democratic socialist organization which advocates social-democratic reforms that \\"will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people\\", were elected to the House of Representatives while eleven DSA candidates were elected to state legislatures. On 30 November 2018, The Sanders Institute and the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 founded the Progressive International, a political organization which unites social democrats with other democratic socialists, labour unionists and progressive activists.  Legacy  Social-democratic policies were first adopted in the German Empire between the 1880s and 1890s, when the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck put in place many social welfare proposals initially suggested by the Social Democrats to hinder their electoral success after he instituted the Anti-Socialist Laws, laying the ground of the first modern welfare state. Those policies were dubbed as State Socialism by the liberal opposition, but the term was later accepted and re- appropriated by Bismarck. It was a set of social programs implemented in Germany that were initiated by Bismarck in 1883 as remedial measures to appease the working class and reduce support for socialism and the Social Democrats following earlier attempts to achieve the same objective through Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Laws. This did not prevent the Social Democrats to become the biggest party in parliament by 1912. Similar policies were later adopted in most of Western Europe, including France and the United Kingdom (the latter in the form of the Liberal welfare reforms), with both socialist and liberal parties adopting those policies. In the United States, the progressive movement, a similar social-democratic movement predominantly influenced more by social liberalism than socialism, supported progressive liberals such as Democratic presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Freedom and New Deal programmes adopted many social- democratic policies. With the Great Depression, economic interventionism and nationalizations became more common worldwide and the post-war consensus until the 1970s saw Keynesian social-democratic and mixed economy policies put in place, leading to the post-World War II boom in which the United States, the Soviet Union, the Western European and East Asian countries experienced unusually high and sustained economic growth, together with full employment. Contrary to early predictions, this period of high economic growth and national development also included many countries that have been devastated by the war such as Japan (Japanese post-war economic miracle), West Germany and Austria (Wirtschaftswunder), South Korea (Miracle of the Han River), France (Trente Glorieuses), Italy (Italian economic miracle) and Greece (Greek economic miracle). With the 1970s energy crisis, the abandonment of both the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system along with Keynesian social- democratic, mixed-economy policies and the implementation of market-oriented, monetarist and neoliberal policies (privatization, deregulation, free trade, economic globalization and anti-inflationary fiscal policy, among others), the social-democratic welfare state was put in doubt. This caused several social- democratic parties to adopt the Third Way, a centrist ideology combining progressivism and social liberalism with neoliberalism. However, the Great Recession in the late 2000s and early 2010s cast doubts to the so-called Washington Consensus and protests against austerity measures ensued, causing a resurgence of social democratic parties and policies, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom with the rise of politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, who rejected the Third Way, after the economic recession caused the Pasokification of many social-democratic parties. The United Nations World Happiness Report shows that the happiest nations are concentrated in social-democratic nations, especially in Northern Europe, where the Nordic model is applied. This is at times attributed to the success of the social-democratic Nordic model in the region, where similar democratic socialist, labourist and social-democratic parties dominated the region's political scene and laid the ground to their universal welfare states in the 20th century. The Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden as well as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, also ranks highest on the metrics of real GDP per capita, economic equality, public health, life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, generosity, quality of life and human development while countries practicing a neoliberal form of government have registered relatively poorer results. Similarly, several reports have listed Scandinavian and other social-democratic countries as ranking high on indicators such as civil liberties, democracy, press, labour and economic freedoms, peace and freedom from corruption. Numerous studies and surveys indicate that people tend to live happier lives in countries ruled by social-democratic parties, compared to countries ruled by neoliberal, centrist and right-wing governments.  Criticism  Social democracy is criticized by other socialists because it serves to devise new means to strengthen the capitalist system which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist system. According to this view, social democracy fails to address the systemic issues inherent in capitalism. The American democratic socialist philosopher David Schweickart contrasts social democracy with democratic socialism by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the welfare state and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently humanised and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. He gives the example that attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline. In contrast to social democracy's mixed economy, democratic socialists advocate a post-capitalist economic system based on either a market economy combined with workers' self-management, or on some form of participatory, decentralized planning of the economy. Marxian socialists argue that social- democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism such as cyclical fluctuations, exploitation and alienation. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism‚Äîsuch as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits‚Äîcreates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system by reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production. The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy such as Jonas Hinnfors argue that when social democracy abandoned Marxism, it also abandoned socialism and became a liberal capitalist movement, effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the Democratic Party in the United States. Market socialism is also critical of social-democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. Franklin Delano Roosevelt III (grandson of United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt) and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a property-owning capitalist class which has an active interest in reversing social-democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy. The economists John Roemer and Pranab Bardhan point out that social democracy requires a strong labour movement to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements, noting that social democracy in Scandinavian countries has been in decline as the labour movement weakened. Some critics claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian welfare capitalism. The democratic socialist political theorist Michael Harrington argues that social democracy historically supported Keynesianism as part of a \\"social democratic compromise\\" between capitalism and socialism. While this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it created welfare states and \\"recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit\\". Social democrats in favour of the Third Way have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as Anthony Giddens of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice. Social democracy's reformism has been criticized from both the left and right, for if the left was to govern a capitalist economy, it would have to do so according to capitalist, not socialist, logic. This argument was previously echoed by Joseph Schumpeter in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942), writing: \\"Socialists had to govern in an essentially capitalist world [...], a social and economic system that would not function except on capitalist lines. [...] If they were to run it, they would have to run it according to its own logic. They would have to \\"administer\\" capitalism\\". Similarly, Irving Kristol argued: \\"Democratic socialism turns out to be an inherently unstable compound, a contradiction in terms. Every social-democratic party, once in power, soon finds itself choosing, at one point after another, between the socialist society it aspires to and the liberal society that lathered it\\". Joseph Stalin was a vocal critic of reformist social democrats, later coining the term social fascism to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period it embraced a similar corporatist economic model to the model supported by fascism. This view was adopted by the Communist International which argued that capitalist society had entered the Third Period in which a proletarian revolution was imminent, but that it could be prevented by social democrats and other fascist forces.

After several attempts, and possible sabotage by a supporter of the Louisville and Portland Canal, the project was ended. History As the Midwestern United States became populated by American settlers, they began to farm produce down the Ohio River to the Mississippi River and New Orleans to be sold. Along this entire route there was only one obstacle, the Falls of the Ohio, a series of rapids between Clarksville, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky. At that location goods had to be unloaded from boats, transported by land to below the falls, and reloaded. This caused a considerable delay for transportation and led to the early growth in the area which responded by creating enterprises to accommodate the needs of moving the goods. The expense caused by the need to transport goods overland for the stretch was considerable and the price incurred by Cincinnati goods alone was estimated to cost over $50,000 annually.Dunn, p. 386. As early as 1790 it was proposed that a canal be built around the falls so that shipping could easily bypass the rapids. Both Indiana and Kentucky competed to be the first to build a canal, knowing whichever side built the canal would receive a large economic boost. Early promoters of the project included Josiah Stephens and Benjamin Hovey, both of whom believed the canal would create a rapid influx of wealth to Indiana.Dunn, pp. 382-383. First company Indiana began formal plans to build a canal before Kentucky, authorizing the first Indiana Canal Company on August 24, 1805. The charter was considered favorable, fixing tolls between two and five dollars. The company's board members were made up mostly of men from Clarksville and included Aaron Burr, Davis Floyd and George Rogers Clark. The Indiana Territory granted the company $120,000 in starting money, and the enterprise raised more than $1.2 million from private sources. The company surveyed a route around the falls through a deep, downhill ravine that began near the mouth of the Cane Run creek and continued downhill past the falls, where it opened back into the Ohio River Valley. The plan was to dam the creek near its mouth at the Ohio River, forcing it down into the ravine where it would wash out the valley creating a natural canal. The redirected creek could then be connected to the Ohio River by a lock. The surveyors believed that this route would be far easier to build and cheaper than the cost of digging a route on the opposing side of the river. The initial company failed before the construction was begun and completely fell apart after the Aaron Burr conspiracy was revealed. Floyd was briefly jailed for part in the plot, and Burr was charged with treason and jailed. Many believed the company was a front to gather funds for Burr's failed plot, but it was never proven that any money was misappropriated as the treason charges were dropped on lack of evidence and no further inquiry was made. Second and third company In 1817 Indiana created a second canal company, the Ohio Canal Company.Fatout, p. 291. Governor Jonathan Jennings, who was intent on increasing the economic viability of the new state, saw the canal as a way to quickly enhance Indiana's economy. This time the charter for the company provided $1 million in starting funds and gave the board a wider representation from Indiana's now larger population to prevent any possible graft by local members. The charter gave the company tax-free status and power of eminent domain. The company was not able to draw enough investments for the project and in 1818 a third canal company, the Jeffersonville Ohio Canal Company, was created and given the additional powers of settings its own tolls and raising up to $100,000 by a lottery. By 1819 the company had progressed enough to begin construction. The Cane Run was dammed and forced into the ravine as planned by the first company. The canal was expected to be long with an average depth of and a width that narrowed from across at the top to across at the bottom. Work was progressing well along until the dam failed. Maurice Thompson claimed that someone from the rival canal company in Louisville had sabotaged the dam. Portland newspapers had been criticizing the canal and many of its residents were openly opposed to a construction of any canal, knowing that without the necessity to transport good overland, Portland's businesses would not be needed anymore. It is also possible the earthen dam was the victim of muskrats who destroyed millions of dollars worth of Indiana canals in the 1830s by burrowing through them. The subsequent Panic of 1819 made raising additional funds difficult, and without the means to continue construction the company folded.Dunn, pp. 384-385. Aftermath Without the funds to repair the dam and begin construction again, the project was allowed to languish. The Indiana General Assembly raised the topic again in 1824 and a commission was appointed, whose members included Christopher Harrison, to study the feasibility of trying to restart the project. After reporting on their findings, the commission was ended. The General Assembly discussed restarting the company but no action was again undertaken to attempt to build a canal on the Indiana side of the River. The debate ended in 1825 when the Louisville and Portland Canal secured federal funding, which virtually guaranteed its success. It was completed in 1831 and was instantly very profitable.Dunn, p. 385. The L & P Canal was still in operation in 2008 as part of the McAlpine Locks and Dam. In 1867 and 1868 a detailed and comprehensive study was conducted by the United States War Department on the feasibility of a \\"Ship canal around the falls of the Ohio\\". A report was submitted to congress in 1869 but was never acted upon. The loss of the canal was a local disaster for Clarksville. Local industry had been building with the expectation that Clarksville would become a major trading hub. The project had focused state attention on the improvement of the area and now many of the state plans where ruined. The state prison had been established in Jeffersonville so criminals could be used to labor on the canal, and other favorable projects had been granted to the area to improve the possibility of a canal. The loss left Clarksville to languish and into a population decline, whereas Jeffersonville began to grow quickly. Seeing the prosperity the L & P Canal brought, Indiana decided to build a series of Canals across the northern part of the state including the Wabash and Erie Canal.

A Palestinian American born in Mandatory Palestine, he was a citizen of the United States by way of his father, a U.S. Army veteran. Educated in the Western canon at British and American schools, Said applied his education and bi-cultural perspective to illuminating the gaps of cultural and political understanding between the Western world and the Eastern world, especially about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict in the Middle East; his principal influences were Antonio Gramsci, Frantz Fanon, Aim√© C√©saire, Michel Foucault, and Theodor Adorno. As a cultural critic, Said is known for the book Orientalism (1978), a critique of the cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism‚Äîhow the Western world perceives the Orient. Said's model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies‚Äîhow academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied.Stephen Howe, \\"Dangerous mind?\\", New Humanist, Vol. 123, November/December 2008.\\"Between Worlds\\", Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays (2002) pp. 561, 565. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature. As a public intellectual, Said was a controversial member of the Palestinian National Council, due to his public criticism of Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim r√©gimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples.Andrew N. Rubin, \\"Edward W. Said\\", Arab Studies Quarterly, Fall 2004: p. 1. Accessed 5 January 2010. Said advocated the establishment of a Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has \\"to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual\\" man and woman. In 1999, with his friend Daniel Barenboim, Said co-founded the West‚ÄìEastern Divan Orchestra, based in Seville. This initiative brings together, every summer, a group of young classical musicians from Israel, the Palestinian territories and Arab countries to study, perform and to promote mutual reflection and understanding. Barenboim and Said jointly received the 2002 Prince of Asturias Awards for their work in \\"improving understanding between nations\\". Besides being an academic, Said was also an accomplished pianist, and, with Barenboim, co-authored the book Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society (2002), a compilation of their conversations and public discussions about music held at New York's Carnegie Hall.Democracy Now!, \\"Edward Sa√Ød Archive\\" , DemocracyNow.org, 2003. Accessed 4 January 2010. The Barenboim‚ÄìSaid Academy, a joint project Said also developed with Barenboim, was created Berlin. The academy was planned as a site for young music students from the Arab world and Israel to study music and humanities in Berlin. It opened its doors on 8 December 2016. Said died of leukemia on 24 September 2003. Life and career =Early life= Rosemarie Said (1940) Edward Wadie Said was born on 1 November 1935, to Hilda Said and Wadie Said, a businessman in Jerusalem, then part of British-governed Mandatory Palestine (1920‚Äì48). Wadie Said was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the American Expeditionary Forces (1917‚Äì19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in the First World War (1914‚Äì18). Afterwards, that war-time military service earned American citizenship to Said p√®re and his family. Edward's mother Hilda Said was Lebanese and raised in Nazareth, Ottoman Empire.Ihab Shalback, 'Edward Said and the Palestinian Experience,' in Joseph Pugliese (ed.) Transmediterranean: Diasporas, Histories, Geopolitical Spaces, Peter Lang, 2010, pp. 71‚Äì83 In 1919, in partnership with a cousin, Wadie Said established a stationery business in Cairo.

Accessed 7 February 2010. =Education= Said lived his boyhood between the worlds of Cairo and Jerusalem; in 1947, he attended St. George's School, Jerusalem, a British school of stern Anglican Christian cast. About being there, Said said: By the late 1940s, Edward's schooling included the Egyptian branch of Victoria College, Alexandria (VC), where classmates included (King) Hussein of Jordan, and the Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers would progress to their becoming ministers, prime ministers, and leading businessmen in their respective countries. In that colonial time and place, the function of a British colonial school such as VC was to educate selections of young men from the Arab and Levantine ruling classes, to become the Anglicized post-colonial administrators who would rule their countries, upon British decolonization. About Victoria College, Said said: In 1951, Victoria College expelled Said, who had proved a troublesome boy, despite being a student of great intelligence and much academic achievement; he then attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, Massachusetts, a socially √©lite, college-prep boarding-school where he lived a difficult year of social alienation. Nonetheless, he excelled academically, and achieved the rank of either first (valedictorian) or second (salutatorian) in a class of one hundred sixty students. In retrospect, being sent far from the Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental decision much influenced by \\"the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain that it would be best to send me as far away as possible.\\" The realities of peripatetic life‚Äîof interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness‚Äîso affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school's end, he had become Edward W. Said‚Äîa polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic). He graduated with an A.B. in English from Princeton University in 1957 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"The Moral Vision: Andr√© Gide and Graham Greene.\\" He later received Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.Sa√Ød, Edward.

In 1993, Said presented the BBC's annual Reith Lectures, a six-lecture series titled Representation of the Intellectual, wherein he examined the role of the public intellectual in contemporary society, which the BBC published in 2011. Literary production The 19th-century novelist Joseph Conrad is the subject of Said's first book, Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography (1966). Said's first published book, Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography (1966), was an expansion of the doctoral dissertation he presented to earn the PhD degree. Moreover, in Edward Sa√Ød: Criticism and Society (2010), Abdirahman Hussein said that Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness (1899) was \\"foundational to Said's entire career and project\\".Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography (1966). Afterwards, Said redacted ideas gleaned from the works of the 17th-century philosopher Giambattista Vico, and other intellectuals, in the book Beginnings: Intention and Method (1974), about the theoretical bases of literary criticism.Edward Sa√Ød, Power, Politics and Culture, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001: pp. 77‚Äì79. Said's later works include The World, the Text, and the Critic (1983), Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature: Yeats and Decolonization (1988), Culture and Imperialism (1993), Representations of the Intellectual: The 1993 Reith Lectures (1994), Humanism and Democratic Criticism (2004), and On Late Style (2006). =Orientalism= Said became an established cultural critic with the book Orientalism (1978) a critique (description and analyses) of Orientalism as the source of the false cultural representations with which the Western world perceives the Middle East‚Äîthe narratives of how The West sees The East. The thesis of Orientalism proposes the existence of a \\"subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo‚ÄìIslamic peoples and their culture\\", which originates from Western culture's long tradition of false, romanticized images of Asia, in general, and the Middle East, in particular. That such cultural representations have served, and continue to serve, as implicit justifications for the colonial and imperial ambitions of the European powers and of the U.S. Likewise, Said denounced the political and the cultural malpractices of the r√©gimes of the ruling Arab √©lites who have internalized the false and romanticized representations of Arabic culture that were created by Anglo‚ÄìAmerican Orientalists.Windschuttle, Keith. \\"Edward Sa√Ød's 'Orientalism revisited'\\", The New Criterion 17 January 1999. Archived 1 May 2008, at the Internet Archive, accessed 23 November 2011. The cover of the book Orientalism (1978) is a detail from the 19th-century Orientalist painting The Snake Charmer, by Jean- L√©on G√©r√¥me (1824‚Äì1904). Orientalism proposed that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, meant for the self- affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination‚Äîthat is to say, the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.Sa√Ød, Edward. Orientalism, Vintage Books: New York: 1979 p. 12. That the cultural representations of the Eastern world that Orientalism purveys are intellectually suspect, and cannot be accepted as faithful, true, and accurate representations of the peoples and things of the Orient; that the history of European colonial rule and political domination of Asian civilizations, distorts the writing of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Orientalist. The idealized Oriental world of The Reception of the Ambassadors in Damascus (1511) That since Antiquity, Western Art has misrepresented the Orient with stereotypes; in the tragedy The Persians (472 BCE), by Aeschylus, the Greek protagonist falls, because he misperceived the true nature of The Orient.Said, Edward. Orientalism, pp. 56‚Äì57. That the European political domination of Asia has biased even the most outwardly objective Western texts about The Orient, to a degree unrecognized by the Western scholars who appropriated for themselves the production of cultural knowledge‚Äîthe academic work of studying, exploring, and interpreting the languages, histories, and peoples of Asia; therefore, Orientalist scholarship implies that the colonial subaltern (the colonised people) were incapable of thinking, acting, or speaking for themselves, thus are incapable of writing their own national histories. In such imperial circumstances, the Orientalist scholars of the West wrote the history of the Orient‚Äîand so constructed the modern, cultural identities of Asia‚Äîfrom the perspective that the West is the cultural standard to emulate, the norm from which the \\"exotic and inscrutable\\" Orientals deviate.Said, Edward. Orientalism, pp. 38‚Äì41. The thesis of Orientalism concluded that the West's knowledge of the Orient depicts the cultures of the Eastern world as an irrational, weak, and feminized non‚ÄìEuropean Other, which is the opposite of the West's representations of Western cultures as a rational, strong, and masculine polity. That such an artificial binary-relation originates from the European psychological need to create a \\"difference\\" of inequality, between the West and the East, which inequality originates from the immutable cultural essences innate to the peoples of the Oriental world.Said, Edward. Orientalism, pp. 65‚Äì67. =Criticism of Orientalism= Orientalism provoked much professional and personal criticism for Said among academics.Kramer, Martin. \\"Enough Said (Book review: Dangerous Knowledge, by Robert Irwin)\\", March 2007. Retrieved 5 January 2010. Traditional Orientalists, such as Albert Hourani, Robert Graham Irwin, Nikki Keddie, Bernard Lewis, and Kanan Makiya, suffered negative consequences, because Orientalism affected public perception of their intellectual integrity and the quality of their Orientalist scholarship.Lewis, Bernard. \\"The Question of Orientalism\\", Islam and the West, London: 1993. pp. 99, 118.Irwin, Robert. For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies London:Allen Lane: 2006. The historian Keddie said that Said's critical work about the field of Orientalism had caused, in their academic disciplines: In Orientalism, Said described Bernard Lewis, the Anglo‚ÄìAmerican Orientalist, as \\"a perfect exemplification [of an] Establishment Orientalist [whose work] purports to be objective, liberal scholarship, but is, in reality, very close to being propaganda against his subject material.\\"Said, Edward Orientalism, p. 315. Lewis responded with a harsh critique of Orientalism accusing Said of politicizing the scientific study of the Middle East (and Arabic studies in particular); neglecting to critique the scholarly findings of the Orientalists; and giving \\"free rein\\" to his biases. Said retorted that in The Muslim Discovery of Europe (1982), Lewis responded to his thesis with the claim that the Western quest for knowledge about other societies was unique in its display of disinterested curiosity, which Muslims did not reciprocate towards Europe. Lewis was saying that \\"knowledge about Europe [was] the only acceptable criterion for true knowledge.\\" The appearance of academic impartiality was part of Lewis's role as an academic authority for zealous \\"anti‚ÄìIslamic, anti‚ÄìArab, Zionist, and Cold War crusades.\\"Sa√Ød, Edward Orientalism (1978), p. 315; \\"Orientalism Reconsidered\\" (1985), p. 96.Edward Sa√Ød, \\"Orientalism Reconsidered\\", Cultural Critique magazine, No. 1, Autumn 1985, p. 96. Moreover, in the Afterword to the 1995 edition of the book, Said replied to Lewis's criticisms of the first edition of Orientalism (1978).Said, Edward Orientalism: pp. 329‚Äì54 =Influence of Orientalism= Post-colonial studies. (William-Adolphe Bouguereau, 1883) In the academy, Orientalism became a foundational text of the field of Post-colonial studies, for what the British intellectual Terry Eagleton said is the book's \\"central truth ... that demeaning images of the East, and imperialist incursions into its terrain, have historically gone hand in hand.\\"Eagleton, Terry. Eastern Block (book review of For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies, 2006, by Robert Irwin) , New Statesman, 13 February 2006. Said's friends and foes acknowledged the transformative influence of Orientalism upon scholarship in the humanities; critics said that the thesis is an intellectually limiting influence upon scholars, whilst supporters said that the thesis is intellectually liberating.Martin Kramer.

In Eastern Europe, Milica Bakiƒá‚ÄìHayden developed the concept of Nesting Orientalisms (1992), derived from the ideas of the historian Larry Wolff (Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment, 1994) and Said's ideas in Orientalism (1978). The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakiƒá‚ÄìHayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms. In The Impact of \\"Biblical Orientalism\\" in Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Palestine (2014), the historian Lorenzo Kamel, presented the concept of \\"Biblical Orientalism\\" with an historical analysis of the simplifications of the complex, local Palestinian reality, which occurred from the 1830s until the early 20th century. Kamel said that the selective usage and simplification of religion, in approaching the place known as \\"The Holy Land\\", created a view that, as a place, the Holy Land has no human history other than as the place where Bible stories occurred, rather than as Palestine, a country inhabited by many peoples. The post-colonial discourse presented in Orientalism, also influenced post-colonial theology and post- colonial biblical criticism, by which method the analytical reader approaches a scripture from the perspective of a colonial reader. See: The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-colonialism in Palestine‚ÄìIsrael (2007). Another book in this area is Postcolonial Theory (1998), by Leela Gandhi, explains Post-colonialism to how it can be applied to the wider philosophical and intellectual context of history. Politics Palestinian cultural mural honoring Said In 1967, consequent to the Six-Day War (5‚Äì10 June 1967) the academic Edward Said became a public intellectual when he acted politically to counter the stereotyped misrepresentations (factual, historical, cultural) with which the U.S. news media explained the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli wars; reportage divorced from the historical realities of the Middle East, in general, and Palestine and Israel, in particular. To address, explain, and correct such Orientalism, Said published \\"The Arab Portrayed\\" (1968), a descriptive essay about images of \\"the Arab\\" that are meant to evade specific discussion of the historical and cultural realities of the peoples (Jews, Christians, Muslims) who are the Middle East, featured in journalism (print, photograph, television) and some types of scholarship (specialist journals).\\"Between Worlds\\", Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays (2002) pp. 563. In the essay \\"Zionism from the Standpoint of its Victims\\" (1979), Said argued in favour of the political legitimacy and philosophic authenticity of the Zionist claims and right to a Jewish homeland; and for the inherent right of national self-determination of the Palestinian people.Edward Sa√Ød, \\"Zionism from the Standpoint of its Victims\\" (1979), in The Edward Sa√Ød Reader, Vintage Books, 2000, pp. 114‚Äì68. Said's books about Israel and Palestine include The Question of Palestine (1979), The Politics of Dispossession (1994), and The End of the Peace Process (2000). =Palestinian National Council= From 1977 until 1991, Said was an independent member of the Palestinian National Council (PNC).Malise Ruthven, \\"Edward Said: Controversial Literary Critic and Bold Advocate of the Palestinian Cause in America,\\" The Guardian 26 September 2003; accessed 1 March 2006. In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict (1948), and voted for the establishment of the State of Palestine at a meeting of the PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991. Said disliked the Oslo Accords for not producing an independent State of Palestine, and because they were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected‚Äîa plan Said had presented to Arafat on behalf of the U.S. government in the late 1970s.Edward Sa√Ød, \\"The Morning After\\". London Review of Books Vol. 15 No. 20. 21 October 1993. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967. The administrative domains of the Palestinian Authority (red) In 1995, in response to Said's political criticisms, the Palestinian Authority (PA) banned the sale of Said's books; however, the PA lifted the book-ban when Said publicly praised Yasir Arafat for rejecting Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offers at the Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David (2000) in the U.S.Michael Wood, \\"On Edward Said\\", London Review of Books, 23 October 2003, accessed 5 January 2010.Edward Said, \\"The price of Camp David\\", Al Ahram Weekly, 23 July 2001. Accessed 5 January 2010. In the mid-1990s, Said wrote the Foreword to the history book Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years (1994), by Israel Shahak, about Jewish fundamentalism, which presents the cultural proposition that Israel's mistreatment of the Palestinians is rooted in a Judaic requirement (of permission) for Jews to commit crimes, including murder, against Gentiles (non-Jews). In his Foreword, Said said that Jewish History, Jewish Religion is \\"nothing less than a concise history of classic and modern Judaism, insofar as these are relevant to the understanding of modern Israel\\"; and praised the historian Shahak for describing contemporary Israel as a nation subsumed in a \\"Judeo‚ÄìNazi\\" cultural ambiance that allowed the dehumanization of the Palestinian Other:Werner Cohn: What Edward Said knows Page accessed 2012-06-15. In 1998, Said made In Search of Palestine (1998), a BBC documentary film about Palestine past and present. In the company of his son, Wadie, Said revisited the places of his boyhood, and confronted injustices meted out to ordinary Palestinians in the contemporary West Bank. Despite the social and cultural prestige usual to BBC cinema products in the U.S., the documentary was never broadcast by any American television company.Culture and resistance: conversations with Edward W. Said By Edward W. Said, David Barsamian, p. 57 In 1999, the American monthly Commentary cited ledgers kept at the Land Registry Office in Jerusalem during the Mandatory period as background for his boyhood recollections. =In Palestine= On 3 July 2000, whilst touring the Middle East with his son, Wadie, Edward Said was photographed throwing a stone across the Blue Line Lebanese‚ÄìIsrael border, which image elicited much political criticism about his action demonstrating an inherent, personal sympathy with terrorism; and, in Commentary magazine, the journalist Edward Alexander labelled Said as \\"The Professor of Terror\\", for aggression against Israel.Julian Vigo, \\"Edward Sa√Ød and the Politics of Peace: From Orientalisms to Terrorology\\", A Journal of Contemporary Thought (2004): pp. 43‚Äì65. Said explained the stone-throwing as a two-fold action, personal and political; a man-to-man contest-of-skill, between a father and his son, and an Arab Man's gesture of joy at the end of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon (1985‚Äì2000): \\"It was a pebble; there was nobody there. The guardhouse was at least half a mile away.\\"Dinitia Smith, \\"A Stone's Throw is a Freudian Slip\\", The New York Times, 10 March 2001. For throwing a stone at an Israeli guardhouse across the Blue Line Lebanese‚ÄìIsraeli border, Commentary magazine labelled Edward Said \\"The Professor of Terror\\" in 2000. Despite having denied that he aimed the stone at an Israeli guardhouse, the Beirut newspaper As-Safir (The Ambassador) reported that a Lebanese local resident reported that Prof. Said was at less than ten metres (ca. 30 ft.) distance from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers manning the two-storey guardhouse, when Said aimed and threw the stone over the border fence; the stone's projectile path was thwarted when it struck the barbed wire atop the border fence.Sunnie Kim, Edward Said Accused of Stoning in South Lebanon, Columbia Spectator, 19 July 2000. Nonetheless, in the U.S., despite a political fracas by right-wing students at Columbia University and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith International (Sons of the Covenant), the university provost published a five-page letter defending Prof. Said's action as an academic's freedom of expression: \\"To my knowledge, the stone was directed at no-one; no law was broken; no indictment was made; no criminal or civil action has been taken against Professor Sa√Ød.\\" Nevertheless, Said endured political repercussions, such as the cancellation of an invitation to give a lecture to the Freud Society, in Austria, in February 2001.Edward Sa√Ød and David Barsamian, Culture and Resistance ‚Äì Conversations with Edward Said, South End Press, 2003: pp. 85‚Äì86 The President of the Freud Society justified withdrawing the invitation by explaining to Said that \\"the political situation in the Middle East, and its consequences\\" had rendered an accusation of anti-Semitism a very serious matter, and that any such accusation \\"has become more dangerous\\" in the politics of Austria; thus, the Freud Society cancelled their invitation to Said in order to \\"avoid an internal clash\\" of opinions, about him, that might ideologically divide the Freud Society. In Culture and Resistance: Conversations with Edward Sa√Ød (2003), Said likened his political situation to the situation that Noam Chomsky has perdured as a public intellectual: > \\"It's very similar to his. He's a well-known, great linguist. He's been > celebrated and honored for that, but he's also vilified as an anti‚ÄìSemite > and as a Hitler worshiper. ... For anyone to deny the horrendous experience > of anti‚ÄìSemitism and the Holocaust is unacceptable. We don't want anybody's > history of suffering to go unrecorded and unacknowledged. On the other hand, > there's a great difference, between acknowledging Jewish oppression and > using that as a cover for the oppression of another people.\\"Edward Sa√Ød and > David Barsamian, Culture and Resistance: Conversations with Edward Sa√Ød, > South End Press, 2003: pp. 85, 178 =Criticism of U.S. foreign policy= In the revised edition of Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World (1997), Said criticized the Orientalist bias of the Western news media's reportage about the Middle East and Islam, especially the tendency to editorialize \\"speculations about the latest conspiracy to blow up buildings, sabotage commercial airliners, and poison water supplies.\\"Martin Kramer, Enough Said review of Dangerous Knowledge, by Robert Irwin, March 2007. He criticized the American military involvement in the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99) as an imperial action; and described the Iraq Liberation Act (1998), promulgated during the Clinton Administration, as the political license that predisposed the U.S. to invade Iraq in 2003, which was authorised with the Iraq Resolution (2 October 2002); and the continual support of Israel by successive U.S. presidential governments, as actions meant to perpetuate regional political instability in the Middle East. In the event, despite being sick with leukemia, as a public intellectual, Said continued criticising the U.S. Invasion of Iraq in mid-2003;Democracy Now!, \\"Syrian Expert Patrick Seale and Columbia University Professor Edward Said Discuss the State of the Middle East After the Invasion of Iraq\\", DemocracyNow.org, 15 April 2003. Accessed 4 January 2010. and, in the Egyptian Al-Ahram Weekly newspaper, in the article \\"Resources of Hope\\" (2 April 2003), Said said that the U.S. war against Iraq was a politically ill-conceived military enterprise: =Under surveillance= In 2003, Haidar Abdel-Shafi, Ibrahim Dakak, Mustafa Barghouti, and Said established Al-Mubadara (The Palestinian National Initiative), headed by Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a third-party reformist, democratic party meant to be an alternative to the usual two-party politics of Palestine. As a political party, the ideology of Al-Mubadara is specifically an alternative to the extremist politics of the social-democratic Fatah and the Islamist Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement). Said's founding of the group, as well as his other international political activities concerning Palestine, were noticed by the U.S. government; in 2006, the anthropologist David Price obtained 147 pages of the 283-page political dossier that the FBI had compiled on Said, begun in 1971, four years into his career as a public intellectual active in U.S. politics.David Price, \\"How the FBI Spied on Edward Said,\\" CounterPunch 13 January 2006, accessed 15 January 2006. Music The harmonious Middle East: the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra conducted by Daniel Barenboim Besides having been a public intellectual, Edward Said was an accomplished pianist, worked as the music critic for The Nation magazine, and wrote four books about music: Musical Elaborations (1991); Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society (2002), with Daniel Barenboim as co-author; On Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain (2006); and Music at the Limits (2007) in which final book he spoke of finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances.Ranjan Ghosh, Edward Said and the Literary, Social, and Political World , New York: Routledge, 2009: p. 22.Columbia University Press, Music at the Limits by Edward W.

Elsewhere in the musical world, the composer Mohammed Fairouz acknowledged the deep influence of Edward Said upon his works; compositionally, Fairouz's First Symphony thematically alludes to the essay \\"Homage to a Belly-Dancer\\" (1990), about Tahia Carioca, the Egyptian terpsichorean, actress, and political militant; and a piano sonata titled Reflections on Exile (1984), which thematically refers to the emotions inherent to being an exile.Rase, Sherri (8 April 2011), Conversations‚Äîwith Mohammed Fairouz , [Q]onStage, retrieved 2011-04-19\\"Homage to a Belly-dancer\\", Granta, 13 (Winter 1984).\\"Reflections on Exile\\", London Review of Books, 13 September 1990.

More specifically, it is a critical-theory analysis of the history, culture, literature, and discourse of (usually European) imperial power. Postcolonialism encompasses a wide variety of approaches, and theoreticians may not always agree on a common set of definitions. On a simple level, through anthropological study, it may seek to build a better understanding of colonial life‚Äîbased on the assumption that the colonial rulers are unreliable narrators‚Äîfrom the point of view of the colonized people. On a deeper level, postcolonialism examines the social and political power relationships that sustain colonialism and neocolonialism, including the social, political and cultural narratives surrounding the colonizer and the colonized. This approach may overlap with studies of contemporary history, and may also draw examples from anthropology, historiography, political science, philosophy, sociology, and human geography. Sub-disciplines of postcolonial studies examine the effects of colonial rule on the practice of feminism, anarchism, literature, and Christian thought. At times, the term postcolonial studies may be preferred to postcolonialism, as the ambiguous term colonialism could refer either to a system of government, or to an ideology or world view underlying that system. However, postcolonialism (i.e., postcolonial studies) generally represents an ideological response to colonialist thought, rather than simply describing a system that comes after colonialism, as the prefix post- may suggest. As such, postcolonialism may be thought of as a reaction to or departure from colonialism in the same way postmodernism is a reaction to modernism; the term postcolonialism itself is modeled on postmodernism, with which it shares certain concepts and methods. Purpose and basic concepts As an epistemology (i.e., a study of knowledge, its nature, and verifiability), ethics (moral philosophy), and as a political science (i.e., in its concern with affairs of the citizenry), the field of postcolonialism addresses the matters that constitute the postcolonial identity of a decolonized people, which derives from:On the power dynamics between Western cultural knowledge production and Indigenous knowledge systems, see Laurie, Timothy, Hannah Stark, and Briohny Walker. 2019. \\"Critical Approaches to Continental Philosophy: Intellectual Community, Disciplinary Identity, and the Politics of Inclusion.\\" Parrhesia 30:1‚Äì17. # the colonizer's generation of cultural knowledge about the colonized people; and # how that Western cultural knowledge was applied to subjugate a non-European people into a colony of the European mother country, which, after initial invasion, was effected by means of the cultural identities of 'colonizer' and 'colonized'. Postcolonialism is aimed at disempowering such theories (intellectual and linguistic, social and economic) by means of which colonialists \\"perceive,\\" \\"understand,\\" and \\"know\\" the world. Postcolonial theory thus establishes intellectual spaces for subaltern peoples to speak for themselves, in their own voices, and thus produce cultural discourses of philosophy, language, society, and economy, balancing the imbalanced us-and-them binary power-relationship between the colonist and the colonial subjects.Ashcroft, Bill; Griffiths, Gareth; Tiffin, Helen (2000). Post-Colonial Studies: The Key Concepts. New York: Routeledge. pp. 168‚Äì173. . =Colonialist discourse= In La R√©forme intellectuelle et morale (1871), the Orientalist Joseph-Ernest Renan, advocated imperial stewardship for civilizing the non‚ÄìWestern peoples of the world. Colonialism was presented as \\"the extension of civilization,\\" which ideologically justified the self-ascribed racial and cultural superiority of the Western world over the non-Western world. This concept was espoused by Joseph-Ernest Renan in La R√©forme intellectuelle et morale (1871), whereby imperial stewardship was thought to affect the intellectual and moral reformation of the coloured peoples of the lesser cultures of the world. That such a divinely established, natural harmony among the human races of the world would be possible, because everyone has an assigned cultural identity, a social place, and an economic role within an imperial colony. Thus:Sa√Ød, Edward. 2000. \\"Nationalism, Human Rights, and Interpretation.\\" Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays. pp. 418‚Äì19. From the mid- to the late-nineteenth century, such racialist group-identity language was the cultural common-currency justifying geopolitical competition amongst the European and American empires and meant to protect their over-extended economies. Especially in the colonization of the Far East and in the late-nineteenth century Scramble for Africa, the representation of a homogeneous European identity justified colonization. Hence, Belgium and Britain, and France and Germany proffered theories of national superiority that justified colonialism as delivering the light of civilization to unenlightened peoples. Notably, la mission civilisatrice, the self-ascribed 'civilizing mission' of the French Empire, proposed that some races and cultures have a higher purpose in life, whereby the more powerful, more developed, and more civilized races have the right to colonize other peoples, in service to the noble idea of \\"civilization\\" and its economic benefits.Evans, Graham, and Jeffrey Newnham. 1998.

In postcolonial literature, the anti-conquest narrative analyzes the identity politics that are the social and cultural perspectives of the subaltern colonial subjects‚Äîtheir creative resistance to the culture of the colonizer; how such cultural resistance complicated the establishment of a colonial society; how the colonizers developed their postcolonial identity; and how neocolonialism actively employs the 'us-and-them' binary social relation to view the non-Western world as inhabited by 'the other'. According to Indian academic Jaydeep Sarangi, one of the profound practices of postcolonial discourse is the celebration of 'the local'. Arguing in favour of voicing the margin/periphery (dalits), in the introduction to his book, Presentations of Postcolonialism in English: New Orientations, he gives reference to Maoris and Aborigines. The neocolonial discourse of geopolitical homogeneity relegating the decolonized peoples, their cultures, and their countries, to an imaginary place, such as \\"the Third World,\\" an over-inclusive term that usually comprises continents and seas, i.e. Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. The postcolonial critique analyzes the self-justifying discourse of neocolonialism and the functions (philosophic and political) of its over-inclusive terms, to establish the factual and cultural inaccuracy of homogeneous concepts, such as the \\"Arabs,\\" the \\"First World,\\" \\"Christendom,\\" and the \\"Ummah,\\" actually comprise heterogeneous peoples, cultures, and geography, and that accurate descriptions of the world's peoples, places, and things require nuanced and accurate terms. =Difficulty of definition= As a term in contemporary history, postcolonialism occasionally is applied, temporally, to denote the immediate time after the period during which imperial powers retreated from their colonial territories. Such is believed to be an problematic application of the term, as the immediate, historical, political time is not included in the categories of critical identity- discourse, which deals with over-inclusive terms of cultural representation, which are abrogated and replaced by postcolonial criticism. As such, the terms postcolonial and postcolonialism denote aspects of the subject matter that indicate that the decolonized world is an intellectual space \\"of contradictions, of half-finished processes, of confusions, of hybridity, and of liminalities.\\" As in most critical theory-based research, the lack of clarity in the definition of the subject matter coupled with an open claim to normativity makes criticism of postcolonial discourse problematic, reasserting its dogmatic or ideological status. In Post-Colonial Drama: Theory, Practice, Politics (1996), Helen Gilbert and Joanne Tompkins clarify the denotational functions, among which: The term post-colonialism is also applied to denote the Mother Country's neocolonial control of the decolonized country, affected by the legalistic continuation of the economic, cultural, and linguistic power relationships that controlled the colonial politics of knowledge (i.e., the generation, production, and distribution of knowledge) about the colonized peoples of the non-Western world. The cultural and religious assumptions of colonialist logic remain active practices in contemporary society, and are the basis of the Mother Country's neocolonial attitude towards her former colonial subjects‚Äîan economical source of labour and raw materials. Notable theoreticians and theories =Frantz Fanon and subjugation= In The Wretched of the Earth (1961), psychiatrist and philosopher Frantz Fanon analyzes and medically describes the nature of colonialism as essentially destructive. Its societal effects‚Äîthe imposition of a subjugating colonial identity‚Äîare harmful to the mental health of the native peoples who were subjugated into colonies. Fanon writes that the ideological essence of colonialism is the systematic denial of \\"all attributes of humanity\\" of the colonized people. Such dehumanization is achieved with physical and mental violence, by which the colonist means to inculcate a servile mentality upon the natives. For Fanon the natives must violently resist colonial subjugation. Hence, Fanon describes violent resistance to colonialism as a mentally cathartic practice, which purges colonial servility from the native psyche, and restores self-respect to the subjugated. Thus, Fanon actively supported and participated in the Algerian Revolution (1954‚Äì62) for independence from France as a member and representative of the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale. As postcolonial praxis, Fanon's mental-health analyses of colonialism and imperialism, and the supporting economic theories, were partly derived from the essay \\"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\\" (1916), wherein Vladimir Lenin described colonial imperialism as an advanced form of capitalism, desperate for growth at all costs, and so requires more and more human exploitation to ensure continually consistent profit-for- investment.Barkawi, Tarak. 2005. \\"War and world politics.\\" Pp. 225‚Äì39 in The Globalization of World Politics, edited by J. Baylis, P. Owens, and S. Smith. pp. 231‚Äì35. Another key book that predates postcolonial theories is Fanon's Black Skins, White Masks. In this book, Fanon discusses the logic of colonial rule from the perspective of the existential experience of racialized subjectivity. Fanon treats colonialism as a total project which rules every aspect of colonized peoples and their reality. Fanon reflects on colonialism, language, and racism and asserts that to speak a language is to adopt a civilization and to participate in the world of that language. His ideas show the influence of French and German philosophy, since existentialism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics claim that language, subjectivity, and reality are interrelated. However, the colonial situation presents a paradox: when colonial beings are forced to adopt and speak an imposed language which is not their own, they adopt and participate in the world and civilization of the colonized. This language results from centuries of colonial domination which is aimed at eliminating other expressive forms in order to reflect the world of the colonizer. As a consequence, when colonial beings speak as the colonized, they participate in their own oppression and the very structures of alienation are reflected in all aspects of their adopted language. =Edward Said and orientalism= Cultural critic Edward Said is considered by E. San Juan, Jr. as \\"the originator and inspiring patron-saint of postcolonial theory and discourse\\" due to his interpretation of the theory of orientalism explained in his 1978 book, Orientalism. To describe the us-and-them \\"binary social relation\\" with which Western Europe intellectually divided the world‚Äîinto the \\"Occident\\" and the \\"Orient\\"‚ÄîSaid developed the denotations and connotations of the term orientalism (an art-history term for Western depictions and the study of the Orient). Said's concept (which he also termed \\"orientalism\\") is that the cultural representations generated with the us-and- them binary relation are social constructs, which are mutually constitutive and cannot exist independent of each other, because each exists on account of and for the other. Notably, \\"the West\\" created the cultural concept of \\"the East,\\" which according to Said allowed the Europeans to suppress the peoples of the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, and of Asia in general, from expressing and representing themselves as discrete peoples and cultures. Orientalism thus conflated and reduced the non-Western world into the homogeneous cultural entity known as \\"the East.\\" Therefore, in service to the colonial type of imperialism, the us-and-them Orientalist paradigm allowed European scholars to represent the Oriental World as inferior and backward, irrational and wild, as opposed to a Western Europe that was superior and progressive, rational and civil‚Äîthe opposite of the Oriental Other. Reviewing Said's Orientalism (1978), A. Madhavan (1993) says that \\"Said's passionate thesis in that book, now an 'almost canonical study', represented Orientalism as a 'style of thought' based on the antinomy of East and West in their world- views, and also as a 'corporate institution' for dealing with the Orient.\\" In concordance with philosopher Michel Foucault, Said established that power and knowledge are the inseparable components of the intellectual binary relationship with which Occidentals claim \\"knowledge of the Orient.\\" That the applied power of such cultural knowledge allowed Europeans to rename, re- define, and thereby control Oriental peoples, places, and things, into imperial colonies. The power‚Äìknowledge binary relation is conceptually essential to identify and understand colonialism in general, and European colonialism in particular. Hence, Nonetheless, critics of the homogeneous \\"Occident‚ÄìOrient\\" binary social relation, say that Orientalism is of limited descriptive capability and practical application, and propose instead that there are variants of Orientalism that apply to Africa and to Latin America. Said response was that the European West applied Orientalism as a homogeneous form of The Other, in order to facilitate the formation of the cohesive, collective European cultural identity denoted by the term \\"The West.\\" With this described binary logic, the West generally constructs the Orient subconsciously as its alter ego. Therefore, descriptions of the Orient by the Occident lack material attributes, grounded within land. This inventive, or imaginative interpretation subscribes female characteristics to the Orient and plays into fantasies that are inherent within the West's alter ego. It should be understood that this process draws creativity, amounting an entire domain and discourse. In Orientalism (p. 6), Said mentions the production of \\"philology [the study of the history of languages], lexicography [dictionary making], history, biology, political and economic theory, novel-writing and lyric poetry.\\" Therefore, there is an entire industry that exploits the Orient for its own subjective purposes that lack a native and intimate understanding. Such industries become institutionalized and eventually become a resource for manifest Orientalism, or a compilation of misinformation about the Orient.Kabbani, Rana. 1994. Imperial Fictions: Europe's Myths of Orient. London: Pandora Press. . These subjective fields of academia now synthesize the political resources and think-tanks that are so common in the West today. Orientalism is self-perpetuating to the extent that it becomes normalized within common discourse, making people say things that are latent, impulsive, or not fully conscious of its own self. =Gayatri Spivak and the subaltern= In establishing the Postcolonial definition of the term subaltern, the philosopher and theoretician Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak cautioned against assigning an over-broad connotation. She argues:de Kock, Leon. 1992. \\"Interview With Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: New Nation Writers Conference in South Africa.\\" ARIEL: A Review of International English Literature 23(3):29‚Äì47. Archived from the original on 2011-07-06. Engaging the voice of the Subaltern: the philosopher and theoretician Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, at Goldsmith College. Spivak also introduced the terms essentialism and strategic essentialism to describe the social functions of postcolonialism. Essentialism denotes the perceptual dangers inherent to reviving subaltern voices in ways that might (over) simplify the cultural identity of heterogeneous social groups and, thereby, create stereotyped representations of the different identities of the people who compose a given social group. Strategic essentialism, on the other hand, denotes a temporary, essential group-identity used in the praxis of discourse among peoples. Furthermore, essentialism can occasionally be applied‚Äîby the so-described people‚Äîto facilitate the subaltern's communication in being heeded, heard, and understood, because a strategic essentialism (a fixed and established subaltern identity) is more readily grasped, and accepted, by the popular majority, in the course of inter-group discourse. The important distinction, between the terms, is that strategic essentialism does not ignore the diversity of identities (cultural and ethnic) in a social group, but that, in its practical function, strategic essentialism temporarily minimizes inter-group diversity to pragmatically support the essential group-identity. Spivak developed and applied Foucault's term epistemic violence to describe the destruction of non-Western ways of perceiving the world and the resultant dominance of the Western ways of perceiving the world. Conceptually, epistemic violence specifically relates to women, whereby the \\"Subaltern [woman] must always be caught in translation, never [allowed to be] truly expressing herself,\\" because the colonial power's destruction of her culture pushed to the social margins her non‚ÄìWestern ways of perceiving, understanding, and knowing the world. In June of the year 1600, the Afro‚ÄìIberian woman Francisca de Figueroa requested from the King of Spain his permission for her to emigrate from Europe to New Spain, and reunite with her daughter, Juana de Figueroa. As a subaltern woman, Francisca repressed her native African language, and spoke her request in Peninsular Spanish, the official language of Colonial Latin America. As a subaltern woman, she applied to her voice the Spanish cultural filters of sexism, Christian monotheism, and servile language, in addressing her colonial master: Moreover, Spivak further cautioned against ignoring subaltern peoples as \\"cultural Others\\", and said that the West could progress‚Äîbeyond the colonial perspective‚Äîby means of introspective self-criticism of the basic ideals and investigative methods that establish a culturally superior West studying the culturally inferior non‚ÄìWestern peoples. Hence, the integration of the subaltern voice to the intellectual spaces of social studies is problematic, because of the unrealistic opposition to the idea of studying \\"Others\\"; Spivak rejected such an anti-intellectual stance by social scientists, and about them said that \\"to refuse to represent a cultural Other is salving your conscience‚Ä¶allowing you not to do any homework.\\" Moreover, postcolonial studies also reject the colonial cultural depiction of subaltern peoples as hollow mimics of the European colonists and their Western ways; and rejects the depiction of subaltern peoples as the passive recipient-vessels of the imperial and colonial power of the Mother Country. Consequent to Foucault's philosophic model of the binary relationship of power and knowledge, scholars from the Subaltern Studies Collective, proposed that anti-colonial resistance always counters every exercise of colonial power. =Homi K. Bhabha and hybridity= In The Location of Culture (1994), theoretician Homi K. Bhabha argues that viewing the human world as composed of separate and unequal cultures, rather than as an integral human world, perpetuates the belief in the existence of imaginary peoples and places‚Äî\\"Christendom\\" and the \\"Islamic World\\", \\"First World,\\" \\"Second World,\\" and the \\"Third World.\\" To counter such linguistic and sociological reductionism, postcolonial praxis establishes the philosophic value of hybrid intellectual spaces, wherein ambiguity abrogates truth and authenticity; thereby, hybridity is the philosophic condition that most substantively challenges the ideological validity of colonialism.Bhabha, 1994: 113 = R. Siva Kumar and alternative modernity = In 1997, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of India's Independence, \\"Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism\\" was an important exhibition curated by R. Siva Kumar at the National Gallery of Modern Art. In his catalogue essay, Kumar introduced the term Contextual Modernism, which later emerged as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of Indian art, specifically the works of Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, and Benode Behari Mukherjee. In the postcolonial history of art, this marked the departure from Eurocentric unilateral idea of modernism to alternative context sensitive modernisms. Several terms including Paul Gilroy's counterculture of modernity and Tani E. Barlow's Colonial modernity have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that 'Contextual Modernism' is a more suited term because \\"the colonial in colonial modernity does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan's artist teachers' refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.\\"Gilroy, Paul Christopher, and Dipesh Chakrabarty. 2011. \\"Overcoming Polarized Modernities: Counter-Modern Art Education: Santiniketan, The Legacy of a Poet's School.\\" =Dipesh Chakrabarty= In Provincializing Europe (2000), Dipesh Chakrabarty charts the subaltern history of the Indian struggle for independence, and counters Eurocentric, Western scholarship about non-Western peoples and cultures, by proposing that Western Europe simply be considered as culturally equal to the other cultures of the world; that is, as \\"one region among many\\" in human geography. =Derek Gregory and the colonial present= Derek Gregory argues the long trajectory through history of British and American colonization is an ongoing process still happening today. In The Colonial Present, Gregory traces connections between the geopolitics of events happening in modern-day Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq and links it back to the us-and-them binary relation between the Western and Eastern world. Building upon the ideas of the other and Said's work on orientalism, Gregory critiques the economic policy, military apparatus, and transnational corporations as vehicles driving present-day colonialism. Emphasizing ideas of discussing ideas around colonialism in the present tense, Gregory utilizes modern events such as the September 11 attacks to tell spatial stories around the colonial behavior happening due to the War on Terror.Gregory, Derek. 2004. The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq. Blackwell Pub. = Amar Acheraiou and Classical influences = Acheraiou argues that colonialism was a capitalist venture moved by appropriation and plundering of foreign lands and was supported by military force and a discourse that legitimized violence in the name of progress and a universal civilizing mission. This discourse is complex and multi-faceted. It was elaborated in the 19th century by colonial ideologues such as Joseph-Ernest Renan and Arthur de Gobineau, but its roots reach far back in history. In Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literature and the Legacy of Classical Writers, Acheraiou discusses the history of colonialist discourse and traces its spirit to ancient Greece, including Europe's claim to racial supremacy and right to rule over non-Europeans harboured by Renan and other 19th-century colonial ideologues. He argues that modern colonial representations of the colonized as \\"inferior,\\" \\"stagnant,\\" and \\"degenerate\\" were borrowed from Greek and Latin authors like Lysias (440‚Äì380 BC), Isocrates (436‚Äì338 BC), Plato (427‚Äì327 BC), Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC), Cicero (106‚Äì43 BC), and Sallust (86‚Äì34 BC), who all considered their racial others‚Äîthe Persians, Scythians, Egyptians as \\"backward,\\" \\"inferior,\\" and \\"effeminate.\\" Among these ancient writers Aristotle is the one who articulated more thoroughly these ancient racial assumptions, which served as a source of inspiration for modern colonists. In The Politics, he established a racial classification and ranked the Greeks superior to the rest. He considered them as an ideal race to rule over Asian and other 'barbarian' peoples, for they knew how to blend the spirit of the European \\"war-like races\\" with Asiatic \\"intelligence\\" and \\"competence.\\" Ancient Rome was a source of admiration in Europe since the enlightenment. In France, Voltaire (1694-1778) was one of the most fervent admirers of Rome. He regarded highly the Roman republican values of rationality, democracy, order and justice. In early-18th century Britain, it was poets and politicians like Joseph Addison (1672‚Äì1719) and Richard Glover (1712 ‚Äì1785) who were vocal advocates of these ancient republican values. It was in the mid-18th century that ancient Greece became a source of admiration among the French and British. This enthusiasm gained prominence in the late-eighteenth century. It was spurred by German Hellenist scholars and English romantic poets, who regarded ancient Greece as the matrix of Western civilization and a model of beauty and democracy. These included: Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717‚Äì1768), Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767‚Äì1835), and Goethe (1749‚Äì1832), Lord Byron (1788‚Äì1824), Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772‚Äì1834), Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792‚Äì1822), and John Keats (1795‚Äì1821). In the 19th century, when Europe began to expand across the globe and establish colonies, ancient Greece and Rome were used as a source of empowerment and justification to Western civilizing mission. At this period, many French and British imperial ideologues identified strongly with the ancient empires and invoked ancient Greece and Rome to justify the colonial civilizing project. They urged European colonizers to emulate these \\"ideal\\" classical conquerors, whom they regarded as \\"universal instructors.\\" For Alexis de Tocqueville (1805‚Äì1859), an ardent and influential advocate of la \\"Grande France,\\" the classical empires were model conquerors to imitate. He advised the French colonists in Algeria to follow the ancient imperial example. In 1841, he stated: > [W]hat matters most when we want to set up and develop a colony is to make > sure that those who arrive in it are as less estranged as possible, that > these newcomers meet a perfect image of their homeland....the thousand > colonies that the Greeks founded on the Mediterranean coasts were all exact > copies of the Greek cities on which they had been modelled. The Romans > established in almost all parts of the globe known to them municipalities > which were no more than miniature Romes. Among modern colonizers, the > English did the same. Who can prevent us from emulating these European > peoples?. The Greeks and Romans were deemed exemplary conquerors and \\"heuristic teachers,\\" whose lessons were invaluable for modern colonists ideologues. John-Robert Seeley (1834-1895), a history professor at Cambridge and proponent of imperialism stated in a rhetoric which echoed that of Renan that the role of the British Empire was 'similar to that of Rome, in which we hold the position of not merely of ruling but of an educating and civilizing race.\\" The incorporation of ancient concepts and racial and cultural assumptions into modern imperial ideology bolstered colonial claims to supremacy and right to colonize non-Europeans. Because of these numerous ramifications between ancient representations and modern colonial rhetoric, 19th century's colonialist discourse acquires a \\"multi-layered\\" or \\"palimpsestic\\" structure. It forms a \\"historical, ideological and narcissistic continuum,\\" in which modern theories of domination feed upon and blend with \\"ancient myths of supremacy and grandeur.\\" Postcolonial literary study As a literary theory, postcolonialism deals with the literatures produced by the peoples who once were colonized by the European imperial powers (e.g. Britain, France, and Spain) and the literatures of the decolonized countries engaged in contemporary, postcolonial arrangements (e.g. Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the Commonwealth of Nations) with their former mother countries.Evans, Graham, and Jeffrey Newnham, eds. 1998. The Penguin Dictionary of International Relations. pp. 83‚Äì84, 182‚Äì83. Postcolonial literary criticism comprehends the literatures written by the colonizer and the colonized, wherein the subject matter includes portraits of the colonized peoples and their lives as imperial subjects. In Dutch literature, the Indies Literature includes the colonial and postcolonial genres, which examine and analyze the formation of a postcolonial identity, and the postcolonial culture produced by the diaspora of the Indo-European peoples, the Eurasian folk who originated from Indonesia; the peoples who were the colony of the Dutch East Indies; in the literature, the notable author is Tjalie Robinson. Waiting for the Barbarians (1980) by J. M. Coetzee depicts the unfair and inhuman situation of people dominated by settlers. To perpetuate and facilitate control of the colonial enterprise, some colonized people, especially from among the subaltern peoples of the British Empire, were sent to attend university in the Imperial Motherland; they were to become the native-born, but Europeanised, ruling class of colonial satraps. Yet, after decolonization, their bicultural educations originated postcolonial criticism of empire and colonialism, and of the representations of the colonist and the colonized. In the late 20th century, after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the constituent Soviet Socialist Republics became the literary subjects of postcolonial criticism, wherein the writers dealt with the legacies (cultural, social, economic) of the Russification of their peoples, countries, and cultures in service to Greater Russia. Postcolonial literary study is in two categories: # the study of postcolonial nations; and # the study of the nations who continue forging a postcolonial national identity. The first category of literature presents and analyzes the internal challenges inherent to determining an ethnic identity in a decolonized nation. The second category of literature presents and analyzes the degeneration of civic and nationalist unities consequent to ethnic parochialism, usually manifested as the demagoguery of \\"protecting the nation,\\" a variant of the us-and-them binary social relation. Civic and national unity degenerate when a patriarchal r√©gime unilaterally defines what is and what is not \\"the national culture\\" of the decolonized country: the nation-state collapses, either into communal movements, espousing grand political goals for the postcolonial nation; or into ethnically mixed communal movements, espousing political separatism, as occurred in decolonized Rwanda, the Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; thus the postcolonial extremes against which Frantz Fanon warned in 1961. Regarding sociolinguistic interpretations of literary texts through postcolonial lenses we may refer to the book Indian Novels in English: A Sociolinguistic Study (2005) by Jaydeep Sarangi. Application =The Middle East= In the essays \\"Overstating the Arab State\\" (2001) by Nazih Ayubi, and \\"Is Jordan Palestine?\\" (2003) by Raphael Israeli, the authors deal with the psychologically-fragmented postcolonial identity, as determined by the effects (political and social, cultural and economic) of Western colonialism in the Middle East. As such, the fragmented national identity remains a characteristic of such societies, consequence of the imperially convenient, but arbitrary, colonial boundaries (geographic and cultural) demarcated by the Europeans, with which they ignored the tribal and clan relations that determined the geographic borders of the Middle East countries, before the arrival of European imperialists.Israeli, Raphael. 2003. \\"Is Jordan Palestine.\\" Pp. 49‚Äì66 in Israel, Hashemites, and the Palestinians: The Fateful Triangle, edited by E. Karsh and P. R. Kumaraswamy. London: Frank Cass.Ayubi, Nazih. 2001. Overstating the Arab State. Bodmin: I.B. Tauris. pp. 86‚Äì123. Hence, the postcolonial literature about the Middle East examines and analyzes the Western discourses about identity formation, the existence and inconsistent nature of a postcolonial national-identity among the peoples of the contemporary Middle East. \\"The Middle East\\" is the Western name for the countries of South-western Asia. In his essay \\"Who Am I?: The Identity Crisis in the Middle East\\" (2006), P.R. Kumaraswamy says: Independence and the end of colonialism did not end social fragmentation and war (civil and international) in the Middle East. In The Search for Arab Democracy: Discourses and Counter- Discourses (2004), Larbi Sadiki says that the problems of national identity in the Middle East are a consequence of the Orientalist indifference of the European empires when they demarcated the political borders of their colonies, which ignored the local history and the geographic and tribal boundaries observed by the natives, in the course of establishing the Western version of the Middle East. In the event: > [I]n places like Iraq and Jordan, leaders of the new sovereign states were > brought in from the outside, [and] tailored to suit colonial interests and > commitments. Likewise, most states in the Persian Gulf were handed over to > those [Europeanised colonial subjects] who could protect and safeguard > imperial interests in the post-withdrawal phase. Moreover, \\"with notable exceptions like Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, most [countries]...[have] had to [re]invent, their historical roots\\" after decolonization, and, \\"like its colonial predecessor, postcolonial identity owes its existence to force.\\" =Africa= Colonialism in 1913: the African colonies of the European empires; and the postcolonial, 21st-century political boundaries of the decolonized countries. (Click image for key) In the late 19th century, the Scramble for Africa (1874‚Äì1914) proved to be the tail end of mercantilist colonialism of the European imperial powers, yet, for the Africans, the consequences were greater than elsewhere in the colonized non‚ÄìWestern world. To facilitate the colonization the European empires laid railroads where the rivers and the land proved impassable. The Imperial British railroad effort proved overambitious in the effort of traversing continental Africa, yet succeeded only in connecting colonial North Africa (Cairo) with the colonial south of Africa (Cape Town). Upon arriving to Africa, the Europeans encountered the native African civilizations of the Ashanti Empire, the Benin Empire, the Kingdom of Dahomey, the Buganda Kingdom (Uganda), and the Kingdom of Kongo, all of which were annexed by imperial powers under the belief that they required European stewardship, as proposed and justified in the essay \\"The African Character\\" (1830), by G. W. F. Hegel, in keeping with his philosophic opinion that cultures were stages in the course of the historical unfolding of The Absolute.Heart of Darkness: Authoritative Text, Backgrounds and Context, Criticism (Fourth Edition), Paul B. Armstrong, Editor. (2006), pp. 208‚Äì12. Nigeria was the homeland of the Hausa people, the Yoruba people and the Igbo people; which last were among the first people to develop their history in constructing a postcolonial identity. (See: Things Fall Apart, 1958). About East Africa, Kenyan writer Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o wrote Weep Not, Child (1964), the first postcolonial novel about the East African experience of colonial imperialism; as well as Decolonizing the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature (1986). In The River Between (1965), with the Mau Mau Uprising (1952‚Äì60) as political background, he addresses the postcolonial matters of native religious culture, and the consequences of the imposition of Christianity, a religion culturally foreign to Kenya and to most of Africa. In postcolonial countries of Africa, the Africans and the non‚ÄìAfricans live in a world of genders, ethnicities, classes and languages, of ages, families, professions, religions and nations. There is a suggestion that individualism and postcolonialism are essentially discontinuous and divergent cultural phenomena.\\"Extravagant Postcolonialism: Ethics and Individualism in Anglophonic, Anglocentric Postcolonial Fiction; Or, 'What was (this) Postcolonialism?'\\" ELH 75(4):899‚Äì937. Johns Hopkins University Press. 2008. =Asia= Map of French Indochina from the colonial period showing its five subdivisions: Tonkin, Annam, Cochinchina, Cambodia and Laos. (Click image for key) French Indochina was divided into five subdivisions: Tonkin, Annam, Cochinchina, Cambodia, and Laos. Cochinchina (southern Vietnam) was the first territory under French control; Saigon was conquered in 1859; and in 1887, the Indochinese Union (Union indochinoise) was established. In 1924, Nguyen Ai Quoc (aka Ho Chi Minh) wrote the first critical text against the French colonization: Le Proc√®s de la colonization fran√ßaise ('French Colonization on Trial') Trinh T. Minh-ha has been developing her innovative theories about postcolonialism in various means of expression, literature, films, and teaching. She is best known for her documentary film Reassemblage (1982), in which she attempts to deconstruct anthropology as a \\"western male hegemonic ideology.\\" In 1989, she wrote Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism, in which she focuses on the acknowledgement of oral tradition. = Eastern Europe = The partitions of Poland (1772‚Äì1918) and occupation of Eastern European countries by the Soviet Union after the Second World War were forms of \\"white\\" colonialism, for long overlooked by postcolonial theorists. The domination of European empires (Prussian, Austrian, Russian, and later Soviet) over neighboring territories (Belarus, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine), consisting in military invasion, exploitation of human and natural resources, devastation of culture, and efforts to re-educate local people in the empires' language, in many ways resembled the violent conquest of overseas territories by Western European powers, despite such factors as geographical proximity and the missing racial difference. Postcolonial studies in East-Central and Eastern Europe were inaugurated by Ewa M. Thompson's seminal book Imperial Knowledge: Russian Literature and Colonialism (2000), followed by works of Aleksander Fiut, Hanna Gosk, Violeta Kelertas, Dorota Ko≈Çodziejczyk, Janusz Korek, Dariusz Sk√≥rczewski, Bogdan ≈ûtefƒÉnescu, and Tomasz Zarycki. = Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) = Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) implemented by the World Bank and IMF are viewed by some postcolonialists as the modern procedure of colonization. Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) calls for trade liberalization, privatization of banks, health care, and educational institutions. These implementations minimized government's role, paved pathways for companies to enter Africa for its resources. Limited to production and exportation of cash crops, many African nations acquired more debt, and were left stranded in a position where acquiring more loan and continuing to pay high interest became an endless cycle. The Dictionary of Human Geography uses the definition of colonialism as \\"enduring relationship of domination and mode of dispossession, usually (or at least initially) between an indigenous (or enslaved) majority and a minority of interlopers (colonizers), who are convinced of their own superiority, pursue their own interests, and exercise power through a mixture of coercion, persuasion, conflict and collaboration.\\"Clayton, Dan. 2009. \\"colonialism.\\" Pp. 94‚Äì98 in The Dictionary of Human Geography (5th ed.), edited by D. Gregory, R. Johnston, G. Pratt, M. J.Watts, and S. Whatmore. Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell. This definition suggests that the SAPs implemented by the Washington Consensus is indeed an act of colonization. Criticism = Undermining of universal values = Indian Marxist scholar Vivek Chibber has critiqued some foundational logics of postcolonial theory in his book Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital. Drawing on Aijaz Ahmad's earlier critique of Said's Orientalism and Sumit Sarkar's critique of the Subaltern Studies scholars, Chibber focuses on and refutes the principal historical claims made by the Subaltern Studies scholars; claims that are representative of the whole of postcolonial theory. Postcolonial theory, he argues, essentializes cultures, painting them as fixed and static categories. Moreover, it presents the difference between East and West as unbridgeable, hence denying people's \\"universal aspirations\\" and \\"universal interests.\\" He also criticized the postcolonial tendency to characterize all of Enlightenment values as Eurocentric. According to him, the theory will be remembered \\"for its revival of cultural essentialism and its acting as an endorsement of orientalism, rather than being an antidote to it.\\" = Fixation on national identity = The concentration of postcolonial studies upon the subject of national identity has determined it is essential to the creation and establishment of a stable nation and country in the aftermath of decolonization; yet indicates that either an indeterminate or an ambiguous national identity has tended to limit the social, cultural, and economic progress of a decolonized people. In Overstating the Arab State (2001) by Nazih Ayubi, Moroccan scholar Bin 'Abd al-'Ali proposed that the existence of \\"a pathological obsession with...identity\\" is a cultural theme common to the contemporary academic field Middle Eastern Studies.Ayubi, Nazih. 2001. Overstating the Arab State. Bodmin: I.B. Tauris. Nevertheless, Kumaraswamy and Sadiki say that such a common sociological problem‚Äîthat of an indeterminate national identity‚Äîamong the countries of the Middle East is an important aspect that must be accounted in order to have an understanding of the politics of the contemporary Middle East. In the event, Ayubi asks if what 'Bin Abd al‚Äì'Ali sociologically described as an obsession with national identity might be explained by \\"the absence of a championing social class?\\"  Postcolonial literature  =Foundation works= Some works written prior to the formal establishment of postcolonial studies as a discipline have been considered retroactively as works of postcolonialist theory. * 1924.

There are different definitions of the far-left. Some scholars define it as representing the left of social democracy while others limit it to the left of communist parties. In certain instances, especially in the news media, the term far-left has been associated with some forms of anarchism and communism, or it characterizes groups that advocate for revolutionary anti-capitalism and anti-globalization. Extremist far-left politics can involve violent acts and the formation of far-left militant organizations meant to abolish capitalist systems and the upper ruling class. Far-left terrorism consists of groups that attempt to realize their radical ideals and bring about change through violence rather than established political processes.  Definition  The definition of the far- left has varies in the literature and there is not a general agreement on what it entails or consensus on the core characteristics that constitute the far- left, other than being to the left of \\"the left\\". In France, extr√™me-gauche (\\"extreme left\\") is a generally accepted term for political groups that position themselves to the left of the Socialist Party, although some such as the political scientist Serge Cosseron limit the scope to the left of the French Communist Party. Scholars such as Luke March and Cas Mudde propose that socio-economic rights are at the far-left's core. Moreover, March and Mudde argue that the far-left is to the left of \\"the left\\" with regard to how parties or groups describe economic inequality on the base of existing social and political arrangements. Luke March, Senior Lecturer in Soviet and post- Soviet Politics at Politics and International Relations of the University of Edinburgh, defines the far-left as those who position themselves to the left of social democracy which is seen as insufficiently left-wing. The two main sub-types of far-left politics are called \\"the radical left\\" and \\"the extreme left\\". The first desires fundamental changes in neoliberal capitalism and progressive reform of democracy such as direct democracy and the inclusion of marginalised communities while the latter denounces liberal democracy as a \\"compromise with bourgeois political forces\\" and defines capitalism more strictly. Far-left politics is seen as radical politics because it calls for fundamental change to the capitalist socio-economic structure of society. March and Mudde claim that far-left parties are an increasingly stabilized political actor and are challenging mainstream social democratic parties, defining other core characteristics of far-left politics as being internationalism and a focus on networking and solidarity as well as opposition to globalization and neoliberalism. In his later conceptualization, March started to refer to far-left politics as \\"radical left politics\\" which is constituted of radical left parties that reject the socio-economic structures of contemporary society that are based on the principles and values of capitalism.  Radical left parties  The New Anticapitalist Party during a demonstration against pension reform in October 2010 in Paris In Europe, the support for far-left politics comes from three overlapping groups, namely far- left subcultures, disaffected social democrats and protest voters‚Äîthose who are opposed to their country's European Union membership. To distinguish the far-left from the moderate left, Luke March and Cas Mudde identify three useful criteria: * Firstly, the far-left rejects the underlying socio-economic structure of contemporary capitalism. * Secondly, they advocate alternative economic and power structures which involve the redistribution of resources from political elites. * Thirdly, they are internationalists, seeing a causality between imperialism and globalism and regional socio-economic issues. Others classify the far-left under the category of populist socialist parties. Some such as Professor V√≠t Hlou≈°ek and Professor Lubom√≠r Kopeƒçek of the Masaryk University at the International Institute of Political Science suggest secondary characteristics, including anti-Americanism, anti- globalization, opposition to NATO and in some cases a rejection of European integration. Luke March states that \\"compared with the international communist movement 30 years ago, the far left has undergone a process of profound de- radicalisation. The extreme left is marginal in most places\\". March identifies four major subgroups within contemporary European far-left politics, namely communists, democratic socialists, populist socialists and social populists. In a later conception of far-left politics, March writes that \\"I prefer the term 'radical left' to alternatives such as 'hard left' and 'far left', which can appear pejorative and imply that the left is necessarily marginal\\". According to March, the most successful far-left parties are \\"pragmatic and non-ideological\\".  Far-left terrorism  Aftermath of the bombing on American Ramstein Air Base in 1981 by the left-wing terrorist group RAF Many far-left militant organizations were formed by members of existing political parties in the 1960s and 1970s such as the Montoneros, the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigades. These groups generally aim to overthrow capitalism and the wealthy ruling classes.

Life  The Dunkelgr√§fin (Dark Countess) arrived in Hildburghausen on February 7, 1807. In 1810, they moved into the nearby but secluded castle of Eishausen where they stayed until their deaths. The man presented himself as Count Vavel de Versay and kept the woman‚Äôs identity secret, making only clear that they were neither married or lovers. They led a secretive life, particularly the Countess who ventured out only in a carriage or with a veil covering her face. At her death (November 28, 1837) she was inhumed very quickly, possibly without a religious service. The Count - later identified as Leonardus Cornelius van der Valck (born September 2, 1769 in Amsterdam), secretary in the Dutch embassy in Paris from July, 1798 to April, 1799 - gave her name as Sophie Botta, a single woman from Westphalia ; according to Dr. Lommler, the physician who constated her death, she looked about 60 years of age. She was buried in a grave on Schulersberg hill, in a garden that the Dunkelgr√§fin had bought in 1820. The Count stayed in the castle and died there on April 8, 1845. He was buried in the churchyard of Eishausen. The castle in which the Dunkelgr√§fin had lived was demolished in 1873.  Theories  Title page of Bechstein's novel '''' The mysterious couple sparked much interest and speculations about the identity of the Countess started early on. The most notable ‚Äì with very little support from historians though ‚Äì proposes that she would be the true Marie-Th√©r√®se, daughter of Marie Antoinette, imprisoned in the Temple and supposedly redeemed in 1795 in exchange for French prisoners. According to this hypothesis, Marie- Th√©r√®se, traumatized by her trials or pregnant by rape, would have refused to go back in the world; her adoptive sister (and possible half sister), Ernestine de Lambriquet, would have taken her place.Nagel, Susan. Marie- Th√©r√®se: The Fate of Marie Antoinette's Daughter. Bloomsbury, 2009. When Marie Th√©r√®se was released from Temple in 1795 and allowed to depart for Austria, Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy was chosen to accompany her on her journey to the border in Huningue after her mother Marie Ang√©lique de Mackau - who had been the first choice of Marie-Therese - was forced to decline due to health reasons. Marie-Therese, who traveled under the name Sophie, sat in the carriage with de Soucy and the guards Mechin (posing as the father of Sophie) and Gomin; the male servants Hue and Baron, the cook Meunier, as well as the maid Catherine de Varenne and a teenage boy called Pierre de Soucy, followed them in the next carriage. According to the legendary switch theory of the Dunkelgr√§fin, Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy assisted Marie-Therese in changing place with Ernestine de Lambriquet during the trip to Austria in 1795-96. Among the eight people accompanying Marie-Therese during her trip through France in 1795, the maid Catherine de Varenne and the teenage boy Pierre de Soucy is mentioned in the passports, but are otherwise impossible to identify. Pierre de Soucy is stated in the passport to be the son of Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy, but she had no son by that name. According to the Switch theory, Pierre de Soucy (or possibly Catherine de Varenne) was in fact Ernestine de Lambriquet, who switched place with Marie-Therese during the journey with the assistance of Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy, after which Ernestine de Lambriquet continued to Austria posing as Marie-Therese, while Marie-Therese herself settled in Germany as the Dunkelgr√§fin. The Austrian Emperor had, in fact, requested that Ernestine de Lambriquet should be allowed to accompany Marie-Therese to Austria, but Minister Benezch had given the reply that Ernestine de Lambriquet could not be located. In reality, however, there would not have been any trouble to locate Ernestine de Lambriquet, as she had lived under the protection of Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy and the Mackau family since the storming of the Tuileries on the 10th of August, 1792. The alternative suggestion is that \\"Pierre de Soucy\\" was in fact one of the daughters of Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy, dressed as a boy in order to make the travel group less identifiable, as Marie-Therese was estimated to have been exposed to threats not only from anti-royalists but also from agents sent by foreign powers to kidnap her during her journey to the border. It is a fact that Ren√©e Suzanne de Soucy exposed Marie-Therese to blackmail for unclear reasons, blackmail Marie- Therese submitted to, which has been speculated to have the connection to this alleged switch. According to Mme. von Heimbruch, her lady in waiting, Queen Mary of Hanover believed that the Dunkelgr√§fin was a Princess of Cond√©. Legacy The Dunkelgr√§fin is the theme of numerous historical essays and fictions in German and French, among them a novel by Ludwig Bechstein. Investigation On 15 October, 2013, the remains of the Dunkelgr√§fin were exhumed for DNA tests. She was solemnly reburied on November 7, 2013. DNA analysis and a study of her reconstructed facial features clearly confirmed that she was not related to Marie-Therese.  Bibliography  * * Richard Boehmker: Das Geheimnis um eine K√∂nigstochter.

As the second of three films in a series based on the Not Quite Human novels by Seth McEvoy, it follows the social development of an android that is designed to appear human, this time as he enrolls in college and is on his own for the first time. The filming locations were Arizona State University, Scottsdale, and Phoenix. Plot The film begins with Chip (Jay Underwood), the android, installing specially-ordered software designed to enhance his facial expressions; it is later discovered that he also inadvertently intakes a computer virus that causes him to malfunction very gradually, diminishing control over his own system's functions. Initially, the virus simply causes Chip to have momentary memory lapses resulting in poor judgment, but within five days it will completely destroy his internal systems, wiping his memory. That same day, Dr. Jonas Carson (Alan Thicke) and his daughter, Becky (Robyn Lively), attend Chip's high school graduation. Chip mentions that he wants to attend college and has already signed up for the summer session; however, his father does not feel Chip is ready to be on his own. Becky later manages to persuade her dad to grant Chip's request, pointing out that college is the natural next step in Chip's development. Since Dr. Carson only reluctantly agreed to allow Chip to attend college, he and Becky secretly follow him to the school in a vehicle that is set up as a monitoring station in order to watch from a distance. At school, Chip sees a girl in a lab coat passing through the hall of the science building and becomes infatuated with her. Chip gets help from his roommate to try to fit in better socially at school, but Chip manages to alienate himself from a popular girl and from his roommate because of his awkwardness, and with no help from his computer virus takeover. When Chip feels homesick and calls his dad, his dad advises that he go after something that really interests him, so the next day, Chip follows Roberta (Katie Barberi) into the robotics lab and asks her out on a date, where she informs Chip that she is an android. Excited by this revelation, Chip tells her that he is also an android. Chip soon learns that Roberta is not able to decide anything for herself, so he introduces her to the concept of free will by reprogramming her. When Roberta chooses to go with Chip instead of returning to Dr. Phil Masters (Greg Mullavy) and the other scientists who developed her, the two of them are forced to flee. Prof. Victoria Gray (Dey Young) discovers that her fellow scientists are responsible for distributing a virus designed to disable competitors' androids, so she joins Dr. Carson in trying to catch up with Chip to provide the antidote. After being relentlessly pursued a great distance, Chip and Roberta finally manage to escape the scientists, and they are surrounded by desert when Roberta explains that running has used up almost all of her power. With the virus's effects growing more pronounced, Chip is unable to control his body very effectively as he carries Roberta and desperately searches for a power outlet to recharge her. Not finding an adequate power source, Chip slumps to the ground as the virus overtakes him, saying haltingly to Roberta, \\"I... love... you.\\" Dr. Carson and Becky arrive just a moment later with Prof. Gray, and they manage to successfully administer the antidote just before Chip's systems fail completely. Once he is fully revived, Chip reveals that he had utilized his magnetic finger to write all of Roberta's programming and memories to a diskette before she lost all power, preserving the character and personality of the girl that he had fought to protect. A photograph at the end shows the Carsons together with Roberta and Prof. Gray. Character development In each of the three Not Quite Human films, Chip is at a distinct level of development in his social awareness. While Chip had difficulty carrying on a sensible conversation in the first film and didn't notice how people perceived him, in Not Quite Human II he communicates fairly well but just takes some statements too literally. For instance, when a pair of fellow college students invite Chip to \\"join\\" them for a game of cards, Chip responds, \\"Are you coming apart?\\" He also sometimes comes close to inadvertently revealing that he is an android, such as when he successfully chases his bus going at full speed down the road. It is this naivety and peculiarity that hinder Chip's efforts to form friendships. Chip's roommate, Brandon Wilson (Scott Nell), does his best to engage Chip in the social scene, but Chip still feels like an outsider. This is why Chip is so glad to encounter Roberta, another android who is also not very developed socially. Cast *Jay Underwood ... Chip Carson *Alan Thicke ... Dr. Jonas Carson *Robyn Lively ...

Neither survive as paintings by Leonardo, but there are a number of drawings for both by him, and copies in oils, especially of the second composition, where Leda stands. First version Leonardo began making studies in 1504 for a painting, apparently never executed, of Leda seated on the ground with her children. Three sketches of Leda by Leonardo exist: * Leda and the Swan, pen and ink and wash over black chalk on paper, 160 x 139 mm. 1503‚Äì1507, Devonshire Collection, Chatsworth (pictured) * Study for kneeling Leda, black chalk, pen and ink on paper, 126 x 109 cm. 1503‚Äì1507, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam * Studies of Leda and a Horse, black chalk, brush and ink on paper, 1503‚Äì1507, Royal Library, Windsor It has been proposed that Leonardo's Chatsworth sketch for Leda and the Swan (pictured) may have been inspired by the Laoco√∂n Group, the famous Vatican sculpture discovered in 1506: there is a similar twist to the subject's body; the curve of the swan's neck recalls the snake's lithe body in Laoco√∂n's hand; the rape by Zeus evokes the forceful attack of the serpents; and the child next to Leda's knee resembles Laoco√∂n's son on the right, who also has a sheer break at the wrist.Jelbert, Rebecca: 'Aping the Masters?: Michelangelo and the Laoco√∂n Group.' Journal of Art Crime, issue 22 (Fall/ Winter 2019), pp.6 and 13, figure 3. A completed copy of Kneeling Leda with her Children by Giampietrino is kept at the Museumslandschaft Hessen Kassel, Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister, Kassel (c.1515/20, oil on wood, 128 x 106 cm). Completed version Pen-and- ink drawing by Raphael, presumably after Leonardo In 1508 Leonardo painted a different composition of the subject. The picture known as Leda and the Swan depicted a nude standing Leda cuddling the swan, with the two sets of infant twins, and their huge broken egg-shells. The original of this is lost, probably deliberately destroyed, and was last recorded in the French royal Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau in 1625 by Cassiano dal Pozzo: A standing figure of Leda almost entirely naked, with the swan at her and two eggs, from whose broken shells come forth four babies, This work, although somewhat dry in style, is exquisitely finished, especially in the woman's breast; and for the rest of the landscape and the plant life are rendered with the greatest diligence. Unfortunately the picture is in a bad state because it is done on three long panels which have split apart and broken off a certain amount of paint. However the picture is known from many copies, of which the earliest are probably the Spiridon Leda, perhaps by a studio assistant and now in the Uffizi,image; Fossi, Gloria, pp. 402-3, Uffizi: art, history, collections, Giunti Editore Firenze Italy, 2004, , 9788809036765 google books and the one at Wilton House in England.

Best known as an abstract modernist painter, Saru was very active in Romania, working as both an artist and professor of art at The Fine Art Academy of Bucharest. He is known for his ability to create transparency and a glowing quality through his fine brushwork. His abstract work has a very distinct style and often hides figurative motifs all throughout. George Saru has illustrated many books, children's books, has designed mosaic public art works and has collaborated on tapestry work with his wife, Liana Saru. He moved to America in the late 1980s and although legally blind, he painted until his last days taking on a much different and less detailed, striking brushwork style and painted in much brighter colors.

He is known for the Flex-Foot brand of artificial foot and limbs that he created, and for his charity work for amputees. An amputee himself, having lost a leg below the knee at age 21, Phillips was motivated by the limitations of then-existing artificial limbs to attend the Northwestern University Medical School Prosthetic-Orthotic Center. After graduation, he worked as a biomedical design engineer at the University of Utah before starting his own company, Flex-Foot Incorporated in 1984. Phillips ultimately created a workable artificial foot made from carbon graphite. Unlike all previous prostheses, it stored kinetic energy from the wearer's steps as potential energy, like a spring, allowing the wearer to run and jump. A prosthetic foot that he created, the Flex-Foot Cheetah, is used by double-amputee and Paralympics gold-medalist Oscar Pistorius, and about 90 percent of Paralympics participants use a variation of the original Flex-Foot design, as well as thousands of people around the world. Phillips sold Flex-Foot to Ossur in 2000, which continues to manufacture the artificial foot. See also √ñssur#Prosthetics. In 1999 he established Second Wind, a non-profit organization to provide inexpensive and resistant prostheses to amputees around the world, and is now working to create a prosthetic leg for land mine victims in developing countries.

She was lynched and accused of sorcery in Brigsted at Horsens in Denmark, a lynching considered to be the last witch lynching in her country and, most likely, in all Scandinavia. Long after the legal courts in Denmark stopped executing witches after the execution of Anne Palles and Johan Pistorius, the belief led to private trials and lynching of alleged witches during the 18th century. In the countryside in √òster Gr√∏nning in Salling in 1722, the villagers apprehended a woman, Dorte Jensdatter, whom they suspected of having caused several deaths and problems in the village by magic, and held a private witch trial. When they were convinced, they tied her up in her own home and burned the house down with her in it. Several of the villagers were later sentenced to death for her murder. Klemens' was the last of these lynch cases. Klemens was a beggar who consulted a cunning woman together with several other people. When she entered the room, the \\"Wise One\\" pointed at her and cried out: \\"Here we have the master of all the witch craft!\\" She ordered six of the men present to beat Klemens up, as it was the belief that the magic of a witch left her when her blood had been spilt. The people gathered obeyed her, out of fear and respect for the wisdom and judgement of the \\"wise one\\", and Klemens died of the abuse. The cunning woman was executed for the murder and the men were banished.

The edibility of this mushroom is controversial - some sources claim that it is edible, while others claim it to be poisonous, although effects are little known and its toxic constituents undescribed. Taxonomy The French mycologist Lucien Qu√©let gave it its current binomial name in 1872, after it was initially described as Agaricus aeruginosus by William Curtis in 1784. The Dutch mycologist Machiel Noordeloos placed it in the genus Psilocybe in 1995. The specific epithet aer≈´g«ên≈çsa is Latin for \\"covered in verdigris (copper-rust)\\". Description The cap is convex, broadening, and becoming umbonate with age. It is from 2‚Äì8 cm in diameter. At first it is a vivid blue/green, and very glutinous (slimy), with a sprinkling of white veil remnants around the edge. The colour in the gluten fades, or is washed off as it matures, and it becomes yellow ocher, sometimes in patches, but mostly at the centre. Finally, it will lose the blue-green coloration completely. The stem is quite long and of uniform thickness. It has a fragile brown/black ring, and below this the stem is covered in fine white scales, or flakes. The gills are initially white, then clay-brown, and sometimes have a white edge.

It particularly favours wood-chip mulches in gardens, and parks. Edibility and toxicity The verdigris agaric is reported as poisonous in many guidebooks printed in the Western Hemisphere, yet the effect of poisoning is little known and toxic constituents unknown. According to some European guidebooks the verdigris agaric is edible, but undesirable due to mildly spicy taste.STROPHARIA AERUGINOSA, –°–¢–†–û–§–ê–†–ò–Ø –°–ò–ù–ï-–ó–ï–õ–ï–ù–ê–Ø References External links * Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America Category:Strophariaceae ","title":"Stropharia aeruginosa"},{"id":"18247611","text":"Charles Thomas Osborne (24 November 1927 ‚Äì 23 September 2017) was an Australian journalist, theatre and opera critic, poet and novelist.Campbell, Ian. Obituary - Charles Osborne. Opera, November 2017, Vol.68 No.11, p4133. He was the assistant editor of The London Magazine from 1958 until 1966, literature director of the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1971 until 1986, and chief theatre critic of Daily Telegraph (London) from 1986 to 1991. He is the only author the Agatha Christie Estate has ever allowed to produce adapted works in her name. Life and career Osborne was born in Brisbane, Australia. He taught himself to play the piano and aged 18 he took singing lessons. Osborne's father hailed originally from Devon and his mother was from Vienna, a fact to which he attributes his lifelong love of opera. He went to school locally, then studied at the University of Queensland. Osborne then worked in literary and musical journalism and in repertory theatre in Australia and Britain, where he settled permanently in 1953. He played the role of Front Gunner Foxlee in the film The Dam Busters (1955), and acted in many plays across the UK including Black Coffee by Agatha Christie, which he later adapted as a novel. From 1958, he was assistant editor of The London Magazine, founded by John Lehmann, which publishes poems, short stories and literary reviews. Osborne himself wrote poetry from an early age. He published three collections of poetry, including Swansong in 1968. Between 1971 and 1986 he was literature director of the Arts Council of Great Britain. This involved dispensing government grants, and Osborne, perhaps inevitably, given the nature of the position, became embroiled in the so-called \\"poetry wars\\" that took place during the 1970s. Osborne gave an account of his tenure at the Arts Council in his autobiography Giving it Away: Memoirs of a Uncivil Servant. This sheds light on his influential role at the Arts Council, as does Peter Barry's 2006 book, Poetry Wars: British Poetry of the 1970s and the Battle of Earl's Court. Between 1986 and 1991, Osborne was chief drama critic for the Daily Telegraph. He continued to write journalism on a wide variety of arts, leading to Vogue magazine dubbing him an uomo universale (universal man). Osborne wrote about opera and published books on Verdi, Wagner, Mozart, Puccini, Richard Strauss and the bel canto operas. His book, The Complete Operas of Verdi, was the first on that composer by someone who had actually seen all the operas staged. It was translated into Italian and published by . The Opera Lover's Companion appeared in 2004. He also from early years in London wrote sleeve notes LP covers, and served on the editorial board of Opera magazine from 1970 to 1999. Osborne published an original novel, Pink Danube, in 2000 and adapted works for the stage as novels, which have been widely reprinted and translated into many languages. His novelised versions of Black Coffee (1998), The Unexpected Guest (1999) and Spider's Web (2000), all originally by Agatha Christie, have proved enduringly popular with readers. He has also adapted Blithe Spirit (2004), by No√´l Coward, and Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. Osborne held an honorary doctorate from Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, for services to the arts and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was a former president, and later council member, of the UK Critics Circle. In 2009, the Italian state conferred on him the honorific title of Commendatore dell'Ordine della Stella della solidariet√† italiana, known as the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity, for his outstanding contribution to the life and works of Verdi. In 2011, The King's Head Theatre, London, staged a successful world premiere of an Oscar Wilde play, Constance. The only play by Wilde previously unproduced, Constance was unearthed, translated and adapted by Osborne from the original French. Professor Joseph Bristow, a Wilde scholar based at UCLA wrote \\"Constance presents us with a startling Wildean drama in an arresting style. I left the King's Head Theater realizing that Wilde might have truly become the Irish Ibsen of his day.\\" He died on 23 September 2017.

The street is named after the Haller family, who were Bavarian origin principal nobles in the early modern Hungary. According to some reviews the street is named after J√°nos Haller (1626‚Äì1697), who was a prominent figure of the family. The 1.5-kilometre long Haller utca runs from Nagyv√°rad t√©r to the Danube, being flanked by the vast green expanses of Haller park and crossing Mester utca on its way. It is also famous for its planes and green hedges along the pavaments.

It was formed from the amalgamation of two regiments after World War I. They saw service from the Mutiny of 1857 up to and including World War II. Formation The 9th Royal Deccan Horse can trace its formation to 1790 when it was called Asif Sah's Irregular Cavalry. Two Regiments were raised for service under the Nizam of Hyderabad in Berar who was allied with the East India Company. During the following years the Regiment's title would change and they were known by the following titles over the years; :1st Regiment, Nizam‚Äôs Cavalry :2nd Regiment, Nizam's Cavalry :1st Cavalry, Hyderabad Contingent :2nd Cavalry, Hyderabad Contingent :1st Lancers, Hyderabad Contingent :2nd Lancers, Hyderabad Contingent. The Deccan Horse was frequently called for service during the 18th and 19th Centuries, winning a Victoria Cross (VC) in 1859 and was also awarded the battle honour, ‚ÄòCentral India‚Äô. The Regiment was also in action during the Second Afghan War, the Burma War, and in China during the Boxer Rebellion. In 1903 during Kitcheners reform of the Indian Army the two Regiments were incorporated into the regular Indian Army with the titles XXth Deccan Horse and the 29th Lancers (Deccan Horse). Deccan Horse, Bazentin Ridge 1916 World War I The 20th Deccan Horse was sent to France for service on the Western Front they were part of the 9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade of the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division. This regiment also served in Palestine and Syria during the Battle of Megiddo forming part of the 14th Cavalry Brigade, 5th Cavalry Division. p. 667 The 29th Lancers were also sent to France they formed part of the 8th (Lucknow) Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Indian Cavalry Division. Both Regiments would at times serve as Infantry in the trenches before being withdrawn for service in Palestine. Amalgamation 9th Deccan Horse The XXth Deccan Horse was awarded the titled Royal for their distinguished service during World War I, and in 1922 following the amalgamation of the two regiments, the Royal Deccan Horse (9th Horse) was formed. World War II During the Second World War, the Regiment converted to tanks, and became part of the 255th Indian Tank Brigade The regiment took part in the re-conquest of Burma.

She was the last person in Poland and among the last people in Europe to be subjected to lynching on the grounds of sorcery and witchcraft.  Background  Krystyna Ceynowa was the widow of a fisherman, living at Ceynowa on the Hel Peninsula, in the Province of Prussia. She was regarded as suspicious by the community for various reasons, including the fact that she never went to church, and it was said that black crows were attracted to her chimney .This gave her a bad reputation in the eyes of the congregation and people suspected that she was a witch. However, the authorities at that time were not willing to conduct a witch trial, which at that time were illegal.  The murder  One day in 1836, she was taken captive by a lynch mob determined to test her to see if she was a witch. Her suppressors were called from Zoppot, and she was subjected to the ordeal of water during an illegal trial. The ordeal took place in the Baltic Sea - she was transported in a boat and thrown overboard. To the disbelief of many, she remained afloat for a long time, which was taken as an evidence of witchcraft, whereas nobody thought that her gown and skirt had acted as a buoy.

Queer Visitors appeared in the North American, the Chicago Record-Herald and other newspapers from 28 August 1904 to 26 February 1905.Michael O'Neal Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, Kansas, University Press of Kansas, 1997; p. 108. The series chronicles the misadventures of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Woggle-Bug, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Sawhorse, as the Gump flies them to various cities in the United States.L. Frank Baum, The Marvelous Land of Oz, Introduction by Martin Gardner; New York, Dover Publications, 1969; Introduction, p. viii. The comic strip in turn produced its own derivation, The Woggle-Bug Book (1905). Development The project was designed to promote The Marvelous Land of Oz.Michael Patrick Hearn, \\"Queer Visitors Revisited,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol. 38 No. 3 (Winter 1994), pp. 4‚Äì10. Coincidentally, it ran at the same time as a comic strip featuring Oz characters that was written and drawn by W. W. Denslow. Denslow drew the illustrations for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and shared in its copyright. After Baum and Denslow had a falling out, Denslow exercised his copyright through his strip, called Denslow's Scarecrow and Tin-Man, which ran in relatively few newspapers from December 1904 to March 1905--an artistic and commercial failure.David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; pp. 15, 20‚Äì2. Re-publication The Visitors from Oz, published by Reilly and Lee in 1960, includes about half of Baum's Visitors stories rewritten and illustrated by Dick Martin. The 27 Queer Visitors stories have been republished in book form as The Third Book of Oz (1989) from Buckethead Enterprises, which was censored. The Buckethead Edition was a reprint under a new cover of an earlier edition, and Dulabone was not aware at the time that it was censored. The Third Book of Oz also includes another early promotion project, \\"The Woggle-Bug Book\\" (written by Baum and illustrated by Ike Morgan); the volume is illustrated by Eric Shanower. Hungry Tiger Press corrected the censoring from the Buckethead edition but used The Visitors from Oz as the title, like the 1960 adaptation. In June, 2009, Sunday Press Books released a collected edition of the newspaper strips in their original format and coloring. The book also included W. W. Denslow's competing strip Denslow's Scarecrow And Tin-Man as well as other comic strips by Walt McDougall, W. W. Denslow, and John R.

The ANPE was created on 13 July 1967. In December 2008, the ANPE merged with the Assedic benefits agency to create a comprehensive employment agency called P√¥le emploi, based on those of Germany and the UK. Activity The National Employment Agency (ANPE)'s main task was to encourage meetings between supply and demand, to help jobseekers find new jobs and help employers hire. With more than 3.7 million job entrusted by companies in 2007 and more than 3.3 million successful hiring, the ANPE was a central player in the labour market. It was open to all job seekers, whatever their situation, compensated or not. In 2007, 19 million maintenance consultants had been made. The main tasks were helping the unemployed back into work, supporting companies in their recruitment requirement, fighting against discrimination. To assist job seekers in their search, the agency offered services. Starting on 1 January 2006, ANPE offered all job seekers monthly monitoring with a personal adviser referral until their return to employment. To facilitate recruitment, the ANPE had a partnership with 568,000 companies to promote the adequacy between supply and demand, including developing the skills of job seekers by training. The ANPE administrations employed 28,459 people in France in 2007. The ANPE claimed 15 million visits per month on its website, anpe.fr. It had more than 1,300 settlements across France, with 22 regional units to define priority action plans in each region. The central administration gave the direction, planning implementation and assessing results. Recent evolution In 1996 the registration of jobseekers was transferred to the Assedic to simplify the process. In 1997, the official website was launched; it is now the first European website for jobs. From 2002, it has been possible for job seekers to demand jobs directly on the website. From 2003, it has published anonymous CVs profiles on the website. In 1998 the Observatoire de l'ANPE was created to publish studies. In 2004 a National Plan against the recruitment difficulties was launched, and in 2005 an Emergency Plan for Employment was implemented. From 2006, a monthly personalized with a counselor referent has been implemented. In 2008, a new public agency was created, resulting from the merging of the ANPE with the Un√©dic administration.

There is a traffic control system in the direction of Deggendorf until right before the exit to the airport. The A 92 essentially follows the lower Isar so that it passes Freising, Moosburg, Landshut, Dingolfing, Landau, Plattling and Deggendorf. Currently it is the most important connection between Munich and the East Central European countries like Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. After completion of A 94 (Munich‚ÄìPassau) a part of the traffic load for eastern Europe will shift towards that Autobahn. The stretch of the A 92 between Landshut and Plattling has a very low traffic density. This is also the reason that the A 92 is used in part as a test stretch by the BMW factory in Dingolfing. One notes that among other things the road surface is better in the vicinity of Dingolfing. History The first conception of building of an Autobahn along the Isar was at the end of the 1960s. It started with the extension of Bundesstra√üe 11, and with the building of a bypass for Wallersdorf. Until 1970, a small piece of length of the autobahn was completed already around Wallersdorf, it was named 5-Minuten-Autobahn. The last section between Dingolfing and Wallersdorf, long, was completed in 1988.

The symphony is dedicated to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and was first performed in St. Petersburg in December 1890 under the baton of Anatoly Lyadov. The symphony is considered a transitional work, with Glazunov largely eschewing the influences of Balakirev, Borodin, and Rimsky-Korsakov inherent in his earlier symphonies for the newer influences of Tchaikovsky and Wagner. Because of this change, the Third has been called the \\"anti-kuchkist\\" symphony in Glazunov's output (kuchkist from kuchka, the shortened Russian name for the nationalist music group The Five).Taruskin, 39. He would tone down these new influences in his subsequent symphonies as he strove for an eclectic mature style. The Third also shows a greater depth of expression, most evident in the chromatic turns of its third movement, reminiscent of Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde. Instrumentation Woodwinds :3 flutes (1 taking piccolo) :2 oboes :2 clarinets :2 bassoons Brass :4 horns :3 trumpets :3 trombones :tuba Percussion :timpani :percussion Strings :violins :violas :violoncellos :double basses Structure Four movements make up the work: # Allegro # Scherzo. Vivace. (6/16 and 2/8 mixed time signatures, in F major) # Andante. (C-sharp minor) # Finale. Allegro moderato. Overview Although the earliest sketches of this work date to 1883, the symphony was an example of Glazunov's effort to break away in a larger form from the nationalist style that animated the compositions of The Mighty Handful (then the most important musical influence in Russia) to reflect what Glazunov felt to be universal forms, moods and themes. He had already explored this desire in smaller works such as the Poem lyrique for orchestra (1881-7), a piece much admired by Tchaikovsky, as well as in the elegy To the Memory of a Hero (Pamyati geroya) (1881-5). The Symphony No. 3, however, was Glazunov's largest orchestral work to aspire to an artistic mould beyond that espoused by the Five. Tchaikovsky's influence is clear, especially in the work's lyrical episodes.Lobanova, 6. In 1924, when Glazunov shared his reminiscences of Tchaikovsky, he said, \\"He also knew my Third Symphony, which is dedicated to him. Much in it found his approval and, at his request, I often played the scherzo of the symphony to him on the piano. When I asked him what he would regard as the most significant weakness in my works, he said: 'Some longevities and the lack of pauses.' Later, when Pyotr Ilyich had long departed this world, I always remembered his words, and in my subsequent production I always took pains to pay heed to them.\\"As quoted by Lobanova, 7.

G. Farthing (born 1948) is a British physician, medical researcher and academic administrator. He was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex (2007‚Äì2016), having succeeded Professor Alasdair Smith in September 2007. Prior to his appointment as Vice-Chancellor at Sussex, his academic career was in Medicine, specialising in Gastroenterology. In 2019, Farthing was elected Master of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. Vice- chancellor On becoming Vice-Chancellor at Sussex, Michael Farthing has led the creation of a new strategic plan for the University, Making the future, which sets out an ambitious growth agenda for Sussex, planning to grow its research income, double international student numbers and increase engagement with the business community. The plan also puts significant investment into the campus itself, with new academic buildings and residences on campus to support academic growth and to respond to student demand. In July 2012 Michael Farthing demonstrated his medical expertise gained and closed the university‚Äôs Centre for Community Engagement (CCE), leading to a number of redundancies. CCE had played an important role offering lifelong learning and part-time degrees and short courses for those in employment and otherwise unable to attend university. The term Making the future draws from a phrase used by the first Vice-Chancellor, Lord Fulton, which said that higher education at Sussex was concerned with making the future. Michael Farthing has also led a move to greater international activity by the University, personally leading the creation of partnerships with institutions in China. This internationalisation has led to the appointment of a member of the executive specifically to lead this area of University work for the future. Under his leadership the University has also been restructured to create 13 schools of studies (beginning in August 2009), including the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, dramatically altering the scope for interdisciplinary communication and collaboration for which Sussex has been known. These new schools are headed by leading academics appointed from within the University and from institutions elsewhere. A regular column in the University's Bulletin used to set out his vision for the development of the University. He also used to hold termly meetings with staff, podcasts of which are available. When in office, Farthing disbanded the renowned Linguistics Department ‚Äî a move condemned by Noam Chomsky as \\"a serious blow to the intellectual life of the university\\" ‚Äî and cut funding to many others. Whilst he is credited with having improved the University's finances, his large-scale culling of academic and other staff initiated in November 2009 was unpopular, and provoked strike action by the UCU lecturers union and widespread civil disobedience by students on the campus. In addition to the wide criticism by faculty and students alike of Farthing's proposals, there have also been a number of protests and occupations taking place at the University. Farthing announced his intention to resign the post of Vice-Chancellor in September 2015 and will replaced by Professor Adam Tickell from September 2016. Controversy over protest In early 2013 the level of student protest at Sussex over privatisation resulted in Farthing publicly considering the defunding or underfunding of the Student Union and in December he took action to suspend five students associated with recent occupations of administration buildings and restrict them from returning to campus. An early day motion calling on Professor Farthing to retract the suspensions was signed by 13 Members of Parliament. The students were eventually reinstated, and the University of Sussex was forced to publish a public apology by the OIA Ombudsman and pay them compensation. One of the suspended students sued the University for defamation and a Court ruled against the University, awarding ¬£20,000 to the student. Career in Medicine Prior to his appointment as Vice-Chancellor of Sussex University Professor Farthing's career was in medicine, and he continues to hold a number of relevant posts. He graduated from University College, London (UCL) and the University College Hospital Medical School in 1972 and held posts in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew's Hospital (\\"Barts\\"), London, specialising in Gastroenterology. In the early 1980s Farthing was a Wellcome Tropical Lecturer and held overseas posts as visiting lecturer and Assistant Professor in India, Boston and Costa Rica, before returning to Barts. In 1990 he was appointed Professor of Gastroenterology at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College and held this post for five years. During this period (from 1993‚Äì97) he was also a member of the Clinical Interest Group for the Wellcome Trust. From 1995 to 1997 he was Dean of the Faculty of Clinical Medicine at Bart's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry. During this time (1995-2000) he held the post of Professor of Gastroenterology at Bart's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry and Trustee and Director at the Barts Foundation for Research from 1996-2000. During this period he also oversaw the postdoctoral work of Rebecca Fitzgerald. In 2000 he moved to Glasgow and became Executive Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Professor of Medicine at the University of Glasgow. Following this, he was Honorary Consultant Gastroenterologist for the St George's Healthcare NHS Trust from 2003-7. He concurrently held the positions of Principal, [St George's, University of London] from 2003-7, and Pro-Vice Chancellor for Medicine University of London from 2005-7.

She was the mother of French politician Claude de Beauharnais. She was the grandmother of St√©phanie de Beauharnais, Grand Duchess of Baden, and through her she is the ancestor of former royal families of Romania and Yugoslavia, and the present royal families of Belgium, of Luxembourg and of Monaco. Life The daughter of the receiver-general of finances in Champagne, whilst very young she married comte Claude de Beauharnais, uncle of Alexandre de Beauharnais and of Fran√ßois de Beauharnais. She was godmother to Hortense de Beauharnais, Alexandre's daughter by Marie Jos√®phe Rose de Tascher de la Pagerie, better known to history as Josephine. She wrote poetry from her childhood onwards and, after separating from her husband, devoted herself to literature, became friends with literary figures such as Claude Joseph Dorat and Michel de Cubi√®res-Palm√©zeaux. Her salon became a choice social venue, and she became a member of the Acad√©mie des Arcades. In 1787 she wrote and put on a five-act prose comedy entitled la Fausse inconstance, though it was not a success. In 1790 she was received into the Acad√©mie de Lyon.

Palante advocated aristocratic individualist ideas similar to Friedrich Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer.\\"Palante's influences\\" . He was opposed to √âmile Durkheim's holism, promoting methodological individualism instead.  Life  Palante's house in Hillion Palante was born in Saint-Laurent-Blangy in the Pas-de-Calais on 20 November 1862. His father Emile Palante was an accountant from Li√®ge. Palante's older brother Emile died when he was only five years old. He studied successively at the college of Arras where he excelled in Latin, then at Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand where he earned his bachelor's degree. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Douai. In 1885, he began his career as professor of philosophy at Aurillac, where he met his future wife Louise Genty, whom he married three years later. The couple had a daughter named Germaine in 1890. Between 1886 and 1888, he studied in Ch√¢teauroux. In 1888, he received his agr√©gation in philosophy. Palante separated from his first wife in 1890 and was appointed to teach at the Lyc√©e de Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, then in the following years at Valenciennes, La Rochelle and Niort. In 1893, he translated a work by Theobald Ziegler and began to publish articles. He returned in 1898 to the Lyc√©e de Saint-Brieuc, at which he worked for the remainder of his teaching career. Meanwhile, he continued to work on his philosophical ideas, publishing articles and essays in journals. Palante published collections of his articles in various books, notably Combat pour l'individu (Fight for the Individual) in 1904 and La Sensibilit√© individualiste (The Individualist Sensibility) in 1909. In 1907, Palante completed a draft doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne, but it was never authorized. However, he published the draft under the title Antinomies entre l'individu et la soci√©t√© (Antinomies Between the Individual and Society) in 1912, expanding it two years later under the title Pessimisme et individualisme (Pessimism and Individualism). In 1908, Palante stood in municipal elections as a socialist candidate, but he was not elected. He took over from Jules de Gaultier at the philosophy journal Mercure de France, holding the position for thirteen years. In 1916, he befriended the writer Louis Guilloux. During this period, Palante lived a bohemian lifestyle, drinking heavily and notoriously marking his students' essays in a local brothel.Michel Onfray (1989). Physiologie de George Palante. Le Livre de Poche. He married his second wife Louise Pierre in 1923 and retired from teaching a year later. On 5 August 1925, Palante died from a self-inflicted bullet wound to the head. The reasons for Palante's suicide are not certain, but he is known to have been suffering from acromegaly, a condition diagnosed when he was a student. A severe degenerative disease which had no cure at time, it was making his life more and more painful.  Philosophy  A thoroughgoing Individualist, he admired Friedrich Nietzsche and showed early interest in the work of Sigmund Freud.In 1916, he wrote: \\"Freud a raison de reconna√Ætre l'importance √©norme de la sexualit√© dans l'√©volution psychologique de l'individu\\", cited by Yannick Pelletier in the preface of L'individu en d√©tresse. His thinking is also critical towards the mass \\"herd instinct\\", which he thought oppresses and prevents individuals from developing fully.\\"√Ä aucun moment, je ne \\"condamne\\" la socialisation de l'individu. Je la constate : voil√† tout. Je constate d'une part une tendance de la soci√©t√© √† socialiser l'individu, √† l'assimiler le plus possible, et d'autre part une tendance de l'individu √† la r√©sistance, √† la diff√©renciation ; - et par suite un conflit n√©cessaire entre ces deux tendances\\". Palante, Mercure de France, 16 December 1912. However, he did not oppose social networks and insisted that his philosophy did not seek to destroy society for the benefit of the individual, but to help to build new networks of social interaction. In sociology, he objected to the holistic model espoused by √âmile Durkheim.  Political ideology  Initially close to socialist theories, while critical of Marxist state socialism, he increasingly rejected it as a political ideal, although he did participate in 1908 municipal elections as a socialist candidate.\\"Dans la donn√©e marxiste le socialisme d'√âtat est un r√©gime aussi odieux que le r√©gime actuel. Il ne faut pas l'appeler socialisme d'√âtat, mais capitalisme d'√âtat (Liebknecht), attendu qu'il veut concentrer tout le capital entre les mains de l'√âtat pour perp√©tuer l'√©crasement d'une classe par l'autre et pour \\" imposer √† la d√©mocratie le double joug de l'exploitation √©conomique et de l'esclavage politique. \\" (Proposition Liebknecht).\\" Preface to La Question sociale est une question morale by Theoblad Ziegler, translated by Palante. He rejected the label anarchist, but his ideas are nevertheless often regarded as a form of anarchism or at least as libertarianism. His ideas have some commonality with classical liberalism, including his definition of the individual and his opposition to various barriers to trade. However, he opposed it in so far as in his view individual being is not determined by rational choice since social determinism is constantly at work. In the economic field, he also objected to capitalists seeking profits to the detriment of the poor and called for a \\"politics of the belly\\".  Influence  Louis Guilloux wrote Souvenirs sur Georges Palante (Memories of Georges Palante) and took his inspiration from Palante to model his character Cripure (short for Critique de la raison pure; in English, Critique of pure reason) in his novel Le Sang noir (Dark Blood). He also puts Palante's ideas into the mouths of characters in other novels. Palante is quoted in one of the footnotes to Albert Camus' classic treatise The Rebel. Jean Grenier, who was Camus' philosophy teacher, met Palante and devoted a full chapter to him in his book Les Gr√®ves (The Seashores). Michel Onfray's thesis and first published book Physiologie de Georges Palante (Georges Palante's Physiology) contributed to the renewed interest in his work. The 2002 and 2005 reissues of the book were subtitled portrait d‚Äôun nietzsch√©en de gauche (Portrait of a Left-wing Nietzschean).

He was tried for war crimes at a courts-martial for the murder of a British prisoner of war. He was found guilty. He was one of the few Italian commissioned officers prosecuted for war crimes during World War II, and the only one to be executed by a British-controlled court. Career =Military service= Bellomo was a career officer in the Italian Army from the regular class of the Italian Military Academy of Modena. At the outbreak of World War I, he held the rank of Artillery Captain and during that war he was awarded the Italian Military Order for gallantry in action. He gave up active duty in 1936, but was reactivated in 1941, when he was assigned as commander of the XII MVSN Zone, and Bari province. =Shooting of prisoners= On 30 November 1941 two British prisoners of war, Captain George Playne of the Royal Armoured Corps and Lieutenant Roy Cooke escaped from Torre Tresca POW detention camp but were recaptured a few hours later. According to the results of the Italian Army investigation board, Bellomo was already waiting for them when they arrived back at the camp. He wanted to personally investigate the course of events leading to their escape, and asked the two British officers to show him the location from which they had launched their plan. Again, the two British prisoners took their chances to escape, although this time Italian sentries opened fire, killing Captain PlayneCWGC entry and wounding Lieutenant Cooke. The investigation into the incident revealed no misconduct on Bellomo's part. =1943 armistice= On 9 September 1943, a day after the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, Bellomo formed a makeshift Italian force to counterattack German forces that tried to occupy the port of Bari. Bellomo was wounded, but the action was successful; the Italians forced the Germans to retreat, leaving the port facilities intact. This allowed the safe and undisturbed landing of British troops on 22 September 1943 under Italian Army protection. A British force quickly moved north to Foggia, which they took on 27 September. By the end of the month, the entire Apulia region and most of southern Italy had been secured by Allied forces. Winston Churchill said, \\"September was a handful month for allied armies.\\" In the meantime, Bellomo kept his position as commander of the XII MVSN Zone in Bari. Shortly afterward, he was detained and arrested by the British military authority and charged with murder and attempted murder for his actions in the shooting of the two British POWs. War crimes trial On 28 January 1944 Bellomo was placed under arrest by the British Military Police and charged with \\"shooting or ordering to shoot two British officers, causing the death of one of them and the wounding of the other one.\\" Lieutenant Cooke, the surviving prisoner, filed a report against Bellomo on 5 June 1945. In the following weeks, Bellomo was moved around several Allied POW camps, namely in Grumo Appula, Padula and Afragola. On 14 July 1945 Bellomo received formal communication of his trial. The court martial took place on 28 July 1945 and within an hour he was sentenced to death. Bellomo, who refused to ask for pardon, was executed by a firing squad on the Island of Nisida north of Naples on 11 September 1945. At that time, the island was occupied by the British Army and used as a prison facility. His execution has been the cause of some controversy in Italy; some have claimed that Bellomo's court martial operated on insufficient evidence and contradictory statements, and therefore the sentence and the execution were unfair. Others believe that the British Court was influenced by \\"many Bellomo's Italian foes, e.g.: the Italian Army that almost everywhere collapsed, instead Bellomo successfully defended the Bari Harbour attacked by the German Forces, the Italian AntiFascist front marginalized by a general too close with the Crown and of course the nostalgics of fascism. At least these forces total isolated the general during the trial.\\" Italian award In 1951, the new Italian Government posthumously awarded Bellomo the Italian Silver Medal for his role in the defense of the seaport of Bari.

Ling was best known for his tenure as chief of the General Office of the Communist Party of China between 2007 and 2012. Ling was charged with corruption and sentenced to life imprisonment as part of a larger campaign carried out by Xi Jinping. Ling began his career as a functionary in regional branches of the Communist Youth League in his native Shanxi Province. His Youth League involvement propelled him to the national-level organization in 1979. At the Youth League Ling worked in its propaganda department and edited its flagship newspaper. Closely following the footsteps of his patron Hu Jintao, Ling was promoted to a leadership position in the General Office of the Communist Party of China in 1999, and became an important member of the State Commission for Public Sector Reform. Ling rose to become the Director of the General Office, an organ that handles day-to-day logistics and bureaucratic functions of the Communist Party, in 2007, when Hu was the party's General Secretary (i.e., paramount leader). He was initially seen as a promising candidate for promotion to the top leadership at the 18th Party Congress in 2012. However, his political fortunes abruptly took a turn when his 23-year-old son was killed while driving a Ferrari in 2012, an event that caused embarrassment for the party elite. Ling was then politically sidelined. In December 2014, Ling was placed under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (party's anti-graft agency) and removed from office. He was expelled from the Communist Party and tried on charges of corruption, illegal possession of state secrets, and abuse of power, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in July 2016.  Career  =Early career= Born Linghu Jihua, Ling was the third son to Linghu Ye (‰ª§ÁãêÈáé), a party official, in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province. He and all four of his siblings received names related to the Communist Party's policies. His own name, Jihua, means \\"planning\\". In December 1973, as with many other young Chinese, he was sent to work in the countryside as part of the Down to the Countryside Movement. Ling worked in a printing factory. \\"Linghu\\" is a very rare surname, eventually most members of the Ling family shortened the \\"Linghu\\" to \\"Ling\\". In June 1975, Ling was admitted into the Communist Youth League (CYL) organization in Pinglu County, and was soon elevated to deputy secretary of the local CYL committee. He joined the Communist Party of China in June 1976. In December 1978, Ling was transferred to Communist Party's Yuncheng Committee in Shanxi. In 1979, Communist Youth League's central organization selected young cadres nationwide to work in the capital. Ling, at the age of 23, was recruited to work in the propaganda department of CYL Central Committee. =Rising through the ranks in Beijing= From August 1983, Ling studied at the Communist Youth League Academy (later China Youth University of Political Studies), majoring in political education. In July 1985, Ling worked in the political theory section of the propaganda department of the Communist Youth League. At that time, Hu Jintao was the First Secretary (i.e., leader), of the Youth League, though it is not clear whether there was direct contact between Ling and Hu. From June 1988, Ling served in various posts in CYL, mostly as part of the CYL Secretariat and the CYL General Office. He also served as editor-in-chief of Chinese Communist Youth League, the primary theory publication of the CYL, and between 1994 and 1995, and the CYL's chief of propaganda. In December 1995, after serving in CYL for over ten years, Ling was transferred to General Office of the Communist Party of China, and continued his work in political theory. Between 1994 and 1996 Ling obtained an \\"on-job master's degree\\" in commercial management at Hunan University. In June 1998, he was promoted to head of research office of the General Office (‰∏≠Â§ÆÂäûÂÖ¨ÂéÖË∞ÉÁ†îÂÆ§‰∏ª‰ªª). In December 1999, Ling was appointed as deputy director of General Office. Later, he also served as the deputy chief of the General Office in charge of the Central Institutional Organization Commission, and chief of staff of the Office of General Secretary Hu Jintao. On September 19, 2007 Ling was promoted to become Director of General Office of the Communist Party of China, the nerve center of the party that was in charge of all manner of administrative activities of the party's central authorities, including communications and leaders' scheduling and agendas. He also became a Secretary of the Central Secretariat, in charge of the implementation of tasks set forth by the party's Politburo. =Son's Ferrari crash= Throughout Hu Jintao's leadership, Ling accompanied Hu on trips abroad and was often seen with Hu on inspection visits around the country. As one of Hu Jintao's closest associates and most trusted advisors, in addition to being of an appropriate level of seniority, Ling seemed long destined for higher office. Ling's political fortunes, however, took an abrupt turn in 2012. On March 18, Ling's only son, then 23-Year old Ling Gu, was involved and killed in a car crash on Beijing's 4th Ring Road while driving a black Ferrari 458 Spider accompanied by two women, reportedly of minority ethnic background, who survived. Ling Gu was said to have been found naked, and the women were described as either naked or otherwise \\"scantily clad,\\" which seemed to suggest sexual activity while driving. While this account was later disputed, the widely discussed \\"Ferrari crash\\" was juicy tabloid fodder and exacerbated public cynicism over the debauchery and conspicuous consumption often associated with children of the Communist ruling elite. News of the crash was reported in mainland Chinese media shortly after it happened, but the story was then rapidly suppressed. Reportedly, Ling Jihua, after viewing the body of the driver at the morgue, denied it was his son. Ling was also said to have mobilized staff from the Central Security Bureau, an organ in charge of national leaders' security which reported into the General Office, to cover up the crash. Chinese media also reported that Ling had contacted Zhou Yongkang, then chief of the powerful Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, to reach unspecified \\"political deals\\" in exchange for assistance on covering up the death of his son. Ling then went on to work as normal. In China, Internet search terms such as \\"Ferrari\\", \\"Little Ling\\" and \\"Prince Ling\\" were blocked. In November 2012, an 'exclusive' from the South China Morning Post reported that Jiang Jiemin, a former associate of Zhou Yongkang then serving as chief executive of China National Petroleum Corporation, wired money from the company's accounts to the families of the two women involved in the crash to keep silent about the crash. Despite media censorship regarding the event, news of the crash was widely circulated in China. The incident was also later reported on major international media, including the Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Online Chinese-language communities also questioned how Ling Gu could afford a car worth some $500,000 when his parents had government jobs. The crash and subsequent suppression was said to have led to Ling Jihua's demotion in August 2012, and his wife Gu Liping's removal from her job in January 2013. =Demotion and investigation= On September 1, 2012, prior to the transfer of power between Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping at the pivotal 18th Party Congress, Ling was abruptly transferred from his position as General Office chief to become head of the United Front Work Department, an organ considered to be of less importance. This was seen as a demotion for Ling. At the 18th Party Congress held in the fall of 2012, Ling did not gain a seat on the Politburo as expected, nor did he retain his position as Secretary of the Secretariat; this signalled that Ling was excluded from all the major power organs of the party. In March 2013, Ling was elected as one of the Vice-Chairmen of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), barely holding onto his status as a \\"national leader\\". In addition, of the 23 candidates standing for confirmation for the CPPCC Vice-Chairmanship, Ling received, by far, the fewest votes in favour. A total of 90 CPPCC delegates voted against Ling, while 22 delegates abstained. The candidate with the second most votes in opposition was Chen Yuan, who received 27 votes against. In the latter half of 2014, members of the Ling family were successively detained by the authorities (see \\"Family\\" section below). Moreover, an unprecedented number of high-ranking officials in Ling's native Shanxi province were investigated for corruption and removed from office. Rumours circulated about Ling's own fate. Ling was officially placed under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (party's anti-graft agency) on December 22, 2014, and dismissed from his position as United Front Work Department head about a week later. The CPPCC then removed him from the office of Vice-Chairman in February 2015, in addition to stripping him of his ordinary CPPCC delegate status. Several weeks prior to the announcement of the investigation, Ling continued to make appearances on state television in his positions of CPPCC Vice Chairman and United Front chief. On December 15 Ling had penned an article on the Communist theory publication Qiushi brimming with praise for the signature political philosophies of Xi Jinping such as the \\"Chinese Dream\\". This was seen by observers as a 'last-ditch' declaration of fealty to the new Chinese leader with whom Ling was thought to have lost favour. Ling was one of the highest- profile targets (next to Zhou Yongkang and Xu Caihou) of the anti-corruption campaign following the 18th Party Congress spearheaded by Party General secretary Xi Jinping and central discipline chief Wang Qishan. He was the second sitting \\"national leader\\"-level figure to be investigated by the party's anti-graft agency, after CPPCC Vice-Chairman Su Rong. Chinese-language media have linked Ling to a mysterious political network composed of prominent politicians and businesspeople with origins in Shanxi called the Xishan Society. =Detention and trial= On July 20, 2015, Ling was expelled from the Communist Party of China, and was arrested to face criminal proceedings. Ling's case received significant media attention, since he was the most prominent political figure expelled from the party since criminal proceedings were initiated against former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang. In the party's disciplinary dossier against Ling, he was accused of \\"violating political discipline, violating political rules, violating organizational discipline, and violating confidentiality discipline.\\" He was further accused of taking in large bribes, aiding in the business interests of his wife, sexual misconduct with \\"numerous women\\", and illegally obtaining party and state secrets. On May 13, 2016, the No. 1 branch of Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate filed suit against Ling on behalf of the state at the No. 1 Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin. On July 4, 2016, after a closed-door trial, Ling was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was convicted on charges of taking bribes, illegally obtaining state secrets and abuse of power. Upon hearing his sentence, Ling read aloud from a prepared script stating that he did not contest the conviction and \\"thanked\\" the court and the lawyers for their work, and used a Chinese idiom (kegu mingxi) to describe how unforgettable the trial had been to him. The sentencing revealed many details which were previously unknown. The conviction stated that Ling had sought to use his influence to advance the interests of senior regional officials Li Chuncheng, Pan Yiyang, and Bai Enpei; all three had fallen under the axe of the anti-corruption campaign though their links to Ling were unclear hitherto the conviction. It also stated that his wife, Gu Liping, and his son, Ling Gu, had taken some bribes on behalf of the Ling family. Ling Gu was said to have solicited bribes worth some 6.5 million yuan (~$1 million) from Wei Xin, a senior executive of Founder Group. Ling and his wife, Gu Liping, additionally were said to have received some 15 million yuan (~$2.3 million) from Guangsha Group, in exchange for political favours from Ling. Following his departure from the General Office, it was said that Ling gained access to privileged state secrets through his former subordinate Huo Ke, who was also indicted and tried. Ling was an alternate member of 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a full member of 17th and 18th Central Committees, and a member of the 17th Central Secretariat. Ling was expelled from the 18th Central Committee at the Fifth Plenary Session in October 2015. Family Ling is married to Gu Liping (Ë∞∑‰∏ΩËêç), the former director-general of Youth Business China a non-profit program that aims to promote youth entrepreneurship that is headquartered in Beijing. In 2010 she was deputy director of the Ying Public Interest Foundation, a charity sponsored by the Communist Youth League. In that role she reportedly solicited donations for the foundation. Gu was thought to be placed in custody prior to the initiation of the investigation on Ling Jihua. Ling and Gu had one son, Ling Gu (‰ª§Ë∞∑), born c. 1989, alias Wang Ziyun (ÁéãÂ≠ê‰∫ë), who majored in international relations at Peking University. Ling Gu died in March 2012 at the age of 23 in the aforementioned Ferrari crash. Ling had three brothers and one sister. His eldest brother, Ling Fangzhen (‰ª§ÊñπÈíà), was in the military, and died after a fall while cleaning windows in 1977. Ling's second eldest brother, Ling Zhengce, was a provincial-level politician in Shanxi Province. Zhengce was placed under investigation by the Communist Party's anti-graft agency in June 2014. His sister, Linghu Luxian (‰ª§ÁãêË∑ØÁ∫ø), was a hospital executive in the city of Yuncheng, and was married to the city's Vice-Mayor Wang Jiankang (ÁéãÂÅ•Â∫∑); the couple disappeared from public view for several months in 2014, suspected of being placed under investigation, but re-appeared later on. Ling's younger brother Ling Wancheng was a businessman and golf enthusiast, who was initially reported to be detained by the authorities, but later found to have fled to the United States.

V. Baliga FRCS (1904‚Äì1964) was a physician, an educationist and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Several institutes in India are named after him. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru the first Prime Minister of India said about Baliga: \\"...He was not only a Brilliant Surgeon but also a good man devoted to good causes, for which he subscribed liberally...His sudden death has deprived India of an outstanding surgeon, a man and a patriot of great merit and accomplishment...\\" Early childhood and education Baliga was born on 26 April 1904 in Kallianpur. His early education was in the Hindu Higher elementary school in Kallianpur. Since there was no high school in Kallianpur, he joined the Christian High School in Udupi. In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi gave a call to students to leave educational institutions run by the British Raj. Baliga left school, but was not readmitted. He joined the National School in Udupi which was affiliated to the Gujarat Vidyapith, a Nationalist institute. Baliga passed his matriculation from there. Since the matriculation was not recognized by the British authorities, he could not be admitted to the M.B.B.S course. He was forced to join the L.C.P.S course at the National Medical College, Bombay. Baliga also had to finance his education by giving private lessons. He finished his L.C.P.S course by standing first in the examinations; he caught the attention of G. V. Deshmukh of KEM Hospital who appointed him house surgeon and physician. His career Baliga went to the U.K. on a fellowship. He had to pass the London matriculation for his LRCP, MRCS and finally FRCS. He returned to India in 1933 and was appointed as an assistant honorary surgeon at the KEM Hospital, Bombay; he also started his private practice. From then on until 1964, he rapidly rose in stature as a surgeon both nationally and internationally. =Philanthropy= Baliga was instrumental in establishing the Kanara College of Arts and Sciences in Kumta (renamed as Dr. A. V. Baliga college, Kumta). He also helped establish the M. G. M. College in Udupi, the Kasturba Medical College, Manipal and the Orthopedic children‚Äôs hospital in Haji Ali, Bombay. He was a founding member of the Association of Surgeons of India and took part in the discussions at the annual conference of the association. =As an international figure= After independence, he was involved in the Goa liberation movement. He was also the chief architect of India's political relations with the former Soviet Union. After the 1962 debacle, he also went on an unofficial diplomatic mission to China. Being a true democrat, he always dreamt of a free, frank and fearless press. This dream became a reality with the publishing of the \\"PATRIOT\\", a daily, and \\"LINK\\", a magazine through which he could express independent social and political views.

Covering many genres including action, real-time strategy, and role-playing games, Spore allows a player to control the development of a species from its beginnings as a microscopic organism, through development as an intelligent and social creature, to interstellar exploration as a spacefaring culture. It has drawn wide attention for its massive scope, and its use of open-ended gameplay and procedural generation. Throughout each stage, players are able to use various creators to produce content for their games. These are then automatically uploaded to the online Sporepedia and are accessible by other players for download. Spore was released after several delays to generally favorable reviews. Praise was given for the fact that the game allowed players to create customized creatures, vehicles and buildings. However, Spore was criticized for its gameplay which was seen as shallow by many reviewers; GameSpot remarked: \\"Individual gameplay elements are extremely simple\\". Controversy surrounded Spore due to the inclusion of SecuROM, and its digital rights management software, which can potentially open the user's computer to security risks. Gameplay Spore allows the player to develop a species from a microscopic organism to its evolution into a complex animal, its emergence as a social, intelligent being, to its mastery of the planet and then finally to its ascension into space, where it interacts with alien species across the galaxy. Throughout the game, the player's perspective and species change dramatically. The game is broken up into distinct \\"stages\\". The outcome of one phase affects the initial conditions and leveling facing the player in the next. Each phase exhibits its own style of play, and has been described by the developers as ten times more complicated than its preceding phase. Phases often feature optional missions; when the player completes a mission, they are granted a bonus, such as a new ability or money. If all of a player's creations are completely destroyed at some point, the species will be respawned at its nearest colony or at the beginning of the phase. Unlike many other Maxis games, Spore has a primary win condition, which is obtained by reaching a supermassive black hole placed at the center of the galaxy and receiving a \\"Staff of Life\\". However, the player may continue to play after any goal has been achieved. The first four phases of the game, if the player uses the editors only minimally, will take up to 15 hours to complete, but can take as little as one or two hours. Note that there is no time limit for any stage: the player may stay in a single stage as long as they wish, and progress to the next stage when ready. At the end of each phase, the player's actions cause their creature to be assigned a characteristic, or consequence trait. Each phase has three consequence traits, usually based on how aggressively or peacefully the phase was played. Characteristics determine how the creature will start the next phase and give it abilities that can be used later in the game. =Stages= Spore is a game that is separated into stages, each stage presenting a different type of experience with different goals to achieve. The five stages are the Cell Stage, the Creature Stage, the Tribal Stage, the Civilization Stage, and the Space Stage. Once the primary objective is completed, the player has the option to advance to the next stage, or continue playing the current stage. Cell Stage A screenshot of a near-final prototype cell stage. The large creatures in the background are drawn into the foreground as the player's organism evolves. The Cell Stage (sometimes referred to as the tide pool, cellular, or microbial stage) is the very first stage in the game, and begins with a cinematic explanation of how the player's cell got onto the planet through the scientific concept of panspermia, with a meteor crashing into the ocean of a planet and breaking apart, revealing a single-celled organism. The player guides this simple microbe around in a 3D environment on a single 2D plane, reminiscent of Flow, where it must deal with fluid dynamics and predators, while eating meat chunks or plants. The player may choose whether the creature is a herbivore or a carnivore prior to starting the stage. The player can find \\"meteor bits\\" (apparently from the aforementioned panspermic meteor) or kill other cells to find parts that upgrade their creature by adding abilities such as electricity, poison or other parts. Once the microbe has found a part, the player can call a mate to enter the editor, in which they can modify the shape, abilities and appearance of the microbe by spending \\"DNA points\\" earned by eating meat chunks or plants in the stage. The cell's eating habits in the Cell Stage directly influence its diet in the Creature Stage, and only mouths appropriate to the diet (Herbivore, Carnivore, or Omnivore) established in the Cell Stage will become available in the Creature Stage. Once the creature grows a brain and the player decides to progress to the next stage, the creature editor appears, prompting the user to add legs before the shift to land. The Creature editor differs in that it gives the player the ability to make major changes to the creature's body shape and length, and place parts in three-dimensional space instead of a top- down view as in the Cell editor. Creature Stage In the Creature Stage, the player creates their own land creature intended to live on a single continent. If the player attempts to swim to another island, an unidentified monster eats the player, and the player is warned not to come again. The biosphere contains a variety of animal species which carnivorous and omnivorous creatures can hunt for food, and fruit-bearing plants intended for herbivores and omnivores. The player creature's Hunger becomes a measured stat as well as its Health in this stage; depletion of the Hunger meter results in Health depletion and eventual death of the player creature unless food is eaten. In the Creature Stage, the player has a home nest where members of their own species are located. The nest is where the player respawns following death, and acts as a recovery point for lost HP. Other species' nests are spread throughout the continent. While interacting with them, the player can choose to be social or aggressive; how the player interacts with other creatures will affect their opinion of the player's species. For instance, by mimicking their social behaviors (singing, dancing etc.), NPC creatures will eventually consider the player an ally, but if the player harms members of their species, they will flee or become aggressive upon sighting them. The player can heal in allied nests and add allied creatures to their packs. Epic creatures, which are rare, aggressive creatures more than twenty times the player's height, feature prominently in the Creature Stage. The player cannot use social interactions with an Epic creature. There are also Rogue creatures which may be befriended or attacked. Additionally, spaceships may appear in this stage and abduct a creature. Progress in the Creature Stage is determined by the player's decisions on whether to befriend or attack other species, and to which degree; these decisions will affect the abilities of the player's species in subsequent stages of the game. Successful socialization and hunting attempts will give DNA Points, which may be spent on many new body parts. The player will also be rewarded with multiple DNA points for allying with or completely extincting a species. Placing new parts in the Creature editor comes at the expense of DNA points; more expensive parts will further upgrade the player creature's abilities for either method of interaction, as well as secondary abilities such as flight, speed or boosted health. After the player is finished editing, a newly evolved generation of creatures will be present in the home nest as the player's creature hatches. As the player's creature befriends or hunts more creatures, its intelligence and size increases until it is able to form a tribe. Tribal Stage After the brain of the player's species evolves sufficiently, the species may enter the Tribal Stage. The species' design becomes permanent, and the player sheds control of an individual creature in favor of the entire tribe group, as the game focuses on the birth of division of labor for the species. The player is given a hut, a group of up to 12 fully evolved creatures,PC Gamer, January 2008, p42-p46 as well as two of six possible Consequence Abilities, unlocked depending on the species' behavior in the previous phases. This is only possible if the player played the previous stages; if the player started directly from the Galaxy Screen, they are locked. Gameplay during this stage is styled as an RTS. Rather than controlling one creature, the player now controls an entire tribe and can give them commands such as gathering food, attacking other tribes or simply moving to a certain location. The player may give the tribe tools such as weapons, musical instruments, and healing or food-gathering implements. Food now replaces \\"DNA points\\" as the player's currency, and can be spent on structures and additional tribe members, or used to appease other tribes of different species. Tribe members also gain the option to wear clothes, the editing of which replaces the Creature Editor in the 'Tribal Outfitter'. Combat can be made more effective with weapons like stone axes, spears, and torches. For socializing, a player can obtain musical instruments: wooden horns, maracas and didgeridoos. Miscellaneous tools can be used for fishing and gathering food and for healing tribe members. All tools, however, require a specialized tool shack, which costs food to build. Tribe members can also gather food, an essential concept. Food can be stolen by wild creatures or by other tribes in the form of raids. The diet choice that the player made in prior stages, whether herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore, determines what food the tribe can gather and eat. Animals can be hunted for meat, and fish or seaweed can be speared for food. Fruit is gathered from trees and bushes, and players can also domesticate animals for eggs, which all diet types can eat. Any foreign animals in the player's pack in the Creature Stage are automatically added to the tribe as farm animals. Epic creatures may threaten nests or tribes. Allied tribes will occasionally bring the player gifts of food. Players can steal food from other tribes (though it angers them), and dead tribes may be pillaged for their food. There are five other tribes that appear along with the player's tribe. For every tribe befriended or destroyed, a piece of a totem pole is built, which may increase the population limit of the player's tribe or grant access to new tools and clothes. When all five tribes are allied or conquered, the player may move forward to the Civilization Stage. Civilization Stage The Civilization Stage focuses on the player developing many cities of three types: Economic, Military and Religious. The events of Tribal Stage have left the player's tribe the dominant species of the planet, but the species itself has now fragmented into many separate nations. The player retains control of a single nation with one city. The goal in the civilization phase is to gain control of the entire planet, and it is left to the player to decide whether to conquer it using military force, diplomacy, or religious influence. Two new editors (the building and vehicle editors) are used to create city buildings and vehicles. The player can place three types of buildings (House, Factory, and Entertainment) around the City Hall (which can also be customized) and may build up to 3 types of vehicles (sea, land and air) at each city. These vehicles serve military, economic or religious purposes. The main unit of currency is \\"Sporebucks\\", which is used to purchase vehicles and buildings. To earn income, players can capture spice geysers and set up spice derricks at their locations, conduct trade, or build factories. In constructing vehicles and buildings, as with most real-time strategy games, there is a capacity limit; building houses will increase the cap, and constructing various buildings adjacent to one another will provide a productivity bonus or deficit. The presence of other nations requires the player to continue expanding their empire using military force, propaganda, or simply buying out cities. Players can choose their method of global domination depending on the types of cities they own. Military states grow solely by attacking other cities. Nations with a religious trait construct special missionary units that convert other cities via religious propaganda. Likewise, economic states communicate solely by trade and have no weapons (except for defensive Turrets). If the player's nation captures a city of a different type, they can choose to have the city retain its original type if they wish, or convert it to match the type it was captured with. Players of all three ideological paths can eventually use a superweapon, which requires a large number of cities and Sporebucks, but gives the player a significant advantage over rival nations. Aside from enemy nations, Epic creatures may threaten individual cities. Space Stage In the Space Stage, the player has access to a galactic map for interstellar travel. The Space Stage provides new goals and paths as the player's species begins to spread through the galaxy. The game adopts the principle of mediocrity, as there are numerous forms of life scattered throughout the galaxy. The player controls a single spaceship, built at the beginning of the Space Stage. The player can travel by clicking on other planets and moons and stars, though each jump costs energy. Later in the game, the player can purchase a wormhole key which enables them to travel through black holes, offering instant transportation to a sister black hole. There are around 500,000 planets in the game's galaxy orbiting around 100,000 stars (including Earth and its star, Sol). Players can visit and explore all rocky planets with all their lifeforms and geologic structure. These planets can also be terraformed and colonized. The colonization of new worlds makes the player's civilization more influential and increases its income. Players can make contact with other space-faring civilizations, or \\"empires\\", which sport many different personalities and worldviews, ranging from diplomatic and polite species willing to ally, to distrustful, fanatical empires more willing to wage war. Completing missions for an empire improves the player's relationship with them, as does trading and assisting in fending off attacks. When the player has become allied with an empire, they can ask certain favors of the empire. If the player becomes enemies with an empire, they will send a small fleet of ships to attack the player's ship as soon as they enter their territory. One of the main goals in the Space Stage is for the player to push their way toward a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center, which introduces the game's final antagonists, the Grox, a unique species of cybernetic aliens with a powerful empire of 2400 systems surrounding the core. Getting to the center of the galaxy and entering starts a cinematic in which the player is introduced to Steve. After the cinematic dialogue with Steve ends the player is shot out of the black hole, and gets rewarded with the Staff of Life. Another major goal in the game was to eradicate the Grox, which yielded an achievement. Removed stages Several other stages were mentioned at various points by the developers, including a Molecular Stage, an Aquatic Stage, a City Stage, and a Terraforming Stage. Ultimately, these were scrapped. ; Galactic Adventures If Galactic Adventures is installed, the player may be given missions which involve travelling to planets, beaming down and completing Maxis-created, planetside 'adventures'. With this expansion, the player can also outfit their Captain with weapons and accessories which assist in these adventures. The occupants of allied ships can also take part. =Editors/creators= Tribal phase clothing editor User-generated content is a major feature of Spore;‚ÄúUser-Generated Future For Gaming‚Äù Tayfun King, Click, BBC World News (May 19, 2006) there are eighteen different editors (some unique to a phase). All have the same general UI and controls for positioning, scaling and colouring parts, whether for the creation of a creature, or for a building or vehicle. The Creature editor, for example, allows the player to take what looks like a lump of clay with a spine and mould it into a creature. Once the torso is shaped, the player can add parts such as legs, arms, feet, hands, noses, eyes, and mouths. Many of these parts affect the creature's abilities (speed, strength, diet, etc.), while some parts are purely decorative. Once the creature is formed, it can be painted using a large number of textures, overlays, colours, and patterns, which are procedurally applied depending on the topology of the creature. The only required feature is the mouth. All other parts are optional; for example, creatures without legs will slither on the ground like a slug or an inchworm, and creatures without arms will be unable to pick up objects. Although there is not a formal planet editor, in the Space Stage, players can freely terraform all rocky planets in the galaxy, adding mountains, valleys, lakes, etc. Players can also change these planets' biological ecosystems. There are two new editors seen in the new expansion Spore Galactic Adventures: these include the captain editor (also called the captain outfitter) and the adventure creator, which enables terraforming and placing objects freely on adventure planets. Community Spore user community functionality includes a feature that is part of an agreement with YouTube granting players the ability to upload a YouTube video of their creatures' activity directly from within the game, and EA's creation of \\"The Spore YouTube Channel\\", which will showcase the most popular videos created this way. In addition, some user- created content will be highlighted by Maxis at the official Spore site, and earn badges of recognition. One of Spore's most social features is the Sporecast, an RSS feed that players can use to subscribe to the creations of any specific Spore player, allowing them to track their creations. There is a toggle which allows the player to restrict what downloadable content will be allowed; choices include: \\"no user generated content\\", \\"official Maxis- approved content\\", \\"downloadable friend content\\", and \\"all user-created content\\". Players can elect to ban content in-game, at any time, and Maxis monitors content for anything deemed inappropriate, issuing bans for infractions of content policy. =Spore API= Spore has also released an API (application programming interface) to allow developers to access data about player activity, the content they produce and their interactions with each other. The Spore API is a collection of RESTful public web services that return data in .XML format. In April 2009, the results of the Spore API Contest was concluded with winners building interactive visualizations, games, mobile applications and content navigation tools. The API also includes a Developers forum for people wishing to use all the creations people have made to create applications. =Interplay= The game is referred to as a \\"massively single-player online game\\" and \\"asynchronous sharing.\\"Spore FAQ, at official website. Simultaneous multiplayer gaming is not a feature of Spore. The content that the player can create is uploaded automatically to a central database, cataloged and rated for quality (based on how many users have downloaded the object or creature in question), and then re-distributed to populate other players' games. The data transmitted is very small ‚Äî only a couple of kilobytes per item transmitted ‚Äì due to procedural generation of material. Via the in-game \\"MySpore Page\\", players receive statistics of how their creatures are faring in other players' games, which has been referred to as the \\"alternate realities of the Spore metaverse.\\" The game reports to the player on how other players have interacted with him or her. For example, the game reports how many times other players have allied with the player's species. The personalities of user-created species are dependent on how the user played them. Players can share creations, chat, and roleplay in the Sporum, the game's internet forum hosted by Maxis. Multiple sections allow forum users to share creations and tips for the game, as well as roleplay. =Sporepedia= Sporepedia during a game The Sporepedia keeps track of nearly every gameplay experience, including the evolution of a creature by graphically displaying a timeline which shows how the creature incrementally changed over the eons; it also keeps track of the creature's achievements, both noteworthy and dubious, as a species. The Sporepedia also keeps track of all the creatures, planets, vehicles and other content the player encounters over the course of a game. Players can upload their creations to Spore.com to be viewed by the public at the Sporepedia website. The ever-growing list of creations made by players is past the 100 million mark so far. Procedural generation Spore uses procedural generation extensively in relation to content pre-made by the developers. Wright mentioned in an interview given at E3 2006 that the information necessary to generate an entire creature would be only a couple of kilobytes, and went on to give the following analogy: \\"think of it as sharing the DNA template of a creature while the game, like a womb, builds the 'phenotypes' of the animal, which represent a few uploaded and downloaded freely and quickly from the Sporepedia online server. This allows users to asynchronously upload their creations and download other players' content, which enriches the experience of the game as more of its players progress in the game.\\" Reception IGN Australia awarded Spore a 9.2 out of 10 score, saying, \\"It [Spore] will make you acknowledge just how far we've come, and just how far we have to go, and Spore will change the way you think about the universe we live in.\\" PC Gamer UK awarded the game a 91%, saying \\"Spores triumph is painfully ironic. By setting out to instill a sense of wonderment at creation and the majesty of the universe, it's shown us that it's actually a lot more interesting to sit here at our computers and explore the contents of each other's brains.\\" In its 4.5 (of 5) -star review, GameSpy wrote \\"Spore is a technological triumph that introduces a whole new way of tapping into a bottomless well of content.\\" Most of the criticism of Spore came from the lack of depth in the first four phases, summarized by Eurogamer's 9 of 10 review, which stated, \\"for all their mighty purpose, the first four phases of the game don't always play brilliantly, and they're too fleeting.\\" 1UP.com reasoned in its B+ graded review, \\"It's not a perfect game, but it's definitely one that any serious gamer should try.\\" GameSpot in its 8.0 of 10 review called Spore \\"a legitimately great game that will deliver hours of quality entertainment\\", but criticized the \\"individual gameplay elements [that] are extremely simple.\\" Jason Ocampo's IGN 8.8 of 10 review stated, \\"Maxis has made an impressive product that does so many incredible things\\" but added, \\"while Spore is an amazing product, it's just not quite an amazing game.\\" The New York Times review of Spore mostly centered on lack of depth and quality of gameplay in the later phases of the game, stating that \\"most of the basic core play dynamics in Spore are unfortunately rather thin.\\" While a review in PC Gamer US stated that \\"it just isn't right to judge Spore in the context of so many of the other games we judge\\", Zero Punctuation was also critical of the game, claiming it did not live up to the legacy of The Sims: \\"The chief failing of Spore is that it's trying to be five games, each one a shallow and cut down equivalent of another game, with the Civilization Stage even going so far as to be named after the game [Civilization] it's bastardizing.\\" Criticism has also emerged surrounding the stability of the game, with The Daily Telegraph stating: \\"The launch of Spore, the keenly anticipated computer game from the creators of The Sims, has been blighted by technical problems.\\" In an interview published by MTV, Spore designer Will Wright responded to early criticism that the phases of the game had been dumbed-down by explaining \\"We were very focused, if anything, on making a game for more casual players. Spore has more depth than, let‚Äôs say, The Sims did. But we looked at the Metacritic scores for Sims 2, which was around ninety, and something like Half-Life, which was ninety-seven, and we decided ‚Äî quite a while back ‚Äî that we would rather have the Metacritic and sales of Sims 2 than the Metacritic and sales of Half-Life\\". In its first three weeks on sale, the game sold 2 million copies, according to Electronic Arts. It received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. =DRM controversy= Spore uses a modified version of the controversial digital rights management (DRM) software SecuROM as copy protection, which requires authentication upon installation and when online access is used. This system was announced after the originally planned system met opposition from the public, as it would have required authentication every ten days. Additionally, EA released the game under a policy by which the product key of an individual copy of the game would only be authenticated on up to three computers; however, some users ran afoul of the limitations as the software would consider even a slight change of hardware to constitute a different computer, resulting in all authorizations being used up by those who often upgrade their computer. In response to customer complaints, this limit was raised to five computers. After the activation limit has been depleted, EA Customer Service will consider further activations on a case-by-case basis. A survey conducted by EA revealed that only 14% have activated on more than 1 PC and less than 1% of users have tried to activate Spore on more than 3 PCs. By September 14, 2008 (ten days after the game's initial Australian release), 2,016 of 2,216 ratings on Amazon gave the game one out of five stars, most citing EA's implementation of DRM for the low ratings. Electronic Arts cited SecuROM as a \\"standard for the industry\\" and Apple's iPod song DRM policy as justification for the control method. Former Maxis developer Chris Harris labeled the DRM a \\"screw up\\" and a \\"totally avoidable disaster\\". The SecuROM software was not mentioned on the box, in the manual, or in the software license agreement. An EA spokesperson stated that \\"we don't disclose specifically which copy protection or digital rights management system we use [...] because EA typically uses one license agreement for all of its downloadable games, and different EA downloadable games may use different copy protection and digital rights management.‚Äù A cracked version without the DRM was released two days before the initial Australian release, making Spore the most torrented game on BitTorrent in 2008. On September 22, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against EA, regarding the DRM in Spore, complaining about EA not disclosing the existence of SecuROM, and addressing how SecuROM runs with the nature of a rootkit, including how it remains on the hard drive even after Spore is uninstalled.A copy of the filed complaint can be read in full here . On October 14, 2008, a similar class action lawsuit was filed against EA for the inclusion of DRM software in the free demo version of the Creature Creator. The DRM was also one of the major reasons why Spore is still one of the most pirated games to date, where within the first week of the game, over 500,000 people started downloading or downloaded it illegally from sites like The Pirate Bay. EA began selling Spore without SecuROM on December 22, 2008 through Steam. Furthermore, EA Games president Frank Gibeau announced that maximum install limit would be increased from 3 to 5 and that it would be possible to de-authorize and move installations to new machines, citing the need to adapt their policy to accommodate their legitimate customers. EA has stated, \\"By running the de-authorization tool, a machine 'slot' will be freed up on the online Product Authorization server and can then be re-used by another machine. You can de-authorize at any time, even without uninstalling Spore, and free up that machine authorization. If you re-launch Spore on the same machine, the game will attempt to re-authorize. If you have not reached the machine limitation, the game will authorize and the machine will be re- authorized using up one of the five available machines.\\" However, the de- authorization tool to do this is not available on the Mac platform. In 2016, a DRM-free version of Spore was released on GOG.com. =Scientific accuracy= The educational community has shown some interest in using Spore to teach students about evolution and biology. However, the game's player-driven evolution mechanism differs from the theory of evolution in some key ways: *The different species that appear in Spore each have different ancestors, not shared ones, and the player's creature's \\"evolutionary\\" path is linear instead of branched: one species can only evolve into one other species, as opposed to into many related species. *In Spore, the player's creature evolves along a path towards intelligence, instead of evolving solely in response to random genetic changes and pressure from its environment. In real world evolution, there are many possible evolutionary pathways, and there is no endpoint except extinction. (However a change in environment most likely will cause the player to change their creature to help survive in a new environment e.g. growing long arms to reach fruits on trees.) *In the real world, an organism's environment shapes its evolution by allowing some individuals to reproduce more and causing other individuals to die. In Spore, the only things shaping the way the creatures change over time are game statistics and \\"whatever the player thinks looks cool.\\" *In Spore, creatures have to collect new parts from other creatures or from skeletal remains in order to evolve those parts themselves. In reality, this does not occur, although in some cases organisms can appropriate the genes of other species. Bacteria and viruses can transfer genes from one species of macroscopic organism to another. However, this transfer is limited to single or occasionally multiple alleles; it never involves complex organs like mouths or limbs, as in Spore. *In real evolution, microorganisms grew in size due to the rise of cyanobacteria, or photosynthesizing cells, rather than solely the consumption of additional food, as in \\"Spore\\". In October 2008, John Bohannon of Science magazine assembled a team to review the game's portrayal of evolution and other scientific concepts. Evolutionary biologists T. Ryan Gregory of the University of Guelph and Niles Elredge of the American Museum of Natural History reviewed the Cell and Creature stages. William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist from the U.S. National Science Foundation, reviewed the Tribe and Civilization stages. NASA's Miles Smith reviewed the Space Stage. The Science team evaluated Spore on twenty-two subjects. The game's grades ranged from a single A in galactic structure and a B+ in sociology to Fs in mutation, sexual selection, natural selection, genetics, and genetic drift. In addition, Yale evolutionary biologists Thomas Near and Thomas Prum found Spore fun to play and admired its ability to get people to think about evolutionary questions, but consider the game's evolutionary mechanism to be \\"severely messed up.\\". With this noted, study of how players make meaning with the game suggest that the game prompts more sophisticated thinking about evolution than the model the game presents. According to Seed magazine, the original concept for Spore was more scientifically accurate than the version that was eventually released. It included more realistic artwork for the single-celled organisms and a rejection of faster-than-light travel as impossible. However, these were removed to make the game more friendly to casual users. While Seed does not entirely reject Spore as a teaching tool, admiring its ability to show the user experimentation, observation, and scale, biological concepts did not fare so well: Will Wright argues that developers \\"put the player in the role of an intelligent designer\\" because of the lack of emotional engagement of early prototypes focusing on mutation. Intelligent design advocate Michael Behe of Lehigh University reviewed the game and said that Spore \\"has nothing to do with real science or real evolution‚Äîneither Darwinian nor intelligent design.\\" Expansions Spore Creature Creator is the creature creator element of Spore released prior to the full game. Spore Creepy and Cute is an expansion pack that was repeased in late 2008, it includes new parts and color schemes for creature creation. Among the new parts were additional mouths and eyes, as well as \\"insect legs.\\" The pack also included new test-drive animations and backgrounds. Spore Galactic Adventures was released on June 23, 2009. It allows the player's creature to beam onto planets, rather than using a hologram. It also adds an \\"Adventure Creator\\" which allows for the creation of missions and goals to share with the Spore community. Creatures can add new abilities, including weaponry, tanks, and crew members, as well as a section of the adventure creator that involves editing a planet and using 60 new flora parts. Spore Bot Parts Pack is an expansion part of an EA promotion with Dr. Pepper in early 2010, 14 new robotic parts for Spore creatures were released in a new patch (1.06.0000) available only from the Dr. Pepper website. Codes found on certain bottles of Dr Pepper allow the player to redeem these parts, albeit only for the USA, excluding Maine. It was only available for Windows PC, and was eventually extended to Canadian residents. The promotion ended in late 2011. The Spore Bot Parts Pack has caused controversy within the Spore community, because of many problems with the download and its exclusive nature. Spinoffs The Nintendo DS spinoff is titled Spore Creatures, focusing on the Creature phase. The game is a 2D/3D story-based role-playing game as the gamer plays a creature kidnapped by a UFO and forced to survive in a strange world, with elements of Nintendogs. Another Spore title for the DS called Spore Hero Arena was released in 2009. Spore Origins is the mobile phone/iPhone/iPod spinoff of Spore, and as with the Nintendo DS version, focuses on a single phase of gameplay; in this case, the cell phase. The simplified game allows players to try to survive as a multicellular organism in a tide pool, similar to Flow. The iPhone version takes advantage of the device's touch capabilities and 3-axis accelerometer. A Wii spinoff of the game now known as Spore Hero has been mentioned by Will Wright several times, such as in his October 26, 2007 interview with The Guardian. Buechner confirmed it, revealing that plans for a Wii version were underway, and that the game would be built from the ground up and would take advantage of the Wii Remote, stating, \\"We're not porting it over. You know, we're still so early in design and prototyping that I don't know where we're going to end up, so I don't want to lead you down one path. But suffice to say that it's being developed with the Wii controls and technology in mind.\\" Eventually, a spin- off under the title \\"Spore Hero\\" was announced, an adventure game built ground up for the Wii with a heavier focus on evolution. For a time, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Spore were under consideration. Frank Gibeau, president of Electronic Arts' Games Label announced that the publisher might use the underlying technology of Spore to develop electric software titles, such as action, real-time strategy, and role-playing games for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii. Spore Hero Arena is a spinoff game for the Nintendo DS released on October 6, 2009. Darkspore was an action role-playing game that utilized the same creature-editing mechanics. It was released in April 2011 for Microsoft Windows. The game was shut down in March 2016. Spore Creature Keeper was a spin-off game developed by Maxis for Windows and OS X. Made for younger users, the gameplay was heavily based on The Sims. Originally planned for a summer 2009 release, the game development was eventually cancelled. Other media =Merchandising= There is an iTunes-style \\"Spore Store\\" built into the game, allowing players to purchase external Spore licensed merchandise, such as t-shirts, posters, and future Spore expansion packs. There are also plans for the creation of a type of Spore collectible card game based on the Sporepedia cards of the creatures, buildings, vehicles, and planets that have been created by the players. There are also indications of plans for the creation of customized creature figurines; some of those who designed their own creatures at E3 2006 later received 3D printed models of the creatures they created. On December 18, 2008, it was announced that players could now turn their creations into 3D sculptures using Z Corporations 3D printing technology. The Spore Store also allows people to put their creatures on items such as T-shirts, mugs, and stickers. The Spore team worked with a comic creation software company to offer comic book versions of players' \\"Spore stories\\". Comic books with stylized pictures of various creatures, some whose creation has been shown in various presentations, can be seen on the walls of the Spore team's office. The utility was revealed at the Comic-Con International: San Diego on July 24, 2008 as the Spore Comic Creator, which would utilize MashOn.com and its e-card software. Spore: Galactic Edition, a special edition of the game; includes a Making of Spore DVD video, How to Build a Better Being DVD video by National Geographic Channel, The Art of Spore hardback mini-book, a fold-out Spore poster and a 100-page Galactic Handbook published by Prima Games. =Theatrical film= EA, 20th Century Fox, and AIG announced the development of a Spore film on October 1, 2009. The movie adaptation would be a CGI-animated film created by Blue Sky Studios. Chris Wedge was set to direct the proposed film. However, , the film remains in development hell. =Soundtrack= Cliff Martinez composed the main menu Galaxy theme track.Spore Credits at http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/spore_/credits Brian Eno created the generative music together with Peter Chilvers and is credited for the ‚Äùspore compositions‚Äù. \\"Solar System\\", \\"Timeline\\" and a few other tracks on Spore‚Äî\\"Religious Vehicle Editor\\". \\"Sporepedia\\" was composed by Saul Stokes. =Use in academia= Spore has been used in academic studies to see how respondents display surrogation.

Dragon Magazine, TSR, Inc.. Issue 151, November 1989, (pg.46)Lampe, David. \\"The Heirs/Errors of \\"Ivanhoe\\" : Robin Hood in Pre- and Post-Modern Fiction\\",. In Hahn, Thomas G. (ed.) Robin Hood in Popular Culture: Violence, Transgression, and Justice Boydell and Brewer, 2000. (pgs. 136-137) In McKinley's afterword, she says, \\"The retellings through the centuries have echoed concurrent preoccupations.\\" The story includes both the traditional Robin Hood characters ‚Äî Little John, Much, Friar Tuck, Marian and Alan-a-dale ‚Äî and characters of McKinley's own invention. Notably, three of the most important characters are women, all of whom escape marriage to prospective spouses chosen by their fathers. Summary Robin is a forester in Sherwood forest. As he leaves an archery contest, someone shoots at him and only just misses. Without thinking, Robin returns fire and kills someone. Robin's friends Marian and Much convince him to become an outlaw. Robin hides in Sherwood Forest and gathers a band to oppose the tyrannous Sheriff of Nottingham. Unsurprisingly they rob the rich, give to the poor, and poach deer. Newcomers join the band, including the huge Little John and Will Scarlet. Will hears that his sister does not want to marry a Norman baron, but Robin refuses to help. A young minstrel named Alan- a-dale asks for help. His beloved, Marjorie, is to wed a baron and he wants to rescue her. The outlaws get Friar Tuck to perform the marriage to Alan instead of the original groom. Alan and Marjorie join Robin's band, which takes in a mysterious young man called Cecil, who is later found to be a girl, and whom Will recognizes as his sister, Cecily. She stays in the band. Robin hears that Sir Richard of the Lea, who had been kind to Robin when he was a forester, is about to lose his property due to debts. The outlaws give Sir Richard the money he needs. There is an archery contest with a prize of a golden arrow; it is clearly a trap so Robin does not go. Marian wears a disguise and wins the contest. Guy of Gisbourne, a mercenary hired by the Sheriff of Nottingham, attacks her thinking that she is Robin. Cecily and Little John spirit Marian away to Friar Tuck's hideout in the forest. Marian is badly hurt. Robin tells her he loves her and asks her to marry him. Guy of Gisbourne and his men find Tuck's hideout. The band beat them off. Sir Richard takes the outlaws to his castle to keep them safe but the Sheriff is furious that Sir Richard is protecting them. Both he and Sir Richard send word to King Richard the Lionheart. Little John and Cecily say they love each other. King Richard shows up at Sir Richard's castle unannounced. He makes all the outlaws swear loyalty to him, and tells them that they must join the crusades. The king makes Robin the heir to Sir Richard‚Äôs lands and says that Robin and Marian can marry. Reception Reviewing The Outlaws of Sherwood in Dragon magazine, John C. Bunnell stated \\"McKinley's retelling of Sherwood Forest's familiar history is wise and deeply satisfying, enough so that it is hard to imagine a version of the legend that could be discernibly better\\".

After graduating he joined the staff of the Leiden Observatory, where he worked on binary stars. In 1913 he gained a post at the Cape Observatory in South Africa, where he worked on double stars and parallax measurements. He became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1917 (and was re-elected in 1953 after his membership lapsed during the war). His preliminary account of the parallax of Proxima Centauri was published in 1917, demonstrating that Proxima was the same distance from the Sun as the Alpha Centauri system. He returned to Java in 1919, where he served as an assistant at the Weltevreden meteorological and magnetic observatory. There he was able to gain the interest of wealthy friends for the construction of an observatory. Vo√ªte became the Director, and he selected the 1,300 m altitude Lembang for the site. The main instrument was a 60 cm Zeiss double refractor. The work of the observatory focused on double stars, parallax measurements, photometry of variable stars and clusters, and so forth. The results were published in the Lembang Observatory Annals. Following the Japanese occupation of Java, Vo√ªte was imprisoned. As a result of his captivity he suffered from poor health, so after the war he moved to Australia. Later he settled in The Hague, the Netherlands, where he died in 1963.

This combination is registered for animal use only. To achieve efficacy, the treatment is administered once monthly, together with food, in a dosage suitable for the weight of the affected animal. The usual ratio is 500 Œºg milbemycin oxime and 10 mg lufenuron/kg body weight. Novartis indicates the proper dosage by color-coding the packages.Novartis Animal Health - Sentinel Flavor Tabs, Several 2002 studies by Novartis demonstrate that milbemycin oxime/lufenuron compares favorably to some other treatments, such as the moxidectin injection. The combination is considered effective in the elimination of fleas, and the prevention of infection from hookworm (Ancylostoma caninum), heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis), roundworms, whipworms (Trichuris vulpis), and ascarids (Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina).

It operated for 10 years, from 1996 to 2006. History Ch√¢teau de Linardi√© functioned with the financial support from the town of Gaillac (led by its dynamic Mayor Charles Pistre), from the Department of the Tarn, and from the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es region. The project entailed the physical restoration of the Ch√¢teau itself and the establishment of an Association to run its activities. Founder David Marshall began work on the Ch√¢teau on 8 January 1996 and the Association Culturelle du Ch√¢teau de Linardi√© was officially declared on 6 November 1996. Ch√¢teau de Linardi√© employed secretarial and administrative personnel and appointed as Artistic Director, Danielle Delouche, a graduate from the University of Sorbonne VIII, Paris, and a specialist in Art History, who has been a contributor to numerous art and design periodicals. The Association collaborated with the University of Toulouse le Mirail, where the Director of the Department of Fine Arts and Applied Arts, Xavier Lambert, as well as the Ma√Ætre des Conf√©rences, Carole Hoffman, were responsible for seminars, colloquia, and conferences. They were especially helpful in helping Linardi√© develop its artistic policy. Another key person was Francis Pratt, a former research fellow at the University of Stirling in Scotland where he was a founder member of the Vision Group. Due to legal difficulties encountered by Gaillac, the town was forced to cede ownership of the Ch√¢teau in September 2006. It is no longer available to the Association and is now rapidly falling back into the state of ruin from which David Marshall rescued it in 1996.

He is best known for his excavations at Heshbon in Jordan and Shechem in the West Bank. He was Professor of History of Antiquity at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary in Berrien Springs, Michigan (now part of Andrews University). The Siegfried H. Horn Museum at Andrews University was named in his honor. An educator of wide-ranging interests and abilities, his areas of specialty were Ancient Near Eastern chronology and archaeology. Biography Horn was born March 17, 1908, to Albin and Klara Horn in Wurzen, Saxony, Germany. His father was one of the world's earliest aviators, trained as a pilot by Louis Bl√©riot. Horn served as a minister and as a missionary from 1930 to 1940, first in the Netherlands and then in the Dutch East Indies. Because he was German, Horn spent six and a half years as a prisoner of war during World War II, from 1940 to 1946, first as a prisoner of the Dutch in Indonesia and then imprisoned by the English in India. Granted access to books, Horn made use of this time to develop his skills in Greek and Hebrew and to teach his fellow inmates. Upon gaining his freedom at the end of World War II, Horn immigrated to the United States and completed his education. He earned a B.A. at Walla Walla College (now a University) in Washington State (1947), an M.A. at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. (1948), and a Ph.D. in Egyptology at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (1951). He studied briefly under William F. Albright at Johns Hopkins University. Horn taught at the Adventist Theological Seminary from 1951 to 1976. He started an archaeological museum (later named for him), was the founding editor of the journal Andrews University Seminary Studies, started up the Seminary's doctoral programs, and initiated and directed the archaeological dig at Tell Hesban, biblical Heshbon. The dig at Hesban eventually developed into the Madaba Plains Project, with excavations at Hesban, Umayri, and Jalul. Horn also dug at Tell Balatah, biblical Shechem, in the early 1960s. Horn died of lymphoma on November 28, 1993, in St. Helena, California, at the age of 85.

From this position, it once controlled the eastern part of the Hodna region, while M'Sila did the west. It flourished from the time of the Roman Empire through the Islamic Middle Ages, until it was sacked and destroyed by the Banu Hilal in the 11th century, after which it was finally abandoned. Poorly documented by archaeologists today, Tobna's ruins occupy an extensive area and include the remains of a Byzantine fortress as well as the traces of a wall covering a 950 m by 930 m area.  History  The site of Tobna is poorly studied by archaeologists as of 2019. The same is true of the surrounding Hodna region in general. Jean Baradez's aerial surveys in Algeria, published in 1949, provided the first aerial images of the site. From this data, he worked on reconstructing the Roman road network surrounding the city. Only a single milestone appearing to mention Tobna by name has been found; it was located on the ancient road to Nicivibus (Ngaous) and carries the inscription \\"[a Thu]bonis\\". Reconstruction of the surrounding road network has mostly been deduced from the distances recorded on other milestones in the area as well as their locations. Roman Tubunae first became a municipium under Septimius Severus. In 427 CE, Count Boniface met with Augustine of Hippo during his stay in the city. In Late Antiquity, Tobna was the seat of a military district called the limes Tubuniensis, which is listed in the Notitia Dignitatum as one of the sixteen praepositi limitis under the jurisdiction of the Comes of Africa. A fortress was built here during the reign of Justinian. This fortress has survived to the present day; it is moderately sized, located at a point somewhat higher than the surrounding plain. By the 680s, it had become a base for the Berber king Kasila, with the Byzantine officials acquiescing. Tobna had formerly been the seat of the Comes of Africa, but that office had fallen out of use by the mid-600s. Byzantine Tobna lay at the border of the provinces of Numidia and Mauretania Caesariensis (aka Mauretania Sitifensis). Later on, the Muslim geographer al-Maliki considered Tobna to be on the western limit of Ifriqiya. Tobna was an important city in the Islamic Middle Ages: the geographer al-Bakri called it the most important city of the Maghreb between Kairouan and Sijilmassa. Al-Bakri described the city as being surrounded by a brick wall, with monumental gateways. Tobna had five gates: to the west, the BƒÅb KhakƒÅn; to the east, the BƒÅb Fat·∏• (with vents); to the south, the BƒÅb TƒÅh≈´dha (made of iron) and the BƒÅb al-Jadƒ´d; and to the north, the BƒÅb KurƒÅma. On the south side of the city was the fortress, which featured vaulted chambers, a cistern dating to the Byzantine period, a Jami mosque, and the governor's palace (dƒÅr al-'imƒÅra). Inside the walls, the main street of Tobna ran east-west (\\"sima·π≠\\", corresponding to the Roman Decumanus Maximus) and was lined with shops and markets. More markets lay outside the city walls in the extensive suburbs, of which the most important was to the west. There was also a hammam. Tobna had an eclectic population including Arabs, Persians serving in the army, Berbers, and Roman Africans who were mostly of Berber descent with some Roman ancestry. Ibn Hawqal and al-Bakri both remarked on the bitter rivalry between the Arabs and the Roman Africans in the city, with the Arabs seeking allies in the Arabs of Tahudha and S√©tif and the Roman Africans seeking allies in the Biskra region. Beyond the walls were extensive suburbs, a cemetery (to the east), and irrigated gardens and farms. The city was irrigated by the waters of the Oued Bitham; according to al-Bakri, \\"Every time it overflows, it waters all the gardens and fields in the suburbs and provides the inhabitants with abundant harvests.\\" Major crops included wheat, barley, flax, and cotton. Orchards grew dates, among other fruits, and there was cattle and sheep breeding until the 10th century. For two centuries beginning c. 700 CE, Tobna was a major strategic center for Muslim rulers, serving as capital of the Zab region. It had a garrison (jund) and newly-built walls, and it served as the main point d'appui for campaigns against rebellious Berbers, including members of the Khawarij and, later, the Kutama tribe. One military governor of Tobna, Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab, went on to found the Aghlabid dynasty, which would rule Ifriqiya for a century. In 906 CE, during the final years of Aghlabid power, Tobna was besieged by the forces of Abu Abdallah al- Shi'i, an Isma'ili missionary who had gathered a large following among the Kutama tribe. Tobna was fortified with structures dating back to the Byzantine Empire, as well as a large Aghlabid garrison which defended itself with mangonels during the siege. Abu Abdallah's Kutama army sent sappers to the wall, protected by a dabbƒÅba (literally \\"crawler\\"): a \\"mobile protecting roof\\" or testudo formation echoing old Roman tactics. The sappers succeeded in collapsing one of the towers along the city wall, and the Kutama were able to enter the city through the breach. The defenders soon surrendered; Ibn Idhari recorded this as taking place at the end of Dhu al-Hijjah, 293 AH (905-906 CE). Tobna then became part of the Fatimid Caliphate. The Zenata tribe to the west were enemies of the Fatimids, and in 927, in order to contain them, the Fatimids established a new regional capital further west, at Msila. Tobna thus lost much of its civic and military importance. Many of its inhabitants relocated west to Msila, and economic activity declined. The wars with the Zenata also hindered agricultural development. Under the Zirid dynasty, Tobna had a Zenata governor named Fulful ibn Sa'id ibn Khazrun, who was appointed by al-Mansur ibn Buluggin in 992 and reconfirmed by his successor Badis ibn Mansur in 996. However, in 999, Fulful rebelled, and in retaliation, Badis pillaged the city. In 1017, a peace treaty between Badis's successor, al- Mu'izz, and Hammad ibn Buluggin, al-Mansur's brother and founder of the Hammadid dynasty, gave control of Tobna to the Hammadids, and Hammad's son al- Qa'id was made its governor. Under Hammadid rule, Tobna briefly enjoyed a renewed prosperity. That ended during the mid-11th century, when the Banu Hilal invaded the region. Ibn Khaldun described the devastation they brought: after sacking and destroying both Tobna and Msila, the Banu Hilal attacked the caravanserais, towns, villages, and farms, razing them completely to the ground. Tobna never recovered. While it was repopulated, it lost its importance in favor of Biskra, and soon after it was abandoned altogether. = List of known governors = * al-Aghlab (761) * al-Muhallab ibn Yazid (date not given) * al-Fadl ibn Rawh (until 791, when he was appointed governor of Ifriqiya) * al-'Ala ibn Sa'id (791-794) * Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab (797-800, founder of Aghlabid dynasty) * Salim ibn Jalbun (dismissed in 847) * Yahya ibn Salim (appointed by Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i in 906) * Fulful ibn Sa'id ibn Khazrun (992-999) Christian diocese There were two towns called Tubunae in the territory of what is now Algeria, when it was part of the Roman Empire. One is referred to as Tubunae in Mauretania, because it was part of the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis. The other (the modern town of Tobna) is called Tubunae in Numidia, because it was situated in the Roman province of Numidia. Writers such as Morcelli uses the spelling \\"Tubunae\\" for both of them,Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa christiana, Volume I, Brescia 1816, pp. 331‚Äì332 but the Catholic Church's list of titular sees refers to the second of them (corresponding to modern Tobna) as Thubunae in Numidia.Annuario Pontifico 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 998 There it is even the possibility that both names are for the same settlement. = Tubunae in Mauretania = The names of none of the bishops of this town, which is mentioned by Ptolemy, have been preserved. The see was vacant when Huneric summoned the North African bishops to Carthage in 484. = Tubunae/Thubunae in Numidia = It was to this town \\"in the depths of Numidia\\"Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Augustine of Hippo: A Biography (University of California Press 1969 ), p. 422 that Augustine of Hippo and Alypius went, probably in 421, to meet the Roman official Boniface and exhort him \\"to serve the Church by protecting the empire from the barbarians\\".William A. Sumruld, Augustine and the Arians (Association University Presse 1984 ), p. 86 In 479 Huneric exiled a large number of Catholics there. Its ruins, known as Tobna, are in the Department of Constantine, Algeria, at the gates of the Sahara, west of the Chott el Hodna, the \\"Salinae Tubunenses\\" of the Romans. They are very extensive, for three successive towns occupied different sites, under the Romans, the Byzantines, and the Arabs. Besides the remains of the fortress, the most remarkable monument is a church now used as a mosque.Sophrone P√©trid√®s, \\"Tubunae\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1912)  Bishops  Three bishops of Tubunae/Thubunae in Numidia are known. Saint Nemesianus assisted at the Council of Carthage (256). Saint Cyprian often speaks of him in his letters, and we have a letter which he wrote to Cyprian in his own name and in the name of those who were condemned with him to the mines. An inscription testifies to his cult at Tixter in 360, and the Roman Martyrology mentions him on 10 September. Another bishop was Cresconius, who usurped the see after quitting that of Bulla Regia, and who assisted at the Council of Carthage (411), where his rival was the Donatist Protasius. A third, Reparatus, was exiled by Huneric in 484. See also * Mauretania Caesariensis * Gemellae * Sitifis References Bibliography * Laffi, Umberto.

Originally the publication was called Dead Relix and was less than twenty pages thick with a hand-drawn black and white cover. By 1978 Dead Relix had dropped the word \\"Dead\\" from its title and expanded to include articles about the entire Bay Area psychedelic scene. From here the scope of Relix expanded to encompass a vast array of musical genres such as reggae and heavy metal. This caused the magazine to lose direction until it rallied behind its original focus on The Grateful Dead. However, Relix did not revert entirely to its old ways and managed to also cover various genres of music and even some non-music related issues. Soon after this transformation Relix became known as a magazine that broke acts, with many emerging bands making their debut in Relix columns such as \\"Independents Daze‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn the Edge.‚Äù After the passing of Jerry Garcia in 1995 Relix was forced to move away from its coverage of The Grateful Dead. Embracing change, it began to report on jambands and other genres of music not considered as mainstream. In 2000 the magazine was purchased by Steve Bernstein and in 2007 it entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Today, Relix covers a variety of jambands, indie rockers, singer-songwriters, and the live music scene in general. Also, each issue comes with a free CD sampling various up and coming bands. Bernstein sold \\"Relix\\" to Relix Media Group in 2009. = Global Rhythm Magazine = Global Rhythm was founded in 2000 by Publisher, Alecia Cohen.

It represents the thermocline between purely offensive and defensive action; interdicting and disrupting an attack or a threat's preparation to attack, either pre-emptively or in self-defence. The mission of the pre-emptive proactive operations is to conduct aggressive interdiction and disruption activities against an adversary using: Psychological operations, Managed Information Dissemination, Precision Targeting, Information Warfare Operations and computer network exploitation and other active threat reduction measures. The proactive defense strategy is meant to improves information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents, provide strike options and to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battlespace. A measure for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber attack, or impending cyber operation or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber counter-operation against the source. Proactive cyber defence operations pre-emptively engage the adversary The offensive capacity includes the manipulation or disruption of networks and systems with the purpose of limiting or eliminating the adversary's operational capability. This capability can be required to guarantee one's freedom of action in the cyber domain. Cyber-attacks can be launched to repel an attack (active defence) or to support the operational action. The distinction between active cyber defence and offensive cyber operations (OCO) is that the later requires legislative exceptions or executive prerogative to undertake. Hence, offensive cyber capabilities may be developed in collaboration with industry, or facilitated by private sector but operations are led by nation states. There are some exceptions, notably in self-defence or with judicial authority (civil warrants) or assisting law enforcement. CyberISR (intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance) focuses a powerful lens onto the Internet-of-Everything. The capability provides strategic listening, enhanced situational understanding, precision and mission-confidence though a keen awareness of both adversary dynamics and one's attack surface, thus facilitating anticipatory threat reduction, accelerated evidence-based decision support, contextualization, targeting, the ability to mount an defence against. Cyber threat hunting is the process of proactively and iteratively searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. Offensive, proactive cyber activities and active cyber defence facilitate anticipatory threat reduction while informing protection, detection and incident response given its ability to engage the adversary at distance and time. An active defence: * Has greater efficacy than reactive systems. * Drastically reduces the volume and severity of attacks leading to an order-of- magnitude fewer alerts, incidents, and costs. Thus, passing these savings to cybersecurity. * Provides early warning and indicators to model zero-day signatures to incident response mechanisms and enumerate attack networks through cyber threat intelligence. * In not subject to scalability issues around performance and cost like reactive systems. * Uniquely has the capability to shape contested space. Cyber defense Strategically, cyber defence refers to operations that are conducted in the cyber domain in support of mission objectives. To help understand the practical difference between cyber security and cyber defence, is to recognize that cyber defence requires a shift from network assurance (security) to mission assurance where cyber defence is fully integrated into operational planning across the Joint Functions. Cyber defence focuses on sensing, detecting, orienting, and engaging adversaries in order to assure mission success and to out-manoeuver that adversary. This shift from security to defence requires a strong emphasis on intelligence,and reconnaissance, and the integration of staff activities to include intelligence, operations, communications, and planning. Defensive cyber operations refer to activities on or through the global information infrastructure to help protect and institutions' electronic information and information infrastructures as a matter of mission assurance. Does not normally involve direct engagement with the adversary. The distinction between cyber defence, active cyber defence, proactive cyber defence and offensive cyber operations has been influenced by doctrine, pragmatics of technology or tradecraft and legal thresholds. Active cyber operations refers to activities on or through the global information infrastructure to degrade, disrupt, influence, respond to or interfere with the capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign individual, state, organization or terrorist group as they relate to international affairs, defence or security. Active cyber defence decisively engages the adversary and includes hunt and adversarial pursuit activities. History In the fifth century, B.C., Sun Tzu advocated foreknowledge (predictive analysis) as part of a winning strategy. He warned that planners must have a precise understanding of the active threat and not \\"remain ignorant of the enemy's condition\\". The thread of proactive defense is spun throughout his teachings. Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl was likely the first to use of the term proactive in his 1946 book Man's Search for Meaning to distinguish the act of taking responsibility for one's own circumstances rather than attributing one's condition to external factors. Later in 1982, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) used \\"proactive\\" as a contrary concept to \\"reactive\\" in assessing risk. In the framework of risk management \\"proactive\\" meant taking initiative by acting rather than reacting to threat events. Conversely \\"reactive\\" measures respond to a stimulus or past events rather than predicting the event. Military science then and now considers defense as the science-art of thwarting an attack. Furthermore, doctrine poses that if a party attacks an enemy who is about to attack this could be called active-defense. Defense is also a euphemism for war but does not carry the negative connotation of an offensive war. Usage in this way has broadened the term to include most military issues including offensive, which is implicitly referred to as active-defense. Politically, the concept of national self- defense to counter a war of aggression refers to a defensive war involving pre-emptive offensive strikes and is one possible criterion in the 'Just War Theory'. Proactive defense has moved beyond theory. It has been put into practice in theatres of operation. In 1989 Stephen Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, published by Free Press, transformed the meaning \\"to act before a situation becomes a source of confrontation or crisis\\". Since then, \\"proactive\\" has been placed in opposition to the words \\"reactive\\" or \\"passive\\". Origins Cyber is derived from \\"cybernetics\\", a word originally coined by a group of scientists led by Norbert Wiener and made popular by Wiener's book of 1948, Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. Cyberspace typically refers to the vast and growing logical domain composed of public and private networks; independently managed networks linked together through the lingua franca of the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP). The definition of Cyberspace has been extended to include all network-space which at some point, through some path, may have eventual access to the public internet. Under this definition, cyberspace becomes virtually every networked device in the world, which is not devoid of a network interface entirely. There is no air-gap anymore between networks. The origins of cyber defense undoubtedly evolved from the original purpose of the Internet which was to harden military networks against the threat of a nuclear strike. Later cyber defense was coveted by the tenets of information warfare and information operations. The rapid evolution of information warfare operations doctrine in the 1990s embraced a proactive preemptive cyber defense strategy. Current status The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace was published in February 2003 to outline an initial framework for both organizing and prioritizing efforts to secure the cyberspace. It highlighted the necessity for public-private partnerships. Proactive threads include the call to deter malicious activity and prevent cyber attacks against America's critical infrastructures. The notion of \\"proactive defense\\" has a rich history. The hype of \\"proactive cyber defence\\" reached its zenith around 1994. This period was marked by intense \\"hype\\" discussions under the auspices of Information Warfare. Much of the current doctrine related to proactive cyber defense was fully developed by 1995. A number of programs were initiated then, and advanced to full operation by 2005 including those of hostile states. Meanwhile, the public discussions diminished until the most recent resurgence in proactive cyber defense 2004‚Äì2008. Now most of the discussions around proactive defence in the literature are much less \\"proactive\\" than the earlier discussions in 1994 or existing operational programs. 'Proactive' is often used to hype marketing of security products or programs, in much the same way that \\"extreme\\" or \\"quality\\" adjectives have been misused. The hype-cycle of discussion reached its peak in 1994. Present-day proactive cyber defense strategy was conceived within the context of the rich discussion that preceded it, existing doctrine and real proactive cyber defense programs that have evolved globally over the past decade. Dr. Robert John Garigue, a computational epistemologist and father of information warfare in Canada, published Information Warfare, Developing a Conceptual Framework. This was a landmark document in 1994 and genesis for proactive cyber defensive theory in Canada. Founding members of the interdepartmental committee on Information Warfare (Canada 1994), Dr. Robert Garigue and Dave McMahon wrote: Strategic listening, core intelligence and a proactive defence provide time and precision. Conversely, reacting in surprise is ineffective, costly and leaves few options. Strategic deterrence needs a credible offensive, proactive defence and information peacekeeping capability in which to project power and influence globally through Cyberspace in the defence of the nation. Similarly, Deterrence and diplomacy are required in the right dosage to dissuade purposeful interference with the national critical cyber infrastructures in influence in the democratic process by foreign states. Vulnerabilities equities Intelligence agencies such as the NSA were criticized for buying up and stockpiling zero-day vulnerabilities, keeping them secret and developing mainly offensive capabilities instead of defensive measures and helping patch vulnerabilities. This criticism was widely reiterated and recognized after the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack. =Proactive pre-emptive operations= The notion of a proactive pre-emptive operations group (P2OG) emerged from a report of the Defense Science Board (DSB), 2002 briefing. The briefing was reported by Dan Dupont in Inside the Pentagon on September 26, 2002, and was also discussed by William M. Arkin in the Los Angeles Times on October 27, 2002. The Los Angeles Times has subsequently quoted U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld revealing the creation of the \\"Proactive, Pre-emptive Operations Group\\". The mission of the P2OG is reportedly to conduct Aggressive, Proactive, Pre-emptive Operations to interdiction and disruption the threat using: Psychological operations, Managed Information Dissemination, Precision Targeting, Information Warfare Operations, and SIGINT... The proactive defense strategy is meant to improves information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents, provide strike options and to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battle space. The P2OG has been recommended to be constituted of \\"one hundred 'highly specialized people with unique technical and intelligence skills such as information operations, PSYOPS, network attack, covert activities, SIGINT, HUMINT, SOF, influence warfare/deception operations and to report to the National Security Council with an annual budget of $100 million\\". The group would be overseen by the White House's deputy national security adviser and would carry out missions coordinated by the secretary of defense or the CIA director. \\"The proposal is the latest sign of a new assertiveness by the Defense Department in intelligence matters, and an indication that the cutting edge of intelligence reform is not to be found in Congress but behind closed doors in the Pentagon.\\" - Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. DoD doctrinally would initiate a 'pre-emptive' attack on the basis of evidence that an enemy attack is imminent. Proactive measures, according to DoD are those actions taken directly against the preventive stage of an attack by the enemy. See also References Sources * , Bradley J. Wood, O.

It combines lean manufacturing/lean enterprise and Six Sigma to eliminate the eight kinds of waste (muda): Defects, Over-Production, Waiting, Non-Utilized Talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, and Extra-Processing. Lean Six Sigma not only reduces process defects and waste, but also provides a framework for overall organizational culture change. By introducing Lean Six Sigma, the mindset of employees and managers change to one that focuses on growth and continuous improvement through process optimization. This change in culture and the mindset of an organization maximizes efficiency and increases profitability. In order to successfully implement Lean Six Sigma, a combination of tools from both lean manufacturing and Six Sigma must be used. Some of these tools include kaizen, value-stream mapping, line balancing, and visual management.  Waste  Waste is defined by Fujio Cho of Toyota as \\"anything other than the minimum amount of equipment, materials, parts, space, and workers time, which are absolutely essential to add value to the product.\\" Different types of waste have been defined: *Defects: A defect is a product that is declared unfit for use. This requires the product to either be scrapped or reworked, costing the company time and money. Examples include a product that is scratched during the production process and incorrect assembly of a product due to unclear instruction. *Over-Production: Over-production refers to product that is made in excess or made before it is needed. Products should be produced as they are needed following the Just-in-time manufacturing philosophy in Lean. Examples include creating unnecessary reports and overproduction of a product before a customer has requested it. *Waiting: Waiting involves delays in process steps and is split into two different categories: waiting for material and equipment and idle equipment. Examples include waiting for authorization from a superior, waiting for an email response, waiting for material delivery, and slow or faulty equipment. *Non- Utilized Talent: Non-Utilized Talent refers to the waste of human potential and skill and is the newest addition to the eight wastes. The main cause of this waste is when management is segregated from employees. When this occurs, employees are not given the opportunity to provide feedback and recommendations to managers in order to improve the process flow and production suffers. Examples include poorly trained employees, lack of incentives for employees, and placing employees in jobs or positions that do not utilize all of their knowledge or skill. *Transportation: Transportation is the unnecessary or excessive movement of materials, product, people, equipment, and tools. Transportation adds no value to the product and can even lead to product damage and defects. Examples include moving product between different functional areas and sending overstocked inventory back to an outlet warehouse. *Inventory: Inventory refers to an excess in products and materials that aren't yet processed. This is a problem because the product may become obsolete before the customer requires it, storing the inventory costs the company time and money, and the possibility of damage and defects increases over time. Examples include excess finished goods, finished goods that cannot be sold, and broken machines scattered on the manufacturing floor. *Motion: Motion is unnecessary movement by people. Excessive motion wastes time and increases the chance of injury. Examples include walking to get tools, reaching for materials, and walking to different parts of the manufacturing floor to complete different tasks. *Extra-Processing: Extra-processing is doing more work than is required or necessary to complete a task. Examples include double-entering data, unnecessary steps in production, unnecessary product customization, and using higher precision equipment than necessary. The acrostic of these items forms the mnemonic DOWN TIME.  History  = 1980s-2000s = What has today to become Lean Six Sigma can be traced to Motorola in the United States in 1986. Six Sigma was developed within Motorola to compete with the Kaizen (or lean manufacturing) business model in Japan. As a result of Six Sigma, Motorola received the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award in the year 1988. In the 1990s Allied Signal hired Larry Bossidy and introduced Six Sigma in heavy manufacturing. A few years later, General Electric's Jack Welch consulted Bossidy and began Six Sigma at General Electric. At this point, Six Sigma became more widely accepted and known in the manufacturing world. During the 2000s Lean Six Sigma forked from Six Sigma and became its own unique process. While Lean Six Sigma developed as a specific process of Six Sigma, it also incorporates ideas from lean manufacturing, which was developed as a part of the Toyota Production System in the 1950s. = 2000s-2010s = The first concept of Lean Six Sigma was created in 2001 by a book titled Leaning into Six Sigma: The Path to Integration of Lean Enterprise and Six Sigma by Barbara Wheat, Chuck Mills, Mike Carnell. The book was developed as a guide for managers of manufacturing plants on how to combine lean manufacturing and Six Sigma in order to dramatically improve quality and cycle time in the plant. Wheat, Mills, and Carnell narrate the story of a company who was skeptical about implementing Lean Six Sigma, but as a result of doing so was able to successfully improve the quality and efficiency in all aspects of business. In the early 2000s Six Sigma principles expanded into other sectors of the economy, such as Healthcare, Finance, Supply Chain, etc. While different sectors of the economy sell different \\"products\\" and have different \\"customers\\", Lean Six Sigma principles can still be applied with slight alterations in wording and processes.  Description  Lean Six Sigma is a synergized managerial concept of Lean and Six Sigma. Lean traditionally focuses on the elimination of the eight kinds of waste/Muda classified as defects, over-production, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra-processing. Six Sigma seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects (errors) and minimizing variability in (manufacturing and business) processes. Together, Lean aims to achieve continuous flow by tightening the linkages between process steps while Six Sigma focuses on reducing process variation (in all its forms) for the process steps thereby enabling a tightening of those linkages. In short, Lean exposes sources of process variation and Six Sigma aims to reduce that variation enabling a virtuous cycle of iterative improvements towards the goal of continuous flow. Lean Six Sigma uses the DMAIC phases similar to that of Six Sigma. The five phases include Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. The five phases used in Lean Six Sigma are aimed to identify the root cause of inefficiencies and works with any process, product, or service that has a large amount of data or measurable characteristics available.The DMAIC toolkit of Lean Six Sigma comprises all the Lean and Six Sigma tools. The different levels of certifications are divided into belt colors, similar to judo. The highest level of certification is a black belt, signifying a deep knowledge of Lean Six Sigma principles. Below the black belt are the green and yellow belts. For each of these belts, levels skill sets are available that describe which of the overall Lean Six Sigma tools are expected to be part at a certain Belt level. These skill sets provide a detailed description of the learning elements that a participant will have acquired after completing a training program. The skill sets reflect elements from Six Sigma, Lean and other process improvement methods like the theory of constraints (TOC) total productive maintenance (TPM). In order to achieve any of the certification levels, a proctored exam must be passed that includes various questions on Lean Six Sigma and its applications. Lean Six Sigma organization structure  How Lean and Six Sigma come together  Lean Six Sigma utilizes concepts from both Lean and Six Sigma to cut production costs, improve quality, speed up, stay competitive, and save money. From Six Sigma, companies benefit from the reduced variation on parts. Also, Lean saves money for the company by focusing on the types of waste and how to reduce waste. The two processes come together into Lean Six Sigma, creating a well balanced and organized solution to save money and produce better products. Although Lean and Six Sigma are different processes, they are complementary and share many similarities that allow them to flow together seamlessly. First, both Lean and Six Sigma stress the fact that the customer defines the value of a product or service. This means that when processes are examined, the importance or necessity of steps in the process should be examined through the eyes of the customer. Also, Lean and Six Sigma utilize process flow maps in order to better understand the flow of production and identify any wastes. Furthermore, both rely on data to determine which areas of production need improvement in efficiency and to measure the success of improvements. Finally, as a result of implementing Lean and Six Sigma, efficiency typically improves and variation decreases. Efficiency and reduction in variation go hand-in-hand, with improvement in one resulting in an improvement in the other. Lean and Six Sigma have many similarities but are different processes and were developed for different purposes. The first difference between the two methods is problem identification. While Lean focuses the problem of inefficiency around the eight wastes, Six Sigma focuses on identifying sources of variation to reduce inefficiency. In addition, Lean and Six Sigma use different tools. While Lean uses more data visualization tools, Six Sigma uses more numerical and analytical-focused tools.Salah, S., Rahim, A. and Carretero, J. (2010), \\"The integration of Six Sigma and lean management\\", International Journal of Lean Six Sigma, Vol. 1 No. 3, pp. 249-274. https://doi.org/10.1108/20401461011075035 The similarities between Lean and Six Sigma allow for simultaneous functionality on the same product or process, while their differences allow the benefit of having a vast amount of analytical tools at the one's disposal.  Benefits of Lean Six Sigma  Lean Six Sigma provides various benefits for organizations. It not only saves money, but also changes the attitude of employees and the functionality of the organization. Through implementation of Lean Six Sigma, organizations can expect the following beneficial outcomes: * Increase in Profit: As a result of eliminating waste and improving the quality of production, Lean Six Sigma reduces costs for organizations and increases profitability. General Electric reportedly experienced a profit-cost savings exceeding $2 billion. * Standardized and Simplified Processes: With the help of value stream mapping, Lean Six Sigma eliminates wastes in processes and unnecessary steps to stream- line production. The processes are simplified so that they are easier to follow and less likely to lead to error. The simplified processes will also reduce time, leading to a decrease in overhead costs. * Decrease in error: With the simplification in processes steps and a detailed investigation into the main causes of error and waste in the organization, Lean Six Sigma drastically reduces errors such as defects and miscalculations. * Employee Performance/Development: Lean Six Sigma stresses the importance of the ideas and observances of individual employees to the overall success of an organization. With Lean Six Sigma, the feeling of self-importance and significance increases among employees and leads to an increase in motivation and better job performance. * Value to Customer: Lean Six Sigma allows companies to improve their processes and the quality of their products. In turn, they are able to produce more products at a cheaper price with less error. Customer satisfaction will increase, which will then lead to an increase in customer loyalty.  Tools for Lean and Six Sigma  Lean: Kaizen (Continuous Improvement), Value Stream Mapping, 5S System, Kanban, Mistake proofing (Poka-yoke), Productive Maintenance, Set Up Time Reduction, Reduce Lot Sizes, Line Balancing, Schedule Leveling, Standardized work, and Visual Management. Six Sigma: Recognize, Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control, Standardize, and Integrate.

It stars d√©butantes Shiv Panditt and Manasi Parekh in lead roles along with Santhanam and Suhasini Raju in pivotal roles. The film which began in May 2008, opened after production delays on 27 April 2012 to positive reviews. Plot The film begins with a trio of friends in college (Malar, Mona, Gayathri). Mona falls in love with Karthik (Shiv Panditt) despite the advice of Malar (Manasi Parekh Gohil) who suspects Karthik to be a complete flirt. One day, while on a date, Mona mentions to Karthik, Malar's views about him and this gets Karthik to start disliking Malar for interfering in his love life. When Karthik calls Mona, Malar picks the call up accidentally and they get into an argument with Karthik venting out his anger towards her interfering in his love life. Shortly later, he breaks up with Mona. Gayathri believing Mona was a wrong choice in Karthik's life begins to date Karthik, while Malar is firmly against it. The relationship ends the same way as his relationship with Mona. A year or two later both Karthik and Malar work at the same software company on different floors in the same building. One day, while trying to call his friend on Malar's floor, he accidentally calls Malar and the two realize their identities and presence in the building and the age-old feud resumes. Over lunch, both Malar's friend (Vicky) and his own friend (Suja) advise him to sort it with Malar. Vicky questions why Karthik would fight with such a beautiful woman as Malar. Karthik not knowing what Malar looks like decides to take a look at her. When he sees Malar he falls in love at first sight, he then tries to reconcile with Malar, but Malar is not willing to forgive a flirt like Karthik. Karthik becomes desperate and begins to follow Malar and in a chance meeting orchestrated by Karthik he introduces himself as a sweet and kind person by the name of 'Sundar'. Malar who has never met Karthik face to face, believes his false identity and begins to open up to Sundar. They start to get to know each other and meet often, when one day Suja who works with Malar finds out about his game. Suja gives Karthik the ultimatum to reveal his true identity, once Malar declares her love for Sundar. Karthik tries to salvage his relationship with hilarious consequences. But, all said and done, how Karthik reveals to Malar about his true identity and her acceptance or rejection forms the crux of the story. Vicky (Santhanam) provides comic relief to the story. Cast *Shiv Panditt as Karthik/Sundar *Manasi Parekh as Karunai Malar *Santhanam as Vicky *Suhasini Raju as Suja *Maya as Mona *Vibha Natarajan as Gayathri *Lakshmi Ramakrishnan as Karthik's mother *Boys Rajan as Malar's father Production Andrew Louis met Ravichandran and narrated the script of Leelai and two months later he agreed to produce the film. The producer subsequently moved the film on to the hands of his brother, Ramesh Babu, under the subsidiary company 'R Films', which was also making Ravi Varman's Moscowin Kavery at the time. The director selected North Indian actor Shiv Panditt in the lead role after seeing him an advertisement for a mobile phone company, Airtel. After Panditt was signed on, he practised his Tamil dialogues by reading them repeatedly and understanding the emotions and punches. He also watched a lot of Tamil films to get attuned to the culture. The female lead in the film is played by Manasi Parekh who has been part of popular shows on Television such as Star One‚Äôs India Calling and Star Plus's Gulaal. A major portion of the film was shot in the popular software company 'HCL' (Chennai Office). The song \\"Oru Killi\\" was shot at the Maheshwar Fort in Madhya Pradesh, while the other songs were shot in Goa and Puducherry respectively. The film ran into a legal battle over its title Leelai with another film claiming it as their own. Ravichandran eventually won the case, forcing the other film to change its title from Leelai to Naan Aval Adhu. The film had been ready for release since 2010, with Shiv Panditt in between making his d√©but in Hindi films with Shaitan. The failure of Ramesh Babu's other production Moscowin Kavery starring Rahul Ravindran and Samantha, also became a factor behind the delay. After two years of remaining complete but unreleased, the film was given a fresh lease of life after producer Ravichandran signed a deal to distribute Billa II, dubbed in trade circles as the \\"hottest film of the year\\", and thus theatres have shown their support for his brother by giving Leelai a big release. Furthermore, after the success of Oru Kal Oru Kannadi, actor Santhanam's popularity heightened with several of his films being released around the same period such as Vinayaga to capitalize on his market reach. Critical reception Leelai opened on 27 April 2012 alongside another Tamil film Aathi Narayana, and won predominantly positive reviews. Critics from Sify.com gave the film a positive review citing that \\"Leelai is an enjoyable romantic ride, laced with peppy music and good fun\\" adding that \\"the director has worked out the romantic situations and spun it around to make it entertaining\\". Behindwoods.com mentioned that Leelai is \\"a light hearted simple romantic tale...a decent family flick for the holiday season\\". Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com noted that \\"it's a feel-good, simple, urban romance that has its funny moments and is worth a watch\\", and added that \\"Shiv Panditt and Manasi Parekh bring the urban Chennaiite alive - they are expressive, emote well, and nowhere do their lines sound jarring\\". Vivek Ramz of in.com rated the film 3/5 and noted that \\"Leelai is a watchable rom-com\\" and added \\"If you are game for urban romance, then Leelai is worth a watch for its simple yet realistic treatment with fun\\". Another critic gave the film three stars out of five, concluding \\"Leelai may have its drawbacks, yet it is feel-good, fun and engaging. Job well done Andrew Louis\\". Rohit Ramachandran of Nowrunning.com rated it 2.5/5 stating that \\"For the most part, Andrew Louis's Leelai is earnest in its narration and interested in its characters\\". Release Despite positive reviews from the critics, the film managed to do average business at the box office mainly due to a complete lack of publicity and predominantly having new faces in the cast. The film also saw a delayed release due to production issues.  Soundtrack  The music is composed by debutant Satish Chakravarthy, a classmate of the director, Andrew Vasanth Louis. Satish also wrote the lyrics for two of the songs. The soundtrack released on 24 August 2009, whilst the music composer later stated that he has also worked on a song for the theatrical trailer.

It was formed as a result of a 1929 merger of four companies: the American Seeding Machine Company of Richmond, Indiana; Oliver Chilled Plow Works of South Bend, Indiana; Hart-Parr Tractor Company of Charles City, Iowa; and Nichols and Shepard Company of Battle Creek, Michigan On November 1, 1960, the White Motor Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio, purchased the Oliver Farm Equipment Company. Merger Four companies joined forces on April 1, 1929. The Oliver Chilled Plow Company dated from 1855. Hart-Parr Tractor Company began operations in 1897, and the American Seeding Machine Company, dated back to 1848. Nichols and Shepard Company likewise began operations in 1848. By 1929, each of these companies had essentially outgrown its usefulness to the industry. For most of them, the market had some time earlier reached a saturation point. In some instances, their machines were badly dated and rapidly approaching obsolescence. For each of these companies to have attempted further activity on solo basis would almost have certainly been disastrous. By uniting their various and somewhat diverse product lines into a single company, Oliver Farm Equipment instantly became a virtual full-line manufacturer. Merged companies = American Seeding Machine Company = \\"Oliver Superior\\" grain and fertilizer drill The American Seeding Machine Company was organized in 1903 from the a merger of seven different manufacturers of grain drills, corn planters and other \\"seeding machines.\\" The leading corporate component among the seven merged companies was the Superior Drill Company of Springfield, Ohio. Accordingly, the American Seeding Machine Company established its corporate headquarters at Springfield in the facilities formerly operated by the Superior Drill Company. Other companies which formed the 1903 merger include P. P. Mast and Company (est. 1856), Hoosier Drill Company (est. 1857), the Empire Drill Company, and Bickford & Huffman. The Superior Drill Company name lived on for many years following the merger that created Oliver, in the \\"Oliver Superior\\" line of seeding drills and related equipment. = Oliver Chilled Plow Works = Oliver Chilled Plow James Oliver started the Oliver Chilled Plow Works in 1853. In Mishawaka, Indiana in 1836 where he worked in a foundry. Later he bought into an already existing small foundry in South Bend, Ind.. Plows with cast iron bottoms and moldboards had been successfully used by farmers and planters in the eastern states of the United States since the time of Thomas Jefferson. However, in the sticky soils of North Dakota and various other portions of the Midwest, the cast iron plows would not \\"scour\\"; that is, the sticky soil would cling to the plow, disrupting the flow of soil over the plow's surface, making plowing impossible. Thus, when settlement of North America moved over the Allegheny Mountains into the Midwest, there was a real need for a new plow that would scour in the soils of the Midwest. To allow a cast iron bottom to scour in sticky soil, various methods of heat treating for creating a hardened surface on the metal plow bottom had been attempted. All of these processes failed because the hard surface created was very thin and would soon wear through to the soft iron under the heat-treated surface. James Oliver developed his sand casting process to include rapid chilling of the molten iron near the outside surface of the casting, which resulted in a bottom that had a thick hardened surface with far greater wearability than competing plow bottoms. The entrance to the Oliver Chilled Plow Works in South Bend, Indiana, c. 1880. Another problem common to cast iron plow bottoms was the lack of soundness and uniformity in the metal's molecular structure, which meant that some cast iron bottoms would have soft spots in the hardened surface, reducing the wearability of the plow bottom. Improvements made by James Oliver to his casting process overcame this problem also. Consequently, on June 30, 1857, James Oliver obtained his first patent from the United States government for his chilled plow sharesUnited States Patent Office, Letters Patent No. 17694, \\"Improvement in Chilling Plowshares,\\" June 30, 1857, to James Oliver and Harvey Little. and in February 1869, he obtained another patent for his process. What Oliver accomplished by this invention is sometimes referred to as chill hardening, or simply chilling. The purpose of chilling, whether it be a plowpoint or a wheel for a railroad car, is to produce an extremely hard and durable exterior of the object. This is done by including \\"chills\\", pieces of metal, into the sand mold, such that when the molten iron is poured into the mould, the portion next to the chill cools rapidly, hardening in a way akin to quenching. This chilled area forms the exterior of the plowpoint. This metal cools more quickly than the metal which forms the other portion of the plowshare, and effectively becomes case hardened. Also, the vapors which arise as the molten metal comes in contract with the mould are expelled through a spout. Had these vapors been trapped in the mould, they would have caused impurities and would have weakened the plowpoint at the place where it should have been the hardest. To harden the plowpoints, Oliver arranged his moulding apparatus in such manner that the surface of the chill was in a position so that the melted metal first came into contact with the chill at the edge of the plowshare. This insured a hard plow cutting point.Meikle, Douglas Laing, \\"James Oliver and the Oliver Chilled Plow Works.\\" unpublished thesis, June, 1958. To learn more about the Oliver company visit Oliver Chilled Plow Works online history An artist's conception drawing of an aerial view of the Oliver Chilled Plow Works, South Bend, Indiana, c.1900. Thus, James Oliver's chilled plow bottom became a practical success and on July 22, 1868, the Oliver's business was incorporated as the South Bend Iron Works. In 1871, the company sold 1,500 plows per year. By 1874 this figure had increased to 17,000 plows a year. At the time of death of James Oliver in 1908, the company had again changed names to the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. and their factory site in South Bend, Indiana covered with 25 of those acres under roof. In January 1885, the plant's mostly Polish workers went on strike in protest of cuts to wages and hours in response to a glut of stock. Veterans of the Civil War with fixed bayonets finally ejected the strikers from the premises. The ownership considered leaving South Bend in the wake of the destruction of parts of the plant, with newspapers stating that they feared \\"the Socialistic influences operating among the foreign elements at South Bend...probably emanating from Chicago.\\" Many workers employed in plow factories died from grindstone consumption. This is the result of the dust from emery wheels and grindstone in the grinding and polishing rooms. ‚ÄúIn South Bend, the ‚Äògrinder‚Äô is either a Pole or a Belgian; so when he dies, society knows nothing about it.‚Äù Upon the death of his father in 1908, Joseph D. Oliver, the only son of James and Susan (Doty) Oliver took over the management of the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. By 1910, the company was manufacturing a wide variety of farm tillage implements in addition to the chilled plow. Production had reached the point that, in 1910, the company purchased over 40,000 tons of pig iron alone. = Hart-Parr Gasoline Engine Company = Hart-Parr nameplate Hart-Parr 30-60 \\"Old Reliable\\" Charles Walter Hart was born at Charles City, Iowa in 1872. At the age of twenty, he transferred from Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts, to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. It was here that he met Charles H. Parr, and the two young men quickly became friends. Together they worked on their Special Honours Thesis and from that thesis they built three working internal combustion engines right there on the campus at Madison. Following their graduation from the University of Wisconsin in 1897, Hart and Parr gathered $3000 in capital and formed the Hart-Parr Gasoline Engine Company. Towards the end of 1899, Charles Hart paid a visit to his parents in Charles City, Iowa. He complained to his father that development funds could not be found for his tractor project. \\"There's money around here that might be interested,\\" replied the elder Hart, admitting for the first time that his son's ambition was not folly. They then found another investor in Charles D. Ellis, a local attorney, who invested $50,000 in additional capital. In 1900, as the engine business expanded, Hart and Parr decided to move their company from Madison to Charles City. Hart-Parr Company was organized on June 12, 1901 at Charles City, Iowa. Ground was broken for the new factory on July 5 that year. By the following December, the Hart-Parr Company was now ready to do business, and had an authorized capitalization of $100,000.00. Hart-Parr number 1 was completed in 1902. Customers did not immediately beat the proverbial path. However, Hart-Parr was able to field one salesman to run demonstrations at county fairs and other events. Hart was patient. \\"We can't force it,\\" he said. \\"We have to let it simmer into the market.\\" Little by little, the Hart-Parrs began to gather defenders. Some of the first tractors delivered were gaining a reputation of usefulness that far surpassed that of the steamers. W.H. Williams, Sales Manager in 1907, decided the words \\"traction engine\\" were vague and too long to be used in press releases, so he coined the word \\"Tractor\\", a combination of the words \\"traction\\" and \\"power\\", instead. For this reason, and because the Charles City plant was the first to be continuously and exclusively used for tractor production, Hart-Parr often used the slogan \\"Founders of the Tractor Industry\\" in their advertising. = Nichols and Shepard Company = In 1848, John Nichols opened a blacksmith shop in Battle Creek, Michigan. In the blacksmith shop, John Nichols began making various farm tools for local farmers. He built his first thresher/separator in 1852. The business was successful from the start, so successful that some time in the 1850s he took on a partner by the name of David Shepard. Together they formed a partnership known as Nichols, Shepard and Company which manufactured farm machinery, steam engines and mill machinery. The first thresher/separator of small grains (largely wheat and oats) was developed in about 1831 by the Pitts brothers‚ÄîHiram and John Pitts of Buffalo, New York. However, this early thresher, called the \\"ground hog,\\" was quite unlike the conventional thresher/separators that developed since that time. For instance, the ground hog's separating unit was largely a slatted apron which pulled the grain across a screen. John Nichols and David Shepard realized that the apron style separator was not a technology that was going to work. Consequently, in 1857, the Nichols and Shepard Company developed the first \\"vibrator\\" separating unit for the small grain thresher. This vibrator-style of separator soon became universally adopted by all other thresher/separator manufacturers. The Nichols and Shepard Company received a patent from the United States government for their \\"Vibrator\\" grain separator on January 7, 1862. The company also obtained a number of other patents for other advances in the thresher/separator technology, for original improvements in steam engine traction technology. During the 1920s, the Nichols and Shepard Company developed a successfully functioning corn picker. Following the acquisition of the Nichols and Shepard Company by the Oliver company. This corn picker became the direct ancestor of the famous Oliver cornpicker. Later acquisitions For the first couple of years, the tractors carried the Oliver-Hart-Parr designation, but the Hart-Parr essence soon disappeared, just as an entirely new line of purely Oliver tractors made their appearance. = McKenzie Manufacturing Company = Following the 1929 merger of the four companies into the Oliver Farm Equipment Company, several other corporate acquisitions were made by the new company over a period of years. The first of these post-merger acquisitions occurred a mere year later, in 1930, when the Oliver Farm Equipment Company purchased the McKenzie Manufacturing Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The McKenzie Manufacturing Company was a leading maker of potato planting and potato harvesting equipment. Acquisition of the McKenzie Company broadened the line of farm equipment offered by Oliver to include potato diggers which were then sold under the \\"Oliver\\" name. However, following the 1930 merger production of the \\"Oliver\\" potato diggers moved out of La Crosse, Wisconsin to Chicago, Illinois. = Ann Arbor Agricultural Machine Company = In 1943, the Oliver Farm Equipment Company purchased the Ann Arbor Agricultural Machine Company of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1885, the Ann Arbor Agricultural Machine Company became the leading manufacturer of \\"hay presses\\" or stationary balers. =Cleveland Tractor Company= The Cleveland Tractor Company became a part of the Oliver family in 1944. At the October 3, 1944 stockholders meeting, with approval of the stockholders, the corporate name was changed to \\"The Oliver Corporation\\". Crawler tractor production ended at Charles City in 1965. = A.B. Farquhar Company = In 1952 the A.B. Farquhar Company was sold to the Oliver Corporation. Founded in York, Pennsylvania, in the 1850s as W.W. Dingee & Co, in 1861 young businessman Arthur Briggs Farquhar bought the business and enlarged it during the Civil War as the Pennsylvania Agricultural Works. In 1889, the A. B. Farquhar Company began building threshing machines and other farm machinery. Later, the company started the production of cultivators for farm use (especially potato harvesting equipment). Farquhar produced some steam engines early then moved onto the production of traction engines.  Product development  =Crawlers= Three Oliver-built crawler-type tractors on display at Antique Powerland, in Oregon In 1944 Oliver acquired the Cleveland Tractor Company (Cletrac). They continued production of the existing Cletrac HG model until 1951. The agricultural Cletrac HG gradually evolved into the more industrial Oliver OC-3 which was produced from 1951 through 1957. In 1956 Oliver announced the slightly larger OC-4 with a four-cylinder Hercules IXB3 engine. In late 1957 (diesel) and early 1958 (gas) OC-4's came equipped with 3 cylinder Hercules 130 engines. Most noticeable was the change to a 'beefier' more industrial front grill. In 1962 at the new Charles City, Iowa crawler production line, the last incarnation of the OC-4 was produced. It was a sturdier industrial model named the Series B. They were powered with the same 3 cylinder Hercules GO-130 and DD-130 engines of the mid-series models. The OC-4 product line was discontinued in 1965. Oliver also produced larger crawlers: the OC-6 from 1953 to 1960; the OC-9 from 1959 to 1965; the OC-12 from 1954 to 1961; and the OC-15 and the large OC-18. All crawler production was halted in 1965. =Tractors= 1956 Oliver Super 55 Diesel In 1948, Oliver was ready with an entirely new line of tractors. These were built over the successes of the past, including the Oliver 60, 70, and 80 tractors. The latter was even built with a diesel engine, although very few were sold. However, in the 1950s, Oliver was an industry leader through their promotion of diesel power. Oliver led the industry in the sale of diesel tractors for several years. The Oliver 66, 77 and 88 tractors of the 1948 to 1954 period, marked an entirely new series of Fleetline models. The 77 and 88 could be bought with either gasoline or diesel engines. During 1954, the company upgraded these tractors with the new \\"Super\\" series models, and added the Oliver Super 55. It was the company's first compact utility tractor. In 1958, Oliver began marketing the new 660, 770, 880, 990, and other new models. = Non-agricultural products = During the war years of the 1940s Oliver Corporation expanded rapidly into non-agricultural production, most notably in the defense sector. By 1947, the Oliver Corporation employed 9,000 with 37% of Oliver's production for defense contracts. Product lines included graders, forklifts, road rollers, crawlers, and power units incorporated into products by other companies. Oliver also built airplane fuselages for Boeing RB-47E Reconnaissance planes at a Battle Creek, Michigan aviation division set up exclusively for defense contracts. The Charles City, Iowa plant assembled transmissions for the 25-ton crane carriers and built and assembled 106 mm recoilless rifle gun mounts for the Army. The Cleveland, Ohio plant built the MG-1 crawler for the Army as well as tank parts. The Gilroy, California plant produced the 76 mm guns for the Walker Bulldog tank. The Shelbyville, Ohio plant built 155 mm Howitzer gun parts. Acquisition by White Motor Corporation =Oliver Corporation= White Motor Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio had a long history of truck manufacturing. On November 1, 1960, White Motor acquired Oliver, changed the name to Oliver Corporation, and made it a wholly owned, separately operating subsidiary of the White Motor Corporation. =Further mergers, acquisitions, and branding= White also acquired Cockshutt Farm Equipment of Canada in February 1962, and it was made a subsidiary of Oliver Corporation. Cockshutt had also previously, in 1928, marketed tractors made by Hart-Parr, and again from 1934 through the late 1940s it marketed tractors made by Oliver, only changing the paint color to red, and changing the name tags to Cockshutt. Minneapolis-Moline became a wholly owned subsidiary of White Motor Corporation in 1963. The Cockshutt and Minneapolis-Moline lines were blended into that of Oliver until there was virtually no difference between them. In 1960, the new four-digit tractor models appeared. Among them were the 1600, 1800 and 1900 models. In 1969 White Motor Corporation formed White Farm Equipment Company, almost immediately after a transitional period when virtually identical tractors and combines were marketed under different trade names. A few models were sold as Oliver, Minneapolis, or Cockshutt, the major difference being the paint colour. As the transaction continued, the White name was more and more applied to the tractor line, with the Oliver 2255, also known as the White 2255, being the last purely \\"Oliver\\" tractor. With the introduction of the White 4-150 Field Boss in 1974, the White name would be used, henceforth to the exclusion of all others. White Motor Corporation shut down the original Oliver Chilled Plow Works factory (factory no. 1) in 1985. The Oliver buildings remained vacant until 2002 when most were demolished to make way for an industrial park. The Oliver powerhouse is now restored and occupied by Rose Brick & Material. FIAT tractors were marketed under the Oliver name in the mid 1970s, such as the Oliver 1465 tractor. Oliver tractors with FIAT gages were available in 1970. Today White is an AGCO brand. AGCO was formed in 1990 by former Deutz-Allis executives. The executives took over Deutz-Allis and then purchased the White tractor line in 1991. The White tractor line was produced by AGCO from 1991 through 2001 when the White line was merged with AGCO-Allis to create the AGCO brand. The White name continues on under AGCO with the White Planter division. Legacy More information about Oliver Tractors can be found in Oliver Heritage Magazine.

Early life Kang was born to a Hakka fishing family in the village of Luotangwan () Wan'an County, Jiangxi Province. In order to make ends meet, her parents sold five daughters in succession to other families as brides. Kang was given away when she was 40 days old to a tenant farmer called Luo Qigui (). Her future husband had not yet been born at this point and, when the Luo family finally had their child, it was a girl. This child died and Kang was cared for by the Luo family as a daughter; living in a peasant family, Kang was the main source of labour for her adopted parents. Revolution In 1924, the Wan'an County Communist member arrived in Kang's village as part of the Northern Expedition and set up various activities to promote revolution, including plays and a night school. The member also promulgated concepts of gender equality and freedom in marriage. At approximately age 14, Kang became a member of the Red Army. She would later promulgate the idea that feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism were the main enemies of the female labourer. She was elected permanent secretary of the Luotangwan Village Women's Association () and was the first local woman to cut her hair short. From this point onwards, Kang took every opportunity to pursue studies that her background had denied her as a child. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek opposed the Communists and there was violent conflict. Nearly 200 people in Wan'an were killed and, to temper Kang's revolutionary tendencies, her adoptive parents attempted to arrange a marriage for her. Kang left home in September 1928 and joined a guerilla band seeking shelter with the Red Army Agnes Smedley's biography of Zhu describes her as follows: ‚Ä≥Up from the Wanan district to the west came a delegation of Peasant Partisans, and among them was the woman leader Kang. She carried a rifle as if it were a part of her and, like the men, she walked with lithe decision and certainty. A woman in her middle twenties, of medium height and shingled hair, she wore the usual clean blue jacket and long loose trousers of the peasant woman. Her face was pock-marked and men said that because of this she was not beautiful. But they admitted that her large black eyes were beautiful and shone with the fire of conviction, and when she smiled, two rows of white teeth gleamed between beautiful red lips. Illiterate she was indeed, for she had been the slave of a rich landlord who had bought her in childhood and used her a field laborer. Though she could recognise but a few written characters, still she was very intelligent so that men said of her: ‚Ä≥'Her thoughts are as clear and direct as bullets fired from a machine-gun.'‚Ä≥Smedley, Agnes. The Great Road: The Life and Times of Chu Teh. Monthly Review Press 1956. Page 137 Kang married Zhu De on 30 December 1930. In 1932, she was made leader of a newly created branch of women volunteers, who were trained in the Red Army School. =Long March= She became a women's leader in the Red Army and was one of a small number of women who were on the Long March.Smedley, The Great Road, pages 272 In the division of the Fourth Red Army, Kang was sent with Zhu De and Zhang Guotao. In October 1935, Kang fell ill after Zhang Guotao's disastrous attempt to establish a communist base in Sichuan. Zhang reportedly kept Kang separated from her husband and attempted to leave her behind when the Fourth Red army moved to Shaanxi, but Zhu managed to bring a doctor and ensured Kang was carried on a stretcher through the Gold Mountains. =Yan'an= Kang was interviewed by the American journalist Helen Foster Snow during her stay in Yan'an. She commented on the military situation, telling Foster Snow that the army's numbers were a problem, but the issue of weaponry was urgent. Kang maintained contact with Foster Snow after this, even giving a speech at a 1991 conference congratulating her on being made Friendship Ambassador to China. People's Republic of China Kang served as vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and president of Soong Ching- ling Foundation. Cultural Revolution During the Cultural Revolution, Kang was under house arrest. She was later rehabilitated. Rehabilitation After the fall of the Gang of Four, Kang was instated as the head of the All-China Women's Federation and is credited with centralising the organisation's bureaucracy. She was a member of the 11th and 12th Central Committees of the Communist Party of China (1977-1987). Women's Rights Kang's ideology in the fight for women's liberation is embodied in the slogan 'Seek liberation in war, seek equality in production' (). 'Liberation in war' referred to women joining the revolutionary struggle to attain equality, while 'equality in production' meant that women should attain powers equal to those granted to men. This included the right to labour, which Kang considered fundamental to improving women's economic position. Kang argued 'equality' should also be expanded to politics, culture, science, and technology. At the first meeting of the China Women's Committee in 1949, Kang made a speech advocating the liberation of women's labour and economic development.

An elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, he currently also serves as IOM Senior Scholar, as well as Executive Director of its Roundtable on Value & Science- Driven Health Care. Early years Born in Columbia, Missouri, United States in 1944, McGinnis moved to California in 1949 when his father was sent by his employer, a manufacturer of power line equipment, to help open a west coast office in San Francisco. He attended public schools for K-12 in San Mateo, but from ages 9 to 17, his summers were spent back in Missouri, working on his maternal grandfather's corn, wheat and soy bean farm in central Missouri. Active in student government from an early age, he continued those interests as a pre-med undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley, serving as the president of his graduating class. Education and professional training During his undergraduate years at U.C. Berkeley, he created the Cal in the Capital internship program, which sends Berkeley students to Washington, DC, every summer to work in Congress, federal agencies, think tanks, and voluntary organizations. This competitive program still thrives 50 years later, sending over 75 students to DC every summer. McGinnis graduated from Berkeley in 1966 with a BA in political science (political theory), and then attended UCLA, receiving both an MA in political science (international relations) and an MD in 1971. He later went on to study public policy at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, receiving an MPP in 1977. He was class commencement speaker for all three of his university graduating classes: Berkeley, UCLA Medical, and the Kennedy School at Harvard. After an internship in internal medicine at the Boston City Hospital, McGinnis completed a residency in preventive medicine while serving in the U.S. Public Health Service in 1972 as an international medical officer where he also learned to fly hot air balloons. International contributions As part of his graduate studies in international relations, McGinnis spent time in residency at the World Health Organization offices in Lausanne and Geneva, exploring the diplomatic dynamics at the formation of the organization and the role it played in using its practical humanitarian mission to forge collaborative activities among often competing nations. When the time came for McGinnis to serve his military obligation, he joined the U.S. Public Health Service in 1972 as an international medical officer, serving as a coordinator for U.S.-Eastern European health programs. In 1974, he was recruited by DA Henderson to join the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication program in India. Working initially as a field epidemiologist tracking and containing reported cases, McGinnis assumed responsibility as WHO's State Coordinator for the eradication program in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, and oversaw the completion of the eradication effort and the implementation of the surveillance system for the maintenance phase of the program. Returning to the United States after the end of smallpox, McGinnis shifted his focus for the next two decades to domestic health policy (see below), but from 1995 to 1996, again at the request of the World Health Organization, he became chair of the World Bank/European Commission Sectoral Task Force on Health and Human Services in Bosnia. This was one of several task forces established to manage support for postwar reconstruction of the basic infrastructure, economic, and human service capabilities in the war-torn region. Under McGinnis‚Äô leadership, the Task Force developed the first bilateral agreement outside of the Dayton Accords, forging consensus on primary care reconstruction priorities by the health ministries of both the Republica Srpska and Bosnia & Herzegovina. Health determinants The contribution for which McGinnis is best personally known is improving understanding and insights into the basic determinants of health. His 1993 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association, ‚ÄúActual Causes of Death‚Äù co-authored with William Foege, focused attention on the root causes of the nation's leading killers and underscored the preventability of many of the nation's leading health threats. Building on a growing evidence base linking lifestyle, environment, and behavior to health, the McGinnis and Foege article pointed out that the conditions holding leading positions on mortality tables‚Äîe.g. heart disease, cancer, stroke, injury, diabetes‚Äîwere in fact caused substantially by factors such as tobacco, diet and activity patterns, alcohol, toxic agents, and other potentially controllable sources. They identified nine leading preventable root causes of death, and calculated that the behavior-related factors on the list alone accounted for about 40% of deaths in the United States. McGinnis extended his work to reframe the notion of health, from a view that is disease-centric to one that captures more broadly the full range of factors that lead to disease and early death‚Äîor to good health. Drawing from the work on actual causes, as well as a developing evidence base on the influence of stress, class distinctions, socio-economic status, and genetics, he organized his assessment around the perspective that health is fundamentally shaped by determinants that fall within five domains: genetic predispositions, social circumstances, physical environments, behavioral choices, and medical care. Underscoring that the most important dynamics occur at the intersections of the determinant domains, his 2002 paper in Health Affairs, ‚ÄúThe Case for More Active Policy Attention to Health Promotion‚Äù, co-authored with Pamela Russo and James Knickman, summarized quantitative assessments of the relative contributions of each of these five domains to the overall burden of early death in the population. As noted in the paper's title, the most notable policy asynchrony they pointed out was that, while only 10 to 15% of premature deaths could be avoided through improvements in health care, 95% of aggregate national spending on health goes to medical care services. The Healthy People program In 1977, McGinnis was a Fellow at Harvard Medical School's Center for Community Health and Medical Care when he accepted an offer from the newly appointed Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano to return to Washington to work in the Carter Administration. He was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Department of Health and Human Services), and served through four Administrations‚ÄîPresidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and William J. Clinton‚Äîwhile also serving as Assistant Surgeon General and Director of the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention. During this period, McGinnis chaired the Secretary's Task Force on Smoking and Health, which resulted in Secretary Califano's 1974 decision to elevate the federal leadership profile on tobacco control; led the development of Healthy People, the nation's prevention agenda; developed, with USDA, the first Dietary Guidelines for Americans; and created the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 1984 to develop an ongoing systematic and comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of clinical preventive services, thereby helping to pioneer the broader advance of evidence-based medicine. Healthy People is perhaps the most widely known of McGinnis‚Äô policy contributions. Begun when he was serving as Chair of the Secretary's Task Force on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion for HEW Secretary Joseph Califano and Surgeon General Julius Richmond in 1978, it started as an effort to develop a Surgeon General's report to serve as a U.S. answer to A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, a groundbreaking report released in 1974 by Canadian Minister of Health Marc Lalonde. McGinnis felt the U.S. report could go beyond simply marshaling the scientific evidence underpinning the power of prevention, to establish quantifiable, evidence-based goals for improving the health of Americans through preventive interventions. This strategy reflected McGinnis' experience in India with the successful eradication of smallpox, which used quantified targets to drive focus and the deployment of resources. Published in 1979, Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention included the first-ever measurable, decade-long goals for reducing death rates for Americans by 1990 at each of the major life stages: reducing infant mortality by 35%, childhood mortality by 20%, adolescent and young adult mortality by 20%, and adult mortality by 25%. For older adults, the goal was to reduce the average number of sick days by 20% over the decade. McGinnis also launched a parallel effort involving each of the agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service (National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration, Indian Health Service, Health Resources and Services Administration, and Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration), in cooperative work with non-governmental experts from around the country to develop measurable 1990 objectives in 15 priority areas within the three prevention domains: health promotion, health protection, and clinical preventive services. These objectives targeted improvements on issues such as tobacco use, environmental quality, and high blood pressure control, child passenger restraints, occupational health, and environmental quality deemed necessary to achieve the national goals. The objectives were released in 1980 in Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation. A broad range of stakeholders rallied around the newly minted national prevention agenda, including through the Healthy People Consortium, which brought states, major cities, and voluntary national organizations together to adopt and tailor these national objectives to their particular needs and priorities. When the 1990 results came in, progress toward better health was on or close to the stated goals in each case: a 35% reduction in infant mortality, a 25% reduction in child deaths, a 12% reduction for adolescent and young adult deaths, a 25% lower adult death rate, and 17% fewer days of disability for older adults. The Healthy People process continues today, building on national goals and objectives over more than three decades through Healthy People 2000, Healthy People 2010, and the current objectives, Healthy People 2020. A number of other countries have since developed similar efforts, and related work in the U.S. led to the development of a high priority set of national Leading Health Indicators, the pilot work group for which was chaired by McGinnis as part of the Healthy People 2010 process. Other U.S. policy initiatives Other programs and policies launched by McGinnis include: the first HHS/USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, now in its seventh edition; the first Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health (1988); and the work of the Public Health Functions Steering Committee to develop the 10 Essential Services of Public Health. The latter initiative was an outgrowth of the town hall meetings he co-hosted in 1994 with the health commissioners in each of the 50 state capitals for public discussions on the importance of public health as a component of health reform. McGinnis also initiated: the National Coordinating Committee on Worksite Health Promotion (1979‚Äì1987) to catalyze employer commitment to healthier workforces, the National Coordinating Committee on School Health (co-chaired by HHS, the Department of Education and USDA), and the Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, which developed guidelines for the conduct of economic analyses of the returns to health investments. From 1999 to 2005, McGinnis served as Senior Vice President and founding Director of the Health Group, and as Counselor to the President of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). At RWJF, his charge was to build the Foundation's contribution to the development of national leadership and capacity for a stronger focus on population health. Hallmarks of this work include the launch of the RWJF Active Living family of programs, the Health & Society Scholars Program, and the Young Epidemiology Scholars Program. Along with RWJF's flagship work in tobacco control, The Active Living Programs represented the first major national health promotion initiative focused on design, engineering, and policy strategies to re- engineer physical activity back into peoples‚Äô living and working environments. The RWJF Health & Society Scholars Program was created to train a generation of extraordinary interdisciplinary scientific and policy experts to lead understanding and action at the intersections of the domains determining health prospects‚Äîgenetics, social circumstances, physical environments, behavioral choices, and medical care. The RWJF Young Epidemiology Scholars Program was a competitive regional and national program to engage high school students in innovative project work in epidemiology‚Äîthe basic science of public health, modeled on the prizes established by the Westinghouse and Intel corporations to encourage student interest and initiative in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. The IOM Learning Health System Initiative Since 2005, McGinnis has served as IOM senior scholar and executive director of the Roundtable on Value & Science-Driven Health Care. He founded and stewards the IOM's initiative to accelerate the evolution of a continuously learning health system, described in the Roundtable‚Äôs Charter as one ‚Äúin which science, informatics, incentives, and culture are aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded in the delivery process and new knowledge captured as an integral by-product of the delivery experience.‚Äù Motivated by rapid changes in the complexity and costs of care, shortfalls in its performance, and newly-emerging digitally-based tools to address these challenges, the initiative focuses both on improving awareness of the possible and on stimulating activities to capture it. The work to improve understanding is being undertaken through the Roundtable's Learning Health System Series of publications exploring in detail the prospects and strategies in areas ranging from research and the clinical data utility to shared decision-making and care culture. On the action front, the Roundtable has developed the concept of Innovation Collaboratives, in which the good offices of The National Academies serve to steward cooperative projects requiring a trusted scientific forum to accelerate progress aimed at transformational change in the value, science, and culture of health and health care. Currently, the Roundtable steward about two dozen projects across six collaboratives: Best Practices (health professions societies), Clinical Effectiveness Research (clinical research organizations), Evidence Communication (marketing community), Digital Learning (IT community), Systems Approaches (operations engineers), and Value Incentives (payers and employers). Voluntary service and recognitions McGinnis has served on various national committees and boards, including the National Academies IOM Committee on Children's Food Marketing (chair), the NIH State-of-the-Science Conference on Multivitamins in Chronic Disease Prevention (chair), and the Health Professionals Roundtable on Preventive Services (chair), the National Governors Association Commission on Childhood Obesity (co-chair), the Board of Directors of the Nemours Foundation, and the Partnership for Prevention (chair, policy committee). He previously served on the NAS Board on Agriculture, Health and the Environment; the NAS Food and Nutrition Board; the Institute of Medicine's Roundtable on Health and the Environment; the HHS Nutrition Policy Board (chair); the HHS Working Group on Leading Health Indicators (chair); the HHS Task Force on Health Risk Assessment (chair); the National Coordinating Committee on Clinical Preventive Services (chair); and the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. McGinnis is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, Fellow of the American College of Epidemiology and Fellow of the American College of Preventive Medicine. McGinnis' recognitions for his contributions to society include the Wilbur Cohen Award, the Porter Prize, the Distinguished Service Medal of the U.S. Public Health Service, the National Health Leader of the Year Award, and the Public Health Hero Award.

His life and work He studied with the Oratorians and fought at the battle of Steenkerque in 1692. A friend of Jean de La Fontaine, he wrote various works of literature, history and philosophy, but failed to publish them. The Duchess of Orl√©ans (1677-1749) made him her secretary and put him in charge of her two daughters' educations. In 1724, he published a translation of Jerusalem Delivered by Torquato Tasso, which brought him much admiration and led to his election two years later to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise.

Unlike loom-based weaving, there is no separation between weft and warp strands, with all strands playing both roles. North and Central American fingerweaving Some patterns and color combinations were originally restricted to certain societies or clans, while others were available for general use by all. Belts, sashes, leg bands, capes, gun straps, even dresses, shirts, and pants were created by the sometimes intricate patterns and methods. Often beads or feathers were interwoven into the patterns of the articles. The French Voyagers (fur traders in the northern US and southern Canada) adapted the finger weaving patterns to create belts and sashes which showed which company they belonged to. The belts were the original weight belts, as they added extra support to their stomachs when they were lifting heavy canoes or packets of beaver pelts, which sometimes weighed up to 600 lbs. The Spanish conquistadors used fingerwoven sashes to proclaim which command they were in, as well as to record their conquests over the Native Americans. South American fingerweaving Although South American styles shared much in common with those from North America, some differences are reliably observable. In addition to many of the specific weaves from the north, additional styles were created by using multiple weft strands at a time. Basic weaves Arrowhead weave The most basic weave is called a diagonal weave, as it creates a series of parallel lines running down the length of the weave at a diagonal. Whether one weaves from left to right or from right to left does not matter, as the pattern is the same; however, the direction must stay the same or the pattern will change. As with loom weaving, one starts with an even number of warp strands, but with no weft strand. Divide the warp strands into two groups, a top and bottom row. Take the top left (or top right) strand, and run it between the top and bottom rows, turning it into a weft. Reverse the position of each warp strand (from top to bottom or bottom to top), making sure to keep all strands in the same order and placement to form a single interlocked row. For the second row, take the new top left (or top right) warp strand, and tuck it between the top and bottom, forming a new weft strand. Again, interlink the top and bottom rows, making sure to use the old weft strand from row #1. Continue this process until the desired length is completed. Other common but more difficult patterns include those of lightning bolts, arrowheads, and chevrons. By making slight changes to the weaving process, a wide variety of unique patterns can be created.

Bridger, Wyo., 1873 The Fort Bridger Rendezvous is an annual reenactment of fur trading as it happened from 1825 to 1840 between mountain men, Native Americans, fur trappers and traders. The event takes place at Fort Bridger, Wyoming on first weekend of September. This family-friendly event is one of the largest mountain man gatherings in the nation. History The fur trade era was from 1825-1840. It was caused by the popularity of beaver skin hats on the east coast of the United States and Europe. In response to the high demand fur trappers and traders headed west to hunt for beaver. In the fall and winter the beavers would be hunted and their pelts would be scraped, stretched and salted for shipment. Then in the spring and summer these trappers would travel over 1,000 miles one way to St. Louis so they could sell their product for supplies. The suppliers decided it would be more effective coming to the mountain men and trading supplies for the furs there instead of St. Louis, thus the Rendezvous was born. The first Rendezvous took place in southern Wyoming in 1825. Every year over Labor Day weekend the town of Fort Bridger, Wyoming holds a reenactment of the Rendezvous which took place during the Fur Trade Era. Marksmanship contests are held with rifles of the time period, along with axe throwing contests and archery. Foods of the time period are also sold, and the Fort Bridger Historical site has workshops people can get involved in to learn about what life was like in those days.

With an elevation of 3,105 metres above sea level, Piz Lischana is the highest summit of the Sesvenna Range north of the Fuorcla Sesvenna (2,819 metres). The normal route of ascent is from the Chamanna Lischana a mountain hut operated by the Swiss Alpine Club, to the Fuorcla de Rims (2940 m), a col at the low point between Piz Lischana and Piz San Jon, and then along the South-East ridge of the mountain passing over the intermediate summit at pt. 3044. The route is graded T3+ or T4 in the Swiss Hiking Scale. The final section of this route can also be reached from S-charl via the Fora dal'Auahttp://www.hikr.org/dir/Fora_dal_Aua_8107/ and via the Val d'Uina, but these routes are longer and involve more ascent. Other routes to the summit involve technical climbing. A substantial rock fall from the summit pyramid into the Val de Triazza was recorded on camera by a party who had just left the summit on July 31, 2011. It is estimated that 2000 cubic metres of rock fell.http://lischanahuette.ch/piz_lischana.pdf The route from the saddle below the summit was assessed by the local authorities and re-routed with prominent red dot route marks to avoid the areas prone to further rock falls.

It includes within its boundaries the earlier Main Street Historic District, although that is considered a separate district by the National Park Service, which added the Roslyn Village district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Distinct from the Main Street district, the newer one includes more commercial property along Old Northern Boulevard, which makes a loop through downtown Roslyn off North Hempstead Turnpike (NY 25A), the main through road along Long Island's North Shore. Its contributing buildings, including several listed separately on the Register, are generally distributed over a wider range of architectural styles from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Geography All but 25 of the district's 65 acres (6 of 26 ha) are accounted for by the Main Street District, which includes all property along that Street between Glen Avenue and the intersection with East Broadway. The Roslyn Village district includes most of the remaining properties within the triangle created by Main, East Broadway and Old Northern, and some areas to the northeast along Glen Avenue, going up to Route 25A and the old Northern Mill Pond. History Since the settlement's earliest days, in the mid-17th century, its development had clustered around Main Street. That growth took off in the early 19th century after independence, when most of the houses on Main were built. After the Civil War, demand still existed for houses in Roslyn, and buyers and builders turned to East Broadway, which shared the steep hillside and Roslyn Pond shoreline as Main, although in opposite directions. As a result, the East Broadway houses skew to the late 19th century, with Victorian styles predominating. James K. Davis, who had earlier designed some of the Main Street houses, embraced the new Second Empire mansard roofed look in 1876 for his own house at 139 East Broadway. The Queen Anne style is exemplified by Evangeline Charman's 207 East Broadway home, built in 1895. In the early 20th century there was still some room left to build on at the edges of the district, and in 1921 the Bryant Library on East Broadway gave the future district its major Colonial Revival building. By 1930 the East Broadway area was as developed as Main Street had been several decades before, and builders turned elsewhere, leaving the district to retain its own historic character. As Roslyn's Landmark Society began to focus local attention on identifying and preserving the village's historic buildings in the 1960s, leading to the creation of the Main Street district, threatened older houses from elsewhere in the village and greater Roslyn area were moved to East Broadway to better protect them. An expanded historic inventory in 1979 led to a local Multiple Property Submission, which included the Roslyn Village district. The reviewers of the National Park Service initially balked at the idea of having two separate districts, suggesting instead that the state Office of Historic Preservation apply to expand the boundaries of the existing district. The state resubmitted the application, carefully explaining how Main Street constituted a visually and historically distinct collection of properties even within the proposed new district, and the Roslyn Village Historic District was added to the National Register. Preservation Roslyn has added to its ordinances a provision protecting the buildings in both its historic districts. They are recognized in its zoning and any additions, demolition or alterations are subject to approval by the six-member Historic District Board. The Roslyn Landmark Society also holds a restrictive covenant on some of the properties.

The congregation met for worship in the old Capitol building until it constructed a church on the corner of Lafayette and Wayne Street the next year. Construction and reconstruction In 1852, Albert Jordan and his brother Octavius arrived in Detroit from Hartford, Connecticut, and soon established a place among the leading architects of the city. In the mid-1850s, despite a membership of only 167 people, the Second Presbyterian congregation hired the Jordans to design a new, larger church. The location the congregation picked was on Fort Street just west of downtown; at that time, the area was a popular residential district and home to many prominent citizens who were also members of the congregation, such as Russell A. Alger, James F. Joy (Henry B. Joy's father), Theodore S. Buhl, Henry D. Shelden, and Zachariah Chandler. After the move, the congregation changed its name to the Fort Street Presbyterian Church. The original church was completed in 1855 at a cost of $70,000. The construction cost prevented the congregation from fully finishing the interior until 15 years later, when it installed the gallery and pews conforming to the original design. However, the building was destroyed by fire in 1876, completely demolishing the interior, destroying the roof, and sending the spire crashing onto Fort Street. The church was rebuilt according to the original architectural plans the following year being completed on June 10, 1877. Another major fire in 1914 again destroyed the roof, but the church was again rebuilt, and it remains as it had been designed by the Jordan brothers in the mid-1850s. Upon completion, the current church with its steeple at ranked as the tallest building in the city and state from 1877 to 1909, and is among the tallest churches in the United States. Architecture The Fort Street Presbyterian Church is an ornately detailed Gothic Revival structure built of limestone ashlar from Malden, Ontario. The facade features a tall square tower with spire on one side with a shorter octagonal turret (modeled after King's College Chapel in Cambridge) on the other. A central stained glass window illuminates the sanctuary. There are seven bays along the side of the church with flying buttresses, crocketed finials, lacy stonework and tall windows, designed to give the impression of lightness. The interior of the sanctuary features a three-aisle nave and a horseshoe balcony capable of seating almost 1,000 people. The pews are of hand-carved black walnut and the baptismal font is constructed of Caen stone, supported by onyx columns imported from Mexico. Tiles dotting the stone floor are early works of Mary Chase Perry Stratton, founder of Pewabic Pottery. The solid brass lectern, in the shape of an eagle, was exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Church Organ c. 1900-1915 The church organ was built in 1914 by Wangerian-Weickhardt, and contains 3,253 pipes ranging in length from 1/4 inch to 16 feet. It incorporates a small portion of the original 1855 organ. =Significance= The Fort Street Presbyterian Church exemplifies an important step in the rise of \\"revivalist\\" architecture in 19th-century America. American architects of the mid-19th century imported and re- interpreted the English Gothic Revival style, based on the visually lush details of Medieval cathedrals. The American architects copied the \\"Gothic\\" elements and combined them with simple building plans to create an American architectural style known as \\"Victorian Gothic\\". The Jordan brothers subscribed to this ethic, and their Fort Street Presbyterian Church, as well as being one of Michigan's oldest churches, is a premier example of Victorian Gothic architecture. The church has remained essentially unchanged despite fires there in 1877 and 1914. Later history In the early 20th century, the church began focusing more on social service programs, as people of more modest incomes moved into the surrounding, formerly aristocratic, area.War and Turmoil from Fort Street Presbyterian Church In 1908, James Joy donated property adjoining the church, and Mrs. Oren Scotten gave $50,000 to pay for the construction of the Church House. This enabled the church to minister to the newer congregants, and the church used the gymnasium in the Church House as a kind of \\"health club,\\" enrolling men, women, and children in gym classes. The church also sponsored one of the first Boy Scout troops west of the Alleghenies.Tribulations from Fort Street Presbyterian Church Membership grew steadily up through the middle of the Great Depression; however, membership, revenue, and attendance fell off afterward. In the early 1940s, plans were afoot to close the expensive church and perhaps pool with other congregations to open a combined church elsewhere in the city. However, World War II intervened. During the war, the church converted the gymnasium of the Church House into a dormitory for servicemen who were arriving at Fort Street Union Depot located across Third Street. By the war's end, the church had provided transient accommodations for 60,000 men.

It later appeared in The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories and The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories. The story is a personal narrative that follows the path of Nick Adams as he drives through his hometown with his son. Most of the story is told through memories of Nick's childhood and Father. The story chronicles the relationships between three generations of men. Important themes in \\"Fathers and Sons\\" include father‚Äìson relationships, Nick's homecoming, growing up, and role models.  Plot  \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is a story about Nicholas Adams driving home with his son after a hunting trip in his hometown. Hunting imagery and small-town agriculture make Nick think about his father, who taught him how to hunt. Nick's father had fantastic vision, but Nick says this skill made him nervous. Nick's father was a sentimental man, and Nick says that most sentimental people are both cruel and abused. Nick loved his father, but hated the way he smelled. Nick lost his sense of smell when he started smoking, which he reflects is a good thing because a good sense of smell is not necessary to man. Nick never shared anything with his father past the age of fifteen. Nick's father taught him how to hunt by giving him only three bullets a day. Nick learned much from his father about hunting. Nick is interrupted from his memories by his son, who asks what it's like to live with Indians and if he can have a gun. Nick tells him that it's his son's decision if he wants to live with Indians, and that he can have a gun at age twelve. Nick thinks about, but does not tell his son, how Trudy ‚Äúdid first what no one has ever done better.\\" He also thinks to himself that shooting one flying bird is like shooting all flying birds‚Äîthe experience is always just as good. Nick's son does not believe that his grandfather could have been a better hunter than Nick, but Nick says that the man was always disappointed in the way Nick shot. Nick's son expresses regret that they have never yet prayed at his grandfather's grave and concern that he will not be able to pray at his father's grave, and Nick says that he can see that they will need to do that soon.

He is best known for the invention of the embolectomy catheter (or balloon catheter), which revolutionised the treatment of blood clots (embolus).  Early life and education  Fogarty was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on February 25, 1934. His father worked as a railroad engineer, but died when Fogarty was eight years old. Fogarty cites his father's absence as being influential in his own creative nature as an inventor. He fixed things that needed to be fixed for his mother, and he worked with soapbox derby cars and model airplanes. \\"I just had a natural inclination and inquisitive nature about building things. I looked at things and just naturally thought, 'Okay, how can I make this better?'\\" His business side was evident in childhood as well. The model airplanes that he built were sold to neighborhood kids. When he became frustrated with motor scooter gears, he built and sold a centrifugal clutch. Fogarty was not a good student, and his original career goal was to be a boxer. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt a very good kid. They sent me to a camp to keep me out of trouble. One of the routine activities was boxing.\\" To help his family get by in the late 1940s, Fogarty started working at Good Samaritan Hospital, beginning with cleaning medical equipment while he was in the eighth grade at school. He continued working during his high school summer vacations and was soon promoted to scrub technician, a person who handed medical instruments to surgeons ‚Äì he witnessed his first surgery at a young age. It was during this time that he first met Dr. Jack Cranley, who would have a major influence on Fogarty's future career. During his last year of high school, Fogarty discovered that he wanted to be a doctor. At the age of 17, he quit his boxing career after he broke his nose in a match that ended in a draw. A family priest gave him a recommendation, and because of his awful grades, he was admitted to Cincinnati's Xavier University on probation. Jack Cranley, one of the most prominent vascular surgeons in the United States became his mentor. Speaking of Cranley, Fogarty later stated: ‚ÄúI had a mentor who encouraged me and helped to persuade me to go to college‚Ä¶ He had 10 kids and I became the 11th. He always told me, ‚ÄòYou are smarter than you think.‚Äô‚Äù Fogarty graduated from Xavier University with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in biology in 1956 and went on to attend the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1960. From 1960 to 1961, he interned at the University of Oregon Medical School in Portland, Oregon, and he completed his surgical residency at the same school in 1965.  Invention of the embolectomy catheter  During Fogarty‚Äôs years at Good Samaritan Hospital, he witnessed the deaths of many patients who died from complications in blood clot surgeries in their limbs. ‚ÄúFifty percent of the patients died. I thought there must be a better way.‚Äù Before Fogarty's invention, surgeons had to use forceps to remove the blood clots only after a huge part of an artery had been cut open, and the patient would be under general anesthesia for hours. Blood flow is usually interrupted in the procedure, increasing the risk of the patient losing a limb. At home, the ideas that went through Fogarty's head concerned different ways of making the procedure better, and he especially concentrated on avoiding the risky incisions. He tinkered with a urethral catheter and a balloon in his attic. Because a catheter only required a small incision, it would be able to get to the clot without much trauma to the patient. The urethral catheter is also flexible yet strong enough to be pushed through a blood clot. As for the balloon, he basically cut off the tip of the pinky finger of a size 5 surgical latex glove and attempted to incorporate it onto the end of the catheter. The resulting balloon could be inflated with saline using a syringe, and once it expands to the size of the artery, it is then retracted, withdrawing the clot through the artery and out the incision. The main problem in building this device was the way the balloon could be attached to the catheter. Glue that could hold vinyl, the material making up a catheter, and latex, the type of glove used, was not available. Fogarty's own take on the catheter came about because of fishing techniques he learned as a child. Precise hand-tying was needed in fishing, and with these techniques, he tied the balloon to the catheter. \\"I'd always tied flies and made lures so it was just a natural thing.\\" His experimental balloon catheter, however, always seemed to burst when it was over inflated. It even broke when he dragged it through glass tubes filled with Jell-o, a model he thought simulated a clot within an artery. After some time, he figured out the type and thickness of rubber that was firm enough when inflated to extract a clot and still flexible enough to move through without breaking. The device, made before Fogarty even received his MD from University of Cincinnati in 1960, became the first minimally invasive surgical device. Fogarty, however, came across difficulties in getting a manufacturer to produce it. From 1959 to 1961, nobody was willing to help. \\"Companies thought I was some stooge fooling around. I didn't have any credibility.\\" Dr. Cranley continued to encourage him, and soon, during his fellowship training at the University of Cincinnati in 1961 and 1962, Fogarty started to make the catheter system by hand for himself and for other vascular surgeons. At the University of Oregon, while Fogarty was completing his residency in surgery, Dr. Al Starr, head of the cardiothoracic division, used Fogarty's balloon catheters. After he was informed that no company was willing to manufacture Fogarty's device, he asked one of his acquaintances, Lowell Edwards, an electrical engineer and president of his own company, to give the device consideration in producing it. In 1969, Fogarty patented his device, and Edwards Life Sciences from Irvine, California, was assigned the patent to begin manufacturing the Fogarty embolectomy catheter. Because of the decreased risk associated with the device, Fogarty's balloon catheter became the industry standard and remains the most widely used catheter for blood-clot removal. Before his invention the success rate for removing an embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. The balloon catheter is now used in over three hundred thousand procedures every year all over the world, and is estimated to have saved the lives and limbs of approximately twenty million patients.  Other inventions  Numerous sequel applications of Fogarty's catheter came about. The first balloon angioplasty, for example, was performed with a Fogarty catheter in 1965, and has led to over six hundred fifty thousand such operations per year. Fogarty has also modified his catheter to less invasive biopsy techniques. After completing his residency and becoming a cardiovascular surgeon, Fogarty continued to invent new medical devices. One of his most successful products is the Stent-Graft, which dealt with the difficult problem of abdominal aortic aneurysms (a term referring to a weakened blood vessel). The old method was to remove the bad part of a weakened blood vessel, but Fogarty's idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a thin polyester tube that grabs onto the blood vessels. A catheter transports the stent to the weakened blood vessel, and once the balloon is inflated, the stent expands to the size of the blood vessel, and blood flows normally. Fogarty's other inventions include Fogarty surgical clips and clamps, which are used by cardiac and vascular surgeons to temporarily occlude vessels during surgery. Working with Warren Hancock, he is co-inventor of the Hancock tissue heart valve ‚Äì the world's first porcine valve. Fogarty's own inventions and the many others that resulted from his original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way surgery was performed. Considered one of the pioneers of minimally-invasive surgery, Fogarty has said: \\"I had no concept that [non-invasive surgery] would reach the magnitude that it has.\\" As a result of the embolectomy catheter and other inventions, Dr. Fogarty has won many prizes, including the National Medal for Technology and Innovation in 2012, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) in 2015. He has published around 180 scientific articles and textbook chapters in the fields of general and cardiovascular surgery. He served as President of the Society for Vascular Surgery from 1995-1996.  Innovation and entrepreneurship  Fogarty founded Fogarty Engineering, Inc. in 1980, to promote ideas for new medical devices, and has founded/co-founded and chaired the board for many business and research companies based on devices developed at the company. In 1993, with Mark Wan and Wilfred Jaeger, he founded Three Arch Partners, a venture capital fund to invest in new technology and medical devices. Three Arch helped to create and fund more than 100 companies. As a pioneer and supporter of innovation in medical technology, Fogarty has acquired over 160 patents for his medical work. He is associated with numerous medical technology companies and was appointed as an independent director to the Board of Pulse Biosciences in 2017. He is managing director of early-stage life science accelerator Emergent Medical Partners. = Fogarty Institute for Innovation = Fogarty left Stanford Medical School after about fourteen years as a professor and practicing cardiovascular surgeon. In September 2007, at Mountain View, California, he founded the Thomas Fogarty Institute for Innovation. It occupies forty-five hundred square feet of offices and engineering labs on the campus of El Camino Hospital. The educational, non-profit organization mentors and trains medical innovators. The idea for the institution dates back to Fogarty's early life when he received encouragement from Dr. Jack Cranley. ‚ÄúWe are teaching people (doctors and engineers) how to get their concepts and products into use. Very few have gone through the process of coming up with a concept and getting it funded. That does not come naturally. It comes through experience. We will teach how to address these challenges.‚Äù Physician innovators, including Fogarty, serve as the faculty of the Institute and make use of their networks and experiences in the private industry to help those with projects that are ready for commercialization.  Thomas Fogarty Winery and Vineyards  In 1969, when he began teaching surgery at the Stanford University Medical Center, Fogarty was first introduced to wine. He helped out at a Stanford colleague's small winery. Later on, he purchased land in the Santa Cruz Mountains. He established a cellar there and began making wine with grapes bought from nearby growers. With help from founding winemaker Michael Martella, he planted his first vines in 1978 and set up a commercial winery, Thomas Fogarty Winery and Vineyards, in 1981, largely in order to share a business with his family. The estate now has thirty acres under vine, which are farmed organically. The winery is run today by Tom Fogarty, Jr and the Fogarty family with production overseen by Winegrower Nathan Kandler. It has become well known as a top producer of single-vineyard Pinot Noir and Chardonnay wines. Thomas Fogarty Winery was named by Wine and Spirits magazine as one of its top 100 wineries in 2014. Like his father, Tom Fogarty Jr was also an avid boxer in his youth, winning multiple amateur golden-glove tournaments throughout the Bay area. The younger Fogarty is famously credited for knocking down Danny Bonaduce in a celebrity boxing match in San Jose in 1997.

The series was first broadcast in 2007. It is about Simon McGrath (played by Darren Boyd), a man who works in a job that he does not like ‚Äì the arms trade. The show mocks issues of morality, although Howarth claims that the show is not satirical. Because of the subject matter and the light-hearted way it is treated, the series is one of Radio 4's most controversial. A second series was broadcast in April 2009. Plot Simon McGrath, the narrator and anti-hero of the series, works as an arms dealer whose main job is selling arms to Gambia. Simon claims that he would prefer to work elsewhere, but due to a combination of laziness and cowardice he has failed to change to a job which is less problematic in terms of morality. He tries to do the good thing, such as donating blood and recycling, but he knows that he could do better. He tries to defend himself by saying that if he was not doing the job, then someone else would. Simon's job puts strains on his relationships. His girlfriend Anna Greig (Joanna Page) wants to settle down and have a family with Simon, but it is mainly because it is easier than trying to find another boyfriend. Simon's sister, Judith (Sarah Smart), who works for Oxfam hates her brother's job and would like to disown him, but she cannot bring herself to do it. Angela (Brigit Forsyth), Simon's mother, does not mind the ethical implications surrounding her son's job as long he has a steady occupation. Simon's main colleague is Boris Kemal (Lewis MacLeod), who has no problem with the morality with his job, claiming that his work is a humanitarian service, once saying, \\"Give a man a fish and he can feed himself for a day. Give a man a gun and he can steal fish for the rest of his life.\\" Despite his exotic name, Boris is actually a Scot who lives in Folkestone. Controversy Safety Catch has attracted controversy due to its material. One listener complained to the BBC complaints show Feedback, saying that the show was, \\"Morally vacuous\\". However, after this complaint was broadcast, fans of the show wrote in to praise the show. In response, Howarth claimed that his aim in writing the series was just trying be funny, claiming that if the series was trying to be moral, then it would probably fail. Howarth also said that the series is not actually about the arms trade, but the life of some who works in the arms trade. The producer of Safety Catch, Dawn Ellis, said that the arms trade is a subject that should not be avoided in comedy. A listener also complained about the references to Gambia being the country to which the arms are dealt, despite the fact that Gambia is one of the most peaceful countries in Africa. Howarth said that he was writing it as though Gambia was on the brink of a war, not at war, because of a recent coup d'√©tat in the country. Howarth also complained about people demanding that his show should be taken off the air, claiming it was censorship.

The film stars Indonesian action star Barry Prima who appears in such films as Ferocious Female Freedom Fighters and The Warrior. The Devil's Sword crosses over into many different genres of film. The film features martial arts, and also elements of fantasy, horror, sci-fi, and also some mild sexual content due to the portrayal of the Crocodile Queen. Background Just like the better known character Jaka Sembung, protagonist of the film is taken from a comic book. 1987 film Mandala Dari Sungai Ular (Mandala from the Snake River), a sequel to The Devil's Sword, is an eponymous adaptation of the cartoon. The main difference between two characters is that Mandala is a warrior from mythical pre-Islamic times of the Archipelago while Jaka Sembung is a Muslim and West Javanese freedom fighter against Dutch colonial rule. Plot The Devil's Sword follows a quest to find an ancient sword that was forged from a mysterious metallic substance that fell to earth in the form of a meteorite. An old man who finds the meteorite creates the Devil's Sword, and he hides it after it burns down his hut. Whoever wields the sword holds the greatest power imaginable in his hands. Banyujaga (Advent Bangun) is sent by the Crocodile Queen (Gudhi Sintara) to steal the fianc√© of a local village's princess (Enny Christina) to keep as her own subject. During the raid on the village, Mandala (Barry Prima), a one time colleague of Banyujaga, sees the scuffle and helps defend the village, and ends up helping the princess recover her husband to be.

(1806). The Bibliographical Miscellany; Or, Supplement to the Bibliographical, p. 276-277. His seminal work on Persian grammar, written in collaboration with Sir William Jones, was noteworthy amongst the early works on this subject; and it remains significant in the context of that philological foundation from which all subsequent grammatical studies were to evolve.Lieber, Francis et al.. (1835). \\"Persian Language, Literature and Religion\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Americana, Vol X, p. 39. Richardson's scholarly compilation was organized in a format similar to Mesgnien-Meninski's Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalis, Turcic√¶, Arabic√¶, Persic√¶ (1680). Each book in the two-volume set was sold separately; many more of the first part (the Persian-Arabic-English volume) were sold than the second part (the English-Persian-Arabic volume). When booksellers found themselves with an overstock of first edition broken sets, a greater number of copies of the second edition's first book were printed. Richardson's ground- breaking scholarship was more broadly disseminated in Charles Wilkins' several revised versions of the dictionary.Zenker, J. Th. (1846). Bibliotheca orientalis: Manuel de bibliographie orientale, p.13. Subsequent work by the 19th century philologists Francis Johnson, Francis Joseph Steingass and others ensured that Richardson's name continued to be well known as an orientalist and as a scholar. Selected works Richardson's reputation has been burnished by the work of subsequent lexicographers who have revised and extended his work. *Richardson, John. (1777).

Located on the Potomac River immediately opposite Williamsport, Maryland, the property consists of a tract with a main house dating from c. 1741. The house was built by Evan Watkins, who operated Watkins Ferry on the Potomac, which was used by George Washington and General Edward Braddock. In 1795 the property was sold to Peter Light. The Light family retained the property until 1854, substantially expanding the house. The ferry and house, by now known as Light's Ferry passed to Robert Lemen, who converted the ferry into a cable ferry. In 1861 the ferry was used by Union forces under Captain Abner Doubleday to cross into Virginia for raids. In 1863 Doubleday again crossed the river by fording while pursuing Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced on Gettysburg. A month later, following Lee's defeat, 70,000 confederate soldiers crossed at Lemen's Ferry. In the late 19th century the first bridge crossing was built at this location. Today, US 11 crosses here, bisecting the property. The Watkins Family also became associated with the Boone Family during the time of their ownership of the Ferry. A great- great grandson, John Watkins (His father John T Watkins was born at Watkins Ferry), of the original Evan Watkins married Elizabeth Karn, a 1st and 2nd cousin of Daniel Boone's. Elizabeth was the daughter of Christopher Karn and Leah Boone. John and Elizabeth's son Christopher Columbus Watkins married Rachel Bristow who was the granddaughter of Leah's sister, Hannah Boone.

The concept Protection of Life is considered to be different from the protection of the environment as it has been used by the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), though that organization was founded as a result of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972. G√ºnther Schwab is known as the author of the screenplay for the movie The Forester of the Silver Wood (1954). In his novel Der Tanz mit dem Teufel (Dance with the Devil) G√ºnther Schwab gives his expressions to sentiments for nature protection and describes the destruction of nature as a plan of a devil who seems really existent. The book was translated in many languages, the first English translation was published 1963. In the year 1958 Schwab started to set up an organization with the name World Union for Saving of Life which was registered as World Union for Protection of Life two years later and soon activated branches in more than 30 countries all over the world.  Germany  International congresses with scientist and church organizations mainly took place in German speaking countries. Around the year 1968 the organization had several thousand members in the Federal Republic of Germany. Famous members were the physicist Karl Bechert and the chemist Hans-Adalbert Schweigart. The organization played an active role during the foundation of the German Green Party, especially in Lower Saxony.\\"Die Beteiligungsformen der Gr√ºnen Parteien ...\\" Dissertation for doctorate, written by Kuei-Hsiang Liao, 2000 The Nazi past was accused to several leading members like Werner Georg Haverbeck, president 1974‚Äì1982, and his wife Ursula Haverbeck has been the subject of lawsuits due to her Holocaust denial.

A scientific advisory board of 400 scientists out of 53 countries supported the work of the organization. Among them were 40 Nobel laureates. President of the board was Linus Pauling.

As Jordan is landlocked except at its southern extremity, with only of shoreline along the Gulf of Aqaba providing access to the Red Sea, its Naval Force comprises 27 patrol boats, and has a total complement of more than 700 personnel, excluding the 77th Marines Reconnaissance Battalion. The Naval Force is under the command of the army. As of July 2016 the Commander of the Navy is Brigadier General Ibrahim Salman Al-Naimat. The Royal Jordanian Navy also cooperates with other nations in the region, being part of the maritime Combined Task Force 152 that provides security in the Persian Gulf.Kuwait hands over Command of CTF 152 to Jordan. Combined Maritime ForcesJordan Hands Over to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in CTF152 Change of Command Ceremony. Combined Maritime Forces, 14 September 2017 History The Royal Naval Force was established in 1951 as the Royal Coast Guard. It was established in Aqaba. Its size was about that of an infantry company i.e.,circa 200 men. In 1952, the Coast Guard Headquarters was moved to the Dead Sea area and remained there until 1967. In 1974, The Coast Guard was provided with four medium patrol boats (Bertram Class) and with equipment for the divers and frogmen. The naval element of the armed forces, although designated the Royal Jordanian Navy, remained an integral part of the army. Performing essentially a coast guard mission, in 1988 it had 300 officers and men based at Al Aqabah, the country's only port, with access to the Red Sea. The navy operated five coastal patrol boats of United States manufacture armed with light machine guns. The navy assisted in the maintenance of harbor security, operating in conjunction with customs and immigration personnel to ensure the enforcement of the country's laws and regulations. In late 1987, three larger craft of ninety-five tons each were ordered from Britain. When introduced, each would have a crew of sixteen and would be armed with 20mm and 30mm guns. Israeli units at the adjacent Israeli naval facility at Elat similarly consisted of small, lightly armed patrol boats. In 1991, the Coast Guard was provided with three heavy patrol boats (Hawk Class). On 13 November 1991 the Royal Coast Guard was renamed as the Royal Naval Force.

The group, like other supporters' trusts, seeks to strengthen the influence of supporters over the destiny of their clubs through democratic supporter ownership. History and constitution The group was founded in 2003 as The Arsenal Supporters' Trust and is registered as an Industrial and Provident Society, which means the Trust is owned equally by all of its members. Each member has one vote in the Trust's elections. Though it is recognised by Supporters Direct as the official Supporters Trust for Arsenal FC, and holds regular dialogue with the club, the Arsenal Supporters' Trust is wholly independent and is not owned or financially dependent on the club or its owners. With a membership of approximately 1,000, it is one of the smaller supporters' trusts in the United Kingdom, but has a close working relationship with the club. AST's members include small shareholders as well as supporters and the Trust itself owns three of the 62,217 shares in the club, including the so-called 'orphan share', donated by the club in 2007. 2007‚Äì09 takeover role The Trust has played a role in the ongoing takeover bids for the club by rivals Stan Kroenke and Alisher Usmanov. Regarding Usmanov's bid as hostile, in November 2007 the Trust joined the Arsenal board's lockdown agreement to prevent a full takeover.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/8442560/Arsenal- takeover-timeline-of-Stan-Kroenkes-time-as-club-shareholder.html In May 2008 the Arsenal Supporters' Trust came down in favour of Stan Kroenke as a more likely long term, supportive, investor in Arsenal FC and published a summary of their point of view, following a visit to some of the sports franchise and TV interests of Kroenke in the United States. The Trust went on to work as bridgebuilder between Kroenke and the Arsenal board. 2011 takeover role The Trust did not support their shareholder members selling shares to Stan Kroenke in May 2011 when his Company bought the shares of two major shareholders Danny Fizsman and Lady Nina Bracewell. The Offer of ¬£11,750 per share came about due to the death of Danny Fiszman with his Estate selling his shares, obliging Kroenke to launch a full take-over bid as he had exceeded the 30 percent threshold. Kroenke through Kroenke Sports Enterprises (KSE) had acceptances from shareholders at the end of the Offer on Friday 10 June 2011 amounting to 66.64% of the issued share capital of Arsenal Holdings PLC. 2014 fan-ownership initiative The Trust launched 'the fanshare scheme' in August 2010 with the vocal backing of the club‚Äôs chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, as a vehicle for fans to buy part shares in Arsenal. More than 1,800 members invested almost ¬£2m in the scheme, which gave fans the rights that came with share ownership, including the ability to attend the Arsenal annual meeting, pose questions on club finances and vote on policy.

The latter is named the mPedigree Network. In December 2015, the mPedigree Network rebranded to 'mPedigree', and begun to trade under that name and a new logo, based on a knight-of-chess motif. In November 2008, the Nigerian National Agency for Drug Administration & Control (NAFDAC) reported to an industry publication that its Technical Committee was evaluating the security credentials of the mPedigree system for a possible roll-out in that country. NAFDAC and the Nigerian pharmaceutical companies formed a consortium in June 2009 to roll the service out for all medicines in Nigeria. By 2014, NAFDAC had renamed this initiative as MAS (Mobile Authentication Service), involving multiple partners, including mPedigree.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20976277 In 2011, the Kenyan drug safety regulator announced its support for the mobile telephony anti- counterfeiting system deployed in that country by mPedigree. In 2017, the Kenyan agricultural regulator, KEPHIS, announced a partnership with mPedigree to enable the verification of seed quality using mobile phone technologies.http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/markets/news/Plant-health- agency-ups-fight-against-fake-seeds/3815534-4093312-ynp0ow/index.html  Methodology  Manufacturers who sign on to the mPedigree scheme upload pedigree information of each pack of medicine into the central registry using standard mass serialisation methods such as those employed in the RFID-enabled e-pedigree system familiar in the United States and elsewhere. When consumers buy a product made by a manufacturer participating in the scheme, they are able to query the pedigree information stored in the registry by means of a free SMS message. An automatic response from the registry certifies whether the particular product is truly \\"from source\\" or not. The proponents of the scheme believe the system will be effective in the fight against counterfeit medicines in the region.allAfrica.com: Ghana: Country to Use SMS to Fight Fake Drugs (Page 1 of 1) In May 2010 it was reported that Hewlett Packard (HP), Zain Telecommunications, and undisclosed pharmaceutical and other partners had signed up to the mPedigree program with plans to extend the service to multiple countries across Africa. Some West African companies were also reported as using the technology.See also: https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601090&sid;=a0_anlNoJCgU  Trials  The platform has been in testing since 28 January 2008. Media reports in Ghana suggest that monitored trials conducted in the two major cities in the country, Accra and Kumasi, were largely successful. In a forum convened together with the US-based Partnership for Safe Medicines and the Ghana Food & Drugs Board, the Deputy Chief Executive of the Food & Drugs Board announced that the Ghanaian Authorities were investigating the introduction of the mPedigree platform as a national standard based on the outcomes of the trial.  Nigeria Update  A new consortium, including mPedigree and other technology companies, was formed by Nigerian regulator NAFDAC to promote the use of mobile medicines authentication technologies in Nigeria, and in July 2014 a deadline for compliance was set for manufacturers of certain categories of medicines.  Ghana Update  On 21 August 2014, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana announced that it had adopted the mPedigree initiative through its new PREVENT program, thus making the mPedigree solution an industry-wide standard in Ghana. The Pharmaceutical Society's member organization, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Ghana, also announced its embrace of the solution, and mention was made that several member companies of the association had already implemented the mPedigree Goldkeys solution on medicines sold in Ghana. The Ministry of Health of Ghana and the Food & Drugs Authority endorsed the program.  Other Industries  mPedigree's Goldkeys technology is also used in the protection of products from counterfeiting in other industries such as textiles and cosmetics. In 2015, the Ugandan standards regulator, the UNBS, announced a partnership with mPedigree, USAID, and others to track seeds and other agro-inputs, and secure them against counterfeiting, using mPedigree's Goldkeys platform, under the KAKASA brand name. Channel 114 was dedicated by the Uganda telecom authorities for this purpose.  Partnerships  MPedigree lists as its supporting partners: the World Economic Forum Technology Pioneers Program, Ashoka, Nokia, and a number of telecoms carriers and pharmaceutical regulators in Ghana, Nigeria, and India.  Social Marketing  In April 2008, mPedigree announced that it had commissioned the first documentary on the fake drugs phenomenon produced within West Africa by a locally based production House. This documentary was debuted in partnership with the German overseas cultural establishment, the Goethe Institut, and later premiered on Ghanaian television networks, including the national broadcaster, GTV.allAfrica.com: Ghana: Media Launch of Short Film (Page 1 of 1)  Awards  In November 2009, mPedigree lost out to Air Semiconductor in the finals of the 2009 Institution of Engineering Technology's Innovation Awards.

Swaggering is an ostentatious style of walking affected by someone wishing to assert their dominance. It is also a form of machismo or sexual display which takes up more space than needed for simple motion. The exact gait will vary with personality and fashion but it is generally more of a loose, rolling style than a stiff strut. The feet will be kept apart rather than following each other in line and the more swaggering the gait, the greater the lateral distance between them. Studies have found that people are able to determine sexual orientation from such cues and a shoulder-swagger was perceived as a heterosexual orientation. Among London cockneys, swaggering was stylised as the coster walk which became the dance craze of the Lambeth walk. Among African-Americans, it is known as a jive-ass walk or pimp walk. The actor John Wayne was known for his swaggering walk which became a distinctive element of his screen image. A cane may be used as a walking stick as part of the performance. In the military, this became stylised as the swagger stick -- useless as a support and just used for gesturing and prodding. Portraits which are ostentatiously posed in the grand manner are known as swagger portraits. The Tate Gallery held an exhibition of these in 1992, featuring the work of William Dobson, Anthony van Dyck and Peter Lely.

It was part of a series of cartoons Avery did satirizing technology of the future which included: The Car of Tomorrow, The Farm of Tomorrow, and The T.V. of Tomorrow. These were satires of live action promotional films that were commonly shown in theaters at the time. The film is a straightforward narrated showcase of appliances said to be found in a typical house in the year 2050, roughly a hundred years after the cartoon was made, each one actually an outlandish joke. Most of the time the inventions following a similar pattern of being made for each member of the family ending with a fatal version for the \\"mother-in-law\\". Plot  *The cartoon starts as the narrator presents the audience \\"The House of Tomorrow\\", completely \\"pre- fabricated and ready to set up\\" (all in one little wrapped up gift). The narrator's voice is provided by radio actor Frank Graham. *The narrator presents the doors for each member of the family: one for Fido (the dog), Junior (the child, which is stained with muddy handprints), the Mother (which is widened to accommodate her hips - \\"she just loves sweets\\"), the Father (a saloon doorway), and the mother-in-law (with chains, locks, boards, and welcome mat that reads \\"SCRAM\\"). *Inside the house, the narrator talks about the thick carpeting. The butler gets into the carpet and he sinks deeply inside it. *The narrator then presents how to get moisture in the room. Just pressing a button reveals a rain cloud that floats across the room. *Next is the trophy room \\"where it contains many rare exhibits of the hunt\\".

Sold to Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique in 1912, she sailed for that company under her original name and, later, as SS Alesia on France‚ÄìSouth America routes. The liner was sold for scrapping in the Netherlands in December 1923, but was lost while being towed.  Design and construction  In March 1885, Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique (CGT), announced the building of four new steamers for the Le Havre‚ÄìNew York route at the company's Penho√´t ship yard. The similarly sized steamers, , , La Bretagne, and , were built under a French government subsidy law that provided that the ships could be taken over in a time of war. CGT also announced that noted French designer Jules Allard would decorate the four ships. La Bretagne as she appeared c. 1890‚Äì1895 La Bretagne was launched 9 September 1885 by CGT in Saint-Nazaire.Bonsor, p. 656‚Äì57. Built for France to New York service, she had a and measured long between perpendiculars and wide. Equipped with twin triple-expansion steam engines driving a single screw propeller that drove her at , she was outfitted with two funnels and four masts carrying a barquentine rig. La Bretagne was initially equipped with accommodations for 390 first-class, 65 second-class, and 600 third-class passengers. Her hull was made of steel from the foundries at Terre-Noire and featured eleven bulkheads which created twelve watertight compartments; her deck was planked with Canadian elm and teak. The ship cost $1,700,000 (about $ million today), exclusive of decorations which were provided for $75,000 by CGT employees.  CGT career  La Bretagne began her maiden voyage from Le Havre to New York on 14 August 1886, and arrived on 22 August after a storm- tossed voyage carrying 281 passengers. In June 1891, a westbound passage was marred when a drunken man flung his five-year-old son overboard in mid ocean. The man was seized and straitjacketed while a boat was launched in an unsuccessful attempt to save the boy. In the last quarter of 1892, La Bretagne seemed to be jinxed. In September, a cholera outbreak, traced to a United States immigrant brought aboard the Hamburg-Amerika steamer Moravia, caused all steerage traffic to be suspended and CGT's New York traffic to depart from Cherbourg for the next two months.Bonsor, p. 631. La Bretagne, arriving in New York in mid-September, was caught in the middle of the outbreak and was detained at the New York Quarantine Station (though the liner had no cases reported on board). Among the passengers aboard was John D. Washburn, the United States Minister to Switzerland, who was leaving his diplomatic post. On her next voyage, a purser's error resulted in the ship being detained for an \\"uncomfortable long time\\" off Liberty Island in early December while the error was sorted out. Departing from her pier at the foot of Morgan Street in New York on 11 December, a pilot error resulted in La Bretagne plowing through a pier at the foot of Franklin Street. The New York agent for CGT estimated that it would take two weeks to repair the eleven plates crushed by the collision. La Bretagne after her 1895 upgrades The success of upgraded engines on the liner in 1894 prompted CGT to make similar changes on several older liners, including La Bretagne. In 1895, her triple-expansion engines were upgraded to quadruple-expansion engines, and her four barquentine-rigged masts were removed and replaced with two pole masts. At the same time, her third-class passenger capacity was nearly tripled, going from 600 to 1,500 passengers. In April 1898, The New York Times reported on a rescue at sea accomplished by La Bretagnes crew that had happened late the previous month. Encountering the dismasted British bark Bothnia, the crew of La Bretagne effected rescue of the stricken ship's master and ten surviving crewmen. The crew then used carrier pigeons to announce the rescue. The carrier pigeons were being carried aboard La Bretagne as a trial program under the watch of a French Army officer, after the CGT liner La Champagne broke her propeller shaft and was adrift for five days in February without any way of communicating her predicament. For details of the incident, see Bonsor, p. 656. On 18 May 1899, a fire was discovered in the cargo hold of the outbound North German Lloyd liner , when she had just sailed through the Narrows. Barbarossas crew‚Äîin a panic, according to a Chicago Daily Tribune news story‚Äîturned the big liner around and hastily headed back to her pier, ramming the docked La Bretagne in her starboard quarter in the process. The damage to La Bretagnes hull was significant: a hole long, below the waterline that left her in danger of sinking at her pier. By making the ship list to port, La Bretagnes crew were able to get the hole above the waterline and prevent further damage. Estimates in The New York Times two days later put La Bretagnes repair time at ten days. In the meantime, her passengers were able to choose to travel on the Cunard liner RMS Carmania or the CGT liner to complete their travel. On 27 May 1909, La Bretagne was tangentially involved in another North German Lloyd liner mishap. , departing for Bremen from New York in a fog, steered clear of La Bretagne and instead ran hard aground near the seawall of Fort Wadsworth. La Bretagnes career was not marked entirely by misfortune. On her August 1902 crossing, a group of about 30 first-cabin passengers formed a vegetarian society, which they called \\"La Soci√©t√© des Legumineux\\", that gave the steward fits because they ignored the chef's signature meat dishes of roast beef and Philadelphia chicken. The same voyage carried eight Franciscan nuns‚Äîreportedly the last of the expelled order to leave France‚Äîon their way to Canada. In September 1905, The New York Times heralded the arrival on La Bretagne of 30 dressmakers and milliners with the latest fall fashions from Paris. Over 200 trunks of women's clothing arrived on the liner, and were inspected by married customs inspectors because, according to the head of the inspectors, \\"a married man is the only person in the world would know what all that stuff was\\".  Later career  In 1912, the newly reorganized Compagnie de Navigation Sud- Atlantique purchased a number of second-hand ships‚Äîincluding La Bretagne‚Äîfor its relaunch of South American service from France. La Bretagne sailed on the South American service through 1923, the last four years under the name of Alesia. In December 1923, Alesia was sold to a Dutch firm for scrapping. While on her way to the shipbreaker, Alesias tow line parted and the ship ran aground on the island of Texel, becoming a total loss.

It is one of his Cartoons or Take-Offs and is scored for piccolo, clarinet, cornet, trombone, bass drum, and two pianos (four players). (Ives suggested in a memo in the manuscript that this instrumentation can be expanded by using extra instruments.) In 1912 or 1913, Ives grouped Calcium Light Night with five other pieces to make Set No. 1 for chamber ensemble.

The show has featured a number of epic races, where one of the presenters ‚Äî Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May, and occasionally The Stig ‚Äî drives a car in a race against the others in another form of transport. These races typically involve Clarkson driving the car while Hammond and May take the same journey by combinations of plane, train, or ferry. May has said that the races are planned to be as close as possible.Top Gear, Series 11 Episode 4 1:01:13 Of the long distance races so far, the car has won the vast majority of the races, with the exceptions of the cross-London epic, in which the car was beaten by a bicycle, a boat on the Thames and public transport; Ferrari Daytona vs. Powerboat, in which the boat won; Shelby Mustang GT500 vs. High Speed Train, in which the train won; and the Arabian Peninsula race, in which the alternative 'money no-object' transportation options beat the Bugatti Chiron. Races = Aston Martin DB9 vs. French TGV ‚Äì Distance 900 miles= Series Four, Episode One (9 May 2004) Clarkson drove an Aston Martin DB9 from the Dunsfold studio in Surrey to Monte Carlo, against Hammond and May who took the Eurostar and the French TGV. Hammond and May walked two miles to a bus stop, took a bus to Guildford railway station, and went on a train to London Waterloo. From there they took the Eurostar to Gare du Nord, the RER to Gare de Lyon, the French TGV to Nice, then another train to Monte Carlo. During the race, May compared the contest to the earlier Blue Train Races, won by a Rover Light Six and Bentley Speed Six against Le Train Bleu or The Blue Train. Winner: Car = Ferrari 612 Scaglietti vs. Passenger Jet ‚Äì Distance 650 miles= Series Five, Episode Eight (19 December 2004) In what proved to be one of the closest Top Gear long-distance races ever staged, Clarkson tried to beat Hammond and May in a race from the Dunsfold studio in Surrey to Verbier, Switzerland to find out the quickest way to get to the Alps for a skiing holiday. Clarkson drove a Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, whilst Hammond and May used public transport, chiefly using a plane to get from Heathrow to Geneva. Setting off at 5:30am, Hammond and May began by taking a bus to Guildford, followed by a train to Woking and a RailAir coach to Heathrow. Clarkson meanwhile drove to Dover to catch the ferry to France, and managed to leave English soil before Hammond and May had even reached the airport. However, after a 90-minute check-in, Hammond and May finally boarded their plane whilst Clarkson had only covered a 100 miles since docking in Calais. Indeed, the plane actually arrived in Geneva early, so by the time Hammond and May had got off the plane, Clarkson was still only halfway between Paris and Dijon, about 250 miles behind. To make matters worse, Clarkson was further slowed by roadworks and then stopped by the police just south of Dijon for speeding, which cost him a further 25 minutes as well as a ¬£60 fine. After Hammond and May landed in Geneva, they took a train to Martigny. However, the slower mode of transport combined with Clarkson encountering very little traffic after being stopped by the police meant that the car had more than halved the distance by the time Hammond and May arrived at Martigny, where they were then forced to wait for an hour until their next train. By the time their train to Le Ch√¢ble had left Martigny station, Clarkson had managed to reach the Swiss border and was then just 40 miles behind Hammond and May when they boarded their final mode of public transport: a coach ride up 12 miles of mountain road from Le Ch√¢ble to Verbier. When they arrived at the Verbier bus depot, Hammond and May had to continue their journey on foot, but having caught up on the mountain road, Clarkson overtook them on the main street of Verbier, barely a few hundred yards away from the finishing point.

It was a never included in a commercial release. = Mercedes- Benz SLR McLaren vs. Cruise Ferry ‚Äì Distance 1320 miles= Series Six, Episode Six (3 July 2005) Hammond and May raced Clarkson (in a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren) from Heathrow airport to Oslo, Norway. May and Hammond flew to Newcastle, then took the ferry across the North Sea to Kristiansand, Norway and used a speedboat to get to Oslo. Clarkson, in the McLaren Mercedes, had to drive over 1,300 miles (about 2,100 km) through the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark (stopping to rest overnight), Sweden, and Norway. On the way from Kristiansand to Oslo, aspiring to their first epic race win, the engine on Hammond and May's speedboat burnt out while the back- up chase boat's hull was damaged‚Äîall while Hammond was getting seasick over the side of the boat‚Äîseverely spoiling their lead. They had to land in an unknown town (Stavern, in Larvik), taking nearly a day to find a bus and get to the destination‚Äîleaving Clarkson to win the race, fly back to England, get home, and be halfway through supper before Hammond and May arrived at the destination.

It was never included in a commercial release. = Bugatti Veyron vs. Cessna 182 ‚Äì Distance 813 miles= Series Seven, Episode Five (11 December 2005) Clarkson (in a Bugatti Veyron) raced Hammond and May (in a Cessna 182) from Alba to Tower 42 in London to deliver a truffle. Hammond and May rode scooters to the local airport, and planned to fly directly to London, but had to fly via the French Riviera since the aircraft was not equipped to fly over mountains above 10,000 feet‚Äîin this case, the Swiss Alps. While catching up to Clarkson, May had to land in Lille, as he was not licensed to fly at night. From Lille, May & Hammond took the Eurostar to London, and then a bus for the final leg of the journey. Winner: Car DVD Release: This race was released as part of the Top Gear: The Challenges 1 DVD. A much shorter version was included on the Top Gear: The Races DVD. = Polar Race ‚Äì Toyota Hilux vs. Dog Sled ‚Äì Distance Approx. 400 miles= Series Nine, Episode Seven (25 July 2007) Clarkson and May drove a modified Toyota Hilux against Hammond, Matty McNair and a dog sled team in a race across the Canadian arctic. Clarkson and May won the race, and became part of the first successful attempt to drive a motor vehicle to the North Magnetic Pole. Winner: Car DVD Release: A director's cut of this race was released on Blu-ray. The televised version was released as part of the Top Gear: The Great Adventures 1 DVD box set. = London Race ‚Äì Car vs. Bicycle vs. Boat vs. Public Transport ‚Äì Distance 17 miles= Series Ten, Episode Five (11 November 2007) May (in a Mercedes-Benz GL-Class) raced Hammond (on a Specialized Sirrus Limited hybrid bicycle), The Stig (using the London public transport system), and Clarkson (in a Cougar motorboat) from Kew across to London City Airport. The Stig started on a bus, then got on the Tube before taking the DLR. Hammond took the lead from the start, although traffic lights meant May remained close behind. The speed limit of 9mph on much of the River Thames put Clarkson firmly in last place. Congestion at Piccadilly let Hammond shake off May, who was further slowed after the Metropolitan Police stopped him to check the camera car's permit. With Hammond 8 miles from the airport, Clarkson passed under Wandsworth Bridge, at which point the Thames had no speed limit. He therefore shot past May and the Stig, but was shocked to discover Hammond had still won by a fair margin. The Stig arrived a short while later, beating May by 15 minutes. Despite the result shown in the film, the presenters mockingly denied this outcome (by saying things such as Hammond crashing into railings and Clarkson's boat exploding), and insisted that May in the Mercedes-Benz won the race fairly. Winner: Bicycle DVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 10 box set. It was also released as part of the Top Gear: The Challenges 2 DVD. = Nissan GT-R vs. Japanese Public Transit System ‚Äì Distance 355 miles= Series Eleven, Episode Four (13 July 2008) In what is commonly agreed to be the closest Top Gear race ever staged, Clarkson drove a Nissan GT-R through Japan, from Hakui, Ishikawa to Mount Nokogiri, while Hammond and May took public transport‚Äîmost notably the 168 mph Shinkansen. First they took a limited express train from Hakui to Kyoto, before getting on the bullet train to Shin-Yokohama, they then had to take the Yokohama Subway to Yokohama Station, where they got on the suburban train to Kurihama and caught the bus to the ferry. While in Tokyo, Clarkson accidentally turned off the satnav system in the GT-R and struggled to turn it back on as the system only spoke Japanese, costing him 45 minutes. By the time he had managed to turn it back on, Hammond and May had taken the lead. However, May and Hammond were temporarily separated when their train split. They eventually regrouped when Hammond asked May to hold the bus. May and Hammond then crossed Tokyo Bay on a ferry, from which they used folding bicycles (carried in their suitcases) to the cable car, which got them up to the top of Mount Nokogiri. Clarkson, meanwhile, thought he had won the race when he reached the mountain's car park, only to be told by the film crew that the finishing line was at the top of the mountain. All three proceeded to run to the rest of the way, converging on the finishing point from two different directions. Clarkson made it to the summit just 3 minutes before Hammond and May, and was visibly still out of breath when the other two arrived. Winner: Car DVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 11 box set. It was also released as part of the Top Gear: The Challenges 3 DVD. = Economy Race to Blackpool ‚Äì Jaguar XJ vs. VW Polo vs. Subaru Legacy ‚Äì Distance 750 miles= Series Twelve, Episode Four (23 November 2008) With the team booked to switch on the famous Blackpool Illuminations, the three were presented with a challenge to determine which of them would get the honour of pulling the switch. This took the form of a race from Basel to Blackpool, taking a route of their choice and using any unmodified production car, the only restriction being that they could only use a single tank of fuel. All three presenters chose diesel vehicles ‚Äì May a Subaru Legacy, Hammond a Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion, to the scorn of his compatriots, and Clarkson a Jaguar XJ. He had dismissed the race as pointless, since the figures indicated no production car at the time could make the distance, and therefore decided to \\"fail in style and comfort\\". Finally, the Stig was dropped off in Blackpool to pull the switch if no-one arrived. Each presenter took different routes across France. Hammond opted for the shortest possible, while May added 30 miles to avoid mountains and several towns. Clarkson headed straight for the nearest motorway and drove \\"like a loony\\", heating seats, charging his phone and running the radio in the hope of emptying his fuel tank in France. After initially struggling with consumption, both Hammond and May realized their pace was too slow, and decided to pick up speed. May caught up with Hammond, and the two began an overtaking duel all the way to Calais, arriving 40 minutes behind Clarkson. The presenters had also chosen different routes across England. Hammond again opted for the shortest, via the M1 and M6. May decided to avoid the risk of M6 traffic by heading along the M1 up to Leeds, then switching to the M62. Clarkson chose to use the M40, with his theoretical route changing to the M6 at Birmingham, although he was really trying to run out of fuel near his house. Despite his fuel-wasting, he passed Oxford with a considerable level remaining, and slowed down, finally taking the race seriously. When Hammond found out that Clarkson was still running, he picked up speed and overtook the Jaguar on the M6 toll. Given his near-empty tank, Clarkson decided to remain economical until his range reached 0, as Hammond's charge had reduced the BlueMotion's range drastically. With May out of the running due to his slow speed and a trouble-free M6, Hammond's theoretical range reached 0. Once the Jaguar did the same, Clarkson accelerated to catch Hammond. However, his charge was too late, as Hammond was greeted with a police escort just outside Blackpool. Clarkson arrived less than a minute later. May did eventually finish, albeit 40 minutes after the celebration ended. With seconds to go before the switch-on, Richard‚Äîdespite winning‚Äîclaimed Jeremy should switch the light, and in the ensuing argument, the Stig pulled the switch. Afterwards, it was found Clarkson's car had 120 miles of fuel left, giving the Jaguar a range of nearly 900 miles. Hammond and May both conceded that despite the Polo arriving first, the Jaguar was to be declared the \\"real\\" winner.May: \\"We have to acknowledge though, that the true hero of this whole piece is that Jaguar.\\" Clarkson: \\"Yeah, I couldn't agree more\\" Winner: VW Polo Bluemotion (Jaguar XJ by agreement) DVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 12 box set. = Ferrari Daytona vs. Powerboat ‚Äì Distance 206 miles= Series Twelve, Episode Five (30 November 2008) Hammond drove a Ferrari Daytona against May and his co-driver in an XSR 48 powerboat from Portofino to Saint-Tropez. Both were stopped by the Italian police at different points to check documents, but Hammond was forced to follow the police to a nearby police station, whereas May did not; this probably led to May winning the race. Winner: Boat DVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 12 box set. It was also released as part of the Top Gear: The Challenges 4 DVD. =London to Edinburgh ‚Äì Race to the North ‚Äì Jaguar XK120 vs. Vincent Black Shadow vs. Tornado locomotive ‚Äì Distance 378 miles= Series Thirteen, Episode One (21 June 2009) Tornado on the Race to the North, 25 April 2009. On 25 April 2009, the BBC filmed a private charter train hauled by the brand new steam locomotive 60163 Tornado. Clarkson (on the train) raced May (in a 1949 Jaguar XK120) and Hammond (on a 1949 Vincent Black Shadow motorcycle) from London King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverley. Tornado completed the run in exactly 8 hours, with four stops for water, while May and Hammond were restricted to the A1 Road (as no motorways existed yet in 1949). Winner: Car DVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 13 box set. It was also released as part of the Top Gear: The Challenges 4 DVD. = Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 vs. French TGV ‚Äì Distance 814 miles= Series Nineteen, Episode Three (10 February 2013) Clarkson raced Hammond and May from Wembley Stadium to the San Siro in Milan, where the winner would get a free ticket to watch AC Milan play Anderlecht in the UEFA Champions League. Clarkson however was restricted to any car he liked which cost no more than ¬£35,000. He decided to drive a Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 while Hammond and May travelled by public transport. They took a combination of bus and commuter train to St. Pancras International, where they then took an early Eurostar train to Paris Gare du Nord. Clarkson meanwhile took the standard journey to Dover where he would catch a ferry across the English Channel to France. However, due to the advancements in public transport since the previous Top Gear long-distance race, all three presenters were aware that the train from St. Pancras to Paris was 20 minutes faster than on previous trips, whilst the ferry journey that the car had to make was now 40 minutes longer; with effectively an hour's advantage, May and Hammond therefore believed that the race was virtually over when they managed to be over 200 miles ahead of Clarkson when the car finally reached French soil. On arrival into Paris, Hammond and May took a metro train across the French capital to Gare de Lyon before taking a TGV to Milan. However, having to navigate the winding tracks around the French Alps meant their speed slowed considerably which allowed Clarkson to catch up. He was virtually neck and neck with the train by the time he was closing in on the Mont Blanc tunnel. However, extensive French roadworks in front of the Mont Blanc tunnel that Clarkson later attested lasted for over 100km, slowed Clarkson significantly, allowing Hammond and May to build up their lead again. They then took the Milan Metro to Lotto Fiera before running to the stadium. With only one ticket up for grabs, Hammond and May raced each other to the finish line. May, who refused to run on television, produced a foldable bicycle out of his bag in hopes of outpacing his colleague, but Hammond was still faster and took the ticket. Clarkson, who had also been hampered by match-day traffic, finished behind both of his colleagues. This is the only Top Gear long-distance race in which car is beaten by public transport. Winner: Train DVD Release: This race was released as part of the Season 19 box set. = Toyota Auris 1.8L vs. AC45 Sailing Boat ‚Äì Distance 410 miles= Series Twenty, Episode One (30 June 2013) Clarkson tried to prove that fossil fuels are still superior to alternatives, and raced a blue 1.8L Toyota Auris against May in an AC45 Sailing Boat, helmed by Olympian Ben Ainslie, and crewed by America's Cup winners. The race was in New Zealand, from Fletcher Bay at the top of the Coromandel Peninsula to Spirits Bay in Northland. When a baffled May questioned his choice of vehicle, Clarkson explained that it was a hire car, which he claimed made it the fastest in the world because he could redline it until he crashed it. Clarkson had to drive south on the Coromandel Peninsula before he could turn north towards Northland, making his journey 410 miles, over May's direct route of 220 miles. During the race Clarkson heavily abused his car and rendered it undriveable after crashing into a stone wall to avoid a tractor. He was forced to stop, visit a hire car centre, and exchange his broken Auris for another ‚Äì then hope that May did not notice that his car was now red. May was constantly battered by the rough seas, and lost his satellite phone during the race after being hit by a large wave. Despite trying to make up ground by using 90 Mile Beach, Clarkson was beaten to the finish line by May, who had a lead of an hour over the car. Also, May noticed that the car was no longer blue at the end of the race. Winner: Sailing Boat = St. Petersburg Race ‚Äì Car vs. Bicycle vs. Hovercraft vs. Public Transport ‚Äì Distance 18 miles= Series Twenty Two, Episode One (25 January 2015) The presenters decide to redo the race they did in London between all of them, this time travelling across St. Petersburg. Clarkson selects a hovercraft, Hammond chooses a ¬£9,000 (Pinarello Dogma F8) bicycle, May picks a Renault Twizy, and the Stig again relies on public transport. From the start, neither Hammond or Clarkson have it easy with their choice of transport. Clarkson found driving his hovercraft ‚Äì which he called a Russian design of the presenters' Hovervan ‚Äì to be quite difficult; along with his instruments and controls being in Russian, he could not keep the craft pointing forward or in a straight line. Meanwhile, Hammond, while managing to overtake and then be overtaken by May, ran afoul of the city's tramlines. Hammond caught a wheel in one of the rails and fell, shearing off the bicycle's derailleur and rendering it useless. The others continued racing and Hammond soon re-entered the race on a second bike, which was borrowed from a passer-by (who was given a lift to his work as compensation). May, meanwhile, suffered no issues whatsoever, and so was able to enjoy the car he was driving. He remarked how he liked the fact that it was designed for European cities, having two seats in tandem, an electric engine, and scissor doors. However, as he reached the city-centre, he discovered that the city's streets and roads were much wider than he expected them to be. Clarkson, who managed to gain the lead despite the handling issues, soon hit the city-centre, where he attempted to use narrow, peaceful canals to avoid the heavy river traffic he encountered. Unfortunately for him, this led him towards low bridges instead, which required him to deflate the hovercraft's skirts repeatedly to squeeze under the bridges. Although his new bicycle was slower and less comfortable than his first mount, Hammond began to catch up to May and Clarkson. Clarkson and Hammond soon reached the finish line, with Hammond coming in just moments after Clarkson, only to find that both had been beaten by May, who was waiting in hiding for them. While they commented that the car had redeemed itself in the race, they realised that one of them was missing. The Stig, who had suffered no major issues when using public transport, failed to finish in the end: he had spotted a Porsche 911 and was banging his helmet against the fence that protected it. Winner: Car = Arabian Peninsula Race ‚Äì Car vs. Alternative \\"money no-object\\" transportation: Sports Bike, Private Jet, Luxury Car and Motorboat = Series Twenty Four, Episode Four (26 March 2017) Matt and Harris are competing against each other in a race from Dubai to a mountaintop hotel in Oman. Harris drives the Bugatti Chiron while Matt takes a combination of luxury transports: a motorboat, a luxury car, a private jet and a sports bike. Early in the race, Harris faced rush hour traffic while Matt was stuck on a 5-knot speed limit zone. As traffic cleared, Harris was escorted out of Dubai by the Dubai Police Force while Matt cleared the marina, enabling him to get the boat to speed before entering the second stage, which was being chauffeured in a Bentley Mulsanne EWB by the Stig's \\"Emirati cousin\\", but is stuck in Dubai's downtown district, falling 100 miles behind Harris. However, Harris was stuck immediately upon entering Oman as the Chiron had to be re-registered while Matt arrived at the airport to board the HondaJet to Muscat, enabling him to gain significant ground despite the 100-mile distance between Muscat and the finish line. Meanwhile, Harris attempts to take a shortcut through a network of alleyways at a town, slowing his progress significantly. In Muscat, Matt's entered the fourth and final stage of his journey, riding the Ducati 1299 Superleggera. At the final leg of the race, both entered the mountains from opposite direction, leading to a tense final sprint.

The roles of functional managers can be defined by obligation and authorities: * Obligation means functional managers have to evaluate and assess the overall effectiveness and also give pertinent suggestion about resources allocation. They also have responsibility to make sure that the performance of their functions has been improved continuously and also to enhance cross-function integration. * Authorities refer the rights of functional managers to establish specific standards and prescribe training and reporting, thus to help the compliance of the organisation's policies and requirements. The skills of functional managers To achieve an organisation's objectives, functional managers need a number of specific skills‚Äîfor example: communication skills, decision making skills, and interpersonal skills. *Technical skills are essential for functional managers, because they require specific knowledge and capabilities to accomplish their tasks. *Communication skills refer to functional manager's ability to transfer the information to others effectively and efficiently. Functional managers need to convey information to subordinates so that subordinates are able to understand what is expected from higher authorities. Once they better understand overall goals and requirements, they work with colleagues to achieve the organisation's goals. *Decision making skills require functional managers to have the ability to weight the positives and negatives of each decision. Moreover, this skill also require functional managers to recognize problems and opportunities quickly and correctly, then they should take appropriate actions to solve the problems or capitalize the opportunities. *Functional managers also need interpersonal skills because they need to get along with people within or outside of their function, for example, senior managers or investors.

Functional managers are accountable to manage people with specific skills and different resources within a department or section to meet functional objectives as well as corporate objectives. Project managers must bring people together from different functions and specific skills to accomplish specialized tasks within a required time. Sometimes, both functional managers and project managers have to work together to share resources and experience .

P.O.X. stands for ‚ÄúPsychobilly Orchestra X‚Äù.  Band history  The P.O.X. was founded 1982 in Hanover (Germany) by the singer and guitarist Beaker Pox (Mathias B√∂ker) and the drummer Slin Pox (Nils Enghusen). It belongs to the first wave of psychobilly bands, and is the first band of the genre in Germany. In 1983 the guitarist and songwriter Carl Pox (Karl-Heinz \\"Kalle\\" Schmidt) completed the final band formation, and in 1984 the band struck a record deal with Wahnsinn Records (Hamburg), releasing the mini LP It's So Dark. International concerts followed, and their next album Voodoo Power was released on the Dutch label KIX4U. In November 1986, the group disbanded after a European tour. In the following years, the P.O.X. still played at various international psychobilly festivals with the line up Beaker Pox, Carl Pox and Jake Pox, but in 1991 the band finally stopped playing live. In 2008, Beaker and Carl Pox revived the band to celebrate a comeback at the Psychomania Rumble Festival in Potsdam. After P.O.X., Nils Enghusen became a member of Celebrate the Nun (as Slin Thompson). He also leads the music school \\"Fit in Music\\" in Garbsen. \\"Fit in Music\\", Garbsen music school  Influences  The P.O.X. mostly played without the usual double bass and replaced the upright bass through electric bass or omitted the bass completely. With the introduction of a strongly distorted rhythm guitar, the P.O.X. brought in a further style element which was still uncommon in psychobilly in 1984. In connection with likewise atypically distorted singing resulted in the characteristic P.O.X. sound, which distinguished itself clearly from the traditional psychobilly sound of a slap bass dominated band. Starting from 1985, the P.O.X. used also MIDI and samples, which again represented an innovation in the scene. The P.O.X. produced the intro track for the Voodoo Power demo and studio production together with producer Yak Bondy. P.O.X's arrangements differ from the predominant blues pattern of early psychobilly; the song ‚ÄúIt's So Dark‚Äù is composed and arranged more in the style of new wave or early gothic rock in the style of Bauhaus, rather than being classical \\"old school\\" psychobilly. While modern psychobilly shows playful aspects in the song lyrics and stage shows, P.O.X. consider psychobilly to be a style of expression for the dark sides of human nature. The shows include visual elements of music and text using morbid references of animal blood or skeletons, as well as transvestite elements echoing The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The P.O.X. were considered influential in introducing psychobilly to other music genres.  Concerts  * 1985 1. International Psychobilly Festival in Hamburg, Fabrik, 19.01.1985.

In the Ashkenazic tradition, it is recited on all fast days; in the Sephardic tradition only because it is recited for the Ten Days of Repentance does it occur on the fast days of Yom Kippur and the Fast of Gedaliah.Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) s.v. Avinu Malkaynu, page 56. Joseph H. Hertz (died 1946), chief rabbi of the British Empire, described it as \\"the oldest and most moving of all the litanies of the Jewish Year.\\"Hertz, Joseph H., The Authorized Daily Prayer Book with commentary, introductions and notes (rev. American ed. 1948, NY, Bloch Publ'g) page 161. It makes use of two sobriquets for God that appear separately in the Bible; \\"Our Father\\" (Isaiah 63:16) and \\"Our King\\" (Isaiah 33:22). History The Talmud records Rabbi Akiva (died 135 CE) reciting two verses each beginning \\"Our Father, Our King\\" in a prayer to end a drought (apparently successfully).T.B. Ta'anith 25b In a much later compilation of Talmudic notes, published circa 1515, this is expanded to five verses. It is very probable that, at first, there was no set number of verses, no sequence, nor perhaps any fixed text. Apparently an early version had the verses in alphabetic sequence, which would mean 22 verses. The prayer book of Amram Gaon (9th century) had 25 verses.Jacobson, B.S., Days of Awe (orig. 1936, Engl. transl. 1978, Tel-Aviv, Sinai Publ'g) page 102. Mahzor Vitry (early 12th century) has more than 40 verses and added the explanation that the prayer accumulated additional verses that were added ad hoc on various occasions and thereafter retained.Gold, Avi, and Scherman, Nosson, Yom Kippur - Its Significance, Laws and Prayers (1989, Brooklyn, Mesorah Publ'ns Ltd.) page 142. Presently, the Sephardic tradition has 29 verses, among the Mizrahi Jews the Syrian tradition has 31 or 32 verses, but the Yemenite has only 27 verses, the Salonika as many as 53 verses, the Ashkenazic has 38 verses, the Polish tradition has 44 verses, all with different sequences. And within traditions, some verses change depending on the occasion, such as the Ten Days of Repentance, including Rosh Hashana and the bulk of Yom Kippur (when it is generally said kotvenu - \\"inscribe us\\"), or the Ne'ila Yom Kippur service (chotmenu - \\"seal us\\"), or a lesser fast day (zokhreinu - \\"remember us\\").Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) s.v. Avinu Malkaynu, pages 56 & 58; Abrahams, Israel, Companion to the Authorised Daily Prayer Book (2nd ed. 1922, London, Eyre & Spottiswoode) page [73]; Gelbard, Shmuel P., Rite and Reason: 1050 Jewish customs and their sources (Engl. transl. 1998, Petach Tikvah, Isr., Mifal Rashi Publ'g) pages 560-561. Practice Each line of the prayer begins with the words \\"Avinu Malkeinu\\" [\\"Our Father, Our King\\"] and is then followed by varying phrases, mostly supplicatory. There is often a slow, chanting, repetitive aspect to the melody to represent the pious pleading within the prayer. There are 54 such verses. Verses 15-23 are recited responsively, first by the leader and then repeated by the congregation. The reader also reads the last verse aloud (and sometimes it is sung by the entire congregation) but, traditionally, in a whisper, as it is a supplication.Gelbard, Shmuel P., Rite and Reason: 1050 Jewish customs and their sources (Engl. transl. 1998, Petach Tikvah, Isr., Mifal Rashi Publ'g) pages 560-561; Nulman, Macy, Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer (1993, NJ, Jason Aronson) s.v. Avinu Malkaynu, page 57. On most days when Avinu Malkeinu is recited, it is included during Shacharit and Mincha on that day. It is omitted at Mincha on Fridays. On Erev Yom Kippur it is not recited at Mincha but some congregations do recite it in the morning when it falls on Friday. On Yom Kippur, Avinu Malkeinu is also recited during Maariv and Ne'ila, except when Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat in the Ashkenazi tradition, in which case Avinu Malkeinu is recited during Ne'ila only. During the Avinu Malkenu, the Ark is opened, and at the end of the prayer, the Ark is closed. In the Sephardic tradition the Ark is not opened, and each community follows received customs about whether to say it on Shabbat.Yaakov Chaim Sofer, Kaf Hayaim OH 484:1 s\\"k 8 ◊ï◊û◊®◊ü ◊ñ\\"◊ú ◊©◊ú◊ê ◊õ◊™◊ë ◊ñ◊î ◊ë◊©\\"◊¢ ◊†◊®◊ê◊î ◊û◊©◊ï◊ù ◊©◊õ◊™◊ë ◊ë◊ë\\"◊ô ◊ë◊©◊ù ◊î◊®◊©◊ë\\"◊• ◊ì◊õ◊ú ◊ê◊ú◊ï ◊î◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô◊ù ◊™◊ú◊ï◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊û◊†◊î◊í ◊ï◊õ◊ï', ◊ï◊¢\\"◊õ ◊î◊†◊ô◊ó ◊ñ◊î ◊¢◊ú ◊î◊û◊†◊î◊í ◊©◊õ◊ú ◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊ô◊¢◊©◊î ◊õ◊û◊†◊î◊í◊ï ◊ï◊¢\\"◊õ ◊ú◊ê ◊î◊ï◊¶◊®◊ö ◊ú◊î◊¢◊ú◊ï◊™◊ï ◊¢◊ú ◊î◊©◊ú◊ó◊ü. ◊†◊û◊¶◊ê ◊ì◊û◊†◊î◊í ◊ê◊©◊õ◊†◊ñ ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊õ◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô ◊û◊ï◊®\\"◊ù ◊ñ\\"◊ú ◊©◊ú◊ê ◊ú◊ê◊ï◊û◊®◊ï ◊ë◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ï◊û◊†◊î◊í ◊ë◊†◊ô ◊°◊§◊®◊ì ◊ô◊© ◊õ◊ö ◊ï◊ô◊© ◊õ◊ö ◊ï◊†◊î◊®◊ê ◊†◊î◊®◊ê ◊ï◊§◊©◊ò◊ô◊î Throughout the Ten Days of Repentance, five lines of Avinu Malkeinu that refer to various heavenly books include the word Kotveinu (\\"Inscribe us\\"). During Ne'ila, this is replaced with Chotmeinu (\\"Seal us\\"). This reflects the belief that on Rosh Hashanah all is written and revealed and on Yom Kippur all decrees for the coming year are sealed. When recited on Fast Days (other than the Fast of Gedaliah which falls in the days of Penitence) the phrase Barech Aleinu (\\"bless us\\") in the 4th verse is recited instead of the usual Chadesh Aleinu (\\"renew us\\"), and \\"Zochreinu\\" (remember us) is recited in verses 19-23 in place of \\"Kotveinu B'Sefer\\" (inscribe us in the book). Fast Days on which it is not recited (by any custom) are Tisha B'Av, the afternoon of the Fast of Esther except when it is brought forward (thus not falling immediately before Purim) and when the 10th of Tevet falls on a Friday it is omitted at Mincha (as is usual on a Friday). Sephardic Jews do not recite Avinu Malkeinu on fast days (except those that fall in the days of Penitence). Instead, a series of Selichot prayers specific to the day are recited. In the interests of gender neutrality, the UK Liberal Jewish prayer-book for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur (Machzor Ruach Chadashah) translates the epithet as \\"Our Creator, Our Sovereign\\". It also contains a contemporary prayer based on Avinu Malkeinu in which the feminine noun Shekhinah is featured. The Reform Jewish High Holy Days prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh, released in 2015 and intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah, includes a version of Avinu Malkeinu that refers to God as both \\"Loving Father\\" and \\"Compassionate Mother.\\" In popular culture In 2018, composer Henry Panion, III incorporates the main theme into his Dreams of Hope for Solo Violin & Orchestra, commissioned for performance by violinist Caitlin Edwards and premiered during the opening of Violins of Hope Birmingham at the historic 16th Street Baptist Church, the site of the infamous bombing that killed the Four Little Girls in 1963. The band Mogwai's instrumental My Father My King is a setting of the main melody to Avinu Malkeinu. The duo Shlomit & RebbeSoul (Bruce Burger and Shlomit Levi) perform an acoustic version on their debut album, The Seal Of Solomon (2015), https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S96BIVC/ref=dm_ws_sp_ps_dp while Burger himself has included a version of the song on nearly all of his albums. The band Phish plays the song in a 5/4 time signature (titled \\"Avenu Malkenu\\")., most recently at Nassau Coliseum on December 1, 2019. Barbra Streisand sings the song. (There is a remix by Offer Nissim) In the 1992 film School Ties, the headmaster of the WASP elitist prep school walks in on David Greene reciting Avinu Malkeinu on Rosh Hashanah. (David is a Jewish student on an athletic scholarship to the school who deals with antisemitism by practicing Judaism clandestinely). It must be added that the WASP headmaster shows a profound understanding of the spiritual and ethical import of the Jewish High Holidays. The prayer appears on the 2002 album Zero Church by sisters Suzzy and Maggie Roche as \\"Aveenu Malcainu\\". The singer/songwriter Lior also performs the song at many of his live concerts. It is recorded on his live album, Doorways of My Mind\\" (2006). Singer Lena M√•ndotter recorded \\"Avinu Malkeinu\\" on her album Songs from the River (Rootsy/Warner Music, 2009). In 2013, Stephen DeCesare, a Roman Catholic composer, wrote a version dedicated to Cantor Fred Scheff of Temple Shalom in Middletown, Rhode Island. The Israeli heavy metal band Orphaned Land incorporates Avinu Malkeinu into their song \\"Our Own Messiah\\" from their 2013 album All Is One. Composer/singer Rebecca Teplow wrote a version of Avinu Malkeinu in 2017. In 2017, Benzion Miller's version of Avinu Malkeinu was featured in the 5th episode of season three of the television show The Leftovers. American Belz Hasidic singer Shulem Lemmer covered the song, in his album The Perfect Dream, released in 2019.Elisa Bray (October 7, 2018). \\"The voice from the Belz; A Belz Chasid from Brooklyn's life changed forever when the CEO of the classical arm of Universal Records stumbled across his Youtube video,\\" The JC. In July 2020, Rabbi David Lau the Chief Rabbi of Israel along with renowned Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky announced that the Avinu Malkeinu prayer shall be recited twice a day by Shacharit and by Mincha in light of the spread of Coronavirus in Israel .

As both it common names and specific epithet suggest, the cup-shaped fruiting bodies are violet colored on the interior surface. P. violacea is typically found growing on burnt soil.  Description  Fruiting bodies are initially almost spherical, then cup-shaped, then expanding to being somewhat flattened in age. They do not have a stem (or at most a short, narrowed version), and may be up to wide by 1‚Äì1.5 cm tall, although they are often much smaller. The inner spore-bearing surface of the cup, the hymenium, is pale violet to reddish violet in color, often centrally depressed and slightly wrinkled. The flesh is thin (0.5‚Äì2.0 mm thick) and pale purple. The exterior surface is paler than the interior, somewhat grayish, and may be pruinose near the margins‚Äîhaving a very fine whitish powder on the surface. The odor and taste are not distinctive. = Microscopic characteristics = The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, without any oil droplets (eguttulate), with dimensions of 16‚Äì17 √ó 8‚Äì10 ¬µm.

In general, Peziza praetervisa is more purple- rather than violet-colored like P. violacea. However, fruiting body color can vary depending on humidity and other factors, so they are more reliably distinguished microscopically‚ÄîP. praetervisa has rough, not smooth spores with two polar oil drops.

History Historical plaque in Rehaniya The Circassians arrived in the Middle East after they were pushed out of their homeland in the North Caucasus. The Circassians, who fought during the long period wherein the Russians captured the northern Caucasus, were massacred and expelled by Tsarist Russia from the Caucasus in an incident that became known as the Circassian Holocaust. The Ottoman Empire absorbed them in their territory, and settled them in sparsely populated areas, including the Galilee in Beirut Vilayet (Ottoman Syria). The area where they settled was called Burak Alma (\\"Pools of Alma\\").Palmer, 1881, p. 70 The village of Rehaniya was established in 1873, but only in 1878 did Circassian families arrive from the Abazah tribe in the northern Caucasus, a region where today is located the Adygea and Karachay‚ÄìCherkessia in the Russian Federation.

In the village there is a mosque in the style of Circassian mosques in the Caucasus, and substantially different from Arab mosques. Also, the village contains a museum and a center for Circassian heritage. In 1948, during Operation Hiram (29‚Äì31 October), the villagers surrendered to the advancing Israeli army and were allowed to remain in the village. In November 1949, a plan to evict the villagers, as well as those from five other villages along the border with Lebanon, was presented to the Israeli cabinet. The proposals were strongly supported by the IDF, but the plan was vetoed by the Foreign Ministry who were worried about the possible international response. The village remained under Martial Law until 1966. Rehaniya is one of two predominantly-Circassian villages in Israel. The other one is Kfar Kama.

He represented England in cross country racing at the Commonwealth Games in 2002 where he came 3rd, and became Commonwealth Champion in 2006. He has won the British Mountain Biking National Champion over five consecutive years; 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. He competed for Great Britain at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics and was chosen as the sole male cross-country rider for the British team for the London Games in 2012. Early life Killeen had been interested in cycling from a young age, but a trip to the Malvern Classic introduced him to cross-country cycling when he was about thirteen. He had previously been interested in motocross. Career Killeen competing in the British Cycling National Trophy, 2010 Having won multiple titles both at the junior and Under-23 levels, he competed at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, where he took the bronze medal. Despite having won his first major medal at the international level, he continued to compete in Under-23 events, winning the silver medal at the Under-23 World Championship in 2004. Prior to the 2004 Summer Olympics, he won the test event on the Olympic track in Greece. Competing in the Games themselves for the British team, he was held up by a crash early on in the race and ended up finishing in fifth place, outside of the medal spots. He returned to the English team at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia. Having placed third at the previous Games, he went two places better, taking the gold medal for his country. In 2007, he suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome and could not compete for an entire season. He competed once more for the British team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and was considered one of the favourites for the gold medal. Only into the race, his handlebars clipped a race marker, flipping him over the bars and off the bike. This left him in last place chasing the rest of the pack, but he managed to move up to seventh place by the finish. He did not get the chance to defend his gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games as mountain biking had been dropped from the games, replaced by archery in the schedule. He considered a switch to road racing to take part in the Games. He was selected as part of the British team to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, where he hoped to achieve a podium finish, but crashed out on the second lap of the race. He was the only athlete competing for Britain in the men's cross country. As part of his training, he conducted practice runs at the Olympic track near Southend. He competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, finishing in 6th place.

In 1738 while the granite embankment of Moyka was being established, the wooden pedestrian bridge was built. It had a raising part to allow passage of mast ships. The wooden bridge was painted in different colours, and therefore was named Coloured Bridge. In 1768 the bridge was reconstructed to accommodate horse traffic. At this time the structure was changed to three-span bridge standing on stone supports.

The native region of these sheep is the Tarn and Aveyron departments and surrounding areas. This region is collectively known as the \\"Roquefort Sector\\" which references the milk collection area. The Lacaune is the most widely used dairying sheep breed in France, with a population of about 800,000 ewes. Notably, it is the predominant breed used in the production of Roquefort cheese in France.Sheep dairying in France, by Francis Barillet (1995). Downloadable  History  Sheep first came to that region of France around 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. The land was rough and desolate but the sheep could adapt well to it. In the mid-19th century, farmers began to add genetics from other local breeds to produce a hardy breed of sheep that produced a rich milk and good meat. This was the development of the dual-purpose breed of original Lacaune. The Lacaune has been used as a milking sheep in France for a very long time, but milking wasn't the dominant feature of the breed until recently. In the late 1960s, the average milk yield per ewe was only about 70 liters during the human milking period (and excluding the lamb suckling period) per annum. Remarkably, by the late 1990s the milk yield had quadrupled to 280 liters per annum. The Lacaune is now one of the world's high-yielding milk breeds. This was the result of a large- scale, rigorous selection program organized by a French government agency. This program included artificial insemination of several million ewes over the years, a vast array of government support for recording the performance of the progeny on many farms with respect to the milk yield and other outcomes, improved knowledge about animal management and nutrition for sheep milk production, and the willingness of many farmers to participate in the program and take advantage of what was being learned. The combination of these and other factors brought about an improvement of 6.3% per year in milk yield per ewe in the breed over the 30-year period. The 6.3% gain is decomposable to \\"a phenotypic gain of 3.9% (better management and nutrition) and a genetic gain of 2.4%. Since 1995 the phenotypic gain has been negligible.\\"\\"Improving Lactation Through Genetics\\", a chapter in the book Principles of sheep dairying in North America, published by Cooperative Extension of the University of Wisconsin-Extension (2004). Greater details about the large- scale Lacaune breeding program in France are available at Genetic improvement of dairy sheep in Europe, by Francis Barillet, 1995 . The success of the large-scale breeding program has not resulted in the extinction of the pre- existing, lower-milk-yielding Lacaunes.  Breed characteristics  When compared to other sheep primarily used for their milk, the Lacaune are a much hardier breed of dairy sheep. The breed is less prone to diseases but crossbreeding for hybrid vigor is still recommended to reduce the amount of incidences of disease in lambs. They also do not have as high of birth rates as other dairy sheep. They produce less milk than other breeds such as East Friesian but their milk has a higher fat and protein content which produces a higher yield when making cheese. The breed is polled (hornless) and are able to resist very large swings in temperature. They weigh between . The breed is well fit for harsh terrain with small hooves that can navigate the rocky hillside. Wool production in this breed is not very prominent either. Many Lacaune sheep have very little wool and their head, legs, and sometimes whole belly is bare. Their double coat of wool is able to shed one layer in the summer so they can keep cool. The Lacaune sheep are usually white in colour. Their heads are elongated and the snout is slightly rounded. Their ears slope downwards and are a bit floppy compared to other breeds. These sheep also have a quite bold temperament and are less docile than other dairy breeds of sheep. When being milked, Lacaune sheep have an oxytocin release that is higher than other breeds with teat stimulation. This means that the milk will be let down easier in Lacaune sheep than in other dairy breeds of sheep. This breed also has a shorter average time to reach the peak rate of flow due to this. The time to reach peak flow also decreases later in lactation. Lacaune have a smaller area in their gland cistern of their udder than other dairy sheep breeds like East Friesian. This means that the stripping yield of the Lacaune sheep is not as high as in other breeds. They also have the highest udder depth of all the milking sheep breeds which correlates to their higher productivity. Lacaune sheep out to pasture.  Production System  Due to the surrounding landscape, Lacaune dairy sheep are most adapted to pasture management. Due to the intensification of the dairy production systems, Lacaune sheep spend part of the year in the sheepfold. The first few weeks of milking take place in the sheepfold but sheep are let out into the pasture during the day. Lacaune sheep are the second highest producing dairy sheep breed in the world. One study showed that Lacaune have a higher production in the beginning of lactation than at the end compared to other breeds. It also showed that this breed has a higher average flow rate and higher peak flow rate. Lambing takes place once a year, near the end of the year (November to January). Lambs are allowed to suckle for 5 weeks and then are weaned off so the ewes' milk can be used for production of Roquefort cheese. Lambs produced that are not being used as replacements for the dairy herd are sent to the market. Due to the lambing time, Lacaune lambs are usually the first to arrive on the market each year. As in most dairy breeds and animals, mastitis is one of the major causes of culling in herds and flocks. Not as much research has been done on the genetic aspects of intramammary infections in sheep. More genetic testing for mastitis resistance needs to be carried out to improve genetics in the Lacaune sheep breed and their milk quality.  Selection program  The breed began as a dual purpose breed with a low milk production. In the 1980s, the Lacaune genetic improvement program was established. This program wanted to improve the breed as a whole and have the Lacaune sheep be able to compete against foreign breeds that were not as adapted to the environment. Focus was put mainly on increasing the milk production of the breed. This program utilized artificial insemination, milk recording, and progeny testing sires. It started with genomic selection in a few nucleus flocks of sheep. Intensive management and testing were done with these sheep that produced, after a few generations, breeding rams that were able to transfer their genetics to the rest of the populations through mainly artificial insemination. This pyramidal management breeding system is how the improvement of the breed was implemented. There was a slight delay between the original nucleus population and the rest of the commercial population of around 5‚Äì7 years. Today, the program has expanded its focus to improving other important aspects such as udder quality, lower somatic cell counts, and milk components. Since the program began, there has been an improvement of over 5 L per lactation, 0.19 g/L of fat content, and 0.17 g/L of crude protein content. The Lacaune breed, due to this extensive program, has the most studied genetics than any dairy sheep breed in the world. One of the reasons that this programs became so successful was the intense decrease in the cost of genotyping and sequencing the genome in animals. This information is very useful in selecting for physical traits as well as other traits such as scrapie resistance.  Milk and cheese  The milk of the Lacaune is described usually as wholesome with a high butterfat and protein content and rich flavour. The butterfat content of the milk makes it good for producing many different types of cheese. The main use of the Lacaune sheep is for production of Roquefort cheese. Theirs is the only milk is used to produce the cheese. Roquefort is a blue cheese that is usually made from the unpasteurized milk of Lacaune sheep. The semi-soft cheese usually has a creamy and crumbly texture.

In 1927, with performers beginning to achieve national stardom through various media, the ballroom was added to adapt to the changing nature of entertainment. The new owners wanted a facility that could hold 5,000 people, and thus the Casino Ballroom was born. After the expansion, the Casino Ballroom boasted the largest dance floor in New England, and 20,000 people made use of the massive space on a weekly basis that hosted acts such as Bing Crosby and Duke Ellington.Trodson, Lars. \\"Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom: A Century of Entertainment Excellence\\", 25-29 May 1999.

The owners at the time sold the facility to a consortium of local businessmen interested in restoring it to its former glory. After renovating the facility and restoring many of its original features, the Ballroom reopened in the 1970s as Club Casino. Renovations, however, were not enough to draw promoters back to the venue. Seeing an opportunity, one of the new owners sought to book then-little-known names such as U2 and aging stars such as Ray Charles as a way of restoring the venue's reputation. His bet paid off, and following another renovation in the late '70s and early '80s, Club Casino began booking the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Melissa Etheridge and Phish. So popular was the location, in fact, that it was able to fit 50 events into a three-month period, unheard of at the time for most music halls. In the 1990s, the club started to develop a reputation for tough bouncers and strict rules against dancing. Again, changes were made to the Club Casino. In an attempt to regain some of its past glory, the name was changed back to the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, the facade of the building was redone, and the adjacent hotel demolished.

He was a nephew of Leonidas Polk. Early life Polk was born in Salisbury, North Carolina. When he was two years of age, the family moved near Columbia, Tennessee. Polk attended the University of Virginia in 1850-51, before settling in Helena, Arkansas, where he was a planter. Civil War In 1861, Polk enlisted in the Yell Rifles as a private under Patrick Cleburne, who he served under during most of the War. At the Battle of Shiloh, then Junior Second Lieutenant Polk was wounded in the face. He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Arkansas Infantry Regiment following Shiloh. When Cleburne was promoted to divisional command, Polk was appointed brigadier general to date from December 13, 1862. Polk took part in fighting at Stones River, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and in the Atlanta Campaign. In June 1864, Polk was severely wounded (the fourth time during the war) at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain and was honorably discharged from the Army. Post-war career Polk returned to Columbia after his wounding at Kennesaw. He served as a delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In 1887 he was elected to the Tennessee Senate. Death and legacy Polk received high praise from Confederate soldier Sam Watkins, who wrote of him in his book Co. Aytch: \\"In every battle he was engaged in, he led his men to victory, or held the enemy at bay, while the surge of battle was against us; he always seemed the successful general, who would snatch victory out of the very jaws of defeat. In every battle, Polk's brigade, of Cleburne's division, almost making the name of Cleburne as the Stonewall of the West. Polk was to Cleburne what Murat or the Old Guard was to Napoleon.\\" Polk died in Columbia, Tennessee, and is buried at St. John's Church Cemetery at nearby Ashwood.

Olvir Hnufa or √ñlvir hn√∫fa was a Norwegian commander in a clan and poet of the late ninth and early tenth centuries, known from, among other sources, Egil's Saga, Skaldatal and the Prose Edda. Olvir was the son of the viking Berle-Kari and brother-in-law of Kveldulf Bjalfason, who married Olvir's sister Salbjorg Karadottir; he was thus uncle to Skallagrim and Thorolf Kveldulfsson and great uncle to the famous poet Egil Skallagrimsson. Olvir also had a brother named Eyvind Lambi.Egil's Saga ¬ß 1 (Thorsson 8). In Egil's Saga, Olvir and Eyvind appear to be roughly the same age as Thorolf, despite being from different generations of the same family. Olvir was a prominent member of the court of King Harald Fairhair, who united Norway under his rule in the late ninth or early tenth century. Among other famous poets, he served as one of King Harald's court poets. He also served as a warrior in Harald's retinue, and fought at the pivotal Battle of Hafrsfjord on the king's flagship. He is best known for his involvement in the conflict between Harald and Olvir's kinsman Thorolf Kveldulfsson, which ended with the latter's death. Only a few fragments of Olvir's poetry survive.E.g., Vigfusson 26. Name The name √ñlvir has been defined as \\"priest of the shrine/sanctuary\\".Peterson, citing Widmark 1965, 1991 s. 48, 58, Kousg√•rd S√∏rensen 1989b s. 8, 11 f. notes that some scholars have considered it to contain a cognate of Gothic alhs (\\"temple\\") and that the original meaning would have been \\"priest of the sanctuary\\". His nickname \\"hnufa\\" is something of a mystery. It is sometimes translated as hump; it is unknown whether this described a physical condition. However, it can also mean \\"snub\\", as in snub-nosed. Vigfusson pointed out that under Nordic law, \\"'hnufa' refers to a bondmaid whose nose has been cut off for theft thrice repeated; as a nickname it must refer to some hurt\\" suffered by Olvir.Vigfusson 25; see also Cleasby 277.  Career  Most of Olvir Hnufa's life is covered in three sagas, Egil's saga, Skaldatal and Prose Edda. Egils saga spans the years 850-1000 and covers the saga of the ancestors of Egill Skallagr√≠msson, including Olvir Hnufa. Skaldatal are poetries from Prose Edda about court poets. Prose Edda is an saga from the 13th century about the norse mythology, which is used to explain poetry from that era. =Viking career= Olvir and Eyvind joined their nephew Thorolf Kveldulfsson on a number of Viking expeditions after the latter received a longship as a gift from his father Kveldulf. They gained a great deal of profit from such voyages.Egil's Saga ¬ß 1 (Thorsson 9). At a thing in Gaular, Olvir fell in love with Solveig Atladottir, the daughter of a jarl in Fjordane named Atli the Slender. The jarl refused Olvir permission to marry the girl, but he was so smitten that he abandoned his Viking life to be near her. A poet of some talent, he composed a number of love poems for Solveig.Egil's Saga ¬ß 2 (Thorsson 9). For reasons not revealed in Egil's Saga, but probably related to his courtship of Solveig, Olvir was attacked and nearly killed in his home by Solveig's brothers shortly after King Harald of Vestfold's conquest of M√∏re. Atli did not long survive this encounter; after Harald Fairhair conquered M√∏re and Fjordane he assigned the governance of the former to Rognvald Eysteinsson and the latter to H√°kon Grj√≥tgar√∞sson. H√°kon and Atli soon came into conflict over Sogn and fought a battle at Fjalir in Stafaness Bay, in which Hakon was killed. Atli was severely wounded in the battle and taken to a nearby island, where he died.Saga of Harald Fairhair ¬ß 12 (Hollander 69). =Life in Harald's court= Norway ca. 872 CE (with Harald's kingdom shown in red) before the defining Battle of Hafrsfjord. Fleeing his attackers, Olvir joined King Harald's retinue as a court poet, a post he would hold for many years along with such notables as √ûorbj√∂rn Hornklofi and √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir.Egil's Saga ¬ß 4 (Thorsson 11). Olvir mollified the king's rage when Kveldulf refused to come pay homage by convincing Thorolf to join Harald's clan, or armed retinue.Egil's Saga ¬ß¬ß 5‚Äì8 (Thorsson 12‚Äì17). Along with Thorolf and Eyvind Lambi, Olvir fought on Harald's ship at the Battle of Hafrsfjord (probably around 885). Over the years, both as a result of slander by Thorolf's enemies, and of Thorolf's growing popularity and power in northern Norway, Harald began to see him as a threat; despite Olvir's continuous attempts to ameliorate the deterioration in the relationship between the two.Egil's Saga ¬ß¬ß 13‚Äì16 (Thorsson 23‚Äì28). Even when the king attacked Thorolf's farm, Olvir still pleaded to save his kinsman's life. After Thorolf was killed by Harald, the king gave his body to Olvir for burial. Olvir tried to convince Harald to pay damages for Thorolf but the king consistently refused, claiming that Thorolf was a traitor. Ultimately, Olvir went to Fjordane to tell Kveldulf and Skallagrim Kveldulfsson of Thorolf's death. Skallagrim went with Olvir to King Harald after Thorolf's murder. He demanded payment for damages, which resulted in his being chased out of the king's court. Together with his father Kveldulf, and their kinsman Ketil Trout, Skalla-Grimr took revenge by killing those of Harald's servants who took part in Thorolf's killing before fleeing to Iceland.Egil's Saga ¬ß¬ß 22‚Äì27 (Thorsson 34‚Äì47). Following these events, Olvir begged Harald to permit him to leave the court and return to his own estate, saying that he had \\"no desire to sit with the men who murdered Thorolf\\". The king, however, refused, and, in the words of William Pencak, \\"Olvir, the would-be peacemaker who sold out to the king, is condemned to a life of praising his family's murderers.\\"Pencak 85. Olvir's subsequent fate is not recorded. There is no record of his ever having married or having had children.Jochens 357‚Äì392. The Hauksb√≥k contains a tale called the Skaldasaga Haralds harfagra (\\"Saga of the poets of Harald Fairhair\\") describing an expedition to Sweden undertaken by Olvir, Thorbjorn Hornklofi, and Audun Ill- skald to expiate an offense. Its historiocity is disputed.Islandica 63. =Poetry= Olvir is quoted by Snorri Sturluson in the Skaldskaparmal as having composed the following poetic fragment about the god Thor: \\"√Üstisk allra landa umbgj√∂r√∞ ok sonr Jar√∞ar.\\" (\\"The encircler of all lands [The Midgard Serpent or J√∂rmungandr ] and Iord's son [Thor] became violent.\\")Young ___. Another poetic fragment attributed to him in the Skaldatal reads: \\"Ma√∞r skyldi √æ√≥ molda megja hverr of √æegja kenni-sei√∞s √æ√≥ at kynni klepp-d√¶g H√°rrs l√¶gvar.\\" (\\"Yet every man should know how to hold his peace even though -\\").Vigfusson 26. William Pencak compared Olvir's poetic career unfavorably with that of his grandnephew Egil: \\"A tyrant needs insincere poets to praise him, and Olvir's career illustrates the problem of artists and thinkers serving political ends ... the saga does not quote any of his poems. First Olvir is the slave of a woman, then of a king. The difference between his poetry and Egil's will demonstrate the opportunities for talent a free society opens up.\\"Pencak 83.

It was one of the few adult westerns in the 1950s and is described as Othello on the Range.Articles - TCM.com Plot Jubal Troop (Glenn Ford) is a cowboy who is found in a weakened condition, without a horse. He is given shelter at Shep Horgan's (Ernest Borgnine) large ranch, where he quickly makes an enemy in Pinky (Rod Steiger), a cattleman who accuses Jubal of carrying the smell of sheep. Horgan is a cheerful, agreeable fellow who is married to an attractive, much younger woman named Mae (Valerie French) whom he met in Canada. He takes an immediate shine to Jubal and offers him a permanent job. Behind his back Mae also has taken a liking to Jubal, which she expresses to him in no uncertain terms. Horgan is impressed with Jubal's work ethic and makes him foreman over the other cowhands. That further antagonises Pinky, whom Horgan does not trust. Jubal fends off Mae's advances while developing an interest in Naomi (Felicia Farr), a young woman from a travelling wagon train of an unnamed religious group that the cowboys call \\"rawhiders.\\" Pinky and the other cowboys try to run off the strangers and resent Jubal's interference on their behalf. Jubal's only ally is a drifter named Reb (Charles Bronson), who has attached himself to the wagon train. On Jubal's recommendation Reb is hired to help him at the ranch. Pinky, who has carried on with Mae behind her husband's back, tells Horgan that his wife and Jubal have betrayed him. Horgan demands the truth from Mae, who angrily responds that she can't stand him and lies that Jubal has been seeing her. An enraged Horgan rides to town and confronts Jubal, intending to kill him. Reb flips a gun to Jubal just in time and Horgan is shot dead. Pinky makes another play for Mae, then beats her savagely when she pushes him away. Pinky then rallies the others to go after Jubal, persuading them that he stole Horgan's wife and murdered him. A posse gets the truth from a dying Mae, that her accusations toward Jubal were completely untrue. She also reveals, just before she dies, that Pinky beat her. The posse slowly circles Pinky and it's clear they intend to hang him. Jubal rides away with Naomi and Reb.

The current FDA approved sterilant gases are ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide and ozone. Other liquid sterilants, such as peracetic acid, may also be used for sterilization and may raise similar occupational health issues. Sterilization means the complete destruction of all biological life (including viruses and sporoidal forms of bacteria), and sterilization efficacy is typically considered adequate if less than one in a million microbes remain viable.  Hazards of sterilant gases  Since sterilant gases are selected to destroy a wide range of biological life forms, any gas which is suitable for sterilization will present a hazard to personnel exposed to it. NIOSH's IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) values for the three sterilant gases are 800 ppm (ethylene oxide), 75 ppm (hydrogen peroxide) and 5 ppm (ozone). For comparison, the IDLH of cyanide gas (hydrogen cyanide) is 50 ppm. The OSHA PEL (permissible exposure limit) will be considerably lower than this; 1 ppm for ethylene oxide, or 5 ppm for a 15 minute short-term exposure limit. Thus exposure to even low levels of sterilant gas should not be treated casually and most facilities go to great lengths to adequately protect their employees. In addition to toxicity, ethylene oxide is flammable (from above 3%) and ozone is damaging to equipment not designed to resist it. Sterilizer manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products as safe as possible but, as with any mechanical device, they can and sometimes do fail and leaks have been reported. The odor threshold for these gases is above the PELs and for ethylene oxide it is 500 ppm, approaching that of the IDLH. Odor is thus inadequate as a monitoring technique. Continuous gas monitors are used as part of an overall safety program to provide a prompt alert to nearby workers in the event that there is a leak of the sterilant gas. Monitoring equipment The monitor alarms are typically set to warn if the concentrations exceed the OSHA permissible exposure limits (PELs), 1.0 ppm for ethylene oxide29 CFR 1910.1047 and 1.0 and 0.1 ppm for hydrogen peroxide and ozone respectively.29 CFR 1910.1000, App. Z-1 The PELs are calculated as 8 hour time weighted average values (i.e. the average exposure over a typical shift).

He was the partner of established character Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), and a father-figure to her four children. Tony sexually abused Bianca's stepdaughter, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), and began grooming her school-friend Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan), before his predatory nature was uncovered and he was arrested for his crimes. Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 to stand trial. The child sexual abuse storyline marked the first time the subject matter had been broached in a UK soap opera, and was researched and developed with advice and approval from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The abusive nature of Tony and Whitney's relationship resulted in over 200 complaints being made to the BBC and television regulatory body Ofcom by members of the public, with the storyline deemed \\"one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted\\" by The Mirror's Beth Neil. The NSPCC however praised the storyline for \\"helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse\\". The storyline also gained EastEnders a Royal Television Society Programme Award in March 2009 in the Soap and Continuing Drama category. Storylines Patsy Palmer plays Bianca, Tony's partner and the adoptive mother of his victim Whitney Dean. After being released from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Tony joins his partner Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and her family in Walford, including her son Morgan Jackson-King, whom he has adopted. It is revealed that he is a paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star Peter Beale (Thomas Law). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter as a result of his growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her. Tony begins grooming fourteen-year-old Lauren Branning, supporting her when her mother Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father. He plans to take her to a concert, but Lauren's father Max Branning (Jake Wood) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing that they are going to leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband Ricky (Sid Owen) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions. Before his trial, Tony attempts suicide. Whitney tries to visit but is refused, and Bianca sees it as a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after the first day of the trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands. Over three years later, Whitney receives a note from Tony via one of his former prison friends, saying that he always loved her. Whitney attempts to visit Tony in prison, but she is told that he killed himself in his cell. Creation Tony was first mentioned in EastEnders in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year absence from the show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, Liam Butcher (James Forde) and Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, mixed-race Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival. Although Tony did not appear in the show until September 2008, his arrival was anticipated from April of that year, when EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer commented that the series was building a picture of his character, and that it would be interesting to see him on-screen. It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving Whitney. BBC News described the plot as an ongoing \\"predatory paedophile storyline\\", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera. An EastEnders spokesperson stated that programme-makers were working in close conjunction with the NSPCC in order to portray the subject matter accurately and sensitively, commenting that the show aims to raise awareness of real-life issues, and has in the past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence, rape and HIV. John Grounds, the NSPCC's director of communications, praised the soap for raising awareness of the issue. The storyline was first conceived when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed a documentary about homelessness, featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented \\"drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\\" Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained that: \\"I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise in the context of a family sitting room. [...] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits. But if a soap doesn't hold up that mirror, then actually, what is it? It will have no depth.\\" Development Coghill was cast as Tony on 20 June 2008. He deemed the role the most challenging he had ever played, but hoped that it would help to raise public awareness of child abuse. Of his off-screen relationship with McGarty, Coghill explained that it helped that she does not look or act like a young child, deeming her \\"fantastic to work with\\", as well as \\"very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress\\", commenting: \\"There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all.\\" Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Tony began grooming Whitney as soon as he met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's \\"hero figure\\" and \\"saviour\\". Coghill elucidated: \\"The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out.\\" As Tony began to lose interest in Whitney, he started grooming her 14-year-old school-friend Lauren Branning. A show-insider commented that Tony had been getting away with abusing Whitney for years, but was escalating as one young girl was no longer enough to satisfy him. Tony left the soap on 12 December 2008, after his true nature was exposed. It was announced on 7 September 2009 that he would return to EastEnders to be put on trial. Coghill was pleased to return, believing it right that Tony's story arc should conclude realistically, giving closure to the storyline and continuing to raise awareness of the issue. Santer commented: \\"One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years. Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will enable us to continue showing the long-term consequences of Tony's abuse of Whitney and ‚Äì I hope ‚Äì continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse.\\" Grounds praised Tony's trial, stating that it demonstrated the importance for children of having their abusers brought to justice. Palmer felt that: \\"If one person out there who's been abused saw that [the legal system] go out of their way to make it easier on the victim ‚Äì Whitney's evidence is given by video link ‚Äì it will be worth it.\\" Reception The BBC and television regulatory body Ofcom received upward of 90 complaints after Whitney's first scenes with Tony aired. However, they ruled that scenes the were not in breach of broadcasting rules. The Guardian's Aida Edemariam said of the beginning of the storyline: \\"what is most disturbing, watching [Tony and Whitney's] first scenes together, is not the sexuality of the situation per se, though that is uncomfortable - it's the subtle blackmail with which he keeps her in line. As it's combined with the emotional manipulation native to soaps, the viewer starts to feel a bit bullied, too\\". Numbers of viewer complaints rose within days to over 200. New Statesman journalist Jeremy Sare commented on the public outrage and defended EastEnders decision to air the storyline, writing: Sare quoted a BBC spokeswoman as saying: \\"we appreciate that for some viewers this storyline will have particular resonance and significance. In running it, it's certainly not our intention to cause distress or upset, either to those who've suffered from sexual abuse or their families. Our aim is instead to raise awareness of this very sensitive issue\\", concluding his article with the summation: \\"The producers‚Äô dilemma is instructive to children's charities and Ministers alike on how to confront the issue in a digestible manner which can stimulate an objective debate.\\" The Mirror's Beth Neil branded the plot strand \\"one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines EastEnders has ever attempted\\", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it to be a \\"new low\\" for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: \\"You've really got to hand it to EastEnders. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead.\\" Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as \\"totally bogus\\", observing that \\"At 7.30 or 8pm, the \\"action\\" has to be so coded as to be pointless\\". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders' \\"rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues\\", writing that: The Guardian's Julie Raeside has questioned: \\"Is this latest sexual abuse storyline a good thing to position in a pre-watershed soap opera, or should the EastEnders storyliners stick to a less controversial brand of misery?\\" However, in contrast to public and media dissent, the NSPCC's director of communications, John Grounds, has praised the storyline for \\"helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse\\", deeming it to be \\"vital in persuading people to take action to stop it and encouraging children to speak out.\\" Episodes from the storyline were submitted to the Royal Television Society Programme Awards 2008 for a panel to judge in the category Soap and Continuing Drama. EastEnders was presented with the award in March 2009, beating Coronation Street and The Bill. Members of the judging panel described the submitted episodes as \\"the culmination of a particularly challenging and controversial storyline which the production team, writers and cast pulled off triumphantly.\\" In addition, the storyline was nominated for Best Storyline at the 2009 Inside Soap Awards and the character was nominated for the Villain of the Year award at the 2009 British Soap Awards.

It is a heavy meat breed, and was created to supply the high demand for white chicken meat from the city of Amsterdam, particularly from the Jewish community in that city. History The North Holland Blue was created in the area around Purmerend in about 1900 to supply the city of Amsterdam with white chicken-meat. It derives from the Belgian Malines. Malines birds had been imported for the purpose but did not do well in the poor conditions of North Holland. They were therefore crossed with local chickens. A breed standard was agreed in 1934 by the Noord-Hollandse Blauwenclub van Nederland, a breeders' association, and in 1950 was adopted with minor changes by the Nederlandse Hoender en Dwerghoender Bond, the national association of poultry breeders. In the years after the Second World War the North Holland Blue was supplanted as a commercial meat breed by faster-growing imported American breeds. The last large North Holland Blue farm closed in 1977. A bantam version was also created in the Netherlands, but was first shown in Germany. The North Holland Blue is recognised in eight European countries. Characteristics The North Holland Blue has only one colour, Cuckoo. It has a quiet, docile temperament, and lays 180‚Äì240 eggs per year. In the Netherlands and New Zealand it is clean-legged; British breed standards call for lightly feathered legs.

It largely replaces the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984.  Detention certificates  The act provides for short-term detention certificates and emergency detention certificates. Short-term certificates are referred to by the act as the 'preferred gateway' to detention, and lead, notionally, to up to 28 days' detention during which treatment may be administered against the will of the detainee, and can also lead to compulsory treatment orders, which have longer term implications for the detainee's liberty. Detainees can apply to the Mental Health Tribunal for revocation of short-term certificates. Emergency certificates lead, notionally, to up to 72 hours' detention, and can also lead to detentions under short-term certificates. Emergency certificates do not enable treatment against the will of detainees, except for urgent treatment, and there is no formal process of appeal against them. Unless a certificate is completed for someone who is already in a mental health hospital, both forms of detention are preceded by detention of up to 72 hours in what are called 'places of safety', while transport to hospital is arranged. Also, short-term detentions may be extended for periods of up to three 'working days', to facilitate applications to the Mental Health Tribunal for compulsory treatment orders. Saturdays, Sundays and Scottish bank holidays are not counted as working days. Principles The law is based on a set of principles. These principles should be taken into account by anyone involved in a person's care and treatment. =Past and present wishes= Patients should be given the information and support they need to take part in decisions about their care and treatment. To help service users get their views across, the Act puts in place the right to access independent advocacy services. It also puts in place advance statements as a way to help service users say what care and treatment they would and would not want to have. The Mental Health Commission in Scotland examines cases where a person's advance statement has been overridden. =The views of any carer, guardian or welfare attorney= Carers should be involved in decision-making and should be given information they need to help them in their role. We will be developing guidance this year to help service providers and carers with the problem of patient confidentiality and sharing information. =Options= A patient's care plan should reflect their needs as an individual. A Mental Health Tribunal reviews care that looks for a compulsory treatment order that lasts longer than 2 years or the service users can request this if they wish to appeal a compulsory treatment order after 3 months. =The care and treatment that will be of most benefit= This should be reflected in a care plan. In addition the Act puts in place safeguards when consent to treatment has not been given. On many occasions a patient's care and treatment becomes much to the opinion of any one person, with a psychiatric disorder (mentalis confusio), latest labels that of chemical imbalance or chemical disorder, perplex and confuse not only the patient, but those whom may be designated decision makers on a patient's behalf. Family members all too often are not given any information, nor the correct questions to ask. All too often the system fails to accept a lack of science behind these labels. \\"where is that chemical test for this chemical imbalance?\\" Truth is that like the word illness: no such disease exists, nor any chemical as where is this chemical test; well paid professionals or populus of institutions together, with no clear facts and no willingness to discuss any way except that of psychiatry & adding of substance of those many same category as Class substances. =Individual abilities and background= Important things about a person such as their age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, racial origin or membership of any ethnic group should be taken into account by people providing care and treatment. People providing care should also make sure that: # any restrictions on a person's freedom are the least necessary # the person being treated under the act shouldn't be treated any less favourably than anyone else being treated for a mental illness, or other mental disorder # carer's needs are taken into account # the person being treated is getting services that are right for them # when a person is no longer receiving compulsory treatment, he or she should still continue to get care and treatment if it is needed # if the person being treated is under 18, his or her welfare is of the highest priority See also *List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999 *Mental Health (Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Act 1999 References External links * Category:Acts of the Scottish Parliament 2003 Category:Mental health law in the United Kingdom Category:Mental health in Scotland Category:Health law in Scotland ","title":"Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003"},{"id":"18251002","text":"The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation (Meso Foundation, formerly MARF) is a privately funded non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research, provides services to patients, educates the public, and advocates in Washington, DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research.

The cup was found down a well on the site of a Roman villa. It is important in that it lists five of the forts on the western section of Hadrian's Wall, thus aiding scholars in identifying the forts correctly. The information on the cup has been compared with the two major sources of information regarding forts on the Wall, the Notitia Dignitatum and the Ravenna Cosmography. The cup is in the possession of the Duke of Northumberland and is on display at Alnwick Castle. A replica of the cup is on display at the British Museum. Description and use The cup is 46mm high, with a rim diameter of 89-93mm (once circular, now a little squashed). The base, now missing, is 58mm in diameter. The Champlev√© enamelling is in three zones: a lower zone consisting of a grid of rectangles; a central zone consisting of fourteen alternating rectangles (these being subdivided into four smaller rectangles with crenellations along the top), alternating with a leaf-shaped design; a third, narrow, grooved channel at the top containing the lettering given below. It is believed that the cup once formed part of a set of ornamental souvenir bowls. However, the fact that there is no sign of a similar vessel covering the central and eastern sectors of the Wall suggests otherwise. Whether the Cup was a souvenir for a retired soldier, a libation vessel or a present to be given to other people is something that will probably never be clear.Allason-Jones, 2012, p.30 The Cup appears to show a schematic drawing of Hadrian's Wall originally picked out in coloured enamels with turrets and milecastles, although this is open to debate. The inscription on the cup is as follows: .A.MAISABALLAVAVXELODUMCAMBOGLANSBANNA Allason-Jones, 2012, p.26 in a continuous strip. This is now interpreted as: A MAIS ABALLAVA VXELODUM CAMBOGLANS BANNA It is believed that these names are from an itinerary of the Wall from west to east, listing the forts as Mais (Bowness), Aballava (Burgh- by-Sands), Uxelodunum (Stanwix), Camboglanna (Castlesteads) and Banna (Birdoswald). Dating and manufacture It is likely that the Cup dates to the early 130s AD when interest and pride in the newly completed Wall would have been at their height. It is unclear as to where and by whom the Cup was made. It may not necessarily have been made near the Wall. It seems possible that the same craftsman made the Cup and the Amiens Patera.Allason-Jones, 2012, p.30-33 Other similar sources =Amiens Skillet= The Amiens Skillet, or Amiens Patera, is a bronze bowl with a single long handle found at Amiens, France ( a stopping place for Roman soldiers) in 1949. It is similar to the Rudge Cup in that it has a representation of the Wall and a list of forts from west to east. The inscription on the bowl is as follows: MAIS ABALLAVA VXELODVNVM CAMBOG...S BANNA ESICA The six forts listed on the Amiens Patera match the five forts on the Rudge Cup, with the addition of Aesica (Great Chesters). The list differs from the Notitia Dignitatum and the Ravenna Cosmography, in that it misses out Magnis (Carvoran), which should come between Banna (Birdoswald) and Aesica (Great Chesters). It is believed that this omission is because Magnis was not actually on the Wall but was south of the Vallum, having been originally built to guard the Stanegate. The patera is 56mm high, with a diameter of 100mm; the handle length is 90mm. Below the inscription a red, crenellated, line depicts (figuratively) a wall and seven towers. The base is decorated with rectangles, possibly depicting masonry foundations, coloured in blue and green enamel. =Staffordshire Moorlands Patera= The Staffordshire Moorlands cup, an enamelled Roman bronze vessel (diameter 89.5 mm) which lists the names of several Roman forts on the western sector of Hadrian's Wall and also the ancient name of the Wall in the form Val[l]i Aeli, the 'Aelian frontier', using part of Hadrian's name which in full was Publius Aelius Hadrianus. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, is a bronze cooking and serving vessel of trulla form found in Staffordshire in 2003. It has elaborate Celtic-style enamelled decoration and had a single handle, now broken. The inscription on the bowl lists four forts on Hadrian's Wall. The inscription on the cup is as follows: MAIS COGGABATA VXELODVNVM CAMMOGLANNA RIGOREVALI AELI DRACONIS The four forts listed do not match the first four forts listed on the Rudge Cup and Amiens Skillet. The second fort on the Staffordshire Bowl is Coggabata (Drumburgh), whereas the other two bowls have Aballava (Burgh-by-Sands) as the second fort. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but the small size of Coggabata may explain its omission from the Rudge Cup and Amiens Skillet. It is thought that Rigorevali Aeli means On the line of Hadrian's Wall, as Aelius is the family name of Hadrian. Draconis probably refers to either the manufacturer or the person for whom the bowl was made, Draco.

Early years Gonzmart was born C√©sar Gonzalez Martinez in Tampa, Florida and named by his mother for the Roman general and statesman, Julius Caesar. (C√©sar is the Spanish spelling of Caesar.) At the age of three, he accompanied his mother, aunt, and grandmother on a cruise to Cuba. Having been impressed by shipboard violinist, he started lessons at age six. A successful student, musically and otherwise, he went to Stetson University on scholarship after only 2¬Ω years at Hillsborough High School. In 1935 at age 15, C√©sar earned $20 a week substituting in the Columbia Restaurant's band; a job he held for three months before leaving for DeLand to attend college. Musical success When C√©sar was 18, he was a symphonic violin soloist. He attended the University of Havana, earning a doctorate in music, and stood as the Havana Symphony Orchestra's concertmaster at age 21. He married and fathered a son, C√©sar Gonzalez, Jr., who would eventually join the United States Department of State as a career diplomat. That son had no connection to the family restaurant business. After performing as a concert violinist in the United States and Cuba, C√©sar also found lucrative success performing popular music with his touring orchestra, C√©sar Gonzalez and his Magic Violins. Name change At that point in his life, C√©sar Gonzalez changed his name to Gonzmart, drawn both from his father's surname of Gonzalez and his mother's of Martinez. He later explained that he had wanted to establish his own identity. Second marriage C√©sar married Adela Hernandez, the granddaughter of Columbia founder Casimiro Hernandez Sr. in 1946. Adela, a Juilliard School of Music graduate, was an accomplished touring pianist. Notably, Adela had played at Carnegie Hall. After the wedding, C√©sar and Adela Gonzmart toured together until C√©sar was convinced to work instead at the Columbia. Though it was a considerable financial loss, C√©sar complied to provide stability to the couple's son, Casey. The following year, their second son Richard was born. Although he traded his career as a musician for one as a restaurateur, C√©sar Gonzmart regularly serenaded his guests. C√©sar learned the business quickly, and he and Adela began to have input in the decisions of the Columbia. In 1956, they convinced Adela's father, Casmiro, to build another large room, the Siboney dining room, named after a town in Cuba where American forces landed in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (also the name of a song by a Cuban composer). Career For the rest of his life, Gonzmart focused on managing and expanding the Spanish-themed Columbia group‚Äîopening high-volume dinner houses in Sarasota, St. Augustine, St. Petersburg and Clearwater Beach. Gonzmart also oversaw the launch of tropical- themed Cha-Cha Coconuts, a casual-themed bar & restaurant in 1988, now four units strong. In addition, the Columbia group operates a commissary called Columbia Food Service Inc. The year Gonzmart left the music business, the Columbia grossed $1 million. In 1991, just before his death, the chain earned $42 million.The Carefree Traveler Magazine: 6th Feature Article-Cesar Gonzmart and the Columbia Restaurant by Richard L.

The glass factory produces 24% lead crystal. Major part of its production is focused on export. Some production stays on the market in the Czech Republic. The company was founded in 1903 by Anton√≠n R√ºckl, a member of old family of glassmakers whose roots can be traced back to the 17th century. The glassworks soon became known throughout Europe, and in several countries it was also represented. At that time, the R√ºckls owned a glass factory in Vƒçelnice and Skalice. In 1945 the glassworks was nationalized and incorporated under Bohemian glassworks in 1965. After the revolution in 1989, the great-grandson of glassmaker Anton√≠n R√ºckl, Ji≈ô√≠ R√ºck privatized and founded a joint-stock company. At present, the glass factory manufactures hand-cut crystal. Most of the production is destined for foreign markets (USA, Japan, Russia), a part for the Czech market. The glassworks are known for producing a number of different state awards, as for the British Queen Elizabeth II, Pope John Paul II or US President Bill Clinton.

The classification of Fully Protected (often abbreviated as CFP) was the State's initial effort in the 1960s to identify and provide additional protection to those animals that were rare or faced possible extinction.CDFG webpage: Fully Protected Animals Lists were created for fish, mammals, amphibians & reptiles, and birds. The Fish and Game Code sections dealing with Fully Protected species state that these species \\"....may not be taken or possessed at any time and no provision of this code or any other law shall be construed to authorize the issuance of permits or licenses to take any fully protected\\" species, although take may be authorized for necessary scientific research. This language arguably makes the \\"Fully Protected\\" designation the strongest and most restrictive regarding the \\"take\\" of these species. In 2003 the code sections dealing with fully protected species were amended to allow CDFG to authorize take resulting from recovery activities for state-listed species. California laws relating to fully protected species were among the first attempts in the nation to give protection to wildlife in risk of extinction, predating even the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). In the decades that followed, new laws were enacted that were more flexible to the needs of growing communities and the modern world. Thus, most fully protected species have also been given additional protection under more recent laws and regulations, and many have been listed under state and federal versions of the ESA. However, the laws relating to fully protected species are still in place. As mentioned above, California law states that no permit may be issued for take of fully protected species, under almost any circumstances. Thus, presence of a fully protected animal in an area such as a construction zone can literally bring the entire project to a halt. In contrast, the ESA carries stronger penalties, but has provisions built in for mitigation options in the event of unavoidable take. There is debate within conservation biology circles as to the modern-day applicability of the fully protected designation due to its inflexibility, the fact that new conservation laws have been enacted, and the fact that some fully protected species have undergone moderate population recovery while many other species that deserve the fully protected status have not been designated as such.

The network uses domain names under the .kp top level domain that are not accessible from the global Internet. As of 2016 the network uses IPv4 addresses reserved for private networks in the 10.0.0.0/8 range. North Koreans often find it more convenient to access sites by their IP address rather than by URL using Latin characters. Like the global Internet, the network hosts content accessible with web browsers, and provides an internal web search engine. It also provides email services and news groups. Content The Kwangmyong network is composed of multiple websites and services, including but not limited to: political, economic, scientific and cultural information and fields of knowledge among other topics; an emailing service; a social networking service; domestic news services; scientific research websites of academic and scholarly works devoted to the network through web-based academic exchanges and information sharing such as the Academy of Sciences for Science and Technology () and the Academy of Sciences for Medical Science ();http://www.icms.he.kp/ websites of various North Korean government agencies including provincial government, cultural institutions, universities and some of the major industrial and commercial organizations; censored websites from the Internet (mostly related to science) that are downloaded, undergo review and censorship, and publication on the Kwangmyong; an electronic library;http://www.elib.edu.kp/ and a few e-commerce websites by commercial organizations. As of 2014, Kwangmyong is estimated to have between 1,000 and 5,500 websites. In 2016 an IPTV service called Manbang started utilising Kwangmyong, accessed by a wi-fi enabled set-top box. Network access Kwangmyong is only accessible from within North Korea. Access is available within major cities and counties, as well as universities and major industrial and commercial organizations. There are several internet caf√©s in Pyongyang. Kwangmyong has 24-hour unlimited access by dial-up telephone line. , a number of Android-based tablet computer products, including the Samjiyon tablet computer, can be purchased in North Korea that give access to Kwangmyong. In 2018, North Korea unveiled a new wi-fi service called Mirae (\\"Future\\"), which allowed mobile devices to access the intranet network in Pyongyang. Languages The network uses Korean as the main interface language, and is maintained by more than 2,000 language experts, according to official information, in expanding services in Russian, Chinese, English, French, German and Japanese, in which there is a real-time, online translation service for the seven languages, with a database containing over 2,000,000 words, to assist users who may not be familiar with foreign languages. Information control Kwangmyong is designed to be used only within North Korea, and often referred as an \\"intranet\\". Kwangmyong prevents domestic users within North Korea from accessing foreign content or information and prevents the leakages of classified data. It functions as a form of information censorship, preventing undesirable information from being accessed. Thus, sensitive topics and information are unlikely to surface on Kwangmyong due to the absence of a link to the outside world and the censorship that occurs. Kwangmyong is maintained by government-related entities. However, large amounts of material from the Internet ends up on Kwangmyong, following processing. Foreigners in North Korea are generally not allowed to access Kwangmyong but may have access to the global Internet. For security reasons networks with Internet and intranet access are air gapped so that computers with Internet access are not housed in the same location as computers with Kwangmyong access. Given that there is no direct connection to the outside Internet, unwanted information cannot enter the network. Information is filtered and processed by government agencies before being hosted on the North Korean Intranet. Myanmar and Cuba also use a similar network system that is separated from the rest of the Internet, and Iran has been reported as having future plans to implement such a network, though it is claimed that it would work alongside the Internet and would not replace it.Christopher Rhoads and Farnaz Fassihi, May 28, 2011, Iran Vows to Unplug Internet, Wall Street Journal See also *Internet in North Korea *Internet censorship in North Korea *Red Star OS References External links *List of sites on Kwangmyong at North Korea Tech *Video of surfing on Kwangmyong at Yle Areena *North Korea and the Internet at The Economist *Kwangmyong computer network at North Korea Economy Watch *Digital Divide on the Korean Peninsula at Institute for Corean-American Studies *Hermit Surfers of P'yongyang at CIA Category:Internet in North Korea Category:Internet censorship Category:Mass surveillance Category:Internet properties established in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in Korea Category:Wide area networks Category:Telecommunications companies of North Korea ","title":"Kwangmyong (network)"},{"id":"18251367","text":"Healthcare-NOW! is a non-profit grassroots coalition in support of the single- payer health care movement for the United States.

Said to be the place where the name originated The name derives from 'Nanskeval' a place on the parish boundaries of St Mawgan in Pydar and St Columb Major, which in 1277 was spelled Nanscuvel. Nanskeval house was once the home of Liberal MP Edward Brydges Willyams and is still part of the Carnanton estate which is still owned by descendants of the same family. Nans means 'valley' in Old Cornish (Welsh: nant) and Kivell is thought to derive from the Cornish equivalent of the Welsh word ceffyl, meaning a horse.Ceffyl This meaning of the name is often quoted but is very unlikely. The Cornish for 'horse' is 'margh' (Welsh: march). A much more likely meaning of the name and its variants is \\"Valley of the Woodcock\\" since 'woodcock' in Cornish is 'kevelek' (Welsh: cyffylog, ceffylog - Scolopax rusticola) and woodcock were common in the woods in the Vale of Lanherne in St Mawgan in Pydar where Nanskeval House once was. The registers of the Parish of St Columb Major, Cornwall from the year 1539 to 1780 have this: \\"The name Nankivell is pure Keltic and means the Glen of the Woodcock (generally spelt Nanskevall)...an old oak wood, lies about 2 miles from St Columb\\".

Operational history =June to September 1941= 21st Army was a part of the Second Operational Echelon of the Red Army. It was formed from the forces of the Volga Military District in May 1941 and was initially based on 63rd Rifle Corps (53rd, 148th, and 167th Rifle Divisions) and 66th Rifle Corps. The army was under the command of Lieutenant-General Vasily Gerasimenko, and its chief of staff was Major-General Vasily Gordov. The commander of 63rd Rifle Corps was Lieutenant-General Leonid Petrovsky and the commander of 66th Rifle Corps was Major-General Fyodor Sudakov. In early June the army was moved to the eastern fringes of the Pripyat Marshes south of Homel. At the outbreak of hostilities on 22 June the army was redeployed north to defend the right bank of the Dnepr between Rybchev and Stary-Bykhov. At the same time 25th Mechanized Corps, under the command of Major-General Semyon Krivoshein, was assigned to 21st Army from the Kharkov Military District. On 27 June 1941 it was proposed to Joseph Stalin that the Soviet armies (13th Army, 19th Army, 20th Army, 21st, 22nd Army) would defend the line going through the Daugava- Polotsk-Vitebsk-Orsha-Mogilev-Mazyr.Fugate Bryan, Dvoriecki Lev Blitzkrieg and Dnieperm Warszawa 2001 page 130 On 2 July, 21st Army was subordinated to the command of Western Front. On 4 July, the 3rd Panzer Division crossed the Dnepr and established a bridgehead on the east bank near Rahachow. Relentless assaults made by 63rd Rifle Corps from 21st Army forced the Germans to evacuate the bridgehead two days later.Fugate Bryan, Dvoriecki Lev page 133 On 6 July a battle-group from the 21st Army (led by the 117th Rifle Division) crossed the Dnepr at Zhlobin south of Rahachow and attacked in direction of Babruysk. The Soviet attack was repelled by the German 10th Motorized Division with help from 3rd Panzer DivisionFugate Bryan, Dvoriecki Lev page 131 as German forces closed to the Dnepr, taking Rahachow and Zhlobin by 7 July and isolating 66th Rifle Corps' 117th Rifle Division in the eastern fringes of the Pripyat Marshes. On 13 July, 21st Army, by this time under the command of Colonel-General Fyodor Kuznetsov, and reinforced with 67th Rifle Corps (commanded by Colonel Filipp Zhmachenko) and a cavalry group under the command of Colonel-General Oka Gorodovikov, went on the offensive again. Its 63rd Rifle Corps crossed Dnepr on pontoon bridges and recaptured Rahachow and Zhlobin, the first large towns to be retaken from German forces since the start of the invasion. Further south 232nd Rifle Division from 66th Rifle Corps under cover of woods, and with Gorodovikov's cavalry forces advancing off its left flank, gained 80 kilometres due west and took a bridgehead on Berezina river.Fugate Bryan, Dvoriecki Lev page 176 The advance of 21st Army was brought to a halt after a few days by fresh German forces from the German Second Army moving east from Minsk after the final surrender of the Soviet frontier armies in western Belorussia. During the second half of July the frontline stabilised from southeast of Babruysk to the Dnepr north of Rahachow and along the Sozh. On 24 July, 21st Army came under command of the newly formed Central Front. Fedor Kuznetsov was assigned to the command of this new Front, and Lieutenant-General Mikhail Eframov was assigned as the new commander of 21st Army. Subsequently, 3rd Army, under the command of Lieutenant-General Vasilii Kuznetsov, was assigned to the frontline off the left flank of 21st Army in the Pripyat Marshes. By early August, 21st Army's defences were beginning to crumble against increasing pressure from Second Army. On 7 August Eframov moved to the command of Central Front and Gordov assumed command of 21st Army. When on 12 August Krychaw was taken by the Guderian's 2nd Panzer Group, the 21st Army with its right flank severed began to withdraw to the east. Its new defensive position was to be on the line of river Desna. Zhlobin fell to Second Army on 14 August and the bridges over the Dnepr to the east of the town, though damaged, were taken in usable condition. Rahachow was taken by Second Army the next day and a sizable Soviet force, predominantly from 63 Rifle Corps, became trapped in the resultant pocket. The advance of Second Army towards Homel was slowed by counterattacks from 21st Army, but Gordov's army was being threatened with encirclement by the southward advance of 2nd Panzer Group from Krychaw. Homel was taken by forces from Second Army on 20 August but not before the bridges over the Sozh had been destroyed. On 25 August Central Front was disbanded; 21st Army and 3rd Army were merged, assigned to the newly created Bryansk Front, and, though the combined force was still designated 21st Army, Vasilii Kuznetsov was appointed to its command. On 26 August German 2nd Panzer Group secured a bridgehead on the Desna's eastern bank near Novhorod-Siverskyi which threatened the eastern flank of 21st Army. Kuznetsov ordered a withdrawal over the river Desna. Unfortunately Kuznetsov did not inform the neighbouring Soviet units about his decision. Because of that 40th Army was forced to abort its attack on the German bridgehead near Novhorod-Siverskyi and the army commander, Major- General Kuzma Podlas, ordered a retreat to the southeast. Thus 21st Army, between South Western Front's 40th and 5th Armies was cut off from the forces of Bryansk Front. Kuznetsov can't be blamed for that decision because his army was at that point already beaten by German forces and in full retreat. In this situation on 6 September Kuznetsov's army was placed under the command of Southwestern Front. By then the advance by 2nd Panzer Group had forced a gap between South Western Front and Bryansk Front,Fugate Bryan, Dvoriecki Lev page 213 and 21st Army, continuing to retreat to the south, became caught up in a vast encirclement that became the Battle of Kiev (1941). During the second week of September a significant portion of 21st Army was able to escape eastwards through gaps in 2nd Panzer Group's lines between Priluki and Piriatin, but the bulk of the army found itself, together with the rest of South Western Front, in a tightening encirclement east of Kiev. Only a few thousand soldiers, mainly from 21st Army and 5th Army, together with 500 men from Kuznetsov's headquarters staff, escaped from the final encirclement of South Western Front in the second half of September.Fugate Bryan, Dvoriecki Lev page 226 =October 1941 to May 1942= On 26 September Colonel-General Yakov Cherevichenko was appointed to the command of the residual forces of 21st Army that had escaped encirclement at Kiev. The army grew rapidly in strength as reserves were fed into the Ukraine from the Soviet strategic reserve, so that by the beginning of October the army included three rifle divisions and five cavalry divisions. On 5 October Fyodor Kuznetsov briefly resumed command of 21st Army. By then it had become clear to Soviet high command that the main thrust of the German autumn offensive would not be directed at the Kharkov ‚Äì Belgorod axis, the defence of which was assigned to South Western Front. On 15 October command of 21st Army reverted once again to Vasiliy Gordov, and Major-General Aleksei Danilov was appointed as the army's chief of staff. During October, under constant pressure from the German Sixth Army, 21st Army withdrew steadily to the east on the Belgorod axis north of Kharkov towards the upper Donets. Since the German mechanised forces had been directed towards Moscow and Rostov, Gordov's forces easily avoided encirclement by the slow-moving infantry divisions of Sixth Army, and by early November the frontline had begun to stabilise along the upper Donets. On 1 January 1942 21st Army, which by then included six rifle divisions, launched an offensive towards Oboyan against part of the German Sixth Army. This was part of a wider offensive by South Western Front and Southern Front to retake Kursk, Kharkov and the Donbas; the offensive in the Ukraine being part of a general winter offensive by the Red Army that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea. By 3 January, the 21st Army, in conjunction with 40th Army further north, was involved in heavy fighting on the line of the Seym River, and the next day Gordov's forces cut the Belgorod ‚Äì Kursk road and began to close in on Oboyan. However, by 5 January the progress of 21st Army had stalled after a series of counterattacks by Sixth Army. On 10 January Sixth Army attacked 21st Army's right flank north of Oboyan and also attacked the army's positions south of the town. Gordov could not prevent German forces from breaking through his lines and threatening the rear of his forward units. This German counterattack brought South Western Front's offensive north of Kharkov to an end and placed 21st Army on the defensive along the upper Donets for the rest of the winter and spring. On 12 May 1942 South Western Front launched a renewed offensive to take Kharkov. 21st Army was to be part of the northern arm of an attempt to encircle the city from north and south. In conjunction with 28th Army on its left, Gordov's forces attacked XVII Army Corps of the German Sixth Army. For several days it seemed that a breakthrough against XVII Army Corps might be possible, but a reserve Soviet cavalry corps was not available in time to support the offensive and the Soviet advance stalled short of Kharkov in the face of effective German defences. =June 1942 to April 1943= By late June 1942, 21st Army, with nine rifle divisions and a tank corps, occupied the northern flank of Southwestern Front along 100 kilometres of frontline east of Belgorod. Gordov's army, facing the left flank of the German Sixth Army and the right flank of the newly introduced Hungarian Second Army, was still flanked on its right by 40th Army, but 40th Army at this time constituted the southern wing of Bryansk Front which was responsible for the defence of the Voronezh axis.Glantz&House; When Titans clashed Page 118 ‚Äì Map 8 On 28 June the main German strategic offensive of 1942, Case Blue, began. The initial German objectives were to break through the left wing of Bryansk Front in an advance to the Don at Voronezh, and, further south, to then break through the left wing of 21st Army in an advance towards Stary Oskol that would encircle 21st Army and 40th Army. Subsequently, German mechanised forces would advance down the right bank of the Don in order to encircle South Western Front, and would develop the offensive into the great bend of the Don and across the lower Don in order to encircle Southern Front, interdict the Volga river traffic at Stalingrad and secure the oilfields at Maykop. Within days of the opening of the German offensive, the right wing and centre of 40th Army had disintegrated and German mechanised forces were advancing rapidly towards Voronezh. On 30 June, XL Panzer Corps, subordinated to the German Sixth Army, struck 21st Army's left flank 40 kilometres southeast of Belgorod. At the same time German mechanised forces that had broken through the centre of 40th Army began to move towards Stary Oskol. On 1 July, with XL Panzer Corps breaking through 21st Army's lines and rendering the left wing of 40th Army and the bulk of 21st Army at risk of encirclement, Gordov was given permission to withdraw to the east. Making effective use of rearguards, Gordov and his staff managed to slow the German advance sufficiently to enable the bulk of 21st Army to reach the Don in the Liski area, and to withdraw to the relative safety of the left bank of the river. On 12 July, as 21st Army was being deployed further south to defend the left bank of the Don bend in the Serafimovich ‚Äì Kletskaya sector, Gordov was assigned to the command of one of three reserve armies that had been activated and were in the process of being deployed to the Don. Danilov was then assigned to the command of 21st Army and Colonel Valentin Penskovskii became the army's chief of staff. On 26 July, the 21st Army crossed the Don to attack German Sixth Army positions on the right bank of the river in the Serafimovich ‚Äì Kletskaya sector. This attack was made to support the Soviet 62nd Army which was under severe pressure from Sixth Army in the Don bend, but the attack was only partially successful and by early August the offensive had stalled. Yet it left Danilov's forces in control of substantial bridgeheads on the right bank of the river at Serafimovich and Kletskaya, bridgeheads that the over- stretched Sixth Army did not have the resources to eliminate. By the fourth week of July Sixth Army had secured bridgeheads on the left bank of the Don at its eastern extremity, and were preparing for an advance across the narrow strip of land to the Volga north of Stalingrad. In conjunction with other Soviet forces facing Sixth Army, 21st Army launched desperate attacks on Sixth Army's positions to try to relieve the pressure on 62nd Army's defences on the left bank of the Don. These attacks failed to prevent Sixth Army from reaching the Volga, but 21st Army managed to enlarge its bridgehead at Serafimovich. During August and September, as the battle for the city of Stalingrad progressed, 21st Army maintained the pressure on Sixth Army's positions on the right bank of the Don. During October the Rumanian Third Army replaced German divisions defending the northern sector of the Don bend, but the Rumanians were unable to prevent 21st Army from further enlarging the Serafimovich bridgehead. Soviet high command had decided to use the Serafimovich bridgehead to launch a major offensive (codenamed Uranus) to the southeast which, in conjunction with an offensive from Soviet positions south of Stalingrad, would strike into the flanks of Sixth Army to end the siege of the city. At the beginning of November Major-General Ivan Chistyakov replaced Danilov as commander of 21st Army. (Penskovskii, promoted in October to the rank of Major-General, remained as the army's chief of staff). Subsequently, 21st Army was reinforced with a tank corps and an elite cavalry corps. By then the army's bridgehead on the right bank of the Don was 50 kilometres long stretching from west of Serafimovich to east of Kletskaya. During November, 21st Army relinquished control of the Serafimovich sector of the bridgehead to the newly arrived 5th Tank Army. This tank army and the mobile forces of 21st Army were to spearhead the encirclement drive from the north. Operation Uranus began in freezing fog on the morning of 19 November. By midday, though 6th Rumanian Infantry Division on 21st Army's right flank held its ground, the resistance of the other Rumanian forces facing 21st Army began to crumble and the army's mobile corps were committed to the offensive. By mid afternoon 21st Army's two mobile corps had broken through the Rumanian lines, and, as the cavalry corps turned east to attack the flank of Sixth Army's XI Army Corps, the tank corps advanced rapidly to the southeast in parallel with a tank corps from 5th Tank Army. On 21 November, the 21st Army's tank corps reached the Don near its eastern extremity and deep in Sixth Army's rear. The next day, further south, the tank corps from 5th Tank Army crossed the Don, and on 23 November linked up with mechanised forces from the Soviet's southern offensive. The whole of the German Sixth Army was surrounded in, and west of, Stalingrad, and five divisions of the Rumanian Third Army were encircled between the right wing of 21st Army and the left wing of 5th Tank Army in the Verkhe Fomikhinsky ‚Äì Raspopinskaya area. Soviet commanders moved rapidly to secure the encirclement of Sixth Army. While part of 21st Army was committed to the subjugation of the surrounded Rumanian divisions on its right flank, the rest of the army advanced south and east into the Don bend. Sixth Army did not try to defend the right bank of the Don; the army's XI Army Corps had pull back to the left bank by 26 November and over the next few days pulled back further to the east to form part of a tighter defensive perimeter. Chistiakov's forces followed to form the western face of the Stalingrad encirclement, an encirclement that included a further six Soviet armies. In all, 22 Axis divisions were caught in the Stalingrad encirclement east of the Don. This was a far larger force than the Soviet high command had expected to ensnare, and throughout December piecemeal Soviet attacks on the Stalingrad perimeter achieved little. To break through the German defences a carefully prepared and coordinated offensive would be required. By the beginning of January 1943 the Soviet armies of the Stalingrad perimeter had been brought under one Front command (Don Front), and the general offensive (Operation Ring) began on 10 January. By this time the combat effectiveness of Sixth Army had been eroded by shortages of food, fuel and ammunition, yet the attacks against most of the perimeter made little progress. Only on the western and north-western face of the perimeter, where the German defences were weakest, was significant progress made by 21st Army and its neighbouring 65th Army. Six days later Pitomnik, the larger of Sixth Army's two major airbases, was taken, and Gumrak, the second airbase fell on 22 January. Four days later forces from 21st Army, advancing towards Stalingrad from the west, met forces from 62nd Army which had broken through the centre of the city to its western outskirts. Sixth Army was cut in two, and by early February the last German forces in the city had surrendered. Within days of Sixth Army's surrender, preparations were underway for the deployment of several of the Soviet armies from the Stalingrad battle, including 21st Army, north to the Livny area to assist in a major offensive towards Kursk. Chistiakov's divisions did not begin to arrive in the Livny area until the second week in March by which time, instead of being committed to the offensive, they were deployed to the Oboyan area to defend against German mechanised forces that were threatening to advance north from Belgorod. Over the subsequent weeks the defensive positions of 21st Army south of Oboyan were to become the southern face of the Kursk salient. At the beginning of May 1943 the designation of Chistiakov's army, in recognition of the part it had played in the battle of Stalingrad, was changed from 21st Army to 6th Guards Army. This change of designation was not made public until July. =July to October 1943= On 12 July 1943 the 3rd Reserve Army, part of the Red Army's strategic reserve, was designated as the new formation of 21st Army. On 23 July it was transferred from the reserve to the operational army and at the beginning of August was assigned to Western Front to participate in an offensive to retake Smolensk (Operation Suvorov). At that time the army, under the command of Lieutenant-General Nikolai Krylov (chief of staff ‚Äì Major-General Pavel Tikhomirov), included eight rifle divisions. The first phase of Operation Suvorov began on 7 August (without 21st Army's initial participation) but made little progress. Spas Demensk was taken on 13 August but thereafter the offensive began to stall. Changing the axis of the offensive from southwest towards Roslavl to a westerly offensive towards Elnia, Western Front renewed its efforts on 28 August using 21st Army and 10th Guards Army to spearhead the attack. Elnia was taken three days later, but 21st Army was unable to advance further to the west. Western Front ordered another operational pause until mid-September. By the time the offensive was resumed on 14 September, the defending German Fourth Army had been so weakened by the transfer of forces to other sectors of the frontline, that it made no determined attempt to defend its positions. Instead, it began a planned withdrawal to more defensible positions east of Orsha. As Fourth Army withdrew, Western Front's armies followed, and in the second half of September, 21st Army advanced 140 kilometres west from Elnia to the Belorussian border southwest of Krasnii where it was stopped by determined German resistance in prepared positions. At the end of October, 21st Army Headquarters was returned to the high command reserve, the army's rifle divisions having been assigned to Western Front's 33rd Army and 68th Army. =May to September 1944= After the failure of armistice negations between the Soviets and the Finns in the spring of 1944, Soviet high command began preparations for an offensive in eastern Karelia and in the Karelian Isthmus to retake territory lost to the Finns in 1941. At the beginning of May 1944 the headquarters of 21st Army, under the command of Lieutenant-General Dmitrii Gusev, was assigned from the reserves to Leningrad Front. Its task was to take command of forces facing the Finnish army's IV Corps in the western half of the frontline in the Karelian Isthmus north of Leningrad. The offensive was planned to begin in early June, by which time 21st Army included nine rifle divisions subordinated to three rifle corps headquarters: * 30th Guards Rifle Corps (45th, 63rd and 64th Guards Rifle Divisions) * 97th Rifle Corps (178th, 358th and 381st Rifle Divisions) * 109th Rifle Corps (72nd, 109th and 286th Rifle Divisions) * 22nd Fortified RegionDavid M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 ‚Äì 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp 420, 426 On 9 June, 21st Army, supported by the guns of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, opened a massive artillery barrage against IV Corps' positions. The next day, after a further artillery barrage, the ground assault, with ample air and armoured support, was launched. By the end of the day IV Corps was being pushed back to its second defence line and the Finns were obliged to send in reinforcements to try to stabilise the position. On 11 June, 23rd Army on the eastern half of the Karelian Isthmus frontline opened its attack on the Finnish III Corps' defences. By 15 June the western sector of IV Corps' second line defences had been breached. Finnish high command ordered its forces to withdraw to a third defence line based on the Vuoski river. This defence line also ran to the north and northeast of the important city and seaport of Vyborg. Following IV Corps' withdrawal, 21st Army advanced north and on 20 June took Vyborg against negligible resistance. Gusev, who was promoted to the rank of colonel-general on 18 June, was ordered to continue the offensive further north to break the Finnish defences at the villages of Tali northeast of Vyborg and at Ihantala north of Vyborg. The renewed offensive began on 25 June against IV Corps' defences in the Tali area. After four days of intense fighting, during which both sides fed reserves into the battle, the Finns were pushed back, but their lines did not break. On 3 July, 21st Army attacked Finnish defensive positions at Ihantala, but the attack had been anticipated by the Finns and after several days of effort, 21st Army's forces had made few gains. By 6 July, after four weeks of intense fighting and after having sustained heavy casualties, 21st Army's offensive capacity was exhausted. Within days some of 21st Army's best units were being withdrawn for deployment to other Soviet armies further south, and by mid-July the offensive in the Karelian Isthmus had been terminated. 21st Army remained with Leningrad Front until the end of September 1944, when it was again returned to the high command reserve. =November 1944 to May 1945= On 11 December 1944 21st Army was assigned to 1st Ukrainian Front from the high command reserve. From this date 21st Army remained operationally active throughout the remainder of the war. (In November, 21st Army had been briefly assigned to the operational army before being returned once again to the high command reserve). Dmitrii Gusev was still the army commander, and the army chief of staff was Major-General Georgii Bukhovets. (Bukhovets had replaced Major-General Victor Petukhov as chief of staff in June 1944). In December 1944, 1st Ukrainian Front occupied a largely static frontline in southern Poland, a frontline that had changed little since the autumn. The Front's main offensive efforts during that time had been directed towards expanding a bridgehead over the Vistula in the Sandomierz area, and in attempting to advance its left wing through the northern Carpathians into Slovakia. However, Soviet high command was planning a major offensive in Poland, and by December that planning was well advanced. The offensive opened in the early morning of 12 January 1945 in a breakout from the Sandomierz bridgehead. Gusev's forces were not part of the breakout effort; 21st Army was one of 1st Ukrainian Front's reserve armies and it was not committed to action until 17 January. By that time 1st Ukrainian Front had advanced deep into southern Poland, and 21st Army was deployed against the German Seventeenth Army in the Miechow area for an attack towards Zawiercie and subsequently Tarnowskie Gory in order to outflank the Katowice industrial area from the north. For this task 21st Army was reinforced with a tank corps and with an elite cavalry corps, and by 23 January it had bypassed German forces in Silesia from the north, its right wing having reached the Oder near Opole, and its left flank having reached Tarnowskie Gory. From Opole 21st Army's cavalry corps, in conjunction with mechanised forces from a Soviet tank army, was turned to the southeast into the German rear and down the right bank of the Oder towards Raciborz. Meanwhile, the rest of 21st Army ceased its outflanking move to the west and attacked east towards Katowice. This manoeuvre, made in conjunction with a westerly advance further south by 4th Ukrainian Front, threatened German forces in the Katowice industrial area with encirclement and forced their withdrawal by 29 January. Thereafter the priority for 1st Ukrainian Front was to cross the Oder and to advance to the river Neisse, from where it was planned it would launch its final offensive towards Dresden and central Germany. By early February, 1st Ukrainian Front had established two bridgeheads over the Oder at Scinawa Mala (formerly Steinau), which was downriver from Wroclaw (formerly Breslau), and at Brzeg, which was between Wroclaw and Opole. Both 5th Guards Army and 21st Army were concentrated into the southern bridgehead, with 21st Army on the left wing. The breakout from the northern bridgehead began on 8 February and within days had forced a gap of more than 100 kilometres in the German lines. The breakout from the Brzeg bridgehead against the German Seventeenth Army began on 14 February. 5th Guards Army advanced to the west and northwest to encircle the substantial German garrison at Wroclaw, and 21st Army advanced to the southwest towards Grodkow. The subsequent advance of 21st Army was modest compared to that made by the armies of 1st Ukrainian Front further west. As the axis of 1st Ukrainian Front's offensive shifted to the west, 21st Army found itself on a relatively inactive sector of the frontline. It was not until mid-March that 1st Ukrainian Front was able to deploy sufficient forces to its left flank to conduct an offensive there. By then the Front was ready to mount a combined attack north and south of Opole towards the Prudnik area, an attack that was expected to outflank much of Seventeenth Army. The northern force, which included 21st Army, was to attack southwest from the Grodkow area. The southern force would attack to the west from the Kedzierzyn-Kozle area. Within four days a number of German divisions in the Opole area had been destroyed by this offensive and by the end of the month 21st Army occupied a 70 kilometre sector of the frontline some 40 kilometres southwest of Wroclaw. In April this frontline stabilised again as 1st Ukrainian Front's resources were directed to the west for the impending offensive across the Neisse into central Germany. In early May, as representatives of the German government were beginning to discuss with the Allies a general surrender of German forces, Soviet high command decided to launch a final offensive against Army Group Centre. The main objective was the capture of Prague, but other Soviet armies facing Army Group Centre's frontline further east, including 21st Army, were required to participate in placing the whole of Army Group Centre under pressure. The hurriedly prepared offensive by more than twenty Soviet armies was launched on 5 May and made rapid progress everywhere. Over the subsequent four days 21st Army advanced 70 kilometres, taking Walbrzych and crossing the Czech border to reach Jaromerz by the war's end on 9 May. 21st Army Order of Battle on 22 June 1941  Source: Leo NiehorsterWorld War II Armed Forces Commander: Lieutenant-General Vasilii Gerasimenko Infantry Forces: 63rd Rifle Corps:- Lieutenant-General Leonid Petrovskii * 53rd Rifle Division- Colonel Filipp Konovalov * 148th Rifle Division- Colonel Filipp Cherokmanov * 167th Rifle Division- Colonel Vasily Rakovsky 66th Rifle Corps:- Major-General Fedor Sudakov * 61st Rifle Division- Colonel Nikolay Prishchepa * 117th Rifle Division- Colonel Spiridon Chernyugov * 154th Rifle Division- Colonel Yakov Fokanov Artillery: * 387th Howitzer Regiment of the Highest Command Reserve (RGK) * 420th Corps Artillery Regiment * 546th Corps Artillery Regiment Mechanised Forces: 25th Mechanized Corps:- Major-General Semen Krivoshein * 50th Tank Division- Colonel Boris Bakharov * 55th Tank Division- Colonel Vasily Badanov * 219th Mechanized Division- Major-General Korzun * 12th Motorcycle Regiment  Commanders  Commanders * Lieutenant General Vasyl Herasymenko (June ‚Äì 6 July 1941) * Marshal Semyon Budyonny (6 ‚Äì 10 July 1941) * Colonel-General Fyodor Kuznetsov (10 ‚Äì 24 July 1941) * Lieutenant General Mikhail Grigoryevich Yefremov (24 July ‚Äì 7 August 1941) * Major General Vasiliy Gordov (7 ‚Äì 24 August 1941) * Lieutenant General Vasily Kuznetsov (25 August ‚Äì 26 September 1941) * Colonel-General Yakov Cherevichenko (26 September ‚Äì 5 October 1941) * Colonel-General Fyodor Kuznetsov (5 ‚Äì 10 October 1941) * Major General Vasiliy Gordov (15 October 1941 -June 1942) * Major General Alexei Danilov (July ‚Äì 1 November 1942) * Lieutenant General Ivan Chistyakov (November 1942 ‚Äì April 1943) * Lieutenant General Nikolay Krylov (12.07.1943 ‚Äì 24.10.1943) * Lieutenant General Yevgeny Zhuravlev (24 October 1943 ‚Äì 25 February 1944) * Lieutenant General Vasily Shvetsov (February -April 1944) * Colonel-General Dmitry Gusev (April 1944 ‚Äì May 1945) References 021 ","title":"21st Army (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"18251416","text":"Kaboom: A Soldier's War Journal was a popular military blog from November 2007 to June 2008, before it was shut down by the writer's military chain of command.

(SNI) was an American mass media company, which was formed on July 1, 2008, and acquired by Discovery Communications on March 6, 2018. It was formed in 2008, through the spin-off of the E. W. Scripps Company's cable television networks and online assets. Discovery Communications completed its acquisition of SNI after receiving approval from the United States Department of Justice and European Commission on March 6, 2018. It was the owner of several major factual television cable channels, including Food Network, HGTV and Travel Channel, and operated or held stakes in localized international versions of these brands. SNI also owned Polish broadcaster TVN and half of the British channel group UKTV. SNI was headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. The company had additional office locations in New York City; Los Angeles; Chicago; San Francisco; Chevy Chase, Maryland; Atlanta; Detroit; Nashville; Cincinnati; and offices in S√£o Paulo (Brazil), London (UK) and Singapore. On July 31, 2017, Discovery Communications announced its intent to acquire SNI. After receiving approval from the United States Department of Justice and European Commission, the sale was completed on March 6, 2018.  History  In 1994, Scripps acquired the Knoxville-based Cinetel Productions to serve as a production base for a new home lifestyle-oriented cable network, which would eventually launch in December as HGTV. Scripps later acquired a stake in the Food Network, and launched a spin-off of HGTV known as DIY Network. On July 1, 2008, Scripps spun out its cable networks and online properties as a new, publicly traded company known as Scripps Networks Interactive. The split was performed to reduce the financial burden of Scripps' broadcast television and print assets on its profitable cable network properties. The company acquired a majority interest in the Travel Channel from Cox Communications for a reported $975 million in late 2009, and the following year rebranded Fine Living Network as Cooking Channel. In April 2011, the company announced the sale of Shopzilla to Symphony Technology Group for $165 million. From within its Travel Channel unit, Scripps also invested in Oyster.com, a hotel research and booking site. In 2011, Virgin Media agreed to sell its 50% stake in UKTV to Scripps Networks Interactive for $495 million (¬£339 million). Completion of the transaction was contingent on regulatory approvals in Ireland and Jersey, which was received on October 3, 2011. On March 22, 2012, Scripps Networks Interactive announced that it had agreed to pay ¬£65m (US$102.7m) to acquire Travel Channel International Limited (TCI), the UK-based broadcaster that ran travel-themed television channels under the Travel Channel brand across the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets, but had no connection with the American television channel of the same name until that time. The deal was completed on May 1, 2012, following regulatory approval. The channels ran by TCI were rebranded after the American channel since then. On December 11, 2012 One Kings Lane, a home decor website, announced that Scripps Networks Interactive had invested in its Series D financing. The company invested $15M in exchange for a 3% equity stake in the company. In May 2013, Scripps Networks Interactive announced that it would open a Brazilian headquarters, in S√£o Paulo, and had appointed the former vice-president of strategy of Fox as managing director, broadcasting its channels to the entire Latin America region. On June 5, 2013, the company launched ulive, a digital-only lifestyle video brand that combined video content from the company's media brands with third-party videos and original series. Later rebranded as Lifeestyle Studios, his video portal and distribution network expanded on the company's food, home and travel verticals, adding coverage for topics including parenting and wellness. By way of its acquisition of Polish company N-Vision, Scripps Networks Interactive gained a 52.7% controlling interest in Polish broadcaster TVN in March 2015 for $615.3 million (‚Ç¨584 million) from ITI Group and French media giant Vivendi. The company bought out TVN's remaining owners, ITI Group and Canal+ Group in July 2015. On May 3, 2017, Scripps acquired millennial- targeted food website Spoon University, which in turn became part of Discovery when that company acquired Scripps. =Acquisition by Discovery= On July 31, 2017, Discovery Communications announced that it would acquire Scripps Networks Interactive for $14.6 billion in a cash and stock deal. Discovery will establish an operational hub in Knoxville, but the company also announced plans to relocate its worldwide headquarters from Silver Spring, Maryland to New York City in 2019. On February 6, 2018, the European Commission approved the deal. Since Liberty Global, which operates pay television services in Poland under the UPC Polska brand, is a major shareholder in Discovery Communications, the EU required that Discovery ensure the continued availability of TVN24 and TVN24 BiS to third-party television providers. The purchase was approved by the U.S. Department of Justice on February 27, 2018, and was closed on March 6, 2018. The combined company was renamed Discovery, Inc. SNI's chief programmer Kathleen Finch was retained as Discovery's Chief Lifestyle Brands Officer, overseeing the former SNI channels, as well as Discovery lifestyle networks such as TLC.

As a member of the dual service U-3-b class, the 6325 handled heavy passenger and freight work for the Grand Trunk Western. In 1946, the 6325 gained notoriety for pulling United States President Harry S. Truman's election campaign train through the state of Michigan. Retired in 1959, the locomotive was donated for display to the City of Battle Creek, Michigan where a failed restoration attempt left 6325 in danger of being scrapped. Purchased in 1993 by Jerry Jacobson of the Ohio Central Railroad, the locomotive sat in storage for six years until being restored to operating condition in 2001 for use on excursion trains across the Ohio Central System. The locomotive is in storage, out of service pending an overhaul at the Age of Steam Roundhouse in Sugarcreek, Ohio. History Grand Trunk Western 6325 was built in February 1942 by ALCO along with 24 other U-3-b 4-8-4 \\"Northern\\" locomotive (sometimes called \\"Confederation\\" locomotives) numbered 6312 through 6336 as dual service locomotives that were the last new steam power assigned to the GTW. The U-3-b engines were right at home with GTW's road profile and characteristics, running almost a quarter of a million miles (400,000 km) between heavy repairs. 6325 could easily handle sixteen passenger cars or eighty car hotshot freights with equal ease on the Chicago division. Its forte was heavy passenger and fast freight service. All U-3-b class locomotives were known as good steamers and were liked by all engine crews and 6325 was no exception. On the GTW, it was the ultimate in modern steam power. In 1948, locomotive 6325 pulled President Harry S. Truman's campaign train across Michigan on Grand Trunk rails. Because of its historical significance, when 6325 was retired in 1959 it was donated to the City of Battle Creek, Michigan, for display. Its role in history is what saved it from the scrapper's torch. A fundraising campaign, led by the National Association of Power Engineers, promoted its preservation and cosmetic restoration. After a fresh paint job by the railroad, 6325 was stored until the city could finalize its plans for the display location. The city finalized plans for the locomotive's display location on Hall street across from the train station in May 1960. As site preparation began, some residents protested suggesting that the site was too small; ultimately, the chosen site was used. The locomotive was moved to its preservation site on July 9, 1960, and a dedication ceremony was held on July 17. A decade later, 6325 had sat in static display with very little maintenance. In 1985, fundraising began to restore the engine. The locomotive, the siding it sat on and the fence surrounding it were all sold for $1 to 6325 Turntable, Inc., a nonprofit organization founded to restore it. After moving it in October 1986 from its display location to a track at Franklin Iron & Metal Co., work soon began to restore the locomotive to operable status. In 1992 the small Michigan restoration group was notified by the GTW/Canadian National railroad that 6325 would have to be moved from its current siding. With little volunteers, low money and no place to call home, the Greater Battle Creek foundation was through. Excursion career In stepped Jerry J. Jacobson of the Ohio Central Railroad System (OHCR) who purchased 6325 and tender in 1993 and moved it to OHCR's steam shops at Morgan Run. But it wasn't until 1998 that restoration efforts began and in 2001, 6325 moved for the first time under its own power in 42 years. Jacobson sold his interest in OHCR in 2008, kept his vintage locomotives and began construction on large roundhouse, the Age of Steam Roundhouse, in Sugarcreek, Ohio, in order to house his collection. As of March 2012, No. 6325 remains in Jacobson's collection. Some well known trips done by 6325 for example, were in 2002, where it pulled many regular trips as well as some photo festivals where it was coupled to a train and was run along Ohio Central's track at various places for photographs, runbys or just normal train chasing. 2003 was a spectacular year for 6325, it pulled a few excursions but that wasn't the main event of that year, it was a huge photo festival which included 20 side by side photo runs with 6325 pulling a freight, and Ohio Central's ex-Canadian Pacific Railway 1293 pulling a passenger train. 2004 saw a huge event in Ohio Central's steam operations when \\"Trainfestival 2004\\" took place from July 30 to August 1, 2004, in Dennison, Ohio. It was a major event featuring all of their steam locomotive, some historic diesel locomotives as well as rolling stock and many more rail-related activities. 6325 was the star of the show; first it was parked for display then it was coupled to the passenger train for several one-hour train rides throughout the day. Then at 5 pm, it pulled a special 3-hour excursion to the OHCR Morgan Run steam shops for tours. It was operated on this schedule for all three days of the event. For the rest of the year, it pulled regular tourist trains. It hasn't been fired since then due to Ohio Central's cease in steam train operations until 2006 when 1293 was fired up for some special events away from OHCR. As of 2008, 6325 is undergoing roller bearing repairs due to recent inspections. Notable sister engines 6325 has one surviving sister engine, GTW 6323, which is famous for being the last GTW steam engine to run on GTW rails, under GTW ownership. GTW 6323 is on display at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois. GTW 6327 was another well known sister engine, the 6327 is known for being the last steam engine to run in Port Huron, Michigan, as well as pulling the last steam train there. 6327 was among the last of GTW's steam engines still operating when the railroad dieselized in 1960 and it was scrapped that year.

It is native to southern Florida and Texas in the United States, and to Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America as far south as Paraguay. Common names include: lime prickly-ash, wild lime, colima, u√±a de gato, and corriosa. Description Zanthoxylum fagara is a spreading shrub or small tree growing to tall. Its trunk is generally rough with gray bark and grows to about in diameter. The irregularly-shaped branches contain hooked spines with pinnate leaves. The leaves and bark can be crushed to make a bitter-tasting condiment, and much of the tree smells similar to citrus. Lime prickly-ash has a high drought tolerance and grows best in full sun, but it can also survive as an understory shrub. It provides significant food and cover for native wildlife and the leaves host the larvae of many butterflies, such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes). Uses The powdered bark and leaves have been used as a spice, with an odor similar to that of limes.

Ahlswede (September 15, 1938 ‚Äì December 18, 2010) was a German mathematician. Born in Dielmissen, Germany, he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis in 1966, at the University of G√∂ttingen, with the topic \\"Contributions to the Shannon information theory in case of non-stationary channels\\". He dedicated himself in his further career to information theory and became one of the leading representatives of this area worldwide. Life and work In 1977, he joined and held a Professorship at the University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany. In 1988, he received together with Imre Csisz√°r the Best Paper Award of the IEEE Information Theory Society for work in the area of the hypothesis testing as well as in 1990 together with Gunter Dueck for a new theory of message identification. He has been awarded this prize twice. As an emeritus of Bielefeld University, Ahlswede received the Claude Elwood Shannon Award 2006 of the IEEE information Theory Society. The prize is designated after Claude Elwood Shannon and since 1974 for outstanding achievements in the area of the information theory. The prize went only five times to scientists from outside the USA. This is the beginning of a new theory known as Network coding. Rudolf Ahlswede died on December 18, 2010, at the age of 72.

It is named after the mythological figure Antaeus, a giant who was unconquerable as long as he touched the ground. This story has appeared in many American and British school textbooks. It is an archetypal tale of rural ways clashing with urban lifestyles. The story is about a boy named T.J. from Marion County, Alabama who moves to a city in the North. He organizes an effort by a gang of kids to grow a garden at the gang‚Äôs hideout, on top of a factory building. T.J. is a southern boy who has moved to a big city. He is lost until he finds a way to bring himself back home, by building a garden. His mother had needed more money to provide for her children. There has been no father mentioned. After a lot of painstaking work, the kids are finally successful in cultivating grass, but are discovered on the rooftop by three strangers, including the building‚Äôs owner. The owner orders the garden to be shoveled off by one of the other strangers by the next day. Not wanting this to happen, T.J. destroys the garden himself, throwing the dirt and grass off the roof. He didn't want anyone to touch the garden, so to protect it, he destroyed it. After this sudden action T.J. leaves, and is not found for another two weeks. When the police do find him he is walking on the railroad tracks, on a walk home.

The floor of the valley lies about above sea level and is accessible from the south via a rack railway (the Vall de N√∫ria Rack Railway) or by foot, and from France to the north by footpaths. There are no roads to access the valley. The place is historically notable for the 1931 drafting of the first Catalan Statute of Autonomy, in the Sanctuary of the Virgin of N√∫ria.http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0046642 Vall de N√∫ria in L'Enciclop√®dia, online reference work based on La Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana (in Catalan) The Virgin of N√∫ria According to tradition, Saint Giles (Catalan: Sant Gil) arrived in the valley in approximately 700 AD and lived there for four years. He crafted an image of the Virgin Mary and hid it in a cave when forced to flee from persecution by the Romans against Christians. Along with the image of the Virgin, he left a pot used for cooking, a cross, and a bell for calling shepherds to meals. According to tradition, a pilgrim named Amad√©u began searching for the image in 1072, after having a prophetic dream. He built a small chapel for pilgrims, and found the image seven years later, next to the pot, the cross, and the bell, and he brought the objects to the chapel to be venerated. The image has been dated to have been made during the 12th or 13th century. It is a wooden Romanesque carving. The primitive-looking polychrome statue retains its painting intact. The shepherds regarded the image of the Blessed Virgin as a patron saint of fertility. The canonical consecration of Our Lady of N√∫ria was made in 1965. Her feast day is September 8.http://pirineos.com/article/articleview/1063/3/97/ Historia del Valle de Nuria in Pirineos.com (in Spanish)http://pirineos.com/article/articleview/1063/4/ El Santuario de Nuria in Pirineos.com (in Spanish) The name N√∫ria is now a popular girl's name in Catalonia.

It is developed by Sega's CS1 Team and published by Sega. It was released in Japan and South East Asia on February 26, 2009 and in North America and Europe on March 9, 2010 and March 12, 2010, respectively. A remaster for the PlayStation 4 was released in Japan on August 9, 2018 and worldwide on August 20, 2019. A sequel, Yakuza 4, was released on March 18, 2010 in Japan. Gameplay =Features= Yakuza 3 introduces PlayStation Network Trophies to the series with 45 trophies (50 in the Eastern releases). It adds four gameplay elements: *Seamless Battle („Ç∑„Éº„É†„É¨„Çπ„Éê„Éà„É´ shimuresu batoru): Seamless Battle is a streaming data-based loading-free system that allows the game to directly connect the adventure mode and the battle mode (called \\"Kenka\\") without the usual loading black screen. *Chase Battle („ÉÅ„Çß„Ç§„Çπ„Éê„Éà„É´, cheisu batoru): Chase Battle is a new battle mode which replaces the regular brawling (Kenka) with a running sequence set within a certain area. Both the chaser and chased have a stamina gauge that decreases as naturally as the character runs, by being hit with a thrown object or by colliding with a passer-by. When the stamina gauge is empty the exhausted character stops the chase. During the game a minor character, Mack Shinozuka will train Kazuma to improve his running performance. *Revelation (Â§©Âïì, tenkei): Ten revelations will allow Kazuma Kiryu to learn new in Adventure mode; it is similar to the system introduced in the previous game Ry≈´ ga Gotoku: Kenzan!. This time Kazuma uses the built-in camera on his cell phone to record new moves and techniques. These are acquired through hints and incidents spotted in First Person View. Learned Heat Actions are posted on Kazuma's personal blog, called \\"Kamuroblo\\", which uses the same template as producer Toshihiro Nagoshi's own blog. *First Person View: When pressing the DualShock 3's R3 button during the adventure mode, the standard third person view switches to a brand new first person mode. This perspective allows a better observation of the streets and people, but looking some people in the eyes using First Person View will provoke him and he will attack. First Person View is disabled in some indoor places and at certain angles. =Event Mode= The main story spans over twelve chapters plus a prologue. As with the earlier games, each chapter is preceded by a cinematic, called an \\"event scene\\", which later becomes available in the Gallery mode. Skipping these scenes using the Start button can only be done after enabling the scene-skipping option in the menu, which is switched off by default. The western version of Yakuza 3 features 295 minutes of cutscenes according to the BBFC. Six sub-scenarios (Date's Pride, Two Fathers, Hometown Girl, The Finishing Touch, Silver Screen Dragon and Murder at Caf√© Alps) are special missions featuring \\"event scene\\" cinematics. Holding R1 and pressing the X button will activate an automatic mode that skips the cutscene dialogue. =Adventure Mode= In the eastern releases, the main story is completed with 103 unique side stories called \\"sub-scenarios\\" (\\"substory\\" in the original version, sabustori). These sub-scenarios are divided into two classes: Mission and Hitman. There are 103 standard missions, some of which are made up of different episodes, and 20 hitman sub-scenarios. Fifteen of these bounty hunter sidestories are located in Kamurocho, the remaining five in Ryukyu. Twenty minigames are available within Adventure mode. These are aromatherapy massage (eastern releases only), darts, pool, karaoke, bowling, mahjong (eastern releases only), chinchirorin, shogi (eastern releases only), ch≈ç-han, koi-koi, oicho-kabu, roulette, poker, blackjack, Answer & Answer (eastern releases only), UFO Catcher, batting cage, golf, surf fishing and Boxcelios. 2-player support for some of these mini games and an expansion for Answer & Answer are added through DLC, as well as main menu direct access in the eastern releases. However, the quiz minigame's expansion was eventually removed from the western release and 2-player support became a time limited DLC exclusive to the North American release's Challenge Pack. Challenges like Mack Shinozuka's training, Inner Fighter 7 and Haruka's Request aren't considered either mini games or side stories. Beating the game in \\"Hard\\" mode unlocks the \\"Ex-Hard\\" (extreme hard) extra difficulty level. Completing the game in any difficulty mode will create a \\"cleared data\\" save file and unlock \\"Premium New Game\\" and \\"Premium Adventure\\". The first allows to restart the game with all accumulated money, items, experience levels and fighting techniques. The latter is a free-run mode dedicated to exploration and completion as it doesn't include the main story, with only sub-scenarios remaining (though a small number of missions will only appear at a certain point in story mode, and cannot be triggered in Premium Adventure). Extra game contents are added through DLC. =Battle Mode= As with the previous games, the is available. An illicit mixed martial arts competition sponsored by Majima is held in the area beneath Kamurocho Hills, formerly Purgatory. The arena is inspired by real life Japanese cage fighting competitions such as K-1 World Grand Prix; gameplay is similar to fighting games Toshihiro Nagoshi previously worked on such as Virtua Fighter 5 and SpikeOut. Single Tournament has 50 unique international fighters (a minor character with its own profile) and 11 grand prix tournaments to choose from. These 3-round competitions have various rings, rules and difficulty levels; the different types of tournament are Exhibition Tournament, Street Fight GP, Breakout GP, Heat GP, Bounding GP, Bomber GP, Golden Glove GP, Weapon Master GP, Hyper GP, Magnum Force GP and Maximum GP.

Once story mode is completed the player can start a Premium Adventure and meet a hidden minor character (a clairvoyant woman) who allows access to four added through DLC, only available in a special edition of the game in Europe, and as a preorder bonus in North America. In Survival Battle Kazuma Kiryu must find and defeat the , Yoshitaka Mine; eight bonus bosses are disseminated within Kamurocho. In Survival Onigokko, Kazuma Kiryu is chased by Bob Utsunomiya in Kamurocho, with ten missions to complete in three minutes. All Star Tournament is an extra Arena single tournament that involves all 8 boss characters plus Goh Hamazaki, the latter of which can only be fought in this mode. All Star Tag Tournament is an extra tag tournament that pits Kazuma Kiryu and his fighting partner Goro Majima against 7 teams of bosses and bonus characters such as Kazuki, Yuya, Goh Hamazaki and Komaki. =Completion= The quest for the disseminated 100 coin lockers (half of them are hidden in Kamurocho, the others are in Ryukyu) is rewarded in Yakuza 3 with the \\"Key Collector\\" Silver PSN Trophy. The latter was called (lit. \\"vagrant keys\\") and was only Bronze level in the Eastern releases. As a mixed game including elements of the sandbox game and RPG genres, Yakuza 3 includes a \\"Completion\\" feature that sums up what percentage of the game was actually completed by the player. Only 100% completion (Completion + Sub-Scenario) will unlock the final mission involving a recurring hidden all-black character named Jo Amon , a.k.a. \\"Mysterious Hitman\\", which is returning character from the spinoff and is a secret boss available since the original Yakuza title. In Yakuza 3, Jo Amon's weapon is dual light sabers. The following extended chart includes the Completion feature and shows the differences between the eastern and western releases. A detailed version of this chart is available in the game's options menu. To learn which contents are specific to each release, see the detailed sections Downloadable content and Versions. Some contents included in the following chart require a completed game save file (such as the Battle Mission), a spinoff game save file (Ukiyo's Bell) or a PlayStation Network redeem code (Battle Pack and Challenge Pack) to be unlocked. Plot =Setting= Unlike Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Kenzan! (often confused with Yakuza 3), which was a Miyamoto Musashi-based spinoff set in Edo period Kyoto, this installment continues the adventures of Kazuma Kiryu from Yakuza and Yakuza 2. The game takes place both in Kamurocho, a fictional version of Tokyo's red- light district Kabukicho, from the first two games and in a brand new location called Ryukyu. The area of Okinawa where the story takes place is a fictional area, based upon Naha's Makishi. It includes real life landmarks such as the Ichiba Hondori (linked to Mutsumibashi Dori and Heiwa Dori) covered shopping arcade renamed in the game as well as the popular Makishi Public Market shortened , the famous entertainment strip Kokusai Street called , the Okinawa Monorail Kencho-mae Station as or the Mitsukoshi department store (Okinawa Mitsukoshi) which kept its actual name as part of the game's tie-in policy. Compared with the earlier episodes, the Kamurocho area has some minor changes with additional backstreets and landmarks. Hence South-East Kabukicho's European medieval castle-shaped karaoke box has been modeled and renamed \\"Kamuro Castle\\", and north-west Kamurocho love hotel Hotel Aland has been recreated in Kamurocho hotels quarter as the Hotel Tea Clipper. =Characters= Yakuza 3's main characters are Kazuma Kiryu and Haruka Sawamura. Additional castings total three hundred and sixty characters, who appear in the main adventure and sub-scenarios. =Story= Unlike the previous episodes the story is not written by Hase Seishu but by Masayoshi Yokoyama. Yakuza 3 takes a departure from the first two games with its choice of setting: instead of focusing on the gritty cityscape of Tokyo and Osaka, it switches gears and sends Kazuma Kiryu to the Ryukyu Islands of Okinawa, where he runs the Morning Glory Orphanage (\\"Sunshine Orphanage\\" in the English PS3 version) with his adoptive daughter Haruka Sawamura (she calls him \\"Uncle Kaz\\") who accompanied him in the previous episodes and the Movie Version. The story starts in February 2007, shortly after the events of Yakuza 2, with Kiryu, Haruka and Kaoru in a cemetery, where most of their friends and family are buried. Hoping to leave their past behind for good, Kaoru decides to take advantage of her promotion and head to the USA for additional training, while Kazuma plans to take over the orphanage in Okinawa, but first pays a visit to his old rival, Goro Majima, who has since left the yakuza to become a legitimate businessman. Concerned that Daigo Dojima, the man he picked to become Sixth Chairman of the Tojo Clan, is too inexperienced, Kiryu persuades Majima to rejoin the clan as a \\"patriarch\\", or gang boss. Six months later, while running the orphanage, Kiryu spots two men spying on him and chases them off. After learning that multiple eviction notices have been sent to Morning Glory by Shigeru Nakahara, the patriarch of the local yakuza outfit, the Ryudo Family, Kiryu confronts the men, who turn out to be his underlings. One of them, Rikiya Shimabukuro, challenges him to a fight, which Kiryu wins. Humiliated, Rikiya takes him to see Nakahara, who explains that he is being pressured to sell the orphanage's land (which he owns) for a new seaside resort. When Nakahara refuses to reconsider his actions, Kiryu makes it clear that he will not leave, no matter what. Sometime later, Rikiya visits the orphanage and asks Kiryu for help: Nakahara's adopted daughter Saki has run away and he's become drunk and depressed. Nakahara refuses to look for Saki, believing that she would never choose to live with him after learning that her mother has returned to town. Kiryu and Rikiya go searching and learn that Saki's mother is working with Tetsuo Tamashiro, the patriarch of a rival family, who plans to use Saki as leverage to seize Nakahara's territory. Kiryu defeats Tamashiro, and Saki chooses to return to Nakahara. Dojima makes a surprise visit to the Ryudo Family's offices, and reveals that Tamashiro was working with Yoshinobu Suzuki, a powerful politician, to secure the land for the resort. He also notes that Defense Minister Ryuzo Tamiya, whose proposed Military Base Expansion Bill is tied to the resort deal, is also involved. One year later, in March 2009, Daigo is shot and falls into a coma; Nakahara is also attacked, and the deed to the orphanage is stolen. Saki provides Kiryu with a drawing of the attacker, who appears to be his deceased father, Shintaro Kazama. Putting his orphans in the care of Haruka, Kiryu returns to Kamurocho, where he is ambushed by a group of mysterious foreigners. After escaping them, he meets with Kashiwagi, Kazama's successor, shortly before he is assassinated. Fleeing from the scene, Kiryu is rescued by Date, his old friend who now works as a journalist. Date gives him information on the three most likely suspects for Kashiwagi's death: Yoshitaka Mine, a white collar yakuza, Goh Hamazaki, a patriarch with ties to the triads, and Tsuyoshi Kanda, who has taken over the gang once controlled by Kiryu's sworn brother, Nishikiyama. Rikiya unexpectedly arrives in Kamurocho, and Kiryu agrees to let him help. They track Kanda to a love hotel, where Kiryu beats him for information. What that fails to turn up any leads, Date informs him that Majima, whose primary source of revenue is construction, has the contract to build the resort. When confronted, Majima challenges him to fight. He loses, and explains that Hamazaki was the one who got him the contract as part of a larger plan to take control of the Tojo Clan and Kamurocho. Majima's associate The Florist of Sai also informs Kiryu that his old enemy Lau Ka Long is working with Hamazaki. Long and his men abduct Rikiya as bait for a trap for Kiryu. Kiryu defeats Long, and he is shot dead by the man who attacked Nakahara. At a meeting with the Florist of Sai, Majima, and Date, Mine arrives with a special package: Kanda's head. He also brings news that Hamazaki has been kidnapped by the Triads, who suspect him of having killed Long. Tamiya contacts Kiryu for a meeting, promising him answers. It becomes clear that the Military Base Expansion Bill is actually part of a CIA operation to eliminate a group of arms smugglers known as Black Monday, and the mystery assassin is Joji Kazama, Shintaro's younger brother who works for the CIA's Japanese division. In return for his help, Tamiya asks Kiryu to protect Toma, his former secretary, from a planned hit by Joji. Kiryu intercepts Joji, and defeats him. Returning home, Kiryu finds the orphanage in ruins, demolished by Tamashiro on Mine's orders. Nakahara is taken to be killed, and Kiryu rescues him, though Tamashiro goes for his gun when Rikiya jumps in front of Kiryu to save him, with Joji promptly killing Tamashiro, though he is too late, as Rikiya dies in a tearful Kiryu's arms. Knowing that Mine likely intends to have Daigo murdered, Kiryu fights through his men to reach the latter's hospital room, where he meets CIA operative Andre Richardson, and realizes that he and his men were the foreigners who tried to kill him earlier. Defeating them, Kiryu finally locates Mine and Daigo on the hospital roof. Mine reveals that he despises Kiryu for putting others above himself, and Kiryu retorts that Mine, who cares only for money, knows nothing of loyalty and friendship. They fight, and Kiryu wins. Richardson shows up, and Mine admits that he is, in fact, the leader of Black Monday. Richardson explains that he has been using Mine as a way to gain access to what he believes to be an advanced missile defense system, unaware that it does not exist. Nevertheless, he prepares to finish off Kiryu. Daigo, having woken up from his coma, suddenly shoots him through the chest before Mine, in an act of self- sacrifice, throws himself and Richardson off the roof to their deaths. The game ends with Kiryu succeeding in his mission, and he and Haruka meet to explore the town. Kiryu is confronted by a man in dirty clothing, who is revealed to be Hamazaki, having survived the implied attempt on his life. Kiryu offers to help him, but Hamazaki, blaming him for his misfortune, stabs him in the stomach before being subdued. Critically wounded, Kiryu seemingly gives his dying words to Haruka. In a post-credits scene, the orphanage's children gather to play as Haruka watches. Next to her is a man, who, as the camera turns, is revealed to be a bandaged Kiryu, having survived the stabbing, and he goes on to continue running Morning Glory with Haruka by his side. Development The game's default video output is 720p HD graphics rendering at a resolution of 1024x768 without anti-aliasing but it supports 1080p mode upscale. Daisuke Tomoda, CS1 Team (Sega CS R&D;) visual artist and character design team leader of the Yakuza series since the original episode, partially unveiled Yakuza 3\`s development at the 2009 Game Tools & Middleware Forum seminar held in Tokyo on June 15. Yakuza 3 character designing began shortly after the completion of Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Kenzan! in 2008 with a three- week project phase followed by an eight months production. In the end 110 high polygon characters, for they appear in Event Scene cinematics, plus 250 minor characters were created by 60 teams producing a dozen characters each. Thus 360 characters were produced following a \\"one person one body\\" philosophy and a three-day-per-body target schedule. As a comparison, the production of Yakuza on PlayStation 2 took 10 months and had no more volume. The series' production pace is one game per year since the original Yakuza in 2005. CS1 used a slogan to describe the game's graphics: . =Magical V-Engine= As with the previous PlayStation 3 Ry≈´ ga Gotoku game, main characters have their face scanned through Cyberware's head & face color 3D scanner (model PS). As detailed at the GTMF 2009, Event Scene cinematics are real-time and render highly detailed XSI 6.5 2.5MB data size characters using 18,000~20,000 polygons each; 3D model bones are made of 107 meshes with 64 used for the body and the remaining 43 used for the face. In addition, the PlayStation 3 employs advanced graphics technologies without LOD, texture size 512√ó512 front buffer with 512√ó512 back buffer, diffuse map and normal map, multi map (ambient occlusion, specular mask, 8-bit specular power RGB) within cutscene. These Event Scene cinematics fully exploit Sega's in-house facial expressions engine called Magical V-Engine. This engine is based on a unique \\"wrinkle shader\\" technology that allows for advanced facial animation from voice recordings alone. By animating based upon not only the phonetic lip syncing but tone, the software can emulate the basic human emotions in full facial expression. Audio Yakuza 3 outputs uncompressed or compressed audio, respectively Linear PCM 2ch/5.1ch (stereo or surround) and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.Ry≈´ ga Gotoku 3 Japanese edition back cover (BLJM-60132) =Cast= The game's main characters have their face modeled in 3D after their voice actors, who are Japanese celebrities. Softimage XSI 3D data is obtained by scanning a human head with Cyberware Inc.'s latest scanner. These include returning voice actors Takaya Kuroda (as Kazuma Kiryu), Rie Kugimiya (as Haruka Sawamura), Hidenari Ugaki as Goro Majima, and TV actor Satoshi Tokushige (as Daigo Dojima). New faces are film actors Tatsuya Fujiwara (as Rikiya Shimabukuro) known overseas for his Shuya Nanahara role in Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale and Battle Royale II: Requiem, Nakamura Shid≈ç II (as Yoshitaka Mine) who featured in Ronny Yu's Jet Li is Fearless and Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima, actor Tetsuya Watari (as Joji Fua) famous for his yakuza roles in Seijun Suzuki's Tokyo Drifter, Kinji Fukasaku's Graveyard of Honor and Takeshi Kitano's Brother, singers and tarento Shigeru Izumiya (as Shigeru Nakahara) and George Takahashi (as Goh Hamazaki), voice actor Akio ≈åtsuka (as Ryuzo Tamiya), tarento Daisuke Miyakawa (as Mikio Aragaki) and Hiroyuki Miyasako (as Tsuyoshi Kanda). =Soundtrack= The Ry≈´ ga Gotoku 3 Original Soundtrack (HCV-452) was published by Wave Master in Japan on February 26, 2009. It was bundled as a bonus enhanced CD in the Yakuza 3 PAL version's standard deluxe edition called the Battle Pack.

Marketing and release =Tie-in and product placement= Producer Toshihiro Nagoshi made twenty-seven tie-in with local companies to produce 3D model reproductions of existing shop, restaurant or hostess bar buildings. Such replicas include real exterior, interior, products, menus and sometimes jingles. Kabukicho's tie-in are Club Sega game centers, Don Quijote discount stores, Matsuya restaurants, Pronto caf√©s (a Suntory joint venture) and Karaoke Kan. Collaboration with Sole tanning studio, Promise, Aeon and Geos is limited to visible ads within Kamurocho. Okinawa's tie-ins are Blue Seal ice cream parlor, Quickly bubble tea stand, Sam's Maui steak house, Stone Market accessory shop, Okinawaya , Okinawarigura liquor storeOkinawarigura official website and Velotaxi Japan. Limited collaborations include the exterior design of Naha's Apa Hotel, Okinawa's Mitsukoshi and OPA department stores (which cannot be entered). Orion draft beer, Tantakatan sh≈çch≈´, Higashuzou awamori and Skymark Airlines have ads visible within the Downtown Ryukyu area. Sega extended its product placement policy which was introduced in the original episode. Now real products can be bought within discount and convenience stores including Axe fragrance, various Ace Cook instant noodles, several Suntory beers or soft drinks (such as Boss Coffee and C.C. Lemon), Pepsi soda (a Suntory licensee), Kodansha magazines (including Young Magazine, Weekly Morning and Vivi). This also applies to bars and pubs, since the Suntory group produces alcohol and owns many licenses for foreign alcoholic beverages like Early Times whiskey, Beefeater Gin, Courvoisier cognac and Carlsberg Beer. Suntory vending machines are still disseminated within Kamurocho as in the previous games. Some sub-scenarios even resolve around product placement with minor characters specially created to advertise products, for example the sidestory involving Ace Cook noodles and the fictitious ramen shop Ace Cook & Yakuza 3 tie-in - special site or Young Magazine and the generic convenience store Poppo. Some items on the food and drink menu, required for 100% completion, cannot be purchased without first being in possession of a copy of Tokyo Isshukan. =Versions= Eastern releases =Kamutai Magazine bundle= As part of the pre- ordering campaign, the Japanese and Asian first prints were bundled with a limited item, a monography called Kamutai Magazine (February 2009 issue). =Rising Dragon Pack= Sony celebrated the Japanese release of the game with a 10,000 console limited edition of the Ceramic White 80GB model PlayStation 3 called the . =Ukiyo's Bell= The eastern versions include an exclusive extra Adventure Mode item. If the game detects an existing save file of Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Kenzan! stored on the PlayStation 3 hard disk drive, a reward item will be unlocked in Ry≈´ ga Gotoku 3 upon beginning a new game. This is a red copper bell called used by Miyamoto Musashi (a.k.a. Kazumanosuke Kiryu) in the spin-off, which grants 3 points in the defense, edge and firearm stats when equipped. The bell was carried on to Yakuza 4, and retains its appearance, but is renamed Gion's Bell, and instead of protecting the wearer, it rewards money for every step taken. Western releases =Localization= The western version features the Japanese voice cast (with localized subtitles) and includes a previously unreleased 18-minute video interview of Tamiya according to the BBFC. Other bonus contents include a free compact disc with the game's original soundtrack and an animated character guide. Western packages also come with PlayStation Network redeem codes to unlock DLC; these western bundles are called Challenge Pack (time limited) and Battle Pack (regular). Although the game was not censored for the western release, much extra content was removed due to time constraints. According to a Sega representative: > \\"The content between Yakuza 3 US/UK and Yakuza JP is a little different in > that we took out certain bits in order to bring the game to the west in the > time alloted [sic] for us to do so. The parts we ended up taking out were > parts that we felt wouldn't make sense (like a Japanese history quiz game) > or wouldn't resonate as much (such as the concept of a hostess club). We > didn't replace the parts we took out, but we made absolutely sure that the > story continuity stayed intact so that the story experience was the same as > the Japanese version and that it didn't take away the human drama so > inherent to the Yakuza series.\\" The western localization of Yakuza 3 was officially unveiled by Sony and Sega in late December 2009. The same month, Sega Australia managing director Darren Macbeth declared in an interview with GameSpot: > \\"The publisher needs to be comfortable enough that there is a strong market > in the West before giving the go-ahead to local Japanese releases like the > Yakuza series. In a lot of cases we have a very strong vocal group of fans, > who demand the opportunity to play these games in their local markets, and > are very outspoken in their support. However, when the time comes, they are > reluctant to stay committed and actually make the purchase.\\" =Removed content= On February 24, 2010, a Sega America Blog community manager officially declared: > \\"We wanted to confirm that there is some content in the Japanese version of > Yakuza 3 that didn't make it over to upcoming Western version, mostly > involving the Hostess Clubs and the Japanese History trivia sections. [...] > The choice that had to be made was either no Yakuza 3 in the west, or a > version of the game that was almost exactly the same, but with a little less > trivia.\\" This statement was an answer to IGN journalist Greg Miller's unofficial insight report of February 23 claiming: > \\"Even though the hostess clubs are out, you can still go on dates with the > girls.[...] The strip clubs are still in Yakuza 3.\\" The referred strip clubs are \\"Show Pub Asia: Kamurocho Asia Beauty Show Dance and Pole\\" and Ryukyu's \\"Canal Grande: Cabaret Club\\", both are linked to main and side stories in the original Japanese release and therefore were not removed as confirmed by a new game trailer. A video showing the game's locations and was officially released by Sega on February 25.Yakuza 3 official trailer - Locations, Sega Europe's official YouTube account A Sega PR further commented to Kotaku blog on February 24, 2010: > \\"We had a tight schedule to abide by for localizing and releasing Yakuza 3 > in the west. Due to the limited time we were given we had to leave certain > bits of the game out and we chose portions we felt didn't resonate with > western culture i.e. a Japanese history quiz show and the concept of hostess > clubs. [...] Given the options of releasing the next chapter of a beloved > game so that our fans can experience the story of Yakuza vs. not releasing > it at all, we felt it was worth it to release it with 99% of the content > intact. We made sure that the story in no way, shape or form changed from > the lack of the quiz show or hostess clubs. You can still go into Cabarets > and on dates with the ladies in the game.\\" Sega gave no further details about what was cut, but comparing the eastern and western releases PSN Trophy lists revealed that five trophies (out of 50) had been removed, two sub-scenario missions (out of 103) were cut as well half- aspect of romancing the club hostesses (out of 10 completion challenges) and four minigames (out of 20). The remaining 45 trophies are the same as in the original Japanese 2009 release, except two Bronze trophies, named \\"Legendary Champion\\" and \\"Key Collector\\", were upranked as Silver trophies. Removal of a first trophy called hinted that the sidestory called was cut. This mission consists of scouting a young female NPC in the Downtown Ryukyu (Shoko, Hiromi, Sh≈ç and Kirie) or Kamurocho (Ritsuko) areas, and to make her the top hostess at cabaret club South Island, by customizing her physical aspects (with variable parameters such as make-up, haircut, outfit and √† la mode accessories). A similar club management mission was introduced in Yakuza 2,Yakuza 2 software manual (US edition), page 10 in which the club, rather than the girls, is customized. Club or \\"cabaret\\" hostesses are a common phenomenon in Japan and have dedicated fashion magazines; such as Koakuma Ageha which is a tie-in with the game. This mission reappeared in Ry≈´ ga Gotoku 4. Removal of a second trophy, , hinted that the ten-episode hostess clubs completion challenge had been partially cut, since the trophy is unlocked by spending a large amount of money in Club Ageha, Club Koakuma and Flawless. In this multipart completion, which is a romancing challenge, Kazuma Kiryu orders food and drink while conversing with the ten hostesses. All characters are modeled after a real Japanese hostesses cast and this gameplay element was introduced in the original Yakuza episode. The possibility of romancing club hostess characters outside clubs in the western releases of Yakuza 3, as officially announced by the Sega representatives, was eventually confirmed by the presence of Mika Tsuchiya of Flawless playing the pool minigame on the game's back cover.North American back cover This possibility is inherited from the Japanese version since the romancing completion challenge actually includes both hostess club dialogues (ordering meals and offering presents) and dating activities such as dual sessions of pool, darts, bowling and karaoke. If the former text part was cut, the latter dating part, which requires a minor translation work, definitely remain in the western releases. While the hostesses remained, the trophy was still removed since it was impossible to spend money on them within the club setting. The third trophy to be removed was which requires the player to take the Love In Heart massage parlor's two courses. This erotic minigame was cut along with its connected sidestory, where the masseuse, Ayaka Tsubaki, comes out to Kiryu as trans. This minor character is modeled after her voice actor, Ayana Tsubaki, who is a Japanese TV personality and trans herself. The fourth and fifth cut trophies, and respectively were the first sign that both shogi and mahjong minigames had been removed from the western releases. These are based on traditional board games that are fairly popular in Japan, yet uncommon overseas. Another confirmed cut was Kamurocho Club Sega's Answer & Answer, a Japanese history quiz minigame based on the real Sega arcade game, which is only available in Japanese game centers. The last cut was an Adventure Mode unlockable bonus item, Ukiyo's Bell, which is awarded to players of the eastern-only PlayStation 3 spinoff Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Kenzan! and, as such, would be both impractical and impossible for the majority of players. =Challenge Pack= According to a community manager's official announcement on the Sega America blog: > \\"Yakuza fans who pre-order the game at their local GameStop will receive > additional content via the Challenge Pack. This will allow them to enjoy 2 > player mini games, competing against their friends at Pool, Bowling, Darts > and Golf. They will also be able to customize their principal characters > with four alternative costumes for Kazuma, Haruka and Rikiya.\\" =Battle Pack= The PAL version was released as a standard deluxe edition called Battle Pack (or Premium Pack). The package's sticker lists the following free contents: > \\"Bonus enhanced CD soundtrack with a guide to Who's Who in the world of > Yakuza + 4 pieces of unlockable content.\\" As an ECD, this CD contains both audio and interactive features. The audio part is the full OST featuring the 31 tracks licensed by JASRAC; it was previously sold by Sega's audio branch in the Japanese market and is now offered to western customers. The data part cointains a fully animated characters guide called Yakuza Who's Who; like the OST these profiles are exclusive to the western releases. Licensed movie version North American video distributor Tokyo Shock (Media Blasters) set the release date and cover art of its licensed DVD version for Yakuza: Like A Dragon in order to match the local marketing for Yakuza 3. The English subtitled version for Takashi Miike's 2007 live-action film adaptation of the first Yakuza game was originally planned for a March 2010 release date; the release schedule was eventually changed to February 23, 2010. Release A free demo version was released on the Japanese PlayStation Store on February 19, 2009. The same demo was released on the European PlayStation Store on February 18, 2010.PlayStation Store Update 18th February Due to their commercial success all Asian versions had bargain re-releases, a PlayStation 3 the Best edition in Asia on November 30, 2009, then in Japan on December 3, 2009 and a PlayStation 3 BigHit Series edition on December 11, 2009 in Korea. Reception The Japanese industry gave it the \\"Award for excellence\\" in the Japan Game Awards 2009's \\"Games of the Year Division\\" for its \\"Dramatic story development, freedom of the story and the graphics elaborated up to the details of the work. In addition, amusement found in every portion of the game including the vast number of sub-stories and mini games.

It was established in 1993, after the demise of the previous service provider, Gray Coach. The service operated 20 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. It ran at 20-minute intervals during peak times and 30-minute intervals off-peak.Airport Express Airport Express (and Gray Coach before them) formerly operated two additional routes, one connecting the airport to Islington subway station and the other to Yorkdale and York Mills stations. These were withdrawn in 2000 after the TTC introduced a competing express bus service from Kipling station, which charges regular TTC fares but until 2013 used regular TTC buses with no space intended for luggage. The service ceased operation on October 31, 2014 due to declining ridership, which had fallen from 400,000 to 190,000 in ten years. The decline was attributed to the popularity of the Billy Bishop airport and delays due to downtown road construction. The closure of the service was in anticipation of the Union Pearson Express rail service which began operation in 2015. Staff and buses were re-deployed back into Pacific Western's other operations in Toronto. In response to the closure of Pacific Western's service, the Toronto Transit Commission enhanced its Route 900 Airport Express express bus service between Kipling subway station and the airport by retrofitting buses with luggage racks and increasing the frequency of buses on the route.

The title The title is a paraphrased partial quote of a line from Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: \\"Hain‚Äôt we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain‚Äôt that a big enough majority in any town?\\"  Plot  The novel is set around the time of its publication and follows Lucifer Clarence Dye, freshly exposed as a US intelligence agent following a bungled operation in Singapore (where a Chinese operative Dye had been trying to recruit instead died of a freak heart attack during a routine polygraph test.) Having just been released from a three-month term in a Singaporean jail in exchange for an official US apology (and a large bribe), Dye is cashiered by the small, independent agency Section 2 and is immediately offered a job by an eccentric young man, Victor Orcutt. A self- proclaimed genius, Orcutt has decided to address the then-topical challenge of urban decay; however, his immodestly named \\"Orcutt's First Law\\" states that \\"Before things get better, they must get much worse.\\" Dye's assignment is, therefore, to \\"corrupt me a city.\\" The city in question is Swankerton, a fictional settlement on the Texas Gulf Coast where Victor Orcutt Associates has been hired to aid the election of a \\"Reform\\" slate to city offices. Swankerton hardly needs corrupting, being practically afloat on a cesspool of vice and depravity already; the \\"Reform\\" poobahs are if anything worse than the current leadership, which is knee-deep in drugs, gambling, whores, and worse, and is backed by a New Orleans mob boss, Giuseppe \\"Joe Lucky\\" Lucarelli. Nevertheless, Dye and Orcutt's other operative, semi-disgraced ex- police chief Homer Necessary, dive right in. Alternating chapters flash back to Dye's past: his childhood as the ward of Tante Katerine, White Russian madam of Shanghai's best whorehouse, his adoption by Gorman Smalldane, war correspondent, and their internment by the Japanese, his marriage to the daughter of the head of Section 2 and his subsequent recruitment, and the violent rape and murder of his wife during an attempt by an enemy organization to coerce information out of his father-in-law. The rest of the main story deals with Dye's budding romance with Orcutt's assistant, the ex-prostitute Carol Thackerty, his meteoric ascent through the rotten power structure of Swankerton, and his conflict with Ramsey Lynch (n√©e Montgomery Vicker,) the New Orleans mob's representative in Swankerton and brother of Gerald Vicker, whom Dye had caused to be dismissed from Section 2 on suspicion of spying for China while Vicker was his subordinate at its Hong Kong station. After his efforts begin to draw attention, Dye is ordered out of the limelight by his former employers, a request he places himself in additional danger by refusing.  Tone  The book is written in first-person POV. Dye's narrative is clipped, matter-of-fact, and unembellished, though wickedly incisive on personal and social matters. While he is capable of acting decisively and forcefully, Dye's overall manner is apathetic and unmotivated, except slightly by money. Additionally he has several odd behavioral quirks, including an aversion to firearms, which apparently stem from the death of his wife. While he does not speak of it, the trauma of her loss seems to have left him in a prolonged state of something resembling shell-shock ‚Äì his foster-father Gorman Smalldane observes that Dye has spent the last fifteen years acting like a zombie.

A former ally of the Spaniards, Manco Inca rebelled in May 1536, and besieged a Spanish garrison in the city of Cusco. To end the stand-off, the besieged mounted a raid against the emperor's headquarters in the town of Ollantaytambo. The expedition, commanded by Hernando Pizarro, included 100 Spaniards and some 30,000 Indian auxiliaries against an Inca army more than 30,000 strong. There is some controversy over the actual location of the battle; according to some, it took place in the town itself, while Jean-Pierre Protzen and John HemmingJohn Hemmings, \\"Conquest of the Incas,\\" Chapter 10 argue that the nearby plain of Mascabamba better matches the descriptions of the encounter. In any case, the Inca army managed to hold the Spanish forces from a set of high terraces and flood their position to hinder their cavalry. Severely pressed and unable to advance, the Spaniards withdrew by night to Cusco. Despite this victory, the arrival of Spanish reinforcements to Cusco forced Manco Inca to abandon Ollantaytambo and seek refuge in the heavily forested region of Vilcabamba, where he established the small independent Neo-Inca State which survived until 1572. Prelude The crowning of Manco Inca as depicted in the chronicle of Guaman Poma In 1531, a group of Spaniards led by Francisco Pizarro landed on the shores of the Inca Empire, thus starting the Spanish conquest of Peru. At that time the empire was emerging from a civil war in which Atahualpa had defeated his brother Huascar to claim the title of Sapa Inca. Atahualpa underestimated the strength of the small force of Spaniards and was captured during an ambush at Cajamarca in November 1532. Pizarro ordered the execution of the emperor in July 1533, and occupied the Inca capital of Cusco four months later. To replace Atahualpa, Pizarro installed his brother T√∫pac Huallpa as a puppet ruler, but he died shortly afterwards. Another brother, Manco Inca, was crowned in his place. During this stage, Atahualpa's generals were the only opposition to the Spanish advance as a sizable part of the empire's population had fought on Huascar's side during the civil war and joined Pizarro against their enemies.D'Altroy, The Incas, pp. 311‚Äì319. For a while, Manco Inca and the conquistadors maintained cordial relations, together they defeated Atahualpa's generals and reestablished Inca rule over most of the empire.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 164‚Äì167. However, Manco came to realize that real authority rested in Spanish hands when his house was looted with impunity by a Spaniard mob in 1535.Hemming, The conquest, p. 171. Following this episode, the Inca emperor was subject to constant harassment as the Spaniards demanded gold, took away his wives, and even imprisoned him. In response, he fled his capital to start an uprising.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 173‚Äì183. In May 1536, an Inca army besieged Cusco, which was garrisoned by a group of Spaniards and native allies.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 185‚Äì187. The conquistadors were hard pressed but they managed to resist and counterattack, storming the main Inca stronghold at Sacsayhuaman.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 192‚Äì196. Meanwhile, Manco's generals occupied the central highlands of Peru and annihilated several expeditions sent to reinforce Cusco but failed in their attempt to take the recently founded Spanish capital of Lima.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 199‚Äì206. As a result of these events, neither side was able to break the deadlock at Cusco for several months, so the Spaniard garrison decided to make a direct attack on Manco's headquarters at the town of Ollantaytambo, northwest of the city.Hemming, The conquest, p. 206. Sources Primary sources about the battle of Ollantaytambo were written mainly by Spaniards. Pedro Pizarro, a cousin of Francisco Pizarro, was part of the expedition against Manco Inca's headquarters. Years later he wrote down his recollections of these and other events in a chronicle called Relaci√≥n del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Per√∫, completed in 1571.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 511, 532. The anonymous Relaci√≥n del sitio del Cuzco y principio de las guerras civiles del Per√∫ hasta la muerte de Diego de Almagro starts in January 1536 when Hernando Pizarro arrived in Cusco, and ends with the execution of Diego de Almagro in July 1538. This chronicle, which includes an account of Manco Inca's rebellion and the attack on Ollantaytambo, was written in 1539 probably by Diego de Silva, a Spanish soldier who was actually in Lima during the uprising.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 181, 505, 555. An account of the battle was also included in the Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano written by Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas between 1610 and 1615.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 508, 559. Herrera was the Cronista Mayor de las Indias (Chronicler-in- Chief of the Indies) of the Spanish Crown and despite writing in Madrid, had access to many documents and sources. On the Inca side, the only written account of the battle is included in the Relaci√≥n de la conquista del Per√∫ y hechos del Inca Manco II written in 1570 by Titu Cusi Yupanqui, son of Manco Inca.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 513, 559. Order of battle Combat between Inca and Spanish forces as depicted by Guaman Poma Manco Inca had gathered more than 30,000 troops at Ollantaytambo, among them, a large number of recruits from tribes of the Amazon Rainforest.Vega, Incas contra espa√±oles, p. 79. Manco Inca's forces were a militia army made up mostly of conscripted farmers with only rudimentary weapons training.Hemming, The conquest, p. 207. This was the regular fare in the Inca Empire, where military service was a duty for all married men between 25 and 50 years old.D'Altroy, The Incas, p. 217. In combat, these soldiers were organized according to their ethnic group and led into battle by their native leaders, called kurakas.D'Altroy, The Incas, p. 233. They used melee weapons such as maces, clubs, and spears, as well as ranged weapons such as arrows, javelins, and slings; protective gear included helmets, shields, and quilted cloth armor.D'Altroy, The Incas, p. 227. Against the conquistadors, wooden clubs and maces with stone or bronze heads were rarely able to penetrate Spanish armor;Hemming, The conquest, p. 114. slings and other missile throwing weapons were somewhat more effective due to their accuracy and the large size of their projectiles.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 114‚Äì115, 187. Even so, Inca soldiers were no match for the Spanish cavalry in open terrain so they resorted to fighting on rough terrain and digging pits in open fields to hinder the mobility of horses. The attack was led by Hernando Pizarro, the senior Spanish commander in Cusco, with a force of 100 Spaniards (30 infantry, 70 cavalry) and an estimated 30,000 native allies.Hemming, The conquest, p. 207; Vega, Incas contra espa√±oles, p. 78. One of his main assets against the Inca armies was the Spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power, maneuverability, speed, and stamina over Inca warriors.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 109‚Äì111. All Spaniards wore some kind of armor, the most commonly used types were chain mail shirts and padded cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits; they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 112‚Äì113. The main Spanish offensive weapon was the steel sword, which horsemen supplemented with the lance; both weapons could easily penetrate the padded armor worn by Inca troops.Hemming, The conquest, p. 113. Firearms, such as arquebuses were rarely used during the Spanish conquest of Peru because they were scarce, hard to use, and despised by horsemen as an ungentlemanly weapon.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 113‚Äì114. Spaniards relied heavily on Indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies.D'Altroy, The Incas, p. 319. These native troops had the same sorts of arms and armor as their Inca counterparts. During the Ollantaytambo campaign, the Pizarro expedition included thousands of auxiliaries, mainly Ca√±aris, Chachapoyas, and Wankas, as well as several members of the Inca nobility opposed to Manco Inca.Vega, Incas contra espa√±oles, p. 78. Battle The main access route to Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley formed in the mountains by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu to the west and with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a last line of defense.Protzen, Inca architecture, pp. 22‚Äì26. Faced with these constraints, the Spanish expedition had to cross the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots, and boulders coming down from the terraces as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry, the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor, and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 208‚Äì209. Battle site Inca terraces at Ollantaytambo The actual location of the battle is the subject of some controversy. According to Canadian explorer John Hemming, Spanish forces occupied a plain between Ollantaytambo and the Urubamba River while the main Inca army was located on a citadel (the Temple Hill) overlooking the town, protected by seventeen terraces.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 207‚Äì208. However, Swiss architect Jean-Pierre Protzen argues that the topography of the town and its surrounding area does not match contemporary descriptions of the battle. An anonymous account attributed to Diego de Silva claims that the Inca army occupied a set of eleven terraces, not seventeen; while the chronicle of Pedro Pizarro describes a gate flanked by walls as the only way through the terraces. Protzen thinks that these descriptions allude to a set of eleven terraces that close the plain of Mascabamba, near Ollantaytambo, which include the heavily fortified gate of T'iyupunku. At this location, when the Spaniards faced the terraces they would have had the Urubamba River to their left and the steep hill of Cerro Pinkuylluna to their right, matching the three sides from which they were attacked during the battle. If Protzen's hypothesis is correct, the river diverted to flood the battlefield was the Urubamba, and not its smaller affluent, the Patakancha, which runs alongside the town of Ollantaytambo.Protzen, Inca architecture, pp. 22‚Äì23. Aftermath The success at Ollantaytambo encouraged Manco Inca to make a renewed attempt against Cusco. However, the Spaniards discovered the Inca army concentrating near the city and mounted a night attack, which inflicted heavy casualties.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 210‚Äì212. On April 18, 1537, a Spanish army led by Diego de Almagro returned from a long expedition to Chile and occupied Cusco. Almagro imprisoned Hernando Pizarro and his brother Gonzalo because he wanted the city for himself; most Spanish troops and their auxiliaries joined his side.Hemming, The conquest, p. 220. He had previously tried to negotiate a settlement with Manco Inca but his efforts failed when both armies clashed at Calca, near Cusco.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 218‚Äì219. With the Spaniards' position consolidated by Almagro's reinforcements, Manco Inca decided that Ollantaytambo was too close to Cusco to be tenable so he withdrew further west to the town of Vitcos.Hemming, The conquest, p. 222. Almagro sent his lieutenant Rodrigo Org√≥√±ez in pursuit with 300 Spaniards and numerous Indian auxiliaries. In July 1537, Orgo√±ez occupied and sacked Vitcos taking many prisoners, but Manco managed to escape.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 223‚Äì225. He took refuge at Vilcabamba, a remote location where the Neo-Inca State was established and lasted until the capture and execution of T√∫pac Amaru, its last emperor, in 1572.D'Altroy, The Incas, pp. 319‚Äì320.

His grandparents include both French economist and mathematician G√©rard Debreu and Hungarian-born American theoretical physicist Edward Teller. He received the nickname \\"Astro\\" after high school friends compared his flat-top haircut to AstroTurf, and he reportedly had the image of cartoon dog Astro from The Jetsons painted on his car door in college. Teller holds a Bachelor of Science in computer science from Stanford University, Masters of Science in symbolic computation (symbolic and heuristic computation), also from Stanford, and a PhD in artificial intelligence from Carnegie Mellon University, where he was a recipient of a Hertz fellowship. Career After working as a teacher at Stanford, he became a business executive. Since 2010, Teller has been directing Google X (which has become X) laboratories.Gertner, John, \\"The Truth About Google X: An Exclusive Look Behind The Secretive Lab's Closed Doors\\", Fast Company magazine, May 2014 issue. Projects at Google X include Google Glass, Google driverless car, Google Contact Lens, and Project Loon. Google X spun its project called Genie out into a stand-alone business in 2012. Teller gave a TED Talk at TED2016 on the importance of failure in Google X's approach to pioneering new projects. On 18 October 2016, it was announced that Teller would temporarily be in charge of X's Project Wing while the search for its next permanent leader was underway. In 2017, Teller was honored with an Edison Achievement Award for his commitment to innovation throughout his career. Entrepreneur Teller was the co-founder and chairman of BodyMedia, makers of the BodyMedia FIT, Bodybugg, and Sensewear armbands (wearable devices that measure sleep, perspiration, motion, and calories burned). He is also co-founder, director, and former CEO of Cerebellum Capital. Speaker In May 2001, Teller was featured on NPR's radio program All Things Considered, discussing how the good economy has shaped the attitudes of 30-year-olds towards their jobs. Teller is the co-founder and co-host of the Solve for X annual event and internet community. He has lectured at the TEDMED Conference (2003 and 2004), South By Southwest (2013), and ideaCity (2004). In 2008, he appeared as a political commentator on the national French television station France 24. Author Teller's novel, Exegesis, was published in 1997. It was translated into Dutch, Japanese, Danish, German, Italian, and Greeklish. A second novel, Among These Savage Thoughts, was published in 2006. An experimental novel, it deals with the protagonist's journey to reinvent himself in the imaginary mountain society of Karabas.

Whereas high-power lasers are used in laser medicine to cut or destroy tissue, it is claimed that application of low-power lasers relieves pain or stimulates and enhances cell function. The effects of LLLT appear to be limited to a specified set of wavelengths, and administering LLLT below the dose range does not appear to be effective. Despite a lack of consensus over its validity, some studies suggest that LLLT may be modestly effective, in relieving short- term pain for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, acute and chronic neck pain, tendinopathy, and possibly, chronic joint disorders. The evidence for LLLT being useful in dentistry, and in the treatment of wound healing is unclear. Names Variations of LLLT have gone by a variety of alternate names including low-power laser therapy (LPLT), soft laser therapy, low-intensity laser therapy, low-energy laser therapy, cold laser therapy, bio-stimulation laser therapy, photobiomodulation, photo- biotherapy, therapeutic laser, and monochromatic infrared light energy (MIRE) therapy.American Cancer Society. Cold Laser Therapy Page archived April 24, 2015 When LLLT is administered to acupuncture points, the procedure is called laser acupuncture. When applied to the head, LLLT may be known as transcranial photobiomodulation, transcranial near-infrared laser therapy (NILT), or transcranial low level light therapy. Medical uses Various LLLT devices have been promoted for use in treatment of several musculoskeletal conditions including carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. They have also been promoted for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, wound healing, smoking cessation, and tuberculosis. While these treatments may briefly help some people with pain management, evidence does not support claims that they change long term outcomes, or that they work better than other, low tech ways of applying heat. LLLT appears to be effective for preventing oral mucositis in recipients of a stem cell transplant with chemotherapy. Mechanism Research is ongoing about the mechanism of LLLT. The effects of LLLT appear to be limited to a specified set of wavelengths of laser, and administering LLLT below the dose range does not appear to be effective. Photochemical reactions are well known in biological research, and LLLT make use of the first law in photochemistry (Grotthuss- Draper law): light must be absorbed by a chemical substance in order for a photochemical reaction to take place. In LLLT that chemical substance is represented by the respiratory enzyme cytochrome c oxidase which is involved in the electron transport chain in mitochondria, which is the generally accepted theory. History Hungarian physician and surgeon Endre Mester (1903-1984) is credited with the discovery of the biological effects of low power lasers, which occurred a few years after the 1960 invention of the ruby laser and the 1961 invention of the helium‚Äìneon (HeNe) laser. Mester accidentally discovered that low-level ruby laser light could regrow hair during an attempt to replicate an experiment that showed that such lasers could reduce tumors in mice. The laser he was using was faulty and wasn't so powerful as he thought. It failed to affect the tumors, but he noticed that in the places where he had shaved the mice in order to do the experiments, the hair grew back more quickly on the treated mice than on those among the control group. He published those results in 1967. He went on to show that low level HeNe light could accelerate wound healing in mice. By the 1970s he was applying low level laser light to treat people with skin ulcers. In 1974 he founded the Laser Research Center at the Semmelweis Medical University in Budapest, and continued working there for the remainder of his life. His sons carried on his work and brought it to the United States. By 1987 companies selling lasers were claiming that they could treat pain, accelerate healing of sports injuries, and treat arthritis, but there was little evidence for this at that time. By 2016 they had been marketed for wound healing, smoking cessation, tuberculosis, and musculoskeletal conditions such as temporomandibular joint disorders, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and there was still little evidence for these uses, other than a possible use in temporarily treating muscle or joint pain. Mester originally called this approach \\"laser biostimulation'\\", but it soon became known as ‚Äúlow level laser therapy\\" and with the adaptation of light emitting diodes by those studying this approach, it became known as \\"low level light therapy\\", and to resolve confusion around the exact meaning of \\"low level\\", the term \\"photobiomodulation\\" arose. Society and culture =Reimbursement= In the US as of 2006 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did not provide coverage for LLLT.\\"Decision memo for infrared therapy devices\\" (CAG00291N). Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Oct 24, 2006.

Aetna has additional information in its \\"Clinical Policy Bulletin on Cold Laser and High-Power Laser Therapies\\". In Norway the use of LLLT is reimbursed through physical therapy.https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2018-09-25-1465#KAPITTEL_3 Research Demonstration of LLLT with intranasal irradiation =Musculoskeletal= A 2008 Cochrane Library review concluded that LLLT has insufficient evidence for treatment of nonspecific low back pain, a finding echoed in a 2010 review of chronic low back pain. A 2015 review found benefit in nonspecific chronic low-back pain. LLLT may be useful in the treatment of both acute and chronic neck pain. In 2013, however, a systematic review and meta-analysis of LLLT for neck pain indicated that the benefit was not of significant importance and that the evidence had a high risk of bias. There are tentative data that LLLT is useful in the short-term treatment of pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis, and possibly chronic joint disorders. While it does not appear to improve pain in temporomandibular disorders, it may improve function. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence for pain reduction in osteoarthritis. There is tentative evidence of benefit in tendinopathy. A 2014 review found benefit in shoulder tendinopathy. A 2014 Cochrane review found tentative evidence that it may help in frozen shoulders. Evidence does not support a benefit in delayed-onset muscle soreness. It may be useful for muscle pain and injuries. =Mouth= Similarly, the use of lasers to treat chronic periodontitis and to speed healing of infections around dental implants is suggested, but there is insufficient evidence to indicate a use superior to traditional practices. There is tentative evidence for dentin hypersensitivity. It does not appear to be useful for orthodontic pain LLLT might be useful for wisdom tooth extraction (complications) and oral mucositis. =Hair loss= LLLT has been studied as a treatment for hair loss; a review in 2012 found little evidence to support the use of lasers to treat hair loss. A 2014 review found tentative evidence for benefit for lasers, while another 2014 review concluded that the results were mixed, had a high risk of bias, and that its effectiveness was unclear. A 2015 review found tentative evidence of benefit,. Additionally, a 2017 review of clinical trials found 10 of 11 trials reviewed \\"demonstrated significant improvement of androgenic alopecia in comparison to baseline or controls when treated with LLLT.\\" =Brain injuries= LLLT has been studied for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke among other conditions. When applied to the head it is known as transcranial photobiomodulation or transcranial low level light therapy. =Cancer treatment side effects= LLLT has been studied as a way to reduce pain and swelling in breast-cancer related lymphedema. Stephen Barrett, writing for Quackwatch, concluded in 2009 there was evidence to support LLLT use for temporary pain relief, but \\"there's no reason to believe that they will influence the course of any ailment or are more effective than other forms of heat delivery.\\" Barrett's position was unchanged as of 2018. =Stem cells= An ongoing area of research is the application of LLLT for increasing cell proliferation, including stem cells. Veterinary use Veterinary clinics use cold laser devices to treat a wide variety of ailments, from arthritis to wounds, on dogs and cats.Robinson, Narda G. (2013), \\"Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Laser Therapy\\", The Merck Veterinary Manual, 11th edition. Very little research has been done on the effects of this treatment on animals. Currently, laser therapy equipment is aggressively marketed to veterinarians as a supposedly powerful therapeutic tool and revenue generator. Brennen McKenzie, president of the Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine Association, has stated that \\"research into cold laser in dogs and cats is sparse and generally low quality. Most studies are small and have minimal or uncertain controls for bias and error\\".McKenzie, Brennen (2016), \\"The Laser Craze: What Is the Evidence for Low-level Laser Therapy?\\" [SA222]; Western Veterinary Conference, Proceedings of the WVC 88th Annual Conference, Mandalay Bay Convention Center, Resort and Casino, Las Vegas, NV, March 6‚Äì10, 2016.McKenzie, Brennen (2016), \\"WVC 2016: The Laser Craze\\", The SkeptVet. While allowing that some studies show promising results, he reports that others do not.

It was the first high-speed train put into service in Spain, in 1992.  History  This class lived through all the changes involved in the creation of the Spanish high-speed network; originally the plan was to build the high-speed route to Andalusia on an Iberian gauge track (). At the last minute, it was decided that it should be , meaning RENFE changed its original order for 24 Iberian gauge units to sixteen standard gauge ones, which were delivered between 1991 and 1993. After various changes in the contract with Alstom and compensation for delays the final eight were delivered; two standard gauge sets and 6 Iberian gauge sets. The Iberian sets became the RENFE Class 101 which used to operate the Euromed services along the Mediterranean corridor (this route is now covered by the RENFE Class 130 trains). Train 100.015 set one of the most important speed records in Spain, reaching on a test run. Its previous record had been on an earlier test run. The Class 100 was also involved in speed tests using Talgo carriages. In a collision in 2002 one of the power cars of set 100.012 was severely damaged. The car was rebuilt by using the newer TGV-Duplex design, giving this set the unique feature of having two different model power cars. This class has almost exclusively served the Madrid‚ÄìSeville high-speed rail line. They were used on the Madrid‚ÄìBarcelona high-speed rail line for a short period until introduction of the RENFE Class 102. The units used on the Barcelona line had to have their pantographs changed as well as installation of the ERTMS system. In 2007, after fifteen years of service‚Äîhalf of the trains' expected working life‚Äîthe entire Class 100 fleet was refurbished. In February 2011, on account of financial pressures, RENFE announced that, instead of buying 10 new trains to cover the Paris-Madrid route, it would convert AVE Class 100 trains for the route, at a cost of ‚Ç¨30 million, rather than ‚Ç¨270 million. RENFE announced that the capacity would be increased to keep the cost down, in addition to the conversion work planned for the trains' electrification and signaling systems. In 2013, some S100 trains have been changed for French homologation making them compatible with French signaling system and so be able to cross the French border. The aim is to create rail service between major French cities and main Spanish cities (Madrid and Barcelona) simultaneously with SNCF. Air Nostrum propose to lease some from RENFE to operate services from Madrid Atocha to Gare de Montpellier-Saint-Roch from October 2018.  Technical information  The Series 100 is directly derived from the TGV Atlantique trains that operate in France. Eight sets were manufactured by Alstom and the remainder by CAF. A Series 100 train is made up of two 4,400 kW power cars with two motorized bogies each and eight passenger cars with shared bogies. It is compatible with the standard gauge. It is compatible with overhead currents of 3 kV DC and 25 kV 50 Hz alternating current. Unlike its model, it has both the (used in Spain) and Linienzugbeeinflussung (used in Germany and in Spain) signaling systems. Furthermore, since 2004 nine of the trains have the ERTMS system installed, as well as two extra coaches and cooling systems specially adapted to temperatures in Spain.

Although Christians inherited some biblical texts that describe numerous examples of polygamy among devotees to God, most Christian groups have historically rejected the practice of polygamy and have upheld monogamy alone as normative. Nevertheless, some Christians groups in different periods have practiced, or currently do practice, polygamy. Some Christians actively debate whether the New Testament or Christian ethics allows or forbids polygamy and there are several Christian views on the Old Covenant. This debate focuses almost exclusively on polygyny (one man having more than one wife) and not polyandry (one woman having more than one husband). Jewish background =Old Testament= Polygamy is found in the Old Testament and over 40 important figures had more than one wife, such as Esau though being considered an enemy of Jacob, Elkanah, and Solomon. Multiple marriage occurred on several occasions on the will of man in the case of famine, widowhood, or female infertility. The practice of levirate marriage obligated a man whose brother has left a widow without heir to marry her. Abraham was told he would have a son but did not wait for the promise and had a son with his servant. God fulfilled his promise anyway and Isaac was born. states that the king shall not have many wives or horses, or accumulate large amounts of silver and gold. =Intertestamental period= Polygamy was a rare exception in post- exilic Israel. The practice began to be criticized and declined during the intertestamental period but there is some extant evidence of polygamy being practiced in the New Testament period. The Dead Sea Scrolls show that several smaller Jewish sects forbade polygamy before and during the time of Jesus. The Temple Scroll (11QT LVII 17‚Äì18) seems to prohibit polygamy. =Rabbinic= According to Rabbi Naftali Silberberg, in Jewish thought, polygamy is not nor was it ever the ideal state because a polygamous family is never mentioned in either the Talmud or the Midrash and as a result, it is not completely clear if polygamy was ever the norm. He also states that almost all polygamous relationships which are mentioned in the Bible existed for specific reasons such as when wives were barren (Sarah, Leah, etc), when monarchs got married in order to cement relationships between tribes, and when Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah. New Testament Three passages in the pastoral epistles (, and ) state that church leaders should be the \\"husband of one wife.\\" This has been read by some Christian sects as a prohibition of polygamy. Others argue that polygamy is allowed, but not for church leaders. Still others argue that the passage only prevents church leaders from divorcing their first wives. In his 1990 book Walter Lock argues that it simply prevents marital unfaithfulness since \\"no Christian, whether an overseer or not, would have been allowed to practice polygamy.\\" In Paul the Apostle states that a man is to have his own wife and a woman is to have her own husband. \\"Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: ‚ÄúIt is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.‚Äù 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman should have her own husband. 3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife should give to her husband his conjugal rights. 4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\\" comments on : He (Paul the Apostle) informs them that marriage, and the comforts and satisfactions of that state, are by divine wisdom prescribed for preventing fornication (v. 2), Porneias ‚ÄîFornications, all sorts of lawless lust. To avoid these, let every man, says he, have his own wife, and every woman her own husband; that is, marry, and confine themselves to their own mates. And, when they are married, let each render the other due benevolence (v. 3), consider the disposition and exigency of each other, and render conjugal duty, which is owing to each other. For, as the apostle argues (v. 4), in the married state neither person has power over his own body, but has delivered it into the power of the other, the wife hers into the power of the husband, the husband his into the power of the wife. Note, Polygamy, or the marriage of more persons than one, as well as adultery, must be a breach of marriage-covenants, and a violation of the partner‚Äôs rights. Gill comments on 1 Corinthians 7 and states that polygamy is unlawful; and that one man is to have but one wife, and to keep to her; and that one woman is to have but one husband, and to keep to him and the wife only has a power over the husband's body, a right to it, and may claim the use of it: this power over each other's bodies is not such, as that they may, by consent, either the husband allow the wife, or the wife the husband, to lie with another. =One flesh= Although the New Testament is largely silent on the issue, some point to Jesus' repetition of the earlier scriptures, noting that a man and a wife \\"shall become one flesh.\\" However, some look to Paul's writings to the Corinthians: \\"Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, 'The two will become one flesh. Supporters of polygamy claim this indicates that the term refers to a physical, rather than spiritual, union. =Cleave to wife= Most Christian theologians argue that in and referring to Jesus explicitly states a man should have only one wife: Polygamists do not dispute that in marriage \\"two shall be one flesh\\", they only disagree with the idea that a married man can only be \\"one flesh\\" with one woman. Assuming the man is married, the fact that a man can even be \\"one flesh\\" with a harlot apparently does not negate his being \\"one flesh\\" with his wife. Further, if a man is married, he and his wife are \\"one flesh.\\" To add another wife would mean that the new wife becomes \\"one flesh\\" with the man and his current wife. Gill argues that polygamists in disagreeing with the idea that a married man can only be \\"one flesh\\" with one woman are in fact disagreeing with Apostle Paul, who makes it clear that in the Christian Covenant the man who already has one wife can not add another wife because his body belongs to the one wife and is no longer his; if the man adds another wife, then that woman is coveting another woman's husband. In the Christian Covenant, a woman shalt not covet another woman's husband just like in the Mosaic Covenant a man is shalt not covet another man's wife. =Husband of one wife= Many critics of polygamy also point to the Pauline epistles that state that church officials should be respectable, above reproach, and the husband of a single wife. Hermeneutically, the Greek phrase mias gunaikos andra is an unusual Greek construction, capable of being translated in multiple ways, including (but not limited to): 1) \\"one wife man,\\" (prohibiting plural marriage) or 2) \\"a wife man\\" (requiring elders to be married) or 3) \\"first wife man\\" (prohibiting divorc√©s from ordination). In the time around Jesus' birth, polygamy (also called bigamy or digamy in texts) was understood as having several spouses consecutively, as evidenced for example by Tertullian's work De Exhortatione Castitatis. The Apostle Paul allowed widows to remarry (1 Cor. vii. 39. and 1 Tim 5:11‚Äì16). Paul says that only one man women older than 60 years can make the list of Christian widows, but that younger widows should remarry to hinder sin. Some conclude that by requiring leaders of the Church be one woman men, Paul excluded remarried widowers from having influence. This would have been a more strict understanding of monogamy than Roman law codified, and would have been a new and unusual demand on men. On this subject William Luck writes: Early Church period Jewish polygamy clashed with Roman monogamy at the time of the early church: Tertullian, who lived at the turn of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, wrote that marriage is lawful, but polygamy is not: The 3rd century Eusebius of Caesarea wrote the lost work \\"On the Numerous Progeny of the Ancients\\". Eusebius references this twice, in the Pr√¶paratio Evangelica, and in the Demonstratio Evangelica. Although his work has been given as an example of plural marriage being reconciled with the ascetic life, the problem dealt with was the contrast presented by the desire of the Patriarchs for numerous offspring and the honour in which continence was held by Christians. Basil of Caesarea wrote in the 4th century of plural marriage that \\"such a state is no longer called marriage but polygamy or, indeed, a moderate fornication.\\" He ordered that those who are engaged in it should be excommunicated for up to five years, and \\"only after they have shown some fruitful repentance\\" were they to be allowed back into the church. Moreover, he stated that the teachings against plural marriage are \\"accepted as our usual practice, not from the canons but in conformity with our predecessors.\\" Augustine wrote in the second half of the 4th century that and \\"The Sacrament of marriage of our time has been so reduced to one man and one wife, as that it is not lawful to ordain any as a steward of the Church, save the husband of one wife.\\" Socrates of Constantinople wrote in the 5th century that the Roman Emperor Valentinian I took two wives and authorized his subjects to take two wives, supporting that Christians were then practicing plural marriage. There is no trace of such an edict in any of the extant Roman Laws. Valentinian I divorced his first wife according to John Malalas, the Chronicon Paschale and John of Nikiu, before marrying his mistress, which was viewed as bigamy by Socrates, since the Church did not accept divorce. Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Tertullian all spoke against polygamy, condemning it. Tertullian explicitly tackled the objection that polygamy was allowed for the patriarchs. He wrote, \\"each pronouncement and arrangement is (the act) of one and the same God; who did then indeed, in the beginning, send forth a sowing of the race by an indulgent laxity granted to the reins of connubial alliances, until the world should be replenished, until the material of the new discipline should attain to forwardness: now, however, at the extreme boundaries of the times, has checked (the command) which He had sent out, and recalled the indulgence which He had granted\\". (De Monogamia chapt. VI.) According to chapter XVI of De Monogamia, Hermogenes thought it was allowed for a man to take several wives. Tertullian also made a direct attack on the polygamous practice of some cults in his work Adversus Hermogenem. This is the same Hermogenes mentioned above. Tertullian writes that he was a sect leader, who mixed Stoic, Gnostic and Christian views to create a new religion. Middle Ages The Church held a synod in Hertford, England, in 673 that was supervised by Archbishop Theodore. Chapter 10 issued by the synod declared that marriage is allowed between one man and one woman, and separation (but not divorce) is only granted in the case of adultery, but even then remarriage is not allowed. In the medieval period, multiple wives were often obtained through kidnapping. It is with this in view that we must interpret the following laws: The Frankish Laws of 818‚Äì9 strictly forbade kidnapping of women. The XXVII. law issued by King Stephen I of Hungary (1000‚Äì1030) declares that the kidnapper must return the woman to her parents even if he has had sexual intercourse with her, and must pay a penalty to the parents. According to the Hungarian law, the kidnapped girl was then free to marry whomever. The Roman councils of 1052 and 1063 suspended from communion those laymen who had a wife and a concubine at the same time. Divorce was also forbidden, and remarriage after a divorce counted as polygamy. Nicholas the Great (858‚Äì67) forbade Lothair II of Lotharingia to divorce his barren wife Teutberga and marry his concubine Waldrada, with whom he had several children. After a council of the Lotharingian bishops, as well as the archbishop of K√∂ln and Trier had annulled his marriage to Theutberga, the pope voided this decision, and made him take his wife back. In Scandinavia, the word for an official concubine was \\"frille\\". Norwegian Bishop √òystein Erlendsson (ca. 1120‚Äì1188) declared that concubines were not allowed to accept the sacraments unless they married, and men were forced to promise marriage to women they had lain with outside of wedlock. In 1280, the Norwegian king Eirik Magnusson (1280‚Äì99) declared that men were exempted from having to promise marriage to the frille if they went to confession and did penance. The Church answered by making several declarations in the 14th century, urging men to marry their concubines. In 1305, King H√•kon V (1299‚Äì1319) issued a law that declared marriage to be the only lawful way of cohabitation, and declared that only women in wedlock were allowed to dress as they pleased, while the dress of concubines was restricted. Reformation period When asked for an opinion on polygamy in 1526, Luther wrote, \\"It is my earnest warning and counsel that Christians especially shall have no more than one wife, not only because it is a scandal, which a Christian should avoid most diligently, but also because there is no word of God here to show that God approves it in Christians.... I must oppose it, especially in Christians, unless there be need, as for instance if the wife be a leper, or be taken away from the husband in some other way.\\" Monogamy was the norm among Christians, However, in the context of the sickness of a wife preventing matrimonial intercourse, the founder of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther wrote: \\"I confess that I cannot forbid a person to marry several wives, for it does not contradict the Scripture. If a man wishes to marry more than one wife he should be asked whether he is satisfied in his conscience that he may do so in accordance with the word of God. In such a case the civil authority has nothing to do in the matter.\\"Luter, Martin. De Wette II, 459, ibid., pp. 329‚Äì330. Arthur Cushman McGiffert also states, Lutheran theologians approved of Philip of Hesse's polygamous marriages to Christine of Saxony and Margarethe von der Saale for this purpose, as well as initial disapproval of divorce and adultery. As well as Phillip, there was much experimentation with marital duration within early German Lutheranism amongst clergy and their erstwhile wives. The theologian Philipp Melanchthon likewise counseled that Henry VIII need not risk schism by dissolving his union with the established churches to grant himself divorces in order to replace his barren wives, but reluctantly, and with remorse afterward, consented that polygamy was an allowable alternative. Anabaptist leader Bernhard Rothmann initially opposed the idea of plural marriage. However, he later wrote a theological defense of plural marriage, and took nine wives himself, saying \\"God has restored the true practice of holy matrimony amongst us.\\" Franz von Waldeck and the other enemies of Anabaptist leader John of Leiden accused him of keeping 16 wives, and publicly beheading one when she disobeyed him. This was used as the basis for their conquest of M√ºnster in 1535. The 16th-century Italian Capuchin monk, Bernardino Ochino, 77 years old and never married, wrote the \\"Thirty Dialogues\\", wherein Dialog XXI was considered a defense of plural marriage. Evidently, he borrowed some of his strongest arguments from a Lutheran dialogue written in 1541 in favor of plural marriage which was written under the fictitious name Huldericus Necobulus in the interest of justifying Philip of Hesse. A different position was taken by the Council of Trent in 1563, which was opposed to polygyny and concubinage, If anyone says that it is lawful for Christians to have several wives at the same time, and that it is not forbidden by any divine law (Matt. 19:4f): let him be anathema\\". The polemicist John Milton expressed support for polygamy in his De doctrina christiana. The Lutheran pastor Johann Lyser strongly defended plural marriage in a work entitled \\"Polygamia Triumphatrix\\". As a result, he was imprisoned, beaten and exiled from Italy to the Netherlands. His book was burned by the public executioner. He never married nor desired wedlock. Samuel Friedrich Willenberg, a doctor of law at the University of Cracow wrote the pro-plural marriage book De finibus polygamiae licitae. In 1715, his book was ordered to be burned. Friedrich escaped with his life, but was fined one hundred thousand gold pieces. One of the more notable published works regarding the modern concept of Christian Plural Marriage dates from the 18th century. The book Thelyphthora was written by Martin Madan, a significant writer of hymns and a contemporary of John Wesley and Charles Wesley. Although Madan was an adherent only of polygyny in a Christian context, this particular volume set the foundation of what is considered the modern Christian Plural Marriage movement. Modern period =Catholic Church= The Council of Trent condemns polygamy: \\"If any one saith, that it is lawful for Christians to have several wives at the same time, and that this is not prohibited by any divine law; let him be anathema..\\" The Catechism forbids polygamy as a grave offense against marriage and contrary to the original plan of God and equal dignity of human beings. Nevertheless, in parts of Africa such as Kenya, many Roman Catholics including catechists, have more than one wife although these people are usually not vocal about the cultural practice because it is in conflict with Roman Catholic teaching. =Lutheran Church= The Lutheran World Federation hosted a regional conference in Africa, in which the acceptance of polygamists and their wives into full membership by the Lutheran Church in Liberia was defended as being permissible. While the Lutheran Church in Liberia permits men to retain their wives if they married them prior to being received into the Church, it does not permit polygamists who have become Christians to marry more wives after they have received the sacrament of Holy Baptism. Evangelical Lutheran missionaries in Maasai also tolerate the practice of polygamy and in Southern Sudan, some polygamists are becoming Lutheran Christians. =Anglican Communion= Polygamy was first discussed during the Lambeth Conference of 1888: :\\"That it is the opinion of this Conference that persons living in polygamy be not admitted to baptism, but they may be accepted as candidates and kept under Christian instruction until such time as they shall be in a position to accept the law of Christ. That the wives of polygamists may, in the opinion of this Conference, be admitted in some cases to baptism, but that it must be left to the local authorities of the Church to decide under what circumstances they may be baptized.\\" (Resolution 5). A resolution dated 1958 and numbered 120 states that: :\\"(a) The Conference bears witness to the truth that monogamy is the divine will, testified by the teaching of Christ himself, and therefore true for every race of men,\\" but adds: :\\"(d) The Conference, recognising that the problem of polygamy is bound up with the limitations of opportunities for women in society, urges that the Church should make every effort to advance the status of women in every possible way, especially in the sphere of education.\\" The Twelfth Lambeth Conference held in 1988, in Resolution 26 - Church and Polygamy stated: This Conference upholds monogamy as God's plan, and as the ideal relationship of love between husband and wife; nevertheless recommends that a polygamist who responds to the Gospel and wishes to join the Anglican Church may be baptized and confirmed with his believing wives and children on the following conditions: # that the polygamist shall promise not to marry again as long as any of his wives at the time of his conversion are alive; # that the receiving of such a polygamist has the consent of the local Anglican community; # that such a polygamist shall not be compelled to put away any of his wives, on account of the social deprivation they would suffer; In 2008 the Lambeth Conference noted: :\\"In the case of polygamy, there is a universal standard ‚Äì it is understood to be a sin, therefore polygamists are not admitted to positions of leadership including Holy Orders, nor after acceptance of the Gospel can a convert take another wife, nor, in some areas, are they admitted to Holy Communion.\\" =Mormonism= fundamentalist Mormon families demonstrate at a pro-plural marriage rally in Salt Lake City in 2006. Over 200 supporters attended the event. Polygamy (which was called \\"plural marriage\\" by Mormons in the 19th century or \\"the Principle\\" as it is called by modern fundamentalist practitioners) was taught by leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) and publicly practiced from 1852 to 1890, nevertheless, it was not the norm but the exception, even during this period. On September 24, 1890, Wilford Woodruff, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at that time, issued the 1890 Manifesto, which advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for Utah to become a U.S. state. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, thus a Second Manifesto was released during U.S. congressional hearings which were held in 1904. Although neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early 1900s. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church standard works as Official Declaration 1 and mainstream Mormons, believe it was prompted by a divine revelation in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it. Mormon fundamentalists dispute the claim that Woodruff received any such revelation and as a result, they continue to practice plural marriage; these denominations include the Apostolic United Brethren and Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, among others. Interviewed by Time magazine about his book, Michael Coogan said that, from a strictly literalist view, fundamentalist Mormons are right about polygamy. =Other views= William Luck states that polygyny is not prohibited by the Bible and it would have been required if a married man seduced (Ex. 22) or raped (Deut. 22) a virgin, as long as her father did not veto the marriage. However, in a book- length consideration of the problem, William George Blum argues that monogamy was always God's ideal. He points out that in every Old Testament example where polygynous families are described in any detail, family strife which involves the plural wives is also described. He argues that the concept of two becoming one flesh makes polygamy a violation of God's plan for marriage. On August 29, 2017, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood released a manifesto on human sexuality which is known as the \\"Nashville Statement\\". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and it includes 14 points of belief. Among other things, it states, \\"We deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship.\\" However, an estimated 50,000 Evangelical Christians practice Christian polygamy in the West, based on their belief that the Bible glorifies this form of marriage, which they justify by citing the fact that many biblical prophets had multiple wives, including David, Abraham, Jacob and Solomon. Individual evangelical Christian pastors have married more than one woman throughout Christendom. The Presbyterian missionary Harold Turner acknowledged the fact that the practice of polygamy was a cultural norm in some parts of the world, such as Africa, and based on it, he cautioned Western Christian missionaries not to impose the foreign cultural norm of monogamy on the Christians of Africa because doing so would lead to the sin of divorce, leaving children without both of their parents, and leading divorced wives to remarry. Indeed, in many cultures, there is the possibility that the image of Christianity can be marred when a cleric in a Christian denomination which opposes polygamy \\"suggests that these wives may marry others, while the community regards them as still married to the first man\\"; in these cases, the Church can be seen as \\"a promoter of immorality and a destroyer of home and family\\" and become a stumbling block to nonbelievers. The Rev. Vincent Mulwa of Christ Pilgrim Restoration Centre opines that polygamy is a biblical practice, because it was the standard for various biblical prophets, and opposition to having more than one wife stems from Westerners imposing their views on Christians who belong to other cultures. =Exceptions in Africa= * John Colenso, the Anglican bishop of Natal, South Africa in 1853, was the first to write down the Zulu language.

Released in June 2001, the album was the band's only release for the EMI Liberty label. Album history Following 1997 album Andromeda Heights and 1999 compilation 38 Carat Collection, Prefab Sprout conducted their first tour of the UK for 10 years. The success of the tour led singer and frontman Paddy McAloon to consider recording material for a new album. Rather than opting for \\"new\\" material, McAloon chose to record material he had previously given to other artists as a \\"tidying up operation\\", before moving on to newer material. Despite drummer Neil Conti's involvement in the tour (having originally departed from the band in 1992), the studio band operated with McAloon and his brother Martin as sole members. Fellow singer Wendy Smith was absent due to having given birth the previous year, and other work commitments with her music therapy career. The album was produced by Tony Visconti, and made use of session musicians including Carlos Alomar, Jeff Pevar and Jordan Rudess. Eric Weissberg of \\"Duelling Banjos\\" fame, played the banjo on \\"Cowboy Dreams\\". Mixes were approved via e-mail between Visconti in New York and the McAloon brothers' base in County Durham. The album included versions of five songs which Paddy McAloon originally wrote for other performers. \\"Cowboy Dreams\\", \\"I'm a Troubled Man\\", \\"Love Will Find Someone for You\\" and \\"Blue Roses\\" were originally recorded by Jimmy Nail in 1994 and 1996, respectively, while title track \\"The Gunman\\" was originally recorded by Cher on her 1995 album It's a Man's World.

History The main staircase leading to the doorway Detail of the walls overlooking the Tagus River Located outside the keep walls, the small chapel of S√°o Br√°s Belver was the first castle and most important to be constructed by the Hospitallers in Portugal during the Middle Ages. It was built in order to defend the access-way along the Tagus River, and donate by Sancho I under the condition that a castle be constructed. In 1194, King Sancho conceded this region of the Northern Tagus River, then known as Guidintesta, or Guidi in testa (or still of Costa), to Afonso Paes, prior of the Order of the Hospitallers. By so doing, the King hoped to stabilize the Christian-Muslim frontier along the Tagus River, leaving the Templar to almost monopolize their power along the frontier lands.M√°rio Jorge Barroca (2000), p.194-195 The King began referring to the construction of the Castle and the surrounding as Belver. In his later testament, King Sancho transferred the title of the Castle to the Hospitalers. By 1210, construction was far enough advanced to allow the permanent occupation and defence. The testament while identifying its existence, also made it clear that the Castle was one of the six repositories of the nation's wealth, thusby providing ample proof of the Castle's defences, albeit located in a frontier outpost.M√°rio Jorge Barroca (2000), p.196 The final construction was completed in 1212. Between 1336 and 1341, Belver fell under the most important command of the Hospitallers, while still not seat nor official House, which continued to reside in the town of Le√ßa do Balio. Even as the head of the Order transferred his rule to the parish of Flor da Rosa, in the municipality of Crato, creating the priorship of Crato, the Castle of Belver (and its community) did not progress more than a provincial stronghold. The fortress remained intact over the following centuries, preserving many of the primitive Romanesque military motifs of the period. In fact, the castle was systematically adapted to military conditions of the time, while garrison accommodations were improved. After becoming King, John I of Portugal renewed the Castle's important military role, and in the face of Castilian conflicts, had the Castle's defenses expanded and rehabilitated, under the direction of Nuno Alvares Pereira (in 1390). In the 16th century, the Chapel of S√£o Br√°s, was completed. Similar renovations occurred in the 17th century, by Cosmander. By the 19th century, the Castle, apart from its imposing form above the parish of Belver, was completely forgotten, becoming a shelter for the settlement's cemetery in 1846. The 1909 earthquake caused major damage to the fortifications, but only resulted in major re-construction between 1939 and 1946, when the DGEMN- Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais also continued to work on the Castle grounds annually, rehabilitate, demolish and erect major facets of the Castle. Similarly, in 1976, the walls and roof were repaired, while the door to the chapel and altar were renovated, and in 1986, while lighting was updated on the grounds, the roof was repaired once more. In 1987-1988, repairs to the donjon (plaster, masonry and pavement) were completed. On 1 June 1992, the property was transferred to the IPPAR (Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico), under decree-law 106F/92. The institute, before being absorbed into the IGESPAR, was responsible for a complete restoration and conservation of the Castle. Architecture Located on the periphery of the village of Belver (isolated on the south-west corner), alongside the right margin of the Tagus River, at the confluence of the Ribeiro de Belver, overlooking a panorama, that includes olive orchards to the east and south- east. Its plan includes a principal rectangular keep circuited by walled parapets, that encircle the space on the hilltop, and Renaissance-era chapel. The castle gates are located on the south face, anticipated by a staircase of masonry stone, and flanked by two towers, whose design would be used by King Denis.M√°rio Jorge Barroca (2000), p.197 Beyond the entrance is a triple doorway of rounded arcs, which now provides entry onto the grounds. Central to the completed structure is the donjon or keep, whose first floor provides a grated access-way to the dungeons. The keep's entrance-hall has a rectangular window and staircase that provides access to the second floor. The second- floor hall, also with a rectangular window and arched doorway, leads onto the vestiges of the veranda, while another doorway leads to the superior floor access to the battlements.M√°rio Jorge Barroca (2000), p.199 The walls and battlements which encircle the Castle follow a semi-circular oval around the keep, and are covered in parapets and turrets, with strategically place cubicle towers located around the entranceway and in each direction of the compass. The Traitor's Gate, the secondary access to the castle, is located on the cliff side of the structure, guarded by a round tower.M√°rio Jorge Barroca (2000), p.198 Vestiges of the alcalde's residence and garrison are located in the south-east, south and south-west parts of the castle, in the space occupied by the three archways. To the north is the remains of the garrison's cistern, constructed during the remodelling of the castle by Nuno √Ålvares Pereira. Near the centre of the Castle, and in the east, is the Chapel of S√£o Br√°s, alongside the keep. In the interior of chapel is a high-altar, with a number of busts and reliquaries from Palestine, presented by the Great Prior of Crato to Prince Lu√≠s, son of Manuel I of Portugal.

History The result was proven by sieve methods by Montgomery and Vaughan; an earlier result of Brun and Titchmarsh obtained a weaker version of this inequality with an additional multiplicative factor of 1+o(1). Improvements If q is relatively small, e.g., q\\\\le x^{9/20}, then there exists a better bound: :\\\\pi(x;q,a)\\\\le{(2+o(1))x\\\\over\\\\varphi(q)\\\\log(x/q^{3/8})} This is due to Y. Motohashi (1973). He used a bilinear structure in the error term in the Selberg sieve, discovered by himself. Later this idea of exploiting structures in sieving errors developed into a major method in Analytic Number Theory, due to H. Iwaniec's extension to combinatorial sieve. Comparison with Dirichlet's theorem By contrast, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions gives an asymptotic result, which may be expressed in the form :\\\\pi(x;q,a) = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\varphi(q)\\\\log(x)} \\\\left({1 + O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\log x}\\\\right)}\\\\right) but this can only be proved to hold for the more restricted range q < (log x)c for constant c: this is the Siegel‚ÄìWalfisz theorem.
