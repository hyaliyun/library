The western terminus of this highway is at a signalized intersection in downtown Findlay where it meets State Route 12 and State Route 37. The eastern terminus of State Route 568 is in downtown Carey at a signalized intersection that serves as all of the northern split of the U.S. Route 23/State Route 103 concurrency, the western split of the State Route 103/State Route 199 concurrency and the southern split of the U.S. Route 23/State Route 199 concurrency. State Route 568 was created in the middle of the 1960s. The entire length of this two-lane highway is part of the former alignment of State Route 15, which was realigned onto a new expressway from Findlay to Carey at that time. Route description Along its path, State Route 568 passes through eastern Hancock County and northwestern Wyandot County. There are no segments of State Route 568 that are incorporated within the National Highway System, a network of highways deemed most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country. History State Route 568 was established in 1965. With the completion of a new four-lane divided expressway from Interstate 75 south of Findlay and U.S. Route 23/State Route 103 south of Carey, the State Route 15 designation, which had utilized a two- lane roadway between downtown Findlay and downtown Carey to that point, was transferred onto the new expressway, which parallels the two-lane road to the south. Consequently, this two-lane highway became known as State Route 568. The route has utilized the same alignment from inception to this day, and has not seen any significant changes since its original designation. Prior to the presently designated Route 568, a previous Route 568 traversed northern Lucas County and Fulton County. Established around 1939, its western terminus was the Ohio‚ÄìMichigan line west of Lyons and the eastern terminus was at U.S. Route 25 (North Detroit Avenue) in Toledo. However, within a year, the part west of old U.S. 223 (present day Monroe Street and Alexis Road in Sylvania) was renamed Route 120. Subsequently only the portion east of Monroe Street remained as Route 568, entirely encompassing Alexis Road. It was decommissioned as a state route around 1953 and designated as a bypass for U.S. 24 and U.S. 25. It was recommissioned as State Route 184 in 1969.U.S.G.S.

He published the New England Primer, the first textbook in British America, and edited the first multi-page newspaper there, Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick, from 25 September 1690. Life His career in London a publisher of Whig books, pamphlets, and a newspaper is known from 1673. Many of his publications were anti-Catholic. He published the pamphlet Appeal from the Country to the City in 1679 by Charles Blount, opposing the succession of James, Duke of York, and was consequently convicted of sedition and ordered to pay a fine he could not afford.Joad Raymond, Pamphlets and Pamphleteering in Early Modern Britain (2006), p. 340. Released from prison, Harris resumed his anti-Catholic campaigning. From 1679 to 1681, Harris published a paper that displayed an early use of local news, Domestick Intelligence: Or News both from City and Country. He moved to Boston in 1686 to start the London Coffee House, which provided both men and women (unusually at the time) access to foreign newspapers and books. After publishing The New-England Primer (c.1690) and Tulley‚Äôs Almanach, he set out to publish a newspaper (Mindich). Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick had three pages of text, with the fourth page left blank for others to write in pieces of news to hand around. It focused on local news, and included gossip; one item concerned King William's War and atrocities attributed to Native American forces allied to the British, current in September 1690.Stephen L.

In 1692, he received the official assignment to print The Acts and Laws of Massachusetts in 1692 (Mindich). Harris was also active in community service, supporting homeless shelters and orphanages. He returned to London 1695. He started a series of short-lived newspapers before publishing the London Post from 1699 to 1706. He sold his paper, books, and almanacs from his printing shop and store.

The Horners returned to Australia in 1976; Arthur had maintained a strong profile in Melbourne for decades particularly by dint of the syndication of Colonel Pewter in the Age. He worked primarily for that paper as well as undertaking book illustrations and other cartooning work. Two new strips ran in the Age, both conceived with finite continuities. These were The Uriel Report, from 1978-79 'An Age privilege offer' Melbourne Age 29 November 1979 p. 18 and Dig: a graphic history of Terra Australis Incognita in 1980. \\"Dig\\", Melbourne Age 28 Jane 1980 p. 7 Both of these strips presented a satirical view of contemporary Australia; The Uriel Report used a character central to a Colonel Pewter story from the late 1960s, an angel on Earth, to provide commentary on Australia in the late 1970s. Three book collections of Pewter strips were published - two in Britain and one in Australia - and in Australia the entire Uriel Report was collected in 1979 alongside the Colonel Pewter story which had featured that character. The characters in Colonel Pewter, though rendered affectionately, were arguably the product of an outsider's view of the British class system, though Horner was also aware of class distinction in Australia as well. Jane Sullivan wrote in 1997: > For all his affection for Colonel Pewter, he despised the gentry.

Colonel Pewter was the London Guardian's first comic strip.Michael McNay, 'Our First Strip Cartoonist' London Guardian 4 March 1997, p. 15 Regardless of the British newspaper which ran the strip, it ran regularly in the Melbourne Age across its existence. Colonel Hugo Albion Pewter \\"Colonel Pewter\\" (\\"Our Man in Drurylania\\") Melbourne Age 7 March 1960 p. 13 was only one of a large number of characters, some constant and others temporary, in a strip which was designed to appeal to both children and adults. An episodic, yet light-hearted, feature in which storylines tended to run across three months, it focused on the adventures of the Colonel and his great-nephew, Martin, a boy of around ten, who live in a mansion, 'Chukkas', in Much Overdun, Whimshire. Other characters included Martin's cat, Chloe, intelligent yet non-verbal; the housekeeper, Mrs. Aspic; an 'Upper Palaeolithic' butler, Glub, and a 'space dog cross', Sirius. Initially Colonel Pewter was notable for tinkering with inventions, at which time wearing a tea-cosy kept his brain 'simmering'. He also owned a 'holdall' with almost infinite capacity. Although the strip always maintained its fantasy, magical element, it also came to emphasise social satire and commentary on 1950s and 60s Britain. Horner mused in 1959 that \\"Pewter began as a harmless pottering eccentric but as time went on a kind of cussedness broke through and he developed more complex characteristics‚Ä¶ His social background has grown to be full of oddity that accumulates like flotsam.\\"James Boswell, ‚ÄúConversation with a One-man Band\\", Meanjin Vol. 18 No. 3, 1959 pp. 335-6 Ian C.

It was captained by Dirk Hartog when he made the second recorded landfall by a European on Australian soil, in 1616. Its name in Dutch literally means 'carrying (as) one' meaning together or in concord, but is also translated as \\"unity\\" or \\"union\\", and was a common name given to Dutch ships of the period, from the motto of the Republic: Concordia res parvae crescunt. First voyage to the East Indies =Departure from Holland= Upon its commissioning, the Eendracht entered the service of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or VOC). For her maiden voyage on the open ocean, the Eendracht set sail on 23 January 1616 from the Dutch port of Texel in the company of several other VOC ships, on a trading venture bound for Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (the present-day Jakarta). Her captain was Dirk Hartog, a thirty-five-year-old former private merchant, who had sailed for the VOC before but was now again in the employ of the VOC. =Route to Indian Ocean= Sailing down the west Africa coastline, the Eendracht became separated from the others in a horrible storm and reached the Cape of Good Hope alone around August. She stayed there until 27 August when Hartog decided to set out unaccompanied across the Indian Ocean towards their destination. Hartog's course across the Indian Ocean was a much more southerly one than the route usually followed. It made use of the prevailing westerly winds at those latitudes known as the \\"Roaring Forties\\", a route which had been pioneered a few years earlier by the Dutch navigator Hendrik Brouwer, who had noted it to be a faster way to reach Java. By this time, the VOC had not as yet instructed all its captains to take advantage of this route, which could reduce the overall traveling time from Europe by a good six months. The decision to do so was taken just a few months after Hartog departed Amsterdam. So Hartog took that decision himself. However, later the intention was to change heading northwards at a more westerly longitude than the Eendracht had done. Whether Hartog had intended to maintain such a southerly course for so long via this route, or was perhaps blown a little off course, is unclear. =Landfall in Australia= After approximately two months at sea, on 25 October Hartog and the Eendracht unexpectedly sighted land\\"various islands, which were, however, found uninhabited\\", at a latitude around 26¬∞ South. These islands and the nearby land were previously unknown to Europeans, and the Eendracht had become the second recorded European ship to visit the continent of Australia, having been preceded (albeit, on the opposite side of the continent) 10 years earlier by Willem Janszoon on the sailing along, and (briefly) landing on, the western shores of the Cape York Peninsula. Luis Vas de Torres is also reported to have mapped a portion of the west coast of Cape York in 1606 without knowing it was the great south land and ships logs suggests a landing where the natives were 'friendly'unlike many of the natives of New Guinea. Hartog and crew made landfall on the island, now known as Dirk Hartog Island which lies off Shark Bay in Western Australia. This was the first recorded landing on the western coastline by a European. The island was uninhabited, and Hartog spent three days there, finding nothing of great interest or value to him or his company. Before departing on 27 October, Hartog left behind a pewter dish affixed to a post set in a rock cleft (now called Cape Inscription), upon which he had inscribed the following brief account of his visit: > 1616 On 25 October arrived the ship Eendracht, of Amsterdam: Supercargo > Gilles Miebais of Liege, skipper Dirch Hatichs of Amsterdam. on 27 d[itt]o. > she set sail again for Bantam. Deputy supercargo Jan Stins, upper steersman > Pieter Doores of Bil. In the year 1616. This object, now known as the Hartog Plate, measuring in diameter, is the oldest known written artifact from Australia's European history. It lay unmolested in situ for a further eighty years, until it was re-discovered half-buried (the post had rotted away) by a Dutch expedition of three ships under the command of the Flemish captain Willem de Vlamingh in 1697. De Vlamingh had earlier explored Rottnest Island and the Swan River (later to be the site of the city of Perth), and had been making his way up the western coast of Australia. He replaced the Hartog dish with one of his own, onto which he copied Hartog's original inscription and added an account of his own landing, installing it in the same spot nailed to a cypress-pine trunk taken from Rottnest. Hartog's original dish returned with De Vlamingh later to Amsterdam, where it is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. =Charting the coast of Western Australia= 300px 400px After leaving the island, the Eendracht sailed in a north-west direction along the West Australian coastline, Hartog charting as he went. He gave this land the name t'Landt van d'Eendracht or \\"Eendrachtsland\\", after his ship. In 1627 this name appeared on the Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht and on subsequent charts, replacing the former mythical and postulated land of Terra Australis Incognita (South Land), sparking considerable further interest by parties such as the Dutch East India Company. This gave further impetus to explore this region in the hope of something notable or exploitable, leading to a long period of further exploration where Hartog's name Eendrachtsland was at first being retained for just the art he visited, when the continent he was then thought to have visited was named Nova Hollandia (New Holland) by Abel Tasman in 1644 when further unveiled by him on two expeditions during the previous two years. Hartog himself did not note anything which might be of use, making no further landfalls or contact with the Australian Aborigine inhabitants of the land. The Eendracht continued along the coast to about 22¬∞ South latitude, thereafter heading northwards toward the Timor Sea. She arrived first at Makassar on the island of Sulawesi on 14 December 1616 where a conflict with the local chief, caused the ship to leave for Ambon where it arrived 6 days later. Some excerpts of a letter from Supercargo, Cornelis Buysero at Bantam to the Managers of the East India Company at Amsterdam, with comments from author, Jan Heeres in 1899, is of interest to the history of the Eendracht, as follows. > Worshipful, Wise, Provident, very Discreet Gentlemen,... > > ...The ship Eendracht [*], with which they had sailed from the Netherlands, > after communicating at the Cabo sailed away from them so far southward as to > come upon 6 various islands which were, however, found uninhabited [**]... > > [* Commanded by Dirk Hartogs, or Hartogszoon.] > > [* What \\"uninhabited islands\\" the ship Eendracht \\"came upon\\", Buysero's > letter does not say.

Return voyage to the Netherlands The Eendracht remained in the East Indies for about a year, possibly engaging in local commercial ventures. On 17 December 1617 she again set sail for the return voyage home, leaving the port of Bantam and bound for Zeeland in the Dutch Republic, with Dirk Hartog again as her master. This voyage proved to be relatively uneventful, and she arrived back in the Netherlands on 16 October 1618 after a period of some ten months at sea. Captain Hartog left the service of the VOC shortly after the return, to resume private trading ventures in the Baltic. He died a few years later. Second voyage to the East Indies On 13 May 1619 the Eendracht again left port at Texel, bound a second time for Batavia and the East Indies. She rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 26 November, and reached her destination on 22 March 1620 without recorded incident, a journey of some ten months. Shipwreck She apparently remained in the East Indies, until 13 May 1622, where on a local trading voyage she is recorded as having been wrecked and lost off the western coast of Ambon Island in the central Moluccas. She had aboard a cargo of coins, and her wreck has not been recovered.

It was ruled by the House of F√ºrstenberg in the Circle of Swabia during the Holy Roman Empire. History The territory consisted at times of two historical states, which were both named after the state of F√ºrstenberg and the F√ºrstenberg Castle. The first state was created in 1408 as a partition of the county of F√ºrstenberg. After the death in 1441 of its only count, Henry VII, it was partitioned between F√ºrstenberg-Baar and F√ºrstenberg-Geisingen. The second state emerged as a county in 1704, as a partition of F√ºrstenberg-St√ºhlingen. It was raised to a principality in 1716, then was partitioned between itself and F√ºrstenberg- P√ºrglitz in 1762, after the death of Prince Joseph Wilhelm Ernst (1699‚Äì1762). The last male of the F√ºrstenberg-F√ºrstenberg branch was Prince Charles Joachim (1771‚Äì1804). Upon his death in 1804, the principality was inherited by the Princes of F√ºrstenberg-P√ºrglitz, who descended from Prince Joseph Wilhelm Ernst's second son.

As with gallstone disease in general, this condition occurs predominantly in overweight female patients of middle age. It is a morphological variant of chronic cholecystitis. Inflammatory scarring of the wall, combined with dystrophic calcification within the wall transforms the gallbladder into a porcelain-like vessel. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the recommended treatment. Symptoms Symptoms are similar to gallstones and can include abdominal pain (especially after eating), jaundice, and vomiting. Porcelain gallbladder can also be asymptomatic and discovered on imaging obtained for a different reason. =Association with cancer= The assertion that porcelain gallbladder increases the incidence of gallbladder cancer is widely taught in medical schools but is based on studies from 1931 and 1962. A prominent study aid for surgical residents even states that the risk of cancer in a porcelain gallbladder is 15%. The precise nature of the association between gallbladder cancer and porcelain gallbladder is uncertain. Two articles published in 2001 examined the association between cancer of the gallbladder and calcified gallbladder. The first study reviewed 10,741 cholecystectomies and found that the 88 patients with gallbladder cancer did not have calcified gallbladders while the 15 patients with porcelain gallbladders did not have gallbladder cancer. The second study reviewed 25,900 gallbladder specimens and found 150 patients with cancer and 44 patients with calcified gallbladders of two types (intramural calcification and selective mucosal calcification). The selective mucosal calcification group showed a 7% incidence of cancer with a significant odds ratio of 13.89. An article published in 2013 reviewed 111 studies and found 340 patients with gallbladder wall calcification showed a 21% overall rate of gallbladder malignancy; however, when studies with obvious selection bias were excluded the rate of gallbladder malignancy fell to 6%. Comparatively, a matched cohort without gallbladder calcification showed a 1% rate of gallbladder malignancy. Diagnosis Abdominal radiography (X-ray), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. Treatment Due to the increased risk for gallbladder cancer, the recommended treatment is cholecystectomy which usually includes pre-operative or intra-operative imaging of the biliary tree. Cholecystectomy may be performed via an open incision or via laparoscopic methods, but gallbladder anatomy and consistency may complicate the operation. * Updated information: Based on evidence in the current literature, a prophylactic cholecystectomy is not routinely recommended for all patients with porcelain gallbladder and should be restricted to those with conventional indications, such as young patients References External links * eMedicine.com ‚Äì Porcelain Gallbladder by Ali Nawaz Khan and Margaret Aird Category:Gallbladder disorders ","title":"Porcelain gallbladder"},{"id":"2191627","text":"Eenie Meenie Records is a Los Angeles‚Äìbased independent record label.

The object of the game is to assemble molecules from compound atoms by moving the atoms on a two-dimensional playfield. Atomix was received positively; reviewers noted the game's addictiveness and enjoyable gameplay, though criticized its repetitiveness. Gameplay Each level in Atomix requires the player to assemble a molecule of a different chemical compound. Atomix takes place on a playfield, consisting of a number of walls, with the atoms scattered throughout. The player is tasked with assembling a molecule from the atoms; more specifically, the atoms must be arranged into a specific shape, identical with the shape of the molecule displayed on the left side of the screen. The player can choose an atom and move it in any of the four cardinal directions; however, a moved atom keeps sliding in one direction until it hits a wall or another atom. Solving the puzzles requires strategic planning in moving the atoms, and on later levels with little free space, even finding room for the completed molecule can be a problem. Once the molecule is assembled, the player receives a score; the faster the puzzle is completed, the more score is given. Each puzzle must be completed within a time limit; otherwise the game ends, though the player can spend some of his score to restart the failed puzzle instead. The entire game consists of 30 puzzles of increasing difficulty. In addition, after every five puzzles, there is a bonus level where the player must move laboratory flasks filled with various amounts of liquid to arrange them from empty to full. The game also offers a two-player mode, where two players are working on the same puzzle; they take turns which last up to thirty seconds.  Levels  # water (H2O) # methane (CH4) # methanol (CH4O) # ethylen (C2H4) # propene (C3H6) # bonus section 1 # ethanol (C2H6O) # propanol (C3H8O) # ethanal (C2H4O) # acetone (C3H6O) # formic acid (CH2O2) # bonus section 2 # acetic acid (C2H4O2) # trans-butene (C4H8) # cis-butene (C4H8) # dimethyl ether (C2H6O) # butanol (C4H9OH) # bonus section 3 # terc-butanol (C4H10O) # glycerol, glycerine (C3H8O3) # polytetrafluorethene, polytetrafluoroethylene (C2F4)n # oxalic acid (C2H2O4) # formaldehyde (CH2O) # bonus section 4 # ethyl acetate (C4H8O2) # ammonia (NH3) # 3-methylpentane (C6H14) # propanal (C3H6O) # propyne (C3H4) # bonus section 5 Development Amiga Format reviewed a pre-release version in its May, 1990 issue. It was almost a complete version of the game although it lacked sound. Initially the game was released for Amiga, Atari ST and the IBM PC; as of May 1990, the C64 version was not yet planned, and was only released a few months later. A ZX Spectrum version was also planned. It was to be distributed by U.S. Gold, but was never released. The game was published for Enterprise 128 in 2006, this version was written by Zolt√°n Pov√°zsay from Hungary. A clone for the Atari Jaguar called Atomic has been released in 2006, written by S√©bastien Briais (AKA Seb from the Removers). A second version called Atomic Reloaded has been released in 2009. Reception Atomix received warm reactions from reviewers. They stated it was highly enjoyable and addictive despite its high difficulty level. Reviewers also pointed out the possible educational application of the game. However, certain reviewers criticized the game for its repetitiveness and stated that it lacked replayability. Some reviewers also wrote about the game's unoriginality, noting similarities to earlier games, Xor and Leonardo. Graphics were generally considered adequate, though not spectacular; Zzap!64 called them \\"a bit dull and repetitive\\" and \\"simplistic, but slick and effective\\", while CU Amiga remarked that despite their simplicity, they \\"create a nice, tidy display\\". The soundtrack was found enjoyable, though the Commodore Format reviewer considered it annoyingly repetitive. Atomix has been the subject of scientific research in computational complexity theory. When generalized to puzzles of arbitrary sizes, the problem of determining whether an Atomix puzzle has a solution is PSPACE-complete. Some heuristic approaches have been considered.Finding Optimal Solutions to Atomix References =Notes= =Bibliography=  * * Category:1990 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Cancelled ZX Spectrum games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:PSPACE-complete problems Category:Puzzle video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Germany ","title":"Atomix (video game)"},{"id":"2191636","text":"David Gifford Leathes Prior, Baron Prior of Brampton (born 3 December 1954) is the current chairman of NHS England and chairman of University College Hospital.

The southern terminus of SR 330 is at a diamond interchange with the SR 15 expressway just south of the village limits of Vanlue. Its northern terminus is at SR 568 nearly north of Vanlue. This two-lane state route was created in the early 1930s, generally along its present routing. From the late 1930s until the middle of the 1960s, SR 330 continued further north along present-day County Road 330 (CR 330) to SR 12 near Arcadia. At the end of that time frame, the highway was restored to its original, shorter routing whose primary function was to serve the community of Vanlue. Route description Vanlue High School SR 330 is situated entirely within the eastern half of Hancock County. The highway begins at a diamond interchange with the SR 15 expressway in Amanda Township, picking up where CR 197 leaves off. The highway briefly travels to the northeast amidst farmland before entering Vanlue. SR 330 follows Buffalo Street into the village, passing amidst some commercial businesses as it enters into the downtown of the village. SR 330 turns southeast onto Main Street, and goes through a residential neighborhood before reaching the East Street intersection, which is located adjacent to Vanlue High School. The state route turns north onto East Street, and passes amidst a few more residences prior to departing the village and re-entering Amanda Township. The remainder of the highway travels among a landscape of vast farmland, with a few homes appearing here and there. SR 330 travels due north, then follows a slight reverse curve that takes it to the northwest before resuming a northerly trek. Amidst that curve, it enters Biglick Township. SR 330 comes to an end at its junction with SR 568\\\\. Continuing north following the end of the state route is CR 330. This highway is not included as a component of the National Highway System, a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country. History The SR 330 designation was assigned in 1932. Originally, the highway, following its present alignment, served as a spur route off of what is now SR 568 serving the village of Vanlue. At the time, SR 568 was designated as a portion of SR 15. Five years after its assignment, SR 330 was extended north from its present northern terminus along the routing of CR 330 to a new endpoint at SR 12 approximately north of Arcadia. By 1965, SR 330's northern terminus was re-instated to its original location when the entirety of the 1937 extension was deleted from the state highway system. With jurisdiction of this portion of roadway transferred to Hancock County, the road was now identified as CR 330\\\\. Meanwhile, this was also the year when the SR 15 designation was transferred to a new four-lane expressway that was constructed in parallel to the south of its original two- lane alignment between Findlay and Carey, passing just to the south of Vanlue. Consequently, the route intersecting SR 330 at its northern terminus was now designated as SR 568\\\\. At the same time, SR 330 was extended slightly to the south of its former southern terminus in Vanlue to a new endpoint at a diamond interchange with the new SR 15 expressway.

Early work David Prior was born in the UK and studied Music and Religious Studies at the University of Wales, Bangor where he studied composition with Andrew Lewis. He was awarded the prize for composition in his final year for his piece Dense which went on to win a Prix de Residence at the 1996 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition , leading to a residency at Xenakis' UPIC studio in Paris the following year. The piece was short-listed by the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM) and following a performance at the Purcell Room in 1998, it was selected by then SPNM artistic director Howard Skempton for the George Butterworth award. From Bangor, Prior went on to study composition with Jonty Harrison at the University of Birmingham, graduating with a PhD in 2001. During his time in Birmingham, Prior's work was often concerned with integrating acoustic space as a compositional parameter in his work. This theme stimulated interests which still define the work he is involved in today, whether that be through his installations, sound-walks, acousmatic compositions or the sound designs he has made for museums and galleries. Another feature of the work Prior was producing during this period but less evident in more recent projects, was the attempt to assimilate free improvisation into the devising of his ultimately 'fixed' compositions, for example Somewhere Submarine (1996), for piano and tape (joint winner of the 1997 Cornelius Cardew Composition Competition) and Another Poisonous Sunset (1998). Prior was awarded a Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) stipendium in 1999, funding a one-year residency at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin, where he completed the work submitted for his PhD. Following the completion of his residency, he stayed living in Berlin, undertaking a commission from the DAAD Kunstlerprogram which led to his twenty-four channel acousmatic piece Love and Death, premiered at the Parochialkirche, Berlin as part of the Inventionen festival, 2000. In 1997, Prior collaborated with Swiss choreographers J√ºrg Koch and R. Lucia Baumgartner on the piece an die Materie and the music from this piece went on to win an honorary mention at the 1998 Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition and first prize in the 1998 EAR (Hungarian Radio) composition prize. When Koch went on to join CandoCo dance company, he worked with Prior again, commissioning him to write the score for Amaze in You in 2002. Liminal: sound and architecture Prior first collaborated with architect Frances Crow in 1997 on Triptych, an installation jointly commissioned by SPNM and the Southbank Centre, London. They worked together again on the Arts Council funded Good Vibrations children's education project in 1999 but it wasn't until 2003 that they formally established Liminal, a design studio with a particular interest in exploring sound and architecture. The partnership has resulted in projects ranging from installations to sound- walks as well as commercial sound design and consultancy and a number of theoretical publications and conference papers. Liminal was formed as a company in order to undertake Swash (2003), a large-scale, immersive sound installation for Living Coasts in Devon and in keeping with other recent work, this piece has evolved into a number of different iterations. Two years after the completion of the installation version of Swash, Prior made an eight- channel, acousmatic concert version of the piece which was first performed at the Martin Harris Hall in Manchester as part of the Sonic Arts Expo, 2006. In 2007, Prior was commissioned by the SpACE-Net spatial audio research group in York to produce a third, improvised version of the work which has been performed a number of times subsequently. Following the completion of Swash, liminal were made lead sound designers for the Churchill Museum in London designed by celebrated designers Casson Mann. The Churchill Museum has gone on to win a string of awards and was nominated for both the D&AD; Award for Outstanding Achievement in Digital Installations and the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize. Since 2006, liminal have been involved as lead artists in the Warwick Bar development in Birmingham. Their work on this project involved close collaboration with masterplanning architects Kinetic-AIU and has since been cited as an exemplar for artist-architect collaborations by CABE, who part- funded liminal's involvement through their PROJECT fund and features as a case-study in their Artists & Places publication.http://www.cabe.org.uk/default.aspx?contentitemid=2467 It was during this project that liminal developed their use of the sound-walk as a research tool, in this instance consolidating the extensive research undertaken into the soundscape of the Warwick Bar site into a binaural walk available to the public. Liminal later contributed to the Cotswold Water Park's twenty-year strategic plan, working with masterplanning consultants Scott Wilson and building on the research techniques they developed for the Warwick Bar project on a series of proposals which address the soundscape of the water park. Liminal's recent work has focussed on the creation of 'listening spaces', whether this takes the form of a site-specific sound-walk, such as Black Water Brown Water (2008) or architectural interventions such as Song Pole with poet Larry Lynch (2008), the point of departure for these pieces is to create a reflexive listening experience for the audience; focussing attention back onto the act of listening itself. In 2010 they were awarded ¬£50,000 to create \\"The Organ of Corti\\" to 'recycle' and create new sounds. Other sound and music collaborations Prior began working with New Zealander Dugal McKinnon in 1998 on a composed radio documentary Ways of Hearing for Resonance FM as part of John Peel's Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre, London. The pair went on to form Arcades in 2000, slowly working towards their album Who's Most Lost? which was completed in late 2007. Meanwhile, Prior was also asked by UK songwriter John Matthias to produce two tracks on his Ninja Tune release Stories From the Water Cooler. Prior and Matthias went on to form Derailer, whose first project was to remix a track by Corker Conboy called Radiant Idiot. The resulting Radiant Idiot Remake, was chosen by American independent film-maker Harmony Korine for his Thornton's television commercial Stuck.http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/12/indy- director-h.html The pair have remixed work by John Richards as well as working towards an album of original material. Prior also remixed John Matthias and Nick Ryan's Cortical Songs, released on the non-classical label. Prior has recorded and/or produced work for artists and ensembles including Icebreaker, Nicola Hitchcock and Michael Bassett as well as contributing sound designs to films by artists Jane Grant and Anya Lewin. In 2007, Prior was invited by improvising vocalist Steve Lewis to join Antti Sakari Saario in providing live electronics for his Flocking project based around an improvising ensemble. Since 2002, Prior has been working with his brother Andrew Prior on a series of collaborative music projects. Their piece Gem Sprinter features on the Yacht Club compilation release Pallomeri under the moniker Orlando Hooks. Films Since 2002, Prior has made a series of short films often characterized by their brevity and simplicity. On a number of these films, Prior has collaborated with poet Larry Lynch, who as well as contributing texts often features in the films themselves. Their collaboration On What it Might Mean to be Spinning features the voice of poet John Hall and was premiered in February 2008 as part of the Voices III festivalhttp://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/event2007.htm in Plymouth, UK. Prior's films have been screened across the UK, in Russia, Korea, China, Sweden, Holland and the USA. Awards Prior's work has won prizes including a number of awards from the Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition, Cornelius Cardew Prize, E.A.R (the composition prize of Hungarian National Radio), the George Butterworth prize and a PRS ATOM award. Prior has received awards from the University of Birmingham Alumni award, M.J. West Foundation, the Arts Council of England, the Banff Centre for the Arts, the DAAD and UNESCO. Academic work Prior began teaching in the music department at the University of Birmingham in the late 1990s while a post-graduate student there. Since 2001, Prior has been a lecturer, then senior lecturer in music at Dartington College of Arts, Devon. Prior has given guest lectures and presentations around the world at institutions including the Icelandic Academy of Arts, Reykjav√≠k, Stadia Helsinki Polytechnic and ESMAE School of Music and Performing Arts, Polytechnic Institute of Porto.

The coast of California is to the upper right, and the administrative centre, located on the granite outcropping, adjacent to it. The actual sanctuary is further left, and colored darker blue. Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary is a marine sanctuary located off the coast of California. It protects an area of of marine wildlife. The administrative center of the sanctuary is on an offshore granite outcrop by , located on the continental shelf off of California. The outcrop is, at its closest (Point Reyes), from the sanctuary itself. Cordell Bank is one of the United States' 13 National Marine Sanctuaries that protect and preserve ocean ecosystems in the U.S. Cordell Bank is a seamount approximately northwest of San Francisco where the ocean bottom rises to within of the surface.\\"Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary\\" at NOAA.gov The seamount was discovered in 1853 by the U.S. Coast Survey, and named for Edward Cordell, who surveyed the area more thoroughly in 1869. It was extensively explored and described during 1978-86 by Robert Schmieder, who published a monograph about it [Schmieder, 1991]. It has been protected as a sanctuary since 1989. The protected area encompasses 526 square miles (1347 km2) of ocean. The unique blend of ocean conditions and undersea topography creates a rich and diverse underwater ecosystem. A subsurface island rises from soft sediments covering the continental shelf. The upper pinnacles reach to within of the surface, and the average depth is . The sanctuary serves as a breeding ground for migratory marine mammals, birds, and fish. The prevailing California Current flows southward along the coast, causing an upwelling of nutrient-rich water that provided the foundation for the area's marine ecosystem. Sanctuary regulations prohibit extraction of hydrocarbons (oil, natural gas), the removal of benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms, discharge of wastes, and removal of cultural resources. Recreational SCUBA diving is not recommended in the sanctuary due to depth and currents. Geological setting Underwater topography of Cordell Bank showing seamount and nearby Farallon Islands Cordell Bank was originally created 93 million years ago, as a member of the Sierra Nevada. The grinding of the plates at the San Andreas Fault, with the Pacific Plate moving north and the North American Plate moving south, parts of the Sierra Mountains were sheared off and carried northwards, including Cordell Bank. Eventually this grinding carried Cordell Bank to its present location opposite Reyes Point. Cordell Bank is still moving, by an average of per year. Between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago the sea level in the area was below the current level, leaving most of Cordell Bank exposed and making it a true island. Today the bank rises out of soft sediment, deposited on the bank more recently by coastal erosion. Within just of Cordell Bank, the continental shelf drops to over deep. The seamount is largely composed of granite. History Coastal California has a rich history of marine utilization by Native Americans and early settlers. Cordell Bank was a mystery prior to the 19th century because neither the Miwok natives nor the settlers had any incentive to venture far out from shore, when food resources were available close to shore. Many European mariners sailed right over Cordell Bank without even knowing it was there. In the later half of the 1800s there was a strong incentive to survey the coast of California so as to promote maritime safety. Cordell Bank was discovered in 1853 by George Davidson of the US Coast Survey during a mapping expedition on California's north coast. In 1869 Edward Cordell (the reserve's namesake) was sent to collect additional information on a \\"shoal west of Point Reyes\\". He found the area by following the numerous birds and marine mammals. To measure the depth, Cordell lowered a lead weight into the water until it hit the bottom and then measured the length of the line on its return to the surface. The area was considered a productive fishing area, but not much was discovered about its marine life until an expedition in 1977. NOAA carried out a detailed multibeam echosounder survey of the area in 1985 from aboard the R/V Davidson. The expedition was led by a non-profit research group, Cordell Expeditions. Over the next 10 years, scores of underwater dives documented the organisms living in, on, and around the bank. The efforts gave rise to an understanding of the biodiversity of the bank, and were instrumental in the decision to make it a sanctuary. =Expansion= A bill (H.R. 5352) was proposed to Congress by Representative Lynn Woolsey to expand the size of the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary and the neighboring Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary by . In 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed an expansion of the borders of the sanctuary, along with expansion of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, to include an additional 2,700 square miles, reaching to Point Arena. Expansion was passed March 2015. Biology 26 species of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, and sea lions, are known to frequent the waters of the sanctuary. In addition, Cordell Bank is one of the most important feeding grounds in the world for the endangered blue and humpback whales; these species travel all the way from their breeding grounds in coastal Mexico and Central America to feed on the krill that aggregate near the bank. Another unique species is the Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), which can be seen in large numbers. Other visitors include California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), all of which are attracted to the abundance in krill, squid, and juvenile fish. Leatherback sea turtles also inhabit sanctuary waters. Cordell Bank is also a major foraging ground for passing seabirds. Known as the \\"Albatross capital of the world,\\" 5 of the 14 major species of albatross have been documented there. The two most common are the black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) and sooty shearwater (Puffinus griseus). It is also one of the few places to see a short-tailed albatross (Phoebastria albatrus), which is extremely rare; the species was thought to have gone extinct after World War II. Currently the world population hovers at around 1000 individuals. Cordell Bank is also known for its abundance of fish. Flatfish, most notably sanddabs, make their home on the mud of the seafloor in the sanctuary. Both solitary and schooling fish find refuge for predators among the bank's rocky pinnacles. Cordell Bank supports more than 246 species of fish, including 44 species of rockfish, ranging in size from the 8-inch pygmy rockfish to the yelloweye rockfish. Although far from shore, sport fishers prize Cordell Bank as a fishing spot, and regularly venture out from shore to catch albacore and salmon. =Ecologic cycle= rosy rockfish and strawberry anemones at 55.5 meters depth This unusual granite mountain is surrounded on three sides by deep waters, which allows the flow of deep nutrient-rich waters over relatively shallow waters with sufficient light to support photosynthesis. The ecological cycle at Cordell Bank can be divided into three oceanographic seasons. During the spring, strong northwestern winds push the water southward along the California coast. Gale winds and the Earth's rotation drive surface water away from the shore, only to be replaced by an upwelling of more nutrient-rich waters from offshore. this contributes to the growth in numbers of phytoplankton, which are the foundation of the marine food web, in turn leading to a rise in the food supply, and thus numbers, of the organisms higher up the chain. During the late summer and fall seasons, the coastal winds that stirred up the deeper waters die down, and the northward-flowing Davidson Current prevails, bringing warm but nutrient-poor water from the south. During the winter storm months, the sea is dominated by rough weather, which mixes the deeper water with that above. The temperature on top of the continental shelf mixes, and the temperature, salinity, and the concentration of nutrients in them are assimilated.

Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 24 approximately northeast of downtown Defiance, and its eastern terminus is at US 6 nearly north of Bradner. The majority of the route is known as the Defiance Pike. Route description Custar The state route begins at a diamond interchange with the US 24 freeway (exit 28). The interchange is partially within the city limits of Defiance and partially in Richland Township. Defiance County Route 175 heads north from the interchange while SR 281 heads south along Domersville Road often crossing between Defiance and Richland Township. After a traffic signal at a connector road to Defiance County Route 424, the route crosses the Maumee River on a plate girder bridge. A short distance later, SR 281 intersects SR 18 and the two routes form a concurrency and head east out of the city past a General Motors factory. After , the SR 18 concurrency ends and SR 281 continues due east. Outside of the Defiance area, the route's surroundings becomes much more agricultural. After exiting Defiance County, it enters Henry County. SR 281 does not pass through any incorporated villages through Henry County, but it intersects State Routes 108, 109, and 65. After crossing into Wood County, SR 281 enters the small village of Custar. SR 281 continues east intersecting SR 235 and SR 25 but also passes over Interstate 75 without an interchange. After its intersection with SR 199, SR 281 turns to the northeast and enters the village of Wayne. Through Wayne, the route has the road names of Main Street and Church Street. northeast of Wayne, SR 281 then passes through the village of Bradner first on Church Street, then due north on Main Street. SR 281 ends at as stop- controlled intersection with US 6 about north of Bradner. The road continues north as the Freedom Township-maintained Bradner Road. History SR 281 was first designated on its current alignment in 1930, but only on the segment between SR 109 and SR 65 in Henry County. In 1934, the route was extended east into Wood County to end at then-US 25 and US 68 in Wood County (modern-day SR 25) and within one year, was extended west to SR 18 near Defiance. The route was extended further east to its current eastern terminus in 1939 when SR 281 was routed over county roads and SR 297 from Wayne through Bradner to US 6. The route would remain unchanged for 33 years except for becoming fully asphalt-paved by 1950. In 1972, SR 281 was extended west on a new bridge over the Maumee River and over existing roads to end at the US 24 bypass of Defiance and Napoleon. The road between CR 424 (formerly SR 424) and US 24 had been designated as a part of US 24 during the time the Defiance bypass was complete but the Napoleon portion was still under construction. The at-grade intersection with US 24 was replaced by a diamond interchange in 2007 as a part of the widening of US 24 through northwestern Ohio.

X Clan- affiliated rapper Lin Que was initially intended to be part of the group but departed soon after its inception due to business decisions. Each member of the group were experienced rappers prior to joining the collective. Finesse recorded an album with rapper Synquis named Soul Sisters in 1988, Champ released her debut album Ghetto Flava on East West America/Atlantic Records, and N-Tyce was signed to Wild Pitch/EMI in the mid 1990s and released a few singles including the RZA-produced \\"Hush Hush Tip\\" featuring Method Man. The Deadly Venoms was J-Boo's professional introduction. A legal dispute with A&M;/PolyGram Records and the then-forthcoming merger between the MCA and PolyGram families of labels that formed the Universal Music Group forced its debut album, Antidote, to remain in its vaults, although the single ‚ÄúOne More to Go‚Äù (featuring Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Cappadonna, Street Life, and GZA) b/w ‚ÄúBomb Threat,‚Äù was released and the album was later leaked. Despite not being properly released, the album got positive reviews. The group was also featured on NBA All-Star and rapper Shaquille O'Neal's 1998 album Respect. Deadly Venoms' second album, Pretty Thugs, was also never properly released because of similar label disputes, this time with DreamWorks/Interscope/Universal Records. However, as with Antidote, copies of the record were leaked, and a promo CD was pressed. After the departure of Finesse due to undisclosed business reasons, the group finally managed to release an album with 2002's Still Standing, on Rocks the World/Caroline/Virgin/EMI Records.

He received more than a dozen Emmy Award nominations, although he never won. Garrison started his television career by accident at the age of 22. Among his first productions were The Kate Smith Show (CBS, 1950) and Your Show of Shows. He went on to produce and direct many television specials with Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Donald O'Connor and many others. He was probably best known for producing and directing The Dean Martin Show, The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts, hour-long comedy specials with Dom DeLuise, and summer shows with Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, Jonathan Winters, The Golddiggers, and Marty Feldman. He also directed one of television's landmark 1960 presidential debates between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Garrison also produced the highly successful The first Fifty Years, a celebration of NBC Television being on the air for fifty years. In his later years Garrison supervised for Guthy- Renker the digital remastering of The Dean Martin Show and celebrity roasts for release on DVD. The marketing of these included an entertaining informercial with clips of an interview of Garrison by host Regis Philbin about his memories of producing/directing the Martin show.

Biology Kingdom: Plantae Division: Magnoliophyta Class: Magnoliopsida Family: Rosaseae Genus: Prunus Scientific Name: Prunus avium = About Royal Ann = Royal Ann cherry trees are perennial semi-dwarfs that bloom early April with harvest in mid-summer. They are deciduous trees that can be characterized by dark green leaves and clusters of small fragrant white flowers that are about 2.5-3 centimeters wide. Royal Ann flowers are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female reproductive organs, however, the tree cannot self-pollinate. Another pollinator species is necessary in order for fertilization to occur, most commonly bees. Each flower goes on to produce a single Royal Ann cherry. A mature fruit producing Royal Ann tree is about 12‚Äì15 feet in height. The trees prefer a half to full day of sun, and soil with good drainage. Royal Ann trees require a temperate climate, where the average winter temperature does not drop below 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Royal Ann cherries are fleshy stone fruits similar in size to most cherry varieties, and are yellow to light pink colored. Royal Ann fruits are often mistaken for Rainier cherries because of their similar appearance and taste. Trees produce fruit within 1‚Äì3 years after planting and are considered fully mature around 8 years old. Royal Ann trees can produce up to 50 pounds of cherries per season. Royal Ann cherries harvested from a Southwest Michigan farm  Nutrient content  Cherries are famous for containing high levels of antioxidants, which are substances that inhibit oxidation in living organisms. Sweet cherries, like the Royal Ann are also high in sugars, like glucose, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol. Organic acids in sweet cherries include malic, citric, shikimic, and fumaric. Stone fruits are known to contain toxic compounds that produce hydrogen cyanide, which is toxic or lethal in large doses. These compounds can be found in the bark, flowers, seeds, and leaves of cherry trees. Children have been poisoned in the past by eating or swallowing large amounts of seeds. Livestock have been killed by grazing on branches and leaves.  Domestication  It is thought that cherries first originated in Turkey, near the Black Sea. Cultivation has been credited to the Greeks who helped the fruit spread through the Roman Empire and to England, where cherry trees were used as a food source and also for timber. Sweet cherry trees were initially brought to the United States with the colonists in 1629. In 1847, Henderson Lewelling brought 700 fruit trees of Napoleon Bigarreau from Iowa to Oregon‚Äôs Willamette Valley to start a cherry orchard. Seth Lewelling joined his brother Henderson in 1850, he renamed the tree 'Royal Ann'. Seth later developed the Bing cherry.  Cultivation  Sweet cherry trees are labeled as being very delicate and finicky. They are not a popular choice for growing with hobby gardeners because they can be very time consuming. Tips for facilitating growth and harvesting include bending the branches. Sweet cherry trees grow vertically very quickly, as more nutrients from sunlight means a higher yield of fruits. However, the more vertical the tree is, the more foliage there is on the tree rather than fruit. By bending the branches at an angle of 30-60 degrees in relation to the trunk and anchoring them to the ground, the tree will produce more fruit and fewer leaves. Research findings show that bending branches slows the release of hormones coursing through the tree that are essential for fruit growth. = Pests, diseases, etc. = Birds are the most common pest of cherry trees, seeking the sweet fruits. Birds can be repelled by using netting to cover trees in an orchard or deploying flash tape to scare them away. Bacterial canker is a disease that can afflict all cherry trees, including Royal Ann trees. Signs of the disease include dead branches and brown colored damaged spots on branches or the trunk. Bacterial canker can be deterred by applying a copper spray to the trees in the fall and winter months. Another common problem is rain splitting. This happens when the cherries are near ripe, and full of nutrients. With an excess of water intake, the skin of the fruit can no longer hold all of the nutrients and fluids and bursts open.  Human use  Because of their firm and fleshy traits, Royal Ann cherries are ideal for home commercial and home canning. They‚Äôre often used for making pies, sauces, and jams because of their natural sweetness. Because Royal Ann cherries are so fragile, they make a great option for canning because the fruit is not being selected based on appearances as if it were freshly picked. Bruised Royal Ann cherries will taste the same mashed into a pie or in canned preserves. Royal Ann cherries are also the ideal variety used to make maraschino cherries for cocktails and dishes. Royal Ann cherries are also excellent and sweet eaten fresh on their own.

Horacek's latest book is Random Life (2017), her ninth cartoon collection. A new picture book with Mem Fox is due out in October 2018. In 2005, a selection of her work was acquired by the National Library of Australia for its collection. She said at the time that \\"I really like being recognised for having done work that is part of the social discourse. And it's always nice to see cartoons get another lease on life ‚Äì now they represent a particular time and context and become part of the portrait of who we [Australians] are\\".Favelle (2005) p. 10 Life Horacek graduated with a BA from the University of Melbourne in 1991, majoring in Fine Arts and English. She then studied for a Diploma in Museum Studies at Victoria University. In 2007, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Visual) in Printmedia and Drawing from Australian National University. She lives in Melbourne. Writing Horacek started her career as a writer, and was a member of a community writing group in North Melbourne.Favelle (2005) p. 8 Words are an important part of her cartoons, and sometimes dominate the pictures. After illustrating a children's picture book for Mem Fox, she began to write and illustrate her own children's books, something she had always wanted to do. Cartoons \\"My life has been a quest to find new and better place to stick cartoons\\", Horacek has said.Favelle (2005) p. 7 Accordingly, her cartoons can be found in newspapers and magazines, online, on aprons and teatowels, on mugs, on fridge magnets and cards, and as limited edition prints. Her cartoons have been described as whimsical and quirky. As she says, \\"I take every day situations and make them strange\\"Horacek (2007) It was her interest in feminism which \\"drove Horacek's early work and established her reputation as a cartoonist\\". Since then, in addition to an ongoing interest in women's issues, her cartoons have covered a wide range of social and political issues such as the Australian Republican Movement, immigration, indigenous issues and FlyBuys. Cartoonist Peter Nicholson describes her work as follows: Horacek's first commissioned work for The Age newspaper was published on International Women's Day 1995, next to the obituary of Senator Olive Zakharov. This was her cartoon, Woman with Altitude, a work which has since appeared on fridge magnets greeting cards, tea-towels and T-shirts.Judith Marie Horacek (2003) In 2007, she said that \\"The woman with altitude ... represents who we could be\\". At various times she has had regular spots in such newspapers and magazines as The Age, The Weekend Australian Magazine, The Canberra Times and the Australian Book Review.

The amount of power a CPU uses, and thus the amount of heat it dissipates, is the product of this voltage and the current it draws. In modern CPUs, which are CMOS circuits, the current is almost proportional to the clock speed, the CPU drawing almost no current between clock cycles. (See, however, subthreshold leakage.)  Power saving and clock speed  To conserve power and manage heat, many laptop and desktop processors have a power management feature that software (usually the operating system) can use to adjust the clock speed and core voltage dynamically. Often a voltage regulator module converts from 5V or 12 V or some other voltage to whatever CPU core voltage is required by the CPU. The trend is towards lower core voltages, which conserve power. This presents the CMOS designer with a challenge, because in CMOS the voltages go only to ground and the supply voltage, the source, gate, and drain terminals of the FETs have only the supply voltage or zero voltage across them. The MOSFET formula: \\\\,I_D = k((V_{GS}-V_{tn})V_{DS}-(V_{DS}/2)^2) says that the current I_D supplied by the FET is proportional to the gate-source voltage reduced by a threshold voltage V_{tn}, which depends on the geometrical shape of the FET's channel and gate and their physical properties, especially capacitance. To reduce V_{tn} (necessary to reduce supply voltage and increase current) one must increase capacitance. However, the load being driven is another FET gate, so the current it requires is proportional to capacitance, which thus requires the designer to keep capacitance low. The trend towards lower supply voltage therefore works against the goal of high clock speed. Only improvements in photolithography and reduction in threshold voltage allow both to improve at once. On another note, the formula shown above is for long channel MOSFETs. With the area of the MOSFETs halving every 18-24 months (Moore's law) the distance between the two terminals of the MOSFET switch called the channel length is becoming smaller and smaller. This changes the nature of the relationship between terminal voltages and current. Overclocking a processor increases its clock speed at the cost of system stability. Withstanding higher clock speeds often requires higher core voltage at the cost of power consumption and heat dissipation. This is called \\"overvolting\\". Overvolting generally involves running a processor out of its specifications, which may damage it or shorten CPU life. Dual-voltage CPU A dual-voltage CPU uses a split-rail design so the processor core can use a lower voltage, while the external Input/Output (I/O) voltages remain at 3.3 volts for backwards compatibility. A single-voltage CPU uses a single power voltage throughout the chip, supplying both I/O power and internal power. As of 2002 Microprocessor#Market statistics, most CPUs are single-voltage CPUs. All CPUs before the Pentium MMX are single-voltage CPUs. Dual-voltage CPUs were introduced for performance gain when increasing clock speeds and finer semiconductor fabrication processes caused excess heat generation and power supply concerns, especially regarding laptop computers. Using a voltage regulator, the external I/O voltage levels was transformed to lower voltages to reduce power draw, resulting in less heat for the ability to operate at higher frequencies. VRT is a feature on older Intel P5 Pentium processors that are typically intended for use in a mobile environment. It refers to splitting the core voltage supply from the I/O voltage. A VRT processor has a 3.3 V I/O and 2.9 V core voltage, to save power compared to a typical Pentium processor with both I/O and core voltage at 3.3V. All Pentium MMX and later processors adopted this so-called split rail power supply.

He graduated from Black Mountain College in 1955 and later wrote a memoir of his time there. He hitchhiked to San Francisco where he encountered the literature of the Beat Generation. Returning to New York, he attended Columbia University and received an MFA in 1971, after which he began teaching writing. Rumaker's first collection was in 1959 in the new-writer showcase Short Story 2, which featured short stories from him and three other authors, including Gertrude Friedberg. His short stories in the book received a favourable review in The New York Times, where he was described as an \\"impressive young writer. His first book, The Butterfly, is a fictionalized memoir of his brief affair with a young Yoko Ono, published before Ono became famous. His short stories, Gringos and other stories, appeared in 1967. A revised and expanded version appeared in 1991. He began to write directly about his life as a gay man in the volumes A Day and a Night at the Baths (1979) and My First Satyrnalia (1981). The novel Pagan Days (1991) is told from the perspective of an eight-year-old boy struggling to understand his gay self. Black Mountain Days, a memoir of his time at Black Mountain College, has a strong autobiographical element. In addition, there are portraits of many students and faculty (including the poets Robert Creeley, Charles Olson and Jonathan Williams) during its last years, 1952-1956. Following his graduation from Black Mountain College, Rumaker made his way to the post-Howl, pre-Stonewall riots gay literary milieu of San Francisco, where he entered the circle of Robert Duncan. His account of that time in the book Robert Duncan in San Francisco, first published by Donald Allen at his Grey Fox Press, gives an unvarnished look at the premier poet of the San Francisco Renaissance. Rumaker will release previously unpublished letters between himself and Robert Duncan for a new edition, published by City Lights.

Eliphalet Chapin (1741-1807) was a cabinetmaker and furniture maker in East Windsor, Connecticut in the late 18th century. His style of furniture design is regarded as one of the most elegant of its time. Chapin was born in Massachusetts; his family were woodworkers, and he too entered the trade. In his early 20s, he was named in a paternity suit by Hannah Bartlett. Although he denied the suit, he settled with Bartlett by deeding a tract of land over to her. Probably as a result, in 1767 he moved to Philadelphia, a colonial center of fine furniture construction, to further study his craft. In the 18th century, Philadelphia was one of the most important cities both before and after the American Revolution and was a center of style and culture. At age 30, he returned to Connecticut, building a home and workshop in East Windsor where he spent the rest of his life, operating his furniture making shop from 1771 through 1798. In contrast to the general style of his contemporary Connecticut furniture makers, which was tall and slim, with long slim legs, Chapin had a style which was more compact, blocky, and chunky, but lighter and cleaner in detail than the Philadelphia rococo design from which he also drew inspiration, resulting in a style known as Connecticut Chippendale. The detail work on his furniture was also consistent and distinctive, with similar very highly detailed carvings on the ball and claw feet of his furniture, similar distinctive spiral rosettes, open fretwork, scrolled pediments, and other decorations. This makes his pieces identifiable, even though he did not sign them or apply a maker's mark. The quality of construction extended even to invisible parts of the furniture; interiors and undersides of drawers were finished just as meticulously as the exteriors, pieces of wood were dovetailed together almost seamlessly, and no pegs or nails are showing in the finished work. Eliphalet's second cousin or nephew Aaron Chapin also worked in Eliphalet's shop between 1774 and 1783. In the 1930s, a debate raged through the furniture scholar community over whether Aaron or Eliphalet was the real mastermind behind the style; the reluctance of either to sign their pieces (no signed piece by Eliphalet and only a few by Aaron have ever been found) has led to over a century of arguing about which Chapin was the actual builder behind any specific piece. It is currently believed, however, that Eliphalet was indeed the driving force, and his work is the more highly prized (and conversely, the more highly prized works are assumed to be by him). East Windsor marriage records show that Eliphalet was married to Mary Darling on November 25, 1773, and to \\"Anne Read of Canterbury\\" on June 18, 1778; and that Aaron married Mary King on September 15, 1777. He died in East Windsor, Connecticut.

He attended Lund University, Rostock, Wittenberg and Uppsala, he originally pursued a career in the diplomatic arena, but found this occupation quite undesirable. He then became a soldier, served in the Austrian army against the Turks, and under William III in Holland. He returned to Sweden in 1697. When the Great Northern War broke out, he was placed in command of a newly created regiment of infantry. He was one of the few successful commanders against the Russians in the Baltic region while King Charles XII was on campaign in Poland and Saxony. In 1705 Lewenhaupt won the Battle of Gemauerthof and was appointed Governor of Riga. In 1708, he was ordered to march east with a supply column, to support Charles's primary invasion force in Russia. This led to the Battle of Lesnaya (1708), in which he was defeated and forced to abandon his supplies. In 1709, after having connected with the King's army, Lewenhaupt was given command of the infantry at the disastrous Battle of Poltava (1709) and the Surrender at Perevolochna. He was kept a prisoner in Russia, and he lived in Moscow until his death on 12 February 1719. Legacy His memoirs, edited by his son-in-law, were published at Stockholm in 1757.

Darkstar is present when the Winter Guard is brought back together.Avengers Vol. 8 #10. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Darkstar is a mutant who can psionically access the extra-dimensional energy of the Darkforce dimension, which grants her a number of superhuman abilities. She is connected to the Darkforce dimension by means of her consciousness being split between her physical body and a Darkforce representation of same, both symbiotically linked. Darkstar can thus utilize the Darkforce for various purposes. She can cause Darkforce to behave like either matter or energy. She may project Darkforce as simple, mentally-controlled solid objects, possessing the density of steel, such as pincers, rings, columns, and spheres, or as a beam of concussive force. If Darkstar is rendered unconscious any Darkforce constructs of her making immediately dissipate. Darkstar can teleport herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and travelling through it. The maximum distance she can teleport has never been revealed. Because crossing the Darkforce dimension disorients her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinds her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner is risky. Darkstar can levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds by generating a virtually invisible portal into the Darkforce dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of the Earth's gravity. The upper limits of her powers are still unknown. Darkstar is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the KGB, and by the Black Widow. She is fluent in both Russian and English. While the original Darkstar's costume was designed by the Soviet government and was made of a synthetic stretch fabric insulated against the cold, the other two Darkstars had costumes composed of Darkforce material.

It is similar to the GTPS (Government Telephone Preference Scheme) for landlines. This scheme allowed the mobile telephone networks to restrict access in a specific area to registered numbers only and is normally invoked by the Police Incident Commander (although it can be invoked by the Cabinet Office). The emergency services are responsible for registering their key numbers in advance. ACCOLC was replaced by MTPAS (Mobile Telecommunication Privileged Access Scheme) in 2009.  Purpose  The purpose of ACCOLC (US) was to restrict non-essential access to cellular phone networks during emergencies. This actively prevents unnecessary usage from congesting the cell networks, thus allowing emergency services personnel priority for communications. It also serves to control information flow in and out of a declared emergency area. Mobile networks can become overwhelmed by a high concentration of calls that often occur immediately after a major incident. Reliable access to the mobile networks, even during times when an exceptionally large number of calls are being made, is achieved by installing a special SIM (subscriber identity module) card in the telephone handset. Special SIMs are only available to entitled users within the emergency services community, and not to members of the public. Verizon Wireless in the United States has also implemented ACCOLC on its wireless networks, the modalities of use may differ from those in Britain especially with regards to ACCOLC being activated permanently on the network.  Implementation  In an emergency situation, the mobile network operator can implement ACCOLC onto specific mobile cell sites (that cover the area of the required restriction). Most systems allow the operator to allow/restrict specific Access Class levels to gain access to the cell sites. The customer's SIM card is provisioned with an Access Class level between 0 and 15. Most SIM cards will be coded with a random access class level between 0 and 9.

Its distribution covers includes bodies of water from East Africa to West Africa. It generally lives in shallow waters with muddy bottoms. Anatomy and appearance This fish has a maximum size that sources say are between two and three feet. The giraffe-like pattern will fade with age to a two-tone mottled brown. Various subspecies have been described for this fish, indicating some geographical variation in coloration. Reproduction Eggs are scattered in a nest and guarded by the male. Dinotopterus cunningtoni takes advantage of the care and allows the male giraffe catfish to care for its eggs and young, an example of interspecific brood care. Relationship to humans The giraffe catfish is occasionally imported for the aquarium trade. Because of its large eventual size and its fast rate of growth, it is inappropriate for smaller aquaria. This fish will readily accept a variety of foods and is tolerant of a wide variety of water conditions. They will scavenge the aquarium looking for food, which could cause in the uprooting of plants.

Many are evergreen trees with lauroid leaves. There are 428 species currently accepted within the genus, distributed mostly in tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas (around 300 species) including the Caribbean and West Indies, but also with some species in Africa, Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands. One species (O. foetens) is native to the Macaronesia (in Canary Islands and Madeira). Description They are trees or shrubs, occasionally with adventitious roots (O. hartshorniana, O. insularis). Leaves simple, alternate, rarely opposite or whorled. The leaves are lauroid, they are commonly dark green glossy with sometimes brown on the underside and fragrant oil cells. The African and Madagascan species all have bisexual flowers (possessing both male and female parts), whereas many of the American species have flowers that are unisexual (either male or female). The apetalous flowers are in small panicles. The fruits are globose or oblong berries, 3‚Äì5 cm in length, hard and fleshy and at the junction of the peduncle part with the fruit covered by a cup-shaped, occasionally flat, cupule, giving them an appearance similar to an acorn. The fruit is dark green, gradually darkening with maturity. The cupule at the base of the berry, can be more brightly colored. The fruit has a single seed wrapped in a hard coat and can be slightly lignified. Names The genus has no standard common name. Names often refer to the aroma of the wood, which can be strong and not always pleasant. Sweetwood is usually applied only to this genus, although many names are also applied to this genus and other genera: *Stinkwood can refer to several unrelated trees that have bad-smelling wood. Ocotea bullata is called black stinkwood or true stinkwood, and Ocotea foetens is also called stinkwood. *Camphorwood is usually Cinnamomum camphora a close relative of Ocotea species. *Rosewood (Peruvian rosewood, O. cernua) is normally Dalbergia or related members of the family Fabaceae. The common names of some species refer to their similarity to other Lauraceae such as Sassafras (Brazilian sassafras: O. odorifera) or Laurus (Cape laurel: O. bullata, Sword laurel: O. floribunda, Guaika laurel: O. puberula, etc.). Ecology Ocotea species are distributed in subtropical and tropical regions, often at higher altitudes. They are characteristic plants of many tropical montane habitats such as Araucaria moist forests, Laurisilva, Afromontane biomes, Knysna-Amatole montane forests and Talamancan montane forests, although in Madagascar and Brazil they also occur in lowland forests. Most relatively small fruit species are of great environmental importance because they are the food of many endemic birds and mammals, especially in Islands, and premontane and montane forests. The leaves of Ocotea species are the food source for the caterpillars of several species of endemic Lepidoptera, including several species of Memphis. Some Memphis caterpillars feed solely on the leaves of one species of Ocotea; for example M. mora feeds only on O. cernua, and M. boisduvali feeds only on O. veraguensis Seed distribution of some Ocotea species is performed by frugivorous birds such as toucans, the three-wattled bellbird (family Cotingidae), quetzal and Cape parrot. Ocotea fruit is also consumed by several Columbiformes such as Columba trocaz, Delegorgue's pigeon, Bolle's pigeon (Columba bollii), African wood pigeon, and American doves. Most of the African tree species are ancient paleoendemic species, which in ancient times were widely distributed on the continent. This is not the case in the Americas: 89 species have been collected in Venezuela alone. Species of Ocotea can be attacked by various rot-inducing root pathogens, including Loweporus inflexibilis, Phellinus apiahynus and Phytophthora cinnamomi. Some Ocotea species are used as nesting sites by ants, which may live in leaf pockets or in hollowed-out stems. The ants patrol their host plants more frequently in response to disturbance or to the appearance of insect pests such as grasshoppers. Uses O. quixos) cupules can be used as spice. Ocotea produce essential oils, which are rich in camphor and safrole. East African camphorwood (O. usambarensis), Peruvian rosewood (O. cernua) and Brazilian sassafras (O. odorifera) are traded internationally. Dried fruit cupules of ishpingo (O. quixos) are used in Ecuador to flavor beverages, such as colada morada. Some fast growing Ocotea tree species are harvested commercially for timber. These include O. puberula, O. bullata (black or true stinkwood) and O. usambarensis. The timber is valued for its resistance to fungal decay. O. odorifera (Brazilian sassafras) and O. kuhlmanni are frequently used as honey plants. Selected species The following are some of the species of Ocotea.

Bri·∫ña, \\"escape\\" or \\"flight\\"), also called the Bericha Movement, was the underground organized effort that helped Jewish Holocaust survivors escape post‚ÄìWorld War II Europe to the British Mandate for Palestine in violation of the White Paper of 1939. It ended when Israel declared independence and annulled the White Paper. July 15, 1945. Buchenwald survivors arrive in Haifa to be arrested by the British. After American, British and Soviet armed forces liberated the camps, survivors suffered from disease, severe malnutrition and depression. Many were displaced persons who were unable to return to their homes from before the war. In some areas the survivors continued to face antisemitic violence; during the 1946 Kielce pogrom in Poland 42 survivors were killed when their communal home was attacked by a mob. For many of the survivors, Europe had become \\"a vast cemetery of the Jewish people\\" and \\"they wanted to start life over and build a new national Jewish homeland in Eretz Yisrael.\\" The movement of Jewish refugees from the Displaced Persons camp in which they were held (one million persons classified as \\"not repatriable\\" remained in Germany and Austria) to Palestine was illegal on both sides, as Jews were not officially allowed to leave the countries of Central and Eastern Europe by the Soviet Union and its allies, nor were they permitted to settle in Palestine by the British. In late 1944 and early 1945, Jewish members of the Polish resistance met up with Warsaw ghetto fighters in Lubin to form Bricha as a way of escaping the antisemitism of Europe, where they were convinced that another Holocaust would occur. After the liberation of Rivne, Eliezer and Abraham Lidovsky, and Pasha (Isaac) Rajchmann, concluded that there was no future for Jews in Poland. They formed an artisan guild to cover their covert activities, and they sent a group to CernƒÉu≈£i, Romania to seek out escape routes. It was only after Abba Kovner, and his group from Vilna joined, along with Icchak Cukierman, who had headed the Jewish Combat Organization of the Polish uprising of August 1944, in January 1945, that the organization took shape. They soon joined up with a similar effort led by the Jewish Brigade and eventually the Haganah (the Jewish clandestine army in Palestine). Officers of the Jewish Brigade of the British army assumed control of the operation, along with operatives from the Haganah who hoped to smuggle as many displaced persons as possible into Palestine through Italy. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee funded the operation. Almost immediately, the explicitly Zionist Berihah became the main conduit for Jews coming to Palestine, especially from the displaced person camps, and it initially had to turn people away due to too much demand. After the Kielce pogrom of 1946, the flight of Jews accelerated, with 100,000 Jews leaving Eastern Europe in three months. Operating in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia through 1948, Berihah transferred approximately 250,000 survivors into Austria, Germany, and Italy through elaborate smuggling networks. Using ships supplied at great cost by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, then the immigration arm of the Yishuv, these refugees were then smuggled through the British cordon around Palestine. Bricha was part of the larger operation known as Aliyah Bet, and ended with the establishment of Israel, after which immigration to the Jewish state was legal, although emigration was still sometimes prohibited, as happened in both the Eastern Bloc and Arab countries, see, for example refusenik.

The book was first published in October 2001 by the Delacorte Press, and it was later reprinted in May 2003 by Dell-Laurel Leaf, an imprint of a division of Random House, Inc. The book has become a bestseller, and is included in the required reading lists of many American high schools. Characters *Johnny Briggs: The protagonist and narrator of the story, who thinks that the battles of World War I reflect the ones he reenacts with his toy nutcracker soldiers *Mrs. Briggs: The mother of the protagonist, who moves to Woolwich to work in an Arsenal *James Briggs: The father of the Johnny , a cheery and pretty clever toymaker, who sends his son wooden soldier men that he carves and paints in the trenches *Auntie Ivy: After Johnny's father enlists, his mother sends him to live with his aunt, a caring, self-professed lonely woman *Hubert Tuttle: Johnny's schoolteacher, an intelligent, ethical man who threatens to leave Cliffe after his roses are destroyed. Plot summary The part of the story taking place in England where Johnny's father has enlisted is told mainly through letters sent back home to his family. Through the letters it is possible to tell that the November 25 until December 26, 1914. At the beginning of the book Johnny and his family live in London, however Johnny is sent to live with his Aunt Ivy in the town of Cliffe soon after his father enlists. His mother moves to the town of Woolwich, also sending letters to Johnny every chapter, to help support the war by getting a job making weaponry in a factory. A main theme of the book is the pointlessness and irrationality of war. After the protagonist, Johnny Briggs, misses school for two days in order to have more time to build his Guy Fawkes, he is forced to spend every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon at his teacher's house. There, his teacher, Mr. Tuttle, tutors him on classic literature, mainly the Iliad. They both draw direct parallels between the events of World War I and the events of Homer's novel. It is during the beginning of the book that he is bullied, but when saved by Sarah is entirely ungrateful and says \\"a girl for a friend is like no friend at all.\\" This is why he leaves the school. When she saves him from being thrown in the fire he starts to see her as a friend. At the beginning of the book, Johnny's father appears enthusiastic about going to war, so much that at the beginning he is frustrated that he lacks the half-inch of height required to enlist. After the required height is lowered, he joins the war and is moved to the front line afterward. As the war continues, it takes its toll on Johnny's father's health, physique, and mentality. Johnny's father sends his son a newly whittled and painted soldier with every letter, but his creations appear increasingly grotesque throughout the book. This is reflected in the model of himself that he had sent. The brown paint of his clothes turns a moldy green, the wide grin on its face fades to a grim, mournful expression, a hairline crack comes down his chest, and a knothole begins to form in its chest. The book comes to a close when Johnny stops playing with his nutcracker soldiers, and brings them together for the Christmas Truce of 1914. The war continues without Johnny's interference, and his father returns four years later in 1918. Johnny's mother dies from sulfur poisoning in 1923, demonstrating that some of the most valiant sacrifices of World War I came not from the front lines, but from the work force at home. Ratings Most people rate it a 4-5/5. This is because people say that this book's contents of the story is interesting and thrilling.http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/reviews/s797579.htm References Category:2001 Canadian novels Category:Canadian young adult novels Category:Novels set during World War I Category:Novels set in England Category:Fiction set in 1914 ","title":"Lord of the Nutcracker Men"},{"id":"2191895","text":"Boro Primorac (; born 5 December 1954) is a Bosnian coach and a former Yugoslav international, currently holding position of Youth Academy director at Hajduk Split.

Tennessee Wesleyan offers ten varsity sports. The Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs compete in the Appalachian Athletic Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. History Old College Tennessee Wesleyan was founded in 1857 as Athens Female College. It consisted solely of one building (now Old College). In 1866 the name was altered to , and in 1867 it became . At that time, the college was one of only a handful of coeducational colleges in the Southern United States. In 1886, college president John F. Spence changed the name to in an attempt to receive financial support from Northern benefactors. In 1889, it merged with Chattanooga University to form (U.S. Grant University; ' being Grant's given names), becoming the consolidated university's Athens branch campus. Seventeen years later (1906), it was renamed the Athens School of the University of Chattanooga. In 1925, the college split from Chattanooga to become Tennessee Wesleyan College and served as a junior college. Tennessee Wesleyan became a liberal arts college in 1957 when it began awarding bachelor's degrees. In February 2016, the school announced that they would change their name to Tennessee Wesleyan University, effective July 1, 2016.

The dispute has been ongoing since 1907, and has involved more than 100 court cases around the world. As a result, Budweiser Budvar has the rights to the name Budweiser in most of Europe and Anheuser-Busch InBev has this right in North America. Consequently, AB InBev uses the name \\"Bud\\" in most of Europe and Budvar sells its beer in North America under the name \\"Czechvar\\". In other territories, one or other or even both may use the name, depending on local trademark law.  Background  Beer brewing in the city of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice (), which was then in the Kingdom of Bohemia and is now in the Czech Republic, dates back to the 13th century,Harper, Timothy; Oliver, Garrett (1997). The Good Beer Book, p.68. New York: Berkley. . when the city was granted brewing rights during the reign of Ottokar II of Bohemia. During the time when both Czech and German were official languages in the kingdom, two breweries were founded in the city. Both breweries made beer which they called \\"Budweiser\\", similar to how brewers in the city of Pilsen made a beer generically called Pilsner. The beer from Budweis began exporting to the United States in 1872‚Äì73 and then again since 1933. In 1876, the American brewer Anheuser-Busch began making a beer which they also called \\"Budweiser\\", motivated in part by a desire to \\"brew a beer similar in quality, color, flavor and taste to the beer then made at Budweis\\", according to Adolphus Busch. Parties Two breweries currently claim rights to the word \\"Budweiser\\": * Anheuser-Busch InBev has marketed \\"Budweiser\\" in the United States and Canada since 1876, and won a series of trademark confrontations to consolidate control of the Budweiser mark in the United States in the 1890s. As of 2014, AB InBev had 150,000 employees globally and sold 400 million hectoliters of beer annually. * Budweiser Budvar Brewery () is a state-owned brewery founded in 1795 by Czech-speaking citizens of Budweis and directly continued the tradition of beer brewing in Budweis, which dates back to the 13th century. As of 2014, it employed 600 people, sold 1.4 million hectoliters of beer annually and exported into 66 foreign countries. In addition, Budweiser Bier B√ºrgerbr√§u () was founded in 1795 by German-speaking citizens of Budweis, and began exporting beer under the \\"Budweiser Bier\\" name to the United States in 1875. The company was expropriated by the state in 1945, and abandoned use of the Budweiser name at that time. However, after the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, the government restored the company's rights in Czechoslovakia. The parent company of Budweiser Bier B√ºrgerbr√§u, Samson, was acquired by AB InBev in 2014, in part to help support AB InBev's claim to the Budweiser mark. Legal theories Anheuser-Busch cites prior registration of the trademark in the United States, and more recently its ownership of Budweiser Bier B√ºrgerbr√§u, when making a claim to the mark. Anheuser-Busch has also pointed to advertising campaigns where those predated any formal registration by either party, such as an extensive campaign in the 1930s in Italy that predated Budvar's 1940 registrations. The Budweis-based companies have argued in turn that Budweiser is generic, or is a protected geographical indication that refers to beer made specifically in the city of Budweis. Where possible, Budvar's claims are supported by proof of prior use (as in Germany). Contracts between Anheuser-Busch and the two Czech breweries in 1911 and 1939 have also factored into some of the cases. These contracts allegedly gave Anheuser the right to use Budweiser as a \\"trade name or trade mark\\" while giving the European companies the right to use Budweiser \\"as descriptive of geographical origin\\". In the European Union, the cases have led to several court rulings about the nature and scope of protected geographical indications (also known as \\"appellations of origin\\"). In Italy, courts found that an appellation could be valid even if the place to which the case referred no longer exists (in this case, the city of Budweis, now Budƒõjovice), which gave Budvar's brand protection in Italy. In a case originating in Austria, the European Court of Justice ruled that simple indications (in this case \\"Bud\\") could not be prohibited if a more specific appellation was protected, therefore allowing AB InBev to sell \\"Bud\\" in Austria, but not \\"Budweiser\\".  History of the dispute  In 1907, American and Bohemian brewers made an agreement that Anheuser-Busch could market its beer as Budweiser only in North America, while the Bohemian brewers had the rights to the European markets. Since then, litigation has been extensive: according to the Budvar website, as of 2012 there were \\"about 40 trademark dispute cases pending in different jurisdictions and some 70 procedural issues up for consideration around the world\\". As of January 2013, Budvar claimed to have won 89 of 124 cases against AB InBev, with an additional eight ending in a draw or settlement. In the European Union (EU), Budƒõjovick√Ω Budvar is recognized as a product with Protected Geographical Indication. However, the trademark rights to the name Budweiser for some products other than beer are owned by Anheuser-Busch. In early 2007, Anheuser-Busch and Budvar reached an agreement that stated that Anheuser-Busch would market Budvar/Czechvar in the United States and several other countries for an undisclosed fee. However, both sides stated that this did not affect their lawsuits. The partnership with AB InBev was terminated in January 2012, and in July of that year, United States Beverage began responsibility for the sales and marketing of Czechvar in the United States. In March 2009, Anheuser-Busch lost an appeal against the EU's Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) decision to reject the registration of Budweiser as an EU-wide trademark for beer for Anheuser- Busch. The court pointed out that Budƒõjovick√Ω Budvar had proven that it had been using the trade mark during at least the five years preceding the publication of Anheuser-Busch's application for a Community trade mark. The decision also covers malted non-alcoholic beverages (such as non-alcoholic beer). Some recent cases include: * EU: In 2009, the European Court of First Instance ruled that AB InBev can not register the Budweiser mark as an EU-wide Community Trade Mark. This was partly because in Germany and Austria the right to use this mark was already held by Budweiser Budvar. The ruling was upheld on appeal. * Germany: In Germany, Budvar has had exclusive control over the Budweiser brand name since May 2009. * UK: In the U.K., courts have ruled that neither company has exclusive rights to the name Budweiser.Trade Mark decision O/504/01 Intellectual Property Office * Italy: In 2013, Budvar won a case against AB InBev in Italy, requiring AB InBev to rebrand their Budweiser as Bud in Italy.  Alternative brands  Where AB InBev has lost cases, it markets its product as \\"Bud\\" (as in Italy) or as \\"Anheuser-Busch B\\" (in Germany). In 2013, AB InBev was granted an EU-wide Community Trade Mark for the use of \\"Bud\\", after winning a related court case against Budvar. Where Budvar does not have rights, such as the United States, Canada, and Brazil, it uses the brand name Czechvar. In 2007, AB InBev signed a deal with Budvar to sell Budvar Budweiser under the name Czechvar in the United States.Story of Czechvar Beer at czechvar.com. Note that the web page avoids the words Budvar or Budweis etc. using the abbreviation B.B.N.P.

With a van der Waals radius of 1.2 √Ö, hydrogen atoms do not usually approach other hydrogen atoms closer than 2.4 √Ö. Close approaches near 1.8 √Ö, are, however, characteristic of dihydrogen bonding. Dihydrogen bonding is evident in the close H---H contacts between water of crystallization and the borohydride anion in the salt NaBH4(H2O)2. Boron hydrides An early example of this phenomenon is credited to Brown and Heseltine. They observed intense absorptions in the IR bands at 3300 and 3210 cm‚àí1 for a solution of (CH3)2NHBH3. The higher energy band is assigned to a normal N‚àíH vibration whereas the lower energy band is assigned to the same bond, which is interacting with the B‚àíH. Upon dilution of the solution, the 3300 cm‚àí1 band increased in intensity and the 3210 cm‚àí1 band decreased, indicative of intermolecular association. Interest in dihydrogen bonding was reignited upon the crystallographic characterization of the molecule H3NBH3. In this molecule, like the one studied by Brown and Hazeltine, the hydrogen atoms on nitrogen have a partial positive charge, denoted HŒ¥+, and the hydrogen atoms on boron have a partial negative charge, often denoted HŒ¥‚àí. In other words, the amine is a protic acid and the borane end is hydridic. The resulting B‚àíH...H‚àíN attractions stabilize the molecule as a solid. In contrast, the related substance ethane, H3CCH3, is a gas with a boiling point 285 ¬∞C lower. Because two hydrogen centers are involved, the interaction is termed a dihydrogen bond. Formation of a dihydrogen bond is assumed to precede formation of H2 from the reaction of a hydride and a protic acid. A very short dihydrogen bond is observed in NaBH4¬∑2H2O with H‚àíH contacts of 1.79, 1.86, and 1.94 √Ö. Coordination chemistry Dihydrogen bonding exists between the hydroxypyridine and a hydride ligand in this iridium complex. Protonation of transition metal hydride complexes is generally thought to occur via dihydrogen bonding.Natalia V. Belkova, Elena S. Shubina, and Lina M. Epstein \\"Diverse World of Unconventional Hydrogen Bonds\\" Acc. Chem. Res., 2005, 38, 624‚Äì631. This kind of H‚àíH interaction is distinct from the H‚àíH bonding interaction in transition metal complexes having dihydrogen bound to a metal. In neutral compounds So-called hydrogen hydrogen bond interactions have been proposed to occur between two neutral non-bonding hydrogen atoms from Atoms in molecules theory, while similar interactions have been shown to exist experimentally. Many of these types of dihydrogen bonds have been identified in molecular aggregates.Bakhmutov, Vladimir. I.

Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets. Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. Orange blossom can be described as smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred to with different names, is a result of the process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of enfleurage (rarely used nowadays due to prohibitive costs) or solvent extraction.  Production  The blossoms are gathered, usually by hand, in late April to early May. The oil is extracted by steam distillation. Tunisia is the largest producer of neroli oil followed by Morocco.  History  By the end of the 17th century, Anne Marie Orsini, duchess of Bracciano and princess of Nerola, Italy, introduced the essence of bitter orange tree as a fashionable fragrance by using it to perfume her gloves and her bath. Since then, the term \\"neroli\\" has been used to describe this essence. Neroli has a refreshing and distinctive, spicy aroma with sweet and flowery notes.  Use  Neroli (Citrus aurantium) essential oil in a clear glass vial It is one of the most widely used floral oils in perfumery. Like all essential oils neroli is irritating, sensitizing and a known allergen because of the high content of aromatic terpenes such as linalool, limonene, farnesol, geraniol and citral. It blends well with any citrus oil, various floral absolutes, and most of the synthetic components available on the market. Neroli oil is a classic element in fragrance design and one of the most commonly used in the industry. It also has a limited use in flavorings. Neroli oil is reportedly one of the ingredients in the closely guarded secret recipe for the Coca-Cola soft drink. It is a flavoring ingredient of open source cola recipes, although some variants consider it as optional, owing to the high cost.

It is characterized by multiple and concurrent seizure types, cognitive dysfunction, and slow spike waves on electroencephalogram (EEG). Typically, it presents in children aged 3‚Äì5 years and can persist into adulthood. It has been associated with several gene mutations, perinatal insults, congenital infections, brain tumors/malformations, and genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and West syndrome. The prognosis for LGS is poor with a 5% mortality in childhood and persistent seizures into adulthood (80%‚Äì90%). LGS was named for neurologists William G. Lennox (Boston, USA) and Henri Gastaut (Marseille, France),Dravet, C., & Roger, J. (1996). Henri Gastaut 1915-1995.

Signs and symptoms The symptoms vary and progress with age. The symptoms are characterized by a triad of seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and EEG findings. The triad may not fully emerge until 1‚Äì2 years after first seizure episode. = Seizures = The peak age of onset of seizures is typically between 3 and 5 years of age. The mainstay symptoms is seizures that are frequent ‚Äì occurring daily ‚Äì and difficult to treat with antiseizure medications. An estimated 30% of patients with infantile spasms (West syndrome) have been reported to progress to LGS.Albert P. Aldenkamp, Fritz E. Dreifuss, W. Renier, T.P.B.M.

New York: Raven Press, 1980: 149‚Äì54 The seizures are most commonly tonic seizures. They occur most frequently during non-REM sleep (90%). The seizures initially last only a few seconds and are activated by sleep. The presentation can be subtle. They present often as tonic eyelid opening with some changes in breathing coupled with pupillary dilation, urinary incontinence, increased heart rate, and flushing can occur. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus occurs in about 50% of patients. The seizures can cause sudden falling often leading to injury. These \\"drop attacks\\" are typically the first manifestation of LGS. The attacks are characterized by a single, generalized monoclonic jerk that precedes tonic contraction of axial muscles. = EEG findings = Findings that strongly suggest LGS include consistent slow spike-wave (< 3 hertz [Hz]) on awake EEG. The complexes typically consist of a spike (duration < 70 milliseconds) or a sharp wave (70-200 milliseconds), followed first by a positive deep trough, then a negative wave (350-400 milliseconds). Not every wave is preceded by a spike. Bursts increase and decrease without clear onset and offset. Slow spike waves may occur during seizure or between seizures, or may occur in absence of any observable clinical changes which helps distinguish pattern from extended 3-Hz spike-wave discharges. = Ocular abnormality = Ocular abnormalities affect around 90% of children. They can present as refractive error, strabismus, cortical visual impairment, and premature retinopathy. Causes The disease pathophysiology is mostly unknown, but some evidence implicates cortical hyperexcitability occurring at critical periods of brain development. There are two types of LGS: idiopathic and secondary. The cause of the idiopathic subtype is unknown. Secondary LGS occurs when an identifiable underlying pathology is responsible. The most common type of LGS (70‚Äì78%) is secondary. These patients tend to have a worse prognosis than those with idiopathic LGS. In up to one-third of cases no cause can be found. =Brain injury = Lennox-Gastaut most often occurs secondary to brain damage. The brain damage can occur from perinatal insults, encephalitis, meningitis, tumor, and brain malformation. =Genetic mutations = Other identified disorders include genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and inherited deficiency of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase. Some of these cases once thought to be of unknown cause may have definitive etiology by modern genetic testing. Progress in genome and exome sequencing is revealing that some individuals diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome have de novo mutations in a variety of genes, including CHD2, GABRB3, ALG13 and SCN2A. The Epi4K study consortium (2013) observed de novo mutations in at least 15% of a study cohort of 165 patients with LGS and infantile spasms using whole exome sequencing. A 2013 study found a high frequency of rare copy-number variation (CNV's) in adult patients with LGS or LGS-like epilepsy. Mutations in the IQSEC2 gene have been associated with this syndrome.Choi MH, Yang JO, Min JS, Lee JJ, Jun SY1, Lee YJ, Yoon JY, Jeon SJ, Byeon I, Kang JW, Kim NS (2019) A novel X-linked variant of IQSEC2 is associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and mild intellectual disability in three generations of a Korean Family. Genet Test Mol Biomarkers This gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.22). Diagnosis The diagnosis of LGS should be suspected in children less than 8 years old with seizures of multiple types that cannot be treated with antiseizure medications. Because of high risk of irreversible brain damage in early stages of syndrome (particularly in infants and young children), early diagnosis is essential. It may take 1‚Äì2 years after first initial seizure for all criteria for diagnosis to emerge, so LGS should be considered if there are suggestive signs and symptoms without presence of complete triad. To confirm diagnosis, awake and asleep EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed. MRI is used to detect focal brain lesions. = Ruling out other diagnosis = Certain diagnoses must be ruled out before diagnosing LGS. These diagnoses are: * Doose syndrome * Dravet syndrome * pseudo-Lennox Gastaut syndrome (atypical benign partial epilepsy) LGS is more easily distinguished from Doose syndrome by seizure type after the syndrome has progressed. Doose syndrome has more myoclonic seizures and LGS has more tonic seizures. The Doose syndromes is less likely to have cognitive disabilities. The Dravet syndrome has a strong family history of epilepsy, unlike LGS. Also, many children with Dravet syndrome have seizures triggered by light. Pseudo-Lennox‚ÄìGastaut syndrome can be distinguished from LGS because pseudo-LGS has different spike-and-wave patterns on EEG. Treatment There are several treatment options, including medications, surgery, and diet. = Medications = In most patients with LGS, the treatment does not end seizure recurrence. The goals of treatment are to lower frequency and severity of seizures to greatest extent possible. The appropriate treatment varies depending on individual. The treatments for LGS has evolved over the years. Various treatments have been shown to have some degree of efficacy. In 1997‚Äì1999, lamotrigine was found to be effective and approved by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada. In 1999, topiramate trials showed that topiramate decreased seizure occurrence by more than 50%. Felbamate is the treatment of last resort in the event that everything else fails, and was found to be superior to placebo in controlling treatment resistant partial seizures and atonic seizures. However, it has been known to cause aplastic anemia and liver toxicity. First-line drugs * valproate (valproic acid, sodium valproate and valproate semisodium) Second-line drugs *lamotrigine Third-line drugs *rufinamide *topiramate Treatment of last resort *felbamate Adjuvant drugs * benzodiazepines, specifically clonazepam, nitrazepam, and clobazam * zonisamide *cannabidiol =Surgery= In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Since 2010, this assumption has been challenged. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period. There are several procedures that have shown efficacy: *vagus nerve stimulation, which involves implantation of battery-operated generator of intermittent electrical stimuli to an electrode wrapped around left vagus nerve. Some studies have been shown it to have greater than 50% reduction in seizures reported in more than half of patients. *corpus callosotomy, which has shown to be effective with atonic seizures. This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failed *transcranial direct current stimulation *resection =Diet= A ketogenic diet is a diet that causes ketosis, a state in which there is an increased amount of ketones in the body. Adopting and maintaining rigid diet may be difficult for some families. Short-term ketogenic diet might be associated with nonsignificant decreases in frequency of parent-reported seizures in children with LGS. A case series study showed 50% seizure reduction reported in almost half of children with LGS after 1 year of ketogenic diet. However, the strength of the study is challenged because it represents reports rather than scientific analysis of the clinical outcomes such as in a randomized controlled trial. Prognosis The mortality rate ranges from 3‚Äì7% in a mean follow up period of 8.5 to 9.7 years. Death is often related to accidents. Epidemiology LGS is seen in approximately 4% of children with epilepsy, and is more common in males than in females. Usual onset is between the ages of three and five. Children can have no neurological problems prior diagnosis, or have other forms of epilepsy. West syndrome is diagnosed in 20% of patients before it evolves into LGS at about 2 years old. =Finland= According to a 1997 community-based retrospective study in the Helsinki metropolitan area and the province of Uusimaa, the annual incidence of Lennox‚ÄìGastaut was 2 in 100,000 (0.002%) from 1975 to 1985. =United States= 0.026% of all children in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area were estimated to have LGS in 1997, which was defined as, \\"onset of multiple seizure types before age 11 years, with at least one seizure type resulting in falls, and an EEG demonstrating slow spike-wave complexes (<2.5 Hz).\\" The study concluded that LGS accounts for 4% of childhood epilepsies. Research Vigabatrin was found by Feucht et al. to be an effective add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. Out of 20 children, only 1 experienced a serious side effect (dyskinesia). Zonisamide showed promise in an overview of controlled and uncontrolled trials conducted in Japan. However, in a physician survey conducted December 2004, only 28% of Lennox‚ÄìGastaut and West syndrome patients improved on zonisamide. One yet to be published study from 2017 supported the use of cannabidiol. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown a significant reduction of seizures in patients taking 10 and 20 mg/kg a day compared to placebo.

He lives in California. He is a singer, songwriter, producer, guitarist and keyboard player. He has been in several bands such as Jyradelix, Cush, Juggernautz, but most notably Mortal and Fold Zandura. He was the main songwriter and lead singer for both bands. He first used his pen name in 1988 on a demo tape but spelled it \\"Gyro\\" until the release of Fathom where it became Jyro. He is married to Carla Joy Phillips. The title track from Mortal's 1995 album Pura is dedicated to her. In 1988 he, Jerome Fontamillas, Ray Tongpo and Wilson Peralta released a six-song demo called Wish Fifteen as Mortal Wish. Four years later they signed with Intense Records and released Lusis and changed their name to simply Mortal. They released six albums with Intense Records. Their last album with the label was called Pura. According to the liner notes of Pura, Solamente is inspired by Tonight I Can Write by Pablo Neruda and is cited as Jyro's favorite poet. Serena by Fold Zandura also references this poem. In the summer of 1995 he and his friend Jerome formed Fold Zandura with drummer Frank Lenz. They released three more albums until 1999. Fold Zandura has not officially broken up according to their website, but they have not released anything since King Planet. In 2000 he worked with Crystal Lewis on Fearless and co-wrote Satisfied. In early 2002 he released a side project on Crystal Lewis' record label Metro One Music called Juggernautz without Jerome. In October 2002 Jyro released a new Mortal album on Tooth & Nail Records called Nu-En-Jin. They did not tour to promote however since Jyro has stated that Mortal could continue to exist albeit only as a studio band. He is currently working for Metro One Music as a producer, engineer, keyboard and guitar player for various bands. Jyro is currently \\"director/dj/guru\\" in Immersion a musical collective that meets every month for event style art. Jyro has also surfaced as the leader of the band LCNA (formerly Lucena) under the initials JFM. Their debut, Mercury Light, is available through iTunes and the band is at work on a full-length album.

He is sometimes confused with his son, another Texas state legislator who was also known as William Clark Jr. (18281884). Biography Clark was born in North Carolina on April 14, 1798. He married Martha B. Wall in the 1820s. They had a son named William Clark Junior in 1828. They lived in Georgia before moving to Sabine County, Texas in 1835, where he operated a successful store. William S Clark Junior and James Gaines both traveled to the Convention of 1836. This Convention was brought together to discuss a possible secession and war with Mexico. This created the Texas Declaration of Independence, which both Clark and Gaines signed. Following the convention, interim President David G Burnet of the Republic of Texas, was assisted by Clark by creating a system to collect supplies and other goods for the army to fight against the invading Mexican army. Clark briefly served as a representative of Sabine County in the House of the Second Congress in 1837 and left in 1838 due to illness. Following the war, and after recovering from his illness, he stayed in Sabine County until he purchased the Planter Hotel in Nacogdoches in 1859, located in East Texas. He managed the property until he died on January 3, 1871. In 1936, the Texas Centennial Commission built a marker on the last Clarks‚Äô home as well as on the graves of Clark and his wife Martha. William S Clark Junior had a son named William Clark Junior. William Clark Junior followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps, as he was elected to the state legislature in 1859, and helped Texas in the Secession Convention of 1861, leading Texas into the American Civil War.

History =Early Beginnings (2000-2006)= Sinai Beach was started by vocalist CJ Alderson, guitarist Logan Lambert, drummer Mike Dunlap, and bassist Jeff Santo. They recorded a four-song demo and played mostly local shows. Their recording and performances gained attention of No Innocent Victim drummer, Jason Dunn. Shortly after signing with Dunn's label, Facedown Records, guitarist Mike Risinger joined on guitar. The five began to write material for their second recording that became the band's first full release, When Breath Escapes. Vocalist CJ Alderson appeared on Zao's The Lesser Lights of Heaven DVD. As the fan base and support continued to grow Sinai Beach started to receive interest from several well-known heavy music labels and eventually signed with Chicago-based Victory Records. This allowed them the opportunity to tour with bands such as Zao, As I Lay Dying, Norma Jean, Haste the Day, Still Remains, Himsa, Bleeding Through, Comeback Kid and Terror. After several US and European tours, Sinai Beach released their second full album Immersed. =Hiatus and Resurrection (2006-2017)= Sinai Beach is listed as \\"Artist Alumni\\" on the Victory Records website and several of the members have moved away and married since the band last played together live. Sean Durham and Erik Collins both joined the band in 2006 following the departure of Santo and the brief hiatus of Risinger. Dunlap and Lambert still reside in the Riverside area, while Risinger, Durham and Collins are in the surrounding area. Alderson moved to North Carolina in 2009. In 2013, it was announced the band would headline at Facedown Festival on March 28, 2014, where the band announced their \\"resurrection\\". In 2017, Lambert did an interview with Indie Vision Music, in which he stated that the band was done, though no official statement was released. He said that the reunion at Facedown Fest was their last show. Influences Early influences of the band include Overcome, Zao, Strongarm, Throwdown, and Living Sacrifice.

Also known as a \\"Storey\\". Generally, shop employees are not shopkeepers, but are often incorrectly referred to as shopkeepers. At larger companies, a shopkeeper is usually referred to as a manager, since the owner is not able to manage the business being a single shopkeeper, so this term could apply to larger firms (in particular, multiple shops) generally and be a separate duty. Job descriptions Shopkeepers may manage their own independent corner shop or run a franchise store on behalf of a retail chain. Unlike store managers who usually work for a large retailer, shopkeepers will normally have overall responsibility for a store. Independent shopkeepers include (but are not limited to) grocers, corner shops, newsagents, butchers, bakers, booksellers, florists, and antique dealers. A shopkeeper would serve clients at a counter and carry out other duties such as taking customer payments, giving change, helping customers and wrapping gifts and purchases. Most of the time shopkeepers are answering customer's enquirers, giving advice about products to customers and listening to customers‚Äô needs and requests, which can indicate new sales opportunities. They also calculate daily takings, prepare pages, deposit cash at the bank, book-keep and stock take to ensure that the stocks are available all the time. Ordering stock from wholesalers, manufacturers, agents and importers, sometimes this task can also given to small shop keeper if the shop is too small and don't have purchaser. Shop- keeping is a non-farm activity. Many people in the village owns a small shop and sells household products. People in the village do this work if they don't get work in the farm or for the daily income. In big cities, there are large malls instead of small shops.

Brought up in Condobolin and Beacon Hill, Sydney, Leak attended the Julian Ashton Art School in the 1970s. His cartoons were first published in 1983 in The Bulletin and after he drew for The Sydney Morning Herald until 1994, when he was recruited by News Limited to contribute to The Daily Telegraph-Mirror and later to The Australian. Leak entered paintings into the Archibald on several occasions, having won the People's Choice Award in 1994 for his portrait of Malcolm Turnbull and the Packing Room Prize twice, in 1997 and 2000 for his portraits of Tex Perkins and Sir Les Patterson respectively. Leak's novel Heart Cancer was published in 2005 and in 2008 ABC TV aired his six-part series Face Painting. Leak's editorial cartoons for The Australian were at the centre of several controversies. Works that received considerable media coverage include a 2006 cartoon drawn during the West Papuan refugee crisis, a series of cartoons in 2007 that featured Kevin Rudd as Tintin, a 2015 cartoon depicting starving Indian people attempting to eat solar panels and two cartoons in 2016, one an illustration of a neglectful Aboriginal father and another that depicted same-sex marriage campaigners wearing rainbow-coloured Nazi uniforms. Early life and career beginnings Desmond Robert Leak was born in Adelaide on 9 January 1956, the second of three children of Doreen and Reg Leak., as reproduced online at: He was brought up in Condobolin from his birth until 1967, when the family moved to Beacon Hill. He attended Beacon Hill High School and Forest High School, forced to leave the former for the latter after drawing caricatures of his teachers. Remembering what Beacon Hill was like in the early 1970s, Leak described the place as \\"intellectually barren, culturally hostile and isolated\\". After finishing high school, Leak trained for two years, 1974-1975 at the Julian Ashton Art School, dropping out before his studies were completed. He also spent time working as a postman. In the late 1970s, Leak departed Australia on an art pilgrimage to Europe. In 1978, he was particularly impressed by an exhibition of the paintings of Paul C√©zanne at the Grand Palais in Paris. Whilst in Salzburg that same year, Leak met a woman named Astrid and they married soon after. The couple lived together in Bavaria until 1982, when they relocated to Australia. They divorced in the early 1990s. Leak began drawing cartoons professionally in 1983, first for The Bulletin and then for The Sydney Morning Herald. News Limited career Leak resigned from The Sydney Morning Herald to take up a role at The Daily Telegraph-Mirror, a News Limited newspaper, in 1994. He later moved to The Australian (also a News Limited newspaper). In April 2006, Leak drew a cartoon captioned \\"No Offence Intended\\", depicting an Indonesian person resembling then president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, as a dog mounting a Papuan native. The drawing was in retaliation to a cartoon in the Jakarta daily Rakyat Merdeka from the previous week, which had depicted the Australian prime minister and foreign minister as dingoes engaged in sexual intercourse, with the prime minister saying \\"I want Papua!! Alex! Try to make it happen!\\" The foreign minister, Alexander Downer, told media that he felt Leak's cartoon was crude, offensive and potentially racist. In 2007, a Belgian company that controlled the rights to the cartoon character Tintin, issued Leak a copyright complaint for portraying the then-leader of the opposition, Kevin Rudd, as Tintin (accompanied by Snowy). The complaint was resolved when Leak agreed not to profit from sales of the cartoons. A Leak cartoon published in The Australian in December 2015 depicted starving Indian villagers trying to eat solar panels delivered by the UN, a comment by Leak on the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The academic Amanda Wise, an associate professor of sociology at Macquarie University, told media that it was her view that the cartoon was racist. Social media commentary, including by Tim Watts, agreed with Wise and condemned the cartoon. The Australian Press Council dismissed a complaint about the cartoon, saying that \\"the cartoon is an example of drawing on exaggeration and absurdity to make its point\\" \\"by ridiculing [the UN's] decision to provide solar panels at the expense of more appropriate aid\\". The Australian Press Council delivered a ruling on the work in November 2016 that it did not breach standards of practice. In August 2016, on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children's Day, a Leak cartoon in The Australian depicted an Aboriginal policeman holding a teenage male and telling the youth's father that he needed to teach his son about personal responsibility. The father, with a can of beer in hand, replies \\"Yeah, righto, What's his name then?\\" Muriel Bamblett, head of the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency, as well as Roy Ah-See, chair of the NSW Aboriginal Land Council, and Nigel Scullion, the minister for Indigenous affairs, all labeled the cartoon racist. Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O'Callaghan and academic Jeremy Sammut defended Leak's 2016 cartoon, saying it was an appropriate portrayal of some communities and families. Leak said the cartoon was not racist, reflecting that if the characters he had drawn were white, he would not have been accused of racially stereotyping all white parents as bad parents. A complaint by a woman who said she had been discriminated against as a result of the cartoon triggered an investigation into Leak and The Australian by the Australian Human Rights Commission. The complaint was later withdrawn after the woman behind the complaint was subjected to alleged intimidation and harassment from Leak's employers at News Limited.http://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2016/11/18/woman-behind-bill-leak- cartoon-complaint-dropped-charges-due-harassment The investigation was thus terminated. right On 21 September 2016, during a nationwide debate about legalising same-sex marriage (SSM), The Australian published a Leak cartoon depicting a club-carrying, goose-stepping platoon, wearing rainbow-coloured NAZI SS uniforms, captioned \\"Waffen-SSM\\", which provoked significant controversy. Comedian Ben McLeay criticized Leak's cartoon, writing that it was harmful and morally repugnant. Peter Wertheim, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry executive director, said that the cartoon was an inversion of history. Association with the Archibald In 1984, Leak first entered the Archibald Prize, an annual portraiture competition administered by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. That year, he swore that he would never enter again but changed his mind in 1989, entering a portrait of Don Bradman, which was named as one of 24 finalists that year. He entered portraits of Malcolm Turnbull in 1994, Graham Richardson in 1995, Tex Perkins in 1997, Gough Whitlam in 1998, Sir Les Patterson in 2000 and Robert Hughes in 2001. He won the Packing Room Prize twice (for portraits of Tex Perkins and Sir Les Patterson) and also won the People's Choice Award for his portrait of Malcolm Turnbull. He was also a subject for People's Choice Award winners Esther Erlich (2000) and Jo Palaitis (1995). Of his long association with the Archibald Prize, News Limited journalist Roger Coombs wrote in 2008 that Leak \\"is widely regarded by good judges as the best painter never to have won the Archibald prize\\". Health On 18 October 2008, Leak sustained serious head injuries from falling off a balcony while trying to feed African grey parrots and gang-gang cockatoos. Brain surgery was required, after which he was in a serious condition. His partner Lo Mong Lau, along with his elder son Johannes and his mother and sister, joined him to be by his side at the Royal North Shore Hospital where he was treated. While the outlook was initially poor, he recovered. Death On 10 March 2017, Leak died in hospital following a suspected heart attack. He was 61 years old. Awards Leak won nine Walkley Awards: *1987 ‚Äì For best illustration, a picture of then employment and education minister John Dawkins *1989 ‚Äì For best illustrationWalkley Winners Archive, The Walkley Foundation. *1990 ‚Äì For best illustration *1992 ‚Äì For best illustration *1993 ‚Äì For best cartoon *1995 ‚Äì For best cartoon, \\"And that's the Truth\\" *1996 ‚Äì For best cartoon, \\"It's our ABC\\" *1997 ‚Äì For his artwork \\"The Big Picture\\" *2002 ‚Äì For his cartoon \\"Brown Nose Day\\" Between 1987 and 1998, he was also presented with 20 Stanley Awards - twelve category (bronze) awards and eight gold for Cartoonist of the Year - and was a two-time winner of News Corps' News Award for best cartoonist of the year, in 2015 and 2016. Books and TV =Books published= In 2005, ABC Books published Leak's first novel, Heart Cancer. The reviewer Gillian Dooley wrote that the book was not a success, labelling the first half \\"tedious, crude, self- indulgent and melodramatic\\" and the end \\"truly nauseating\\".

It is located at the Waimea Cliff. The Fly was first envisioned and bolted by Mark Sprague in 1995 as an open project for all to try but did not see a free ascent until David Graham, an 18-year-old American climber from Maine, climbed it in April 2000. It was quickly repeated by his climbing partner, Luke Parady. These ascents were milestones for the young up and coming climbers and the Rumney area, as (at the time) they were at the cutting edge grade of physical difficulty in North America. Route Description The Fly ascends a short, steep, lower portion of the Waimea wall, gaining a large ledge (the E-Ticket Ledge) and a bolted anchor about 25 feet up. The climb is very fingery and powerful. The route is quite short by sport climbing standards, essentially a rope protected boulder problem, with its two protection bolts being placed before the now common use of many stacked 'crash pads' to protect the dangerous landing. Most ascents make use of the protection offered by the bolts, usually preclipping the rope to them both, though after practicing the moves on a rope, the climb has been 'bouldered' (sans rope), first by Jason Kehl, on November 7, 2003. First Ascent David Graham made the first ascent (FA) on April 7, 2000.He apparently made a typo while transferring his notes on his ascent in his 8a.nu scorecard from the route to bouldering category, changing the date from 2000 to 2001. See interviews such as and archived first mention of The Fly from 10 April 2000 At the time, David Graham and Luke Parady proposed the tentative grade of .

Calendar-wise, it is opposite to the winter holiday Koliada. The celebration relates to the summer solstice when nights are the shortest and includes a number of Slavic rituals.website \\"Guide to Russia\\"  History  Simon Kozhin. Kupala Night, Divination on the Wreaths. The name of the holiday was originally Kupala; a pagan fertility rite later adapted into the Orthodox Christian calendar by connecting it with St. John's Day which is celebrated on 24 June. Eastern Christianity uses traditional Julian calendar which is misaligned with actual solstice; 24 June in Julian calendar falls on 7 July in more modern Gregorian calendar. The Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian name of this holiday combines \\"Ivan\\" (John, in this case John the Baptist) and Kupala which was thought to be derived from the Slavic word for bathing, which is cognate. However, it likely stems from the proto-Slavic kump, a gathering. The two feasts could be connected by reinterpreting John's baptizing people through full immersion in water. However, the tradition of Kupala predates Christianity. The pagan celebration was adapted and reestablished as one of the native Christian traditions intertwined with local folklore. The holiday is still enthusiastically celebrated by the younger people of Eastern Europe. The night preceding the holiday (Tvorila night) is considered the night for \\"good humour\\" mischiefs (which sometimes would raise the concern of law enforcement agencies). On Ivan Kupala day itself, children engage in water fights and perform pranks, mostly involving pouring water over people.

Stamp of Ukraine (1998) Many of the rites related to this holiday are connected with the role of water in fertility and ritual purification. This is due to the ancient Kupala rites. On Kupala day, young people jump over the flames of bonfires in a ritual test of bravery and faith. The failure of a couple in love to complete the jump, while holding hands, is a sign of their destined separation.

Men may attempt to capture the wreaths, in the hope of capturing the interest of the woman who floated it. Ivan Kupala Day in Belgorod Oblast, Russia Khorovod around the fire. Ivan Kupala Night in Belgorod Oblast. June 24, 2017 There is an ancient Kupala belief that the eve of Ivan Kupala is the only time of the year when ferns bloom. Prosperity, luck, discernment, and power befall whom ever finds a fern flower. Therefore, on that night, village folk roam through the forests in search of magical herbs, and especially, the elusive fern flower. Traditionally, unmarried women, signified by the garlands in their hair, are the first to enter the forest. They are followed by young men. Therefore, the quest to find herbs and the fern flower may lead to the blooming of relationships between pairs within the forest. Ferns are not angiosperms (flowering plants), and instead reproduce by spores; they cannot flower. In Gogol's story The Eve of Ivan Kupala, a young man finds the fantastical fern- flower, but is cursed by it. Gogol's tale may have been the stimulus for Modest Mussorgsky to compose his tone poem Night on Bald Mountain, adapted by Yuri Ilyenko into a film of the same name.

Honored with the title of Mahakavi () in Nepali literature, he was known as a poet with a golden heart. He is considered to be the greatest and most famous literary figure in Nepal. Some of his popular works include the best selling Muna Madan, along with Sulochana, Kunjini, Bhikhari, and Shakuntala. Early life Devkota was born on the night of Lakshmi Puja on 13 November 1909 (B.S.1966 Kartik 27) to father Teel Madhav Devkota and mother Amar Rajyalakshmi Devi in Thatunati (now Dhobidhara), Kathmandu.Muna Being born on the auspicious day of Laxmi pooja(the goddess of wealth), he was regarded as the gift of goddess Laxmi, but in contradiction to it, he became a gift of Saraswati(goddess of knowledge and education). His father was a Sanskrit scholar, so he attained his basic education under the custodianship of his father. He started his formal education at Durbar High School, where he studied both Sanskrit grammar and English. After finishing his matriculation exams from Patna at the age of 17, he pursued Bachelor of Arts along with Bachelor of Laws at Tri-Chandra College and graduated from Patna University as a private examinee. His desire of completing his master's degree was although left incomplete due to his family's financial conditions.http://www.weallnepali.com/sahitya-sumana/laxmi- prasad-devkota-laksmi-prasada-devakota Muna Only after a decade from his graduation as a lawyer, he started working in Nepal Bhasaanuwad Parishad (Publication Censor Board), where he met famous playwright Balkrishna Sama. At the same time, he also worked as a lecturer at Tri-Chandra College and Padma Kanya College. Learning and style Devkota contributed to Nepali literature by starting a modern Nepali language romantic movement in the country. He was the first writer born in Nepal to begin writing epic poems in Nepali literature. Nepali poetry soared to new heights with Devkota's innovative use of the language. Departing from the Sanskrit tradition that dominated the Nepali literary scene at the time, and being inspired from the Newar language ballad song Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni, he wrote Muna Madan () (1930), a long narrative poem in a popular Jhyaure bhaka () folk tune. Muna Madan is undoubtedly the best-selling book in the history of Nepalese literature. The 2003 film Muna Madan, which was Nepal's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 76th Academy Awards, was based on this poem. The work received immediate recognition from the Ranas‚Äîthe country's rulers at the time. Muna Madan tells the story of Madan, a travelling merchant, who departs to Tibet in a bid to earn some money leaving behind his wife, Muna. The poem describes the thematic hardships of the journey: the grief of separation, the itching longing, and the torment of death. The ballad Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni is a tragic song based on a Newa merchant, his mother, and his wife. The merchant is about to leave Kathmandu for Tibet on work. The song starts with the wife pleading with her mother-in-law to stop him, saying that it's not even been a month since she came to their home and he wants to go away. Being raised in Kathmandu, Devkota had heard this song from locals singing it at a local Pati (). He was highly fascinated by the song and decided to re-write it in Nepali language. Since the Rana rulers had put a ban on the Newa trade, language and literature, he changed the main character from a Newa merchant as in the original song to a Kshatriya (warrior class) character. Although Kshatriya people did not practice trade for their living during those days, he had to depict it as such in order to lure the Rana rulers. The following couplet, which is among the most famous and frequently quoted lines from the epic, celebrates the triumph of humanity and compassion over the hierarchies created by caste in Nepalese culture. \\"‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ã ‡§õ‡•ã‡§∞‡•ã ‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§™‡§æ‡§â ‡§õ‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§õ, ‡§ò‡§ø‡§®‡§≤‡•á ‡§õ‡•Å‡§Å‡§¶‡•à‡§® ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§†‡•Ç‡§≤‡•ã ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§õ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§Å‡§¶‡•à‡§® !\\" The son of a Kshatriya touches your feet not with hatred but with love. A man's greatness is determined by his heart; not by his caste or lineage. Considered his magnum opus, Muna Madan has remained widely popular among the lay readers of Nepali literature. Devkota, inspired by his five-month stay in a mental asylum in 1939, wrote a free-verse poem Pagal (). The poem deals with his usual mental ability and is considered one of the best Nepali language poems. \\"‡§ú‡§∞‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§•‡•Ä ‡§Æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§ó‡§≤ ! ‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•à ‡§õ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•ã ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤ ‡•§ ‡§Æ ‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶‡§≤‡§æ‡§à ‡§¶‡•á‡§ñ‡•ç‡§¶‡§õ‡•Å ! ‡§¶‡•É‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≤‡§æ‡§à ‡§∏‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§õ‡•Å ! ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∏‡§®‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§à ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§≤‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§õ‡•Å ‡•§ ‡§Ü‡§ï‡§æ‡§∂‡§≠‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ ‡§™‡§æ‡§§‡§æ‡§≤‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§à ‡§õ‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§õ‡•Å ‡•§ ‡§§‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ, ‡§ú‡§∏‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§µ ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•à‡§Ç‡§® ‡§ú‡§∏‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ü‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•à‡§® !\\" Surely, my friend, I am mad, That‚Äôs exactly what I am! I see sounds, Hear sights, Taste smells, I touch things thinner than air, Those things, Whose existence the world denies, Whose shapes the world does not know. Devkota had the ability to compose long epics and poems with literary complexity and philosophical density in very short periods of time. He wrote Shakuntala, his first epic poem and also the first Mahakavya () written in the Nepali language, in a mere three months. Published in 1945, Shakuntala is a voluminous work in 24 cantos based on KƒÅlidƒÅsa's famous Sanskrit play Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam. Shakuntala demonstrates Devkota's mastery of Sanskrit meter and diction which he incorporated heavily while working primarily in Nepali. According to the late scholar and translator of Devkota, David Rubin, Shakuntala is among his greatest accomplishments. \\"It is, without doubt, a remarkable work, a masterpiece of a particular kind, harmonizing various elements of a classical tradition with a modern point of view, a pastoral with a cosmic allegory, KƒÅlidƒÅsa's romantic comedy of earthly love with a symbolic structure that points to redemption through the coinciding of sensual and sacred love.\\"Rubin, David (translator). Nepali Visions, Nepali Dreams: The Poetry of Laxmi Prasad Devkota. Columbia University Press, 1980, p. 40. Devkota also published several collections of short lyric poems set in various traditional and non-traditional forms and meters. Most of his poetry shows the influence of English Romantic poets like Wordsworth and Coleridge. The title poem in the collection Bhikhari () is reminiscent of Wordsworth's \\"The Old Cumberland Beggar\\". In this poem, Devkota describes the beggar going about his ways in dire poverty and desolation, deprived of human love and material comforts. On the other hand, the beggar is also seen as the source of compassion placed in the core of suffering and destitution. Devkota connects the beggar with the divine as the ultimate fount of kindness and empathy: \\"‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡•ã ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶‡§≤‡§¨‡§æ‡§ü ‡§ñ‡§∏‡•á‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§≠‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§™‡§∏‡•á‡§ï‡•ã, ‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§≠‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ? ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡§õ ‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§Ø ‡§ò‡•Å‡§∏‡•á‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ò‡§∞, ‡§ò‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§Å‡§ó‡§® ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡§õ, ‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ß‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡§õ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•Ç‡§£‡§æ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤ ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡•§\\" Fallen from the blackest clouds To enter into darker shrouds, Is he deity or beggar? Buddha speaks ‚Äì his words pierce the heart, Wandering from house to house, yard to yard, Now speaking with a voice of pain: His heart in sorrow cowed. Many of his poems focus on mundane elements of the human and the natural world. The titles of his poems like Ban (), Kisaan (), Baadal () shows that he sought his poetic inspiration in the commonplace and proximal aspects of the world. What resonates throughout most of his poetry is his profound faith in humanity. For instance, in the poem Ban, the speaker goes through a series of interrogations, rejecting all forms of comfort and solace that could be offered solely to him as an individual. Instead, he embraces his responsibility and concern for his fellow beings. The poem ends with the following quatrain that highlights the speaker's humanistic inclinations: \\"‡§¶‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ‡§Å ‡§õ‡§®‡•ç? ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§õ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ï‡•ã? ‡§ò‡§∞ ‡§π‡•ã ‡§§‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã ‡§ï‡•Å‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂? ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§õ‡•å ‡§ï‡•Å‡§® ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞ ‡§≠‡§µ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§´‡§ø‡§∞, ‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡•å ‡§ï‡•Å‡§® ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§∂? ‡§¶‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§§ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•ã ‡§∂‡•Å‡§≠ ‡§â‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•Ä, ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§õ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§∏ ‡§¨‡•á‡§∂ ‡•§ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ ‡§∏‡§¨‡•à ‡§ò‡§∞, ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§Ø-‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§â‡§õ‡•Å ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§æ ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§∂ ‡•§‡•§\\" Where are your friends? Who goes with you? Which land is your home? What place do you seek, Traveller? With what news do you roam? My friend is decent diligence. Courage comes with me. The whole world is my home. To heartland I roam, with hues of humanity. Besides poetry, Devkota also made significant contributions to the essay genre. He is considered the father of the modern Nepali essay. He defied the conventional form of essays and broke the traditional rules of essay writing and embraced a more fluid and colloquial style which had more clarity in meaning, expressive in feelings and eloquent in terms of language. His essays are generally satirical in tone and are characterized by their trenchant humour and ruthless criticism of the modernizing influences from the West on Nepali society. An essay titled Bhaladmi () or criticizes a decadent trend in Nepali society to respect people based on their outward appearances and outfit rather than their actual inner worth and personality. In another essay titled Ke Nepal Sano Cha? (), he expresses deeply nationalistic sentiments inveighing against the colonial forces from British India which, he felt, were encroaching all aspects of Nepali culture. His essays are published in an essays book entitled Laxmi Nibhandha Sanghraha (). Devkota also translated William Shakespeare's play Hamlet into Nepali. Politics Laxmi Prasad Devkota was not active within any well-established political party but his poetry consistently embodied an attitude of rebellion against the oppressive Rana dynasty. During his self-exile in Varanasi, he started working as an editor of Yugvani newspaper of the Nepali Congress, leading to confiscation of all his property in Nepal by the Rana Government. After the introduction of democracy through Revolution of 1951, Devkota was appointed member of the Nepal Salahkar Samiti () in 1952 by King Tribhuvan. Later in 1957, he was appointed as Minister of Education and Autonomous Governance under the premiership of Kunwar Inderjit Singh.  Personal life  =Family= Devkota's son, Padma Devkota, is also a poet and writer and served for many years as a professor at the English Department, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu. =Health= In the late 1930s, Devkota suffered from nervous breakdowns, probably due to the death of his mother, father, and his two-month old daughter. Eventually, in 1939, he was admitted to the Mental Asylum of Ranchi, India, for five months. With financial debts later in his life and being unable to finance the weddings and dowries of his daughters, he is once reported to have said to his wife, \\"Tonight let's abandon the children to the care of society and youth and renounce this world at bedtime and take potassium cyanide or morphine or something like that [sic].\\"Pande, N.

Artifact at the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic in Cornwall, England The term Voodoo doll is commonly employed to describe an effigy into which pins are inserted. Although it comes in various different forms, such practices are found in the magical traditions of many cultures across the world. Although the use of the term Voodoo implies that the practice has links to either the religion of Haitian Vodou or Louisiana Voodoo, it does not have a prominent place in either. History =20th-century link with Voodoo= Contemporary voodoo doll, with 58 pins The link between this magical practice and Voodoo was established through the presentation of the latter in Western popular culture enduring the first half of the 20th century. In this, the myth of this magical practice being closely linked to Voodoo and Vodou was promoted as part of the wider negative depictions of blacks and Afro-Caribbean religious practices in the United States. In John Houston Craige's 1933 book Black Bagdad: The Arabian Nights Adventures of a Marine Captain in Haiti, he described a Haitian prisoner sticking pins into an effigy to induce illness. Its use also appeared in film representations of Haitian Vodou such as Victor Halperin's 1932 White Zombie and Jacques Tourneur‚Äôs 1943 I Walked with a Zombie. In the 1975 film, Lisztomania, a voodoo doll is used, resembling Franz Liszt. In the 1984 film, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, a voodoo doll is used, resembling Indiana Jones. By the early 21st century, the image of the voodoo doll had become particularly pervasive. It had become a novelty item available for purchase, with examples being provided in vending machines in British shopping centres, and an article on \\"How to Make a Voodoo Doll\\" being included on WikiHow.

They hired drummer Frank Lenz and self-released their eponymous debut. In 1997, they released two albums, the first titled Return and featuring five re-recorded songs from their debut, plus two new songs and an instrumental. They made a video for \\"Ember\\" that was filmed in a hospital. Later that year, they released their major label debut, Ultraforever, on BEC Recordings. This time, their new album contained 14 new songs and two songs from Fold Zandura. They made a music video for \\"Deep Surround\\" and also recorded two non-album tracks for two BEC compilations. Moms Like Us Too Vol. 1 featured \\"Serena,\\" and Happy Christmas featured \\"Asia Minor\\". Soon thereafter, Frank Lenz left the band in order to be closer to his family, although he would continue to play at concerts close to home. In 1999, they independently released a seven song EP called King Planet. The band members were listed simply as Jyro and Jerome, although Jyro's wife Carla does vocals on one track. The album was available exclusively through their website and a few Christian music stores. In 2000, Jerome Fontamillas joined Switchfoot as a session musician. He later joined them full-time. The following year, \\"King Planet\\" was featured on the soundtrack to the film Extreme Days. In early 2002, Jyro released Juggernautz, a side project without Jerome on Metro One Music. Jyro Xhan is currently the leader of the band LCNA (Lucena), which goes by the name JFM. He also works with Crystal Lewis and various other bands as producer, engineer, guitar, and keyboard player.

Tandberg's credits include eleven Walkley Awards.Walkley Award history, www.walkley.com He was inducted into the Melbourne Press Club's Victorian Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life and education Tandberg was born in Melbourne to working-class parents and raised in a small house at the suburb of Pascoe Vale South. His grandfather was a builder who gave away his money during the Great Depression and believed in communist ideas. Raised a Catholic, his father was a maintenance electrician while his mother was an overlocker who worked in a knitting mill. Both his parents worked at William Angliss Meatworks. He attended a Catholic primary school (St Fidelis' Primary) in Moreland, St Ambrose primary school Brunswick, St Joseph's College, and then Coburg Technical School. Qualifying for a teaching certificate, he worked as an art teacher, then attended RMIT to study art and graphic design. Artistic career Tandberg started working at Leader Community Newspapers in 1963, although he claimed he lost this job for impersonating his boss. At around the same time, he was producing a regular comic strip called \\"Fred and Others\\" which was syndicated to The Herald in Melbourne, The Advertiser in Adelaide, and eventually international papers including The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. After a few newspapers dropped the strip, Tandberg approached The Age about taking it on. Editor Graham Perkin declined, but offered him a job as a political cartoonist, which he reluctantly accepted in 1972, thus beginning a 45-year career with the newspaper. Tandberg became known for his distinctive \\"pocket\\" cartoons‚Äîminimalist single-panel images to complement and draw attention to a story. Tandberg illustrated an HIV/AIDS prevention poster campaign for the National AIDS Education Council with the tag line \\"If it's not on, it's not on\\" (referring to a condom), which was widely distributed in Australia in the early 1990s. Death Tandberg died of oesophageal cancer at St John of God Hospital, in Geelong, Victoria, surrounded by his family, in the afternoon of 8 January 2018, at the age of 74. He was survived by his wife, Glen.

Retrieved on September 23, 2018.  History  On October 2, 1899, Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs first school would open in what was then Dade County. Ivy Cromartie (later to become Ivy Stranahan) welcomed nine students into a wood- framed schoolhouse located on South Andrews Avenue, south of the New River. By 1901, there were 18 students enrolled at Fort Lauderdale with only 997 enrolled in all of Dade County. In 1902 the School Board began offering transportation to students living in Hallandale who needed to attend school; each day, students would climb aboard wagons for the ride. By 1910, Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs population had grown enough to require the building of a new school so, the old two-room schoolhouse was moved slightly northward to make room. The ‚Äúmodern‚Äù two-story concrete school was constructed for a total cost of $7,000. At the time, Fort Lauderdale was the only high school in the 68-mile stretch between Miami and West Palm Beach. By 1914, enrollment reached 325 with only 47 being high school students; this was the first year with a full nine-month term. In 1915, a 46 to 16 vote led the way for construction of a new Fort Lauderdale High School in the newly designated Broward County. The new school was located three blocks east of Andrews Avenue adjacent to Stranahan Park and was constructed for $55,000. The school was also referred to as Central High School because of the large area it served. The first graduating class in 1915 consisted of five boys. By 1916, it could boast that all nine of its teachers had college degrees. In 1924, Fort Lauderdale established its first Honor Society. 1962 saw the opening of the new Fort Lauderdale High School at its present location on NE Fourth Avenue, with its first graduating class celebrating commencement in June, 1963. The History of Broward County Public Schools 1899 - 1919 The past few years have seen tremendous changes to the FLHS campus, most notably the opening of a new three-story classroom building, a modern library, and a two-story cafeteria. 2007 also saw the renaming of NE 4 Ave between the city divider and NE 13 St as ‚ÄúFlying L Drive‚Äù in honor of the school's commitment to education and community service. The project was completed by a group of four students in John Pellegrino's Public Affairs class.  Magnet Programs  = Pre-Law & Public Affairs = A college preparatory program designed for those interested in careers in Law, Criminal Justice, and Public Affairs. Because of its location in the county seat, the program allows students access to governmental agencies that are utilized as ‚Äúliving laboratories‚Äù for the ultimate learning experience. Students participate in mock trials in a courtroom housed within the school as well as take field trips to the Broward County Courthouse to witness actual trials. Due to the high interest of its students in Pre-Law, the FLHS debate team is one of the best in the state and competes nationally while providing valuable opportunities for its students. FLHS Law Magnet = Advanced Studies Institute = Allows for students to take more Advanced Placement courses, putting them ahead when they enter college. They offer a wide variety of AP courses from Art to History to English. = Cambridge Program = An international pre-university program developed by Cambridge University, designed with a varied curriculum, which also allows students to earn college credit.

Originally the school mascot was known as \\"The Fort Lauderdale L\\". However, at the 1917 state track meet, a reporter from the Miami Herald remarked \\"Look at that L Fly\\" as track star Charlie Rhodes ran to victory, starring in numerous events. The following week, the town of Fort Lauderdale voted on nicknaming all of the school's sports teams \\"The Flying L's\\".  Athletics  Fort Lauderdale Track Team circa 1921The Athletic Program began in 1915 with only two men's sports, Fort Lauderdale High now provides the students with eleven varsity sports for men and ten varsity sports for women. The school also offers four junior varsity sports for men and five junior varsity sports for women to participate in. In 1917, FLHS won their first state championship in track, which is where the unique mascot was derived. Over the years the program has accumulated fifty-nine state championships. In 2001 the girls' basketball team won the 4A State Basketball Championship and later in 2004 the boys' track team won the 3A State Championship and Class 3A Region 4 Championship. In 1967, Fort Lauderdale High School met Dillard High School in the season opener for both teams. This, along with another game in Broward County between Ely and McArthur the same night, was the first meeting between white and black teams. Prior to the game, the FLHS team members held their own practices as the coaches refused to hold practice due to an ongoing teacher strike. The current Athletic Director is Timothy 'TJ' Lawrence.  Demographics  As of 2011, the total student enrollment was 2,003. The ethnic makeup of the school was 54% Black, 30% White, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian or Pacific Islander, 3% Multiracial, and 1% Native American or Native Alaskan.Enrollment Counts For the 2017-2018 data reporting period, the student body has a 73% minority enrollment rate, which is the percentage of the student body belonging to all ethnic groups besides white (non-Hispanic). Approximately 69% of the student body qualified for free or reduced lunch, which is a proxy measure for structural economic disadvantage.

The Chato Santana version of El Diablo appeared in the 2016 Suicide Squad film set in the DC Extended Universe. Publication history The original version (Lazarus Lane) debuted in All-Star Western #2 (October 1970), and was created by Robert Kanigher and Gray Morrow. The character starred in a four issue mini-series published by DC Comics through their Vertigo imprint as a mature readers title; El Diablo #1 (March 2001) was written by Brian Azzarello and drawn by Danijel Zezelj. The second version (Rafael Sandoval) first appeared in El Diablo #1 (August 1989), and was created by Gerard Jones and Mike Parobeck. The third version (Chato Santana) first appeared in El Diablo #1 (September 2008) and was created by Jai Nitz, Phil Hester and Ande Parks. Fictional character biography =Lazarus Lane= Lazarus Lane is the original iteration of El Diablo, operating in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West. Lane was originally a bank teller who is nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a coma after being struck by lightning. After being revived by Native American shaman \\"Wise Owl\\", Lane becomes the vigilante El Diablo. The name El Diablo means \\"the devil\\" in Spanish. According to Jonah Hex vol. 2, #11 (Nov. 2006) and #24 (Dec. 2007), Lazarus Lane is cursed to be the host of a minor demon which acts as a Spirit of Vengeance. Lane's body slumbers in a coma while \\"El Diablo\\" roams the Earth. His fate is similar to that of the current Crimson Avenger. In Swamp Thing vol. 2, #85 (April 1989), Wise Owl is shown in a more villainous light, with Lane/El Diablo his unwilling servant. In that story, set in 1872, a number of DC's western heroes (including the aforementioned Hex, Bat Lash, Johnny Thunder, and Madame .44) were employed by Otto Von Hammer and Jason Blood to defeat Wise Owl and recover from him an object of great power, which turned out to be a crystal containing the spirit of Swamp Thing, who had become lost in time. When the group killed Wise Owl, Lane's comatose body woke up, and El Diablo apparently vanished forever. In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lazarus Lane appeared in a backup feature in All-Star Western. In this iteration, he was once again cursed by Wise Owl to become the host of a demon. Rather than being in a coma, Lazarus remains awake. However, El Diablo arises from his body whenever he is unconscious. =Rafael Sandoval= Rafael Sandoval was the second iteration created in 1989 by writer Gerard Jones and artist Mike Parobeck as a title set in the modern DC Universe. This title lasted 16 months. As created by Jones and Parobeck, Sandoval is a rookie member of the city council of Dos Rios, Texas who creates his version of El Diablo (from a festival costume and an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the Devil) after being stymied by officials while trying to pursue the case of a serial arsonist. Subsequent efforts involved battles with illicit drug smugglers using maquiladora covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios. Rafael Sandoval's character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the Justice League titles, in which he is possessed by the spirit of an Aztec god-emperor and takes on an appearance reminiscent of the Lazarus Lane Diablo. He also appears in the Villains United Special when he is pulled out of retirement by Oracle to serve in her de facto Justice League, whereupon he is attacked by a member of the Royal Flush Gang during a battle at the Enclave M prison in the Sonora Valley, Mexico. He is wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility. =Chato Santana= The current iteration of El Diablo is Chato Santana, an ex-criminal who after being hospitalized, meets a still living comatose Lazarus Lane. It is written by Jai Nitz, pencilled by Phil Hester, with inks by Ande Parks.Jai Nitz & Phil Hester - Introducing El Diablo, Newsarama, August 2, 2008 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Santana's El Diablo is a member of the Suicide Squad. He is later recruited into Checkmate under the leadership of Uncle Sam, until he realizes that he is being lied to and abandons them in search of the truth. In other media =Television= * The Lazarus Lane version of El Diablo appears in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Nestor Carbonell. While designed after his comic appearance, elements from Zorro's appearance were added in. Seen in the episode \\"The Once and Future Thing\\", he appears alongside Pow Wow Smith, Bat Lash, and Jonah Hex. * In the TV series Constantine, in the episode \\"The Saint of Last Resorts: Part Two\\", John gains the name \\"El Diablo\\" among the gangsters of Mexico City. * The Chato Santana version of El Diablo appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"TV Knight 2\\", with a costume similar to the movie Suicide Squad. =Film= Jay Hernandez played Chato Santana / El Diablo in the live- action 2016 film Suicide Squad. Unlike most of his Suicide Squad teammates, he is not a ruthless villain, having used his powers to establish himself as a gang leader before he destroyed his family home and killed his wife and two children in a moment of anger. He mourns his actions. Finally he uses his powers to save the rest of the team from Enchantress' minions thanks to Deadshot. El Diablo helps the Squad resist Enchantress's illusions of what they want most if they surrender. He sacrifices himself to defeat Enchantress's powerful brother, turning into his Aztec fire demon form to overpower and hold the enchantress's brother in the blast radius of a powerful military bomb. =Video games= * The Chato Santana incarnation of El Diablo appears in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. He is part of \\"The Squad\\" downloadable content. * The Chato Santana incarnation of El Diablo appears as a playable character in Suicide Squad: Special Ops. * The Chato Santana incarnation of El Diablo is mentioned in Injustice 2 during dialog between Deadshot and Atrocitus. =Web series= The Chato Santana version appears as a background student in DC Superhero Girls.

Gypsy's domestic happiness is short-lived, as some time after she has left the JLA, a vengeful Despero arrives at her home and murders her parents.

Rupture reveals that Gypsy's full name in the new continuity is Cynthia Mordeth, as she is Mordeth's daughter.Justice League of America's Vibe #7 (August 2013)  Powers and abilities  Gypsy's primary power is that of illusion casting, which allows her to blend into her background, effectively becoming invisible. It also allows her to adapt to rapidly changing backgrounds without betraying the illusion. She can camouflage both herself and someone in close proximity to her. In Gypsy's first appearance, only her shadow is shown from the Bunker's monitor, and she appears to teleport at the end of the issue. Gypsy's illusion-casting can also be used to project frightening illusions into the minds of other people. These illusions usually show what the affected person fears most. This ability can affect other living things besides people, and Gypsy can use this ability in combat situations. Gypsy has the ability to project an illusion to appear as another person, but that person needs to be her approximate height and weight for it to appear authentic. Gypsy's powers have evolved to the point that she can now cloak not only herself, but a moving vehicle and its passengers. Gypsy also has limited precognitive abilities and astral projection (able to project her spirit from her body). Aside from her powers, Gypsy is an expert in hand-to-hand combat. She's also an accomplished acrobat, able to leap high, run fast, swim, and execute unexpectedly quick martial arts tactics with relative ease. Gypsy also has a strong aptitude in electronics and computers, and has become skilled in the use of firearms. She has been trained by Bronze Tiger.

A professional artist and sculptor, Tessa is the lover and confidant of the series protagonist Duncan MacLeod, played by Adrian Paul, an immortal swordsman born centuries before in the Scottish Highlands. In the pilot episode \\"The Gathering,\\" Tessa is said to have been in a relationship with Duncan for twelve years already and the two co-own MacLeod and No√´l Antiques in the fictional city Seacouver, Washington. Alongside Duncan, she is a mentor and friend to young Richie Ryan. Highlander: The Series ran for six season from 1992-1998. A series regular, Vandernoot appeared in all season 1 episodes and the first four episodes of season 2. She then left the show in order to have more time for her family and other projects, not wishing to continue working with the show's heavy production schedule and obligations. She returned for guest appearances in the season two finale \\"Counterfeit\\" and the two-part series finale episodes \\"To Be\\" and \\"Not to Be\\" in 1998. The character of Tessa was popular with fans who praised her character's outspoken personality and her relationship with Duncan MacLeod. Her departure was criticized and protested by several. The series producers have noted in different interviews that the show became more cynical following Tessa's departure. Fictional biography Tessa No√´l is born on August 28, 1958 in Lille, France. When she is seven years old, she falls in love for the first time with then-nineteen-year-old Alan Rothwood (Anthony Head) and is \\"heart-broken\\" when he completes his studies and leaves the country., in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disc 7.

On April 1, 1980, while escaping an enemy, the immortal Duncan MacLeod leaps off a bridge and lands on a Bateau Mouche boat where Tessa is conducting a tour. Despite the interruption, Tessa finds Duncan charming and allows him to remain with the tour. The two meet afterward and begin dating. On the three year anniversary of when they first met, MacLeod reveals to Tessa that he was born in 1592 and, like a rare number of other humans, was born with an energy called the Quickening that made him ageless once he'd suffered a premature violent death (his First Death). Since then, he can only die if he is beheaded. MacLeod reveals this so Tessa can decide if she wants to continue their relationship. To his relief, she expresses compassion and empathy for the loneliness immortality must bring and is glad to now know the truth., in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disk 7. \\"I was just thinking how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die.\\"A flashback in \\"For Evil's Sake\\" shows Tessa working on a Bateau Mouche like this one in Paris.The two continue dating, though Tessa later openly worries that Duncan's immortality will one day separate them, either because she'll want someone younger or because she'll decide she wants someone who can grow older with her. As an immortal, MacLeod is sterile and Tessa resigns herself to having no children. In the episode \\"The Sea Witch,\\" Tessa becomes very fond of a four-year-old girl and muses, \\"For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But, she's not... I have my own life and it's more than enough.\\" At one point, Tessa tells Duncan, \\"I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine.\\" Duncan does not tell Tessa that an immortal may take the power and knowledge of another immortal they kill. For this reason, many hunt each other in the Game, believing \\"in the end, there can be only one\\" and that the last survivor will have the power of all immortals who ever lived. During their time together, Duncan occasionally defends himself from other immortals and kills them without Tessa knowing., in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disc 4. Eventually, the two open the antique shop MacLeod and No√´l Antiques in Seacouver, Washington. Their apartment is attached to the property and Tessa also maintains a studio there where she continues to create and sell art. In 1992, the immortal Slan Quince (Richard Moll) comes to the shop to challenge Duncan to a duel. He is immediately followed by Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert). After Slan flees to continue the battle another time, Duncan explains that Connor is from his clan and also immortal, born almost 90 years earlier. When Connor learned that another member of the Clan MacLeod had recovered from death, he found Duncan, taught him about immortals, and trained him in how to survive. Tessa then learns about the Game and that Duncan will repeatedly have to battle for his life against those immortals who desire more power., in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disk 1. The two discuss what this means for their relationship but Tessa decides to stay with Duncan. During this time, the two of them meet 17-year-old petty thief Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch), who learns from witnessing the MacLeods fight and behead Quince that they are immortals. Wanting to watch over the young man and believing he is not an inherent criminal but simply someone who needs guidance, Duncan and Tessa hire Richie to work in their shop, forging a friendship. \\"See No Evil\\" indicates Tessa was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris Now understanding how violent Duncan's world is, Tessa is an aid and confidant to his adventures. At times, she helps ground him. \\"You may be immortal, but you're not omnipotent... The world is not your responsibility.\\" in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disk 5. Hating violence and war, Tessa reluctantly concludes that it is now part of her life and sometimes all that will stop certain types of evil. At the same time, she takes no joy or satisfaction in the deaths of evil immortals or killers. To stop a serial killer, she strikes the man with her car, injuring him. Despite his crimes, Tessa asks for an ambulance rather than allow the man to suffer or die, and later feels guilty for her action, remarking, \\"I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this.\\" During all this, she continues to pursue her own career and is hired for high-profile projects. When Tessa witnesses the brutal murder of former artist Anne Wheeler, she becomes enraged when the police seem unwilling to do something and decides to investigate on her own., in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disk 4. During the investigation, MacLeod tells Tessa she is stronger than Anne and would be fine if he were to die. Tessa responds, \\"You only think so because it suits you.\\" The two eventually avenge Anne's death when the killer is revealed to be an immortal. Later on, Tessa is offered the position of curator of a traveling exhibition based in Paris, France. She decides to leave Seacouver, telling Duncan, \\"Remember. Paris is our city. I'll be waiting for you.\\" After battling another immortal, Duncan and Richie join Tessa in Paris. The three live on a barge MacLeod owns on the Seine near Notre Dame., in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disc 5 While in Paris, Tessa meets Amanda (Elizabeth Gracen), an immortal thief and former lover of Duncan's. Despite their tension and clashing views of life, the two women come to respect each other., Final Shooting Script, p. 20, in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disk 9. In another case, Tessa pushes aside her jealous of a former love of Duncan's when an ex- girlfriend named Grace needs his help. Once Duncan assures her he has no feelings still for Grace, Tessa remarks, \\"that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd expect you to do no less.\\", in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disk 6. MacLeod encounters Alfred Cahill (Martin Kemp), an immortal who recently discovered his true nature. Already suffering from mental illness, Cahill now believes he is an angel meant to free the world from sin. While MacLeod believes the only way to stop Cahill is to behead him, Tessa's argues, \\"Enlightened societies don't kill their insane. They treat them.\\" Cahill crosses paths with Tessa's childhood friend Elaine Trent (Sandra Nelson), who has became a prostitute since they last saw each other. Shocked at first, believing that Elaine threw away her potential, Tessa decides this is too harsh and she should not judge her friend. The two talk and reach a new understanding. Cahill later confronts Tessa, who sees how delusional he is when he insists he is the reincarnation of a Knight Templar. Seeing no other way to protest others from his delusion, MacLeod duels and kills Cahill. Elaine then leaves Paris without saying goodbye to Tessa, hoping to completely start her life over., in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disc 7 While still in Paris, the immortal Darius, an old friend of Duncan's, is murdered by mortals. Darius's belongings lead Duncan to learn that there is a secret organization called the Watchers who study and record the lives of immortals. A sub-group calling themselves Hunters now executes immortals so none will win the Game and gain enough power to rule humanity. After Duncan saves his friend Hugh Fitzcairn from the Hunters, he returns to Seacouver with Tessa and Richie. Soon afterward, Duncan meets the Watcher Joe Dawson who explains the rest of his organization is benevolent and sworn to not interfere with the lives of immortals or their loved ones. Weeks later, Richie meets a fortune teller named Greta (Traci Lords) who then experiences a psychic vision when she meets Tessa. She urges her to flee the city but Tessa isn't sure how seriously to take her. MacLeod recalls another fortune teller in 1848 who predicted he would love and bury many women, but marry none. Worried he may not have a chance later or may lose her first, MacLeod then asks Tessa to marry him and she agrees. The next day, Tessa is abducted by a Hunter named Pallin Wolf (Andrew Jackson) as bait for MacLeod. MacLeod finds them and kills Wolf, then sends Tessa home with Richie. On their way to the car, Tessa and Richie are mugged and shot dead by Marc Roszca, a drug addict wanting their money. As Tessa dies, Richie awakens, realizing what MacLeod had sensed since they first met: he is also immortal. Duncan's grief leads him to sell the antique shop and purchase a martial arts gym, relocating to a new apartment. Haunted by Tessa's death, he also treasures the time they spent together, telling Richie, \\"She was part of our lives, Richie. Never pretend she wasn't.\\", in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disk 2. Later, Richie remarks to MacLeod, \\"You can't get past it, Mac. I know. You've seen a lot of people die. But you had to be the hero, you sent us out to the car that night, you could have been there... You look me in the eyes and you tell me you don't blame yourself for her death.\\" MacLeod continues to occasionally think of Tessa throughout the series, sometimes missing her and sometimes believing she would have had a better life and would still be alive if they had never met. He is forced to confront his guilt and grief regarding Tessa when he meets a woman sharing her appearance in the second season two-part finale \\"Counterfeit.\\" In the two-part series finale episodes \\"To Be\\" and \\"Not To Be\\", MacLeod has a vision of a world in which he was never born. In this reality, Tessa has a husband and children but sacrificed creating art herself, believing it was just too difficult a career to pursue. Though she cares for her children, her marriage is empty and without passion, and she does not connect to her often-absent husband who sees no reason to encourage her art.Episodes \\"To Be\\" and \\"Not To Be\\", in Highlander: The Series (season 6) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2005). Character development and reception Executive producer William Panzer was intrigued by the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an immortal despite the drawbacks and possible dangers., Bonus Material, Bill Panzer's interview, in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001), disc 3. Panzer said creating interesting female characters in the Highlander franchise was often a challenge because the producers found it difficult to \\"have the women be something other than a victim, a hostage, other things when dealing with an immortal hero.\\"Bill Panzer, in , Bonus Material, Bill Panzer and David Abramowitz's interview, in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disk 2. In the script of \\"The Gathering,\\" Tessa is described as \\"a beautiful, elegantly casual woman, artist, free spirit, and proprietor of the most unusual antique shop in the city.\\", Final Shooting Script, p.1, in Highlander: The Series (season 1) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, Inc., 2001), disk 9. Because Highlander: The Series was an international co-production, the producers cast a French-speaking actor to play Tessa. Producer Gary Goodman explained that they wanted someone \\"that would be appealing on a television screen... in the sense that you were comfortable with her accent and her character.\\" They chose Belgian actress Alexandra Vandernoot because she \\"was able to be exotic, pretty and not so unfamiliar to an American audience that she was accepted.\\"Gary Goodman, in Vandernoot recalled, \\"I think I was quite close to Tessa. She was very well written, very easy to play and I wish I was like that. I'm not sure I'd like that but... it's very nice, you know, to play a character with nice feelings and nice emotions... very understanding, generous, supportive.\\"Alexandra Vandernoot, in Highlander: Counterfeit, Bonus Material, Interviews with Cast and Crew (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2004). Vandernoot got along with actors Adrian Paul (who played Duncan MacLeod) and Stan Kirsch (who played young Richie Ryan), but was not prepared for the long hours and months of filming a North American TV series, where a season includes often twice as many episodes or more as a European TV series. She adapted, later saying that filming the series was \\"exhausting but formative.\\" A native French speaker, Vandernoot worked with a dialect coach to help her with English, which she found \\"challenging.\\"Stan Kirsch, in Highlander: Counterfeit, Bonus material, Audio commentary (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2004). Vandernoot thought \\"the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself... because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. She trusted him entirely and he trusted her.\\" Producer Barry Rosen said, \\"We were very lucky that [Vandernoot and Kirsch] were so human-grounded, so we could really play off of them and the way they looked at things that [Duncan MacLeod] went through. They were also able to get into real-life situations, romances, getting in trouble, jealousies and so on.\\"Barry Rosen, in In the show, Tessa is in her mid 30s while Richie is just shy of his 18th birthday when they meet, leading to a relationship not unlike an older sister and younger brother. On set, Vandernoot was only three years older than Kirsh, but still jokingly treated him as a beloved younger brother because of his youthful appearance.Adrian Paul, in , Bonus Material, Adrian Paul's audio commentary, in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disc 3. Vandernoot and Paul created a strong on-screen relationship between their characters. David Abramowitz, creative consultant starting in the second season and later an executive producer on the show, said, \\"When I saw her and Adrian together, I thought that if I died, and there was a Mount Olympus, that the two of them would be standing together with thunderbolts around them. They were god-like. They were so beautiful and had such presence.\\"David Abramowitz, in Reviewer Rob Lineberger called Tessa \\"beautiful and spirited,\\" and said \\"she is the perfect mortal foil for MacLeod's heavy concerns. She lightens and strengthens him.\\" He added, \\"Together, they are a model couple. They have healthy banter, intense arguments, plenty of romance, and an easy comfort with each other.\\" Reviewer Abbie Bernstein of the Audio Video Revolution website wrote that Tessa was \\"depicted not as a screechy, in-the-dark Lois Lane but rather as a woman who handles her lover‚Äôs supernatural aspects with remarkable pragmatism.\\" Berstein added Tessa was \\"an unusually gutsy love interest (not to mention a refreshing sexually active heroine, as opposed to the coy 'sexual tension'-generating females who usually populate the genre).\\" Reviewer Gord Lacey of TVShowsOnDVD.com \\"found her rather annoying.\\" Reviewer Doug Anderson of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Tessa was \\"too arty and sympathetic to serve any purpose other than an emotional spur for the hero's vengeance.\\" Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post wrote that \\"Paul and Vandernoot don't look like typical American TV-style bimbos and hunks, and for good reason. They were cast to appeal internationally.\\" In 1993, Vandernoot wanted to leave the show because shooting Highlander was too demanding on her time, requiring her to spend several months each year in Canada when she wanted to spend more time with her family. According to Abramowitz, another reason was that \\"[Vandernoot] being a really strong actress wanted to play a more aggressive part in the show and sadly, the nature of the beast was that it couldn't happen [with Tessa] and she made a decision.\\"David Abramowitz, in , Bonus Material, Bill Panzer and David Abramowitz's interview, in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disc 2. The creative staff felt ways Tessa could be written out of the show were restricted because of the character's strong relationship with MacLeod. Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath said, \\"There was no way... to have a scene where she said, 'Okay, I'm going to go to Paris without you. Nice knowing you, MacLeod.'\\"Gillian Horvath, in The writers decided that the only solution was for Tessa to die, despite Abramowitz's feeling that her death was \\"heartbreaking.\\" Tessa's death occurred in the fourth episode of the second season, \\"The Darkness.\\" To surprise audiences and not make the death seem formulaic, the creative staff decided Tessa would die in a random mugging incident rather than be murdered by an enemy of MacLeod's or as part of the episode's main storyline. Horvath said \\"losing a loved one to a random act of violence is something that happens totally unexpectedly, at a moment that makes no sense dramatically\\". As originally written, Tessa's death scene shows MacLeod kneeling beside her and cradling her. Richie then revives from his fatal wounds and speaks with MacLeod., Final Shooting Script, p. 51-52, in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disk 8. During the filming of the episode, no dialog was recorded and the final broadcast version shown in North America did not show Richie revive. The European version showed Richie reviving, but not that he speaks to MacLeod. For the season finale \\"Counterfeit Part Two,\\" this scene reshot in Paris, this time including the dialog. However, this footage was not seen in the final broadcast version. The footage was eventually used in the season four episode \\"Leader of the Pack,\\" when Richie finds Tessa's killer., Bonus Material, Lost Scenes, in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disk 2. Lineberger wrote that \\"I was taken aback by the dark tone and emotional range generated by this episode. Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I cared about the characters as though I know them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death left me reeling.\\" Abramowitz said that Tessa's death strongly angered many viewers and \\"people hated me for killing her.\\"David Abramowitz, in There was further audience anger and criticism when in the episode immediately following, \\"Eye For An Eye,\\" MacLeod spends the night with an old lover, the immortal Annie Devlin. Abramowitz justified the scene saying \\"someone once told me that death was an aphrodisiac. It's a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life, that's 'seize life', is sex.\\", Bonus Material, Bill Panzer and David Abramowitz's interview, in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disk 2. In his review of \\"Eye For An Eye,\\" Lineberger wrote \\"This one caused an uproar‚Äî one I feel is justified... When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm. But the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers.\\" Adrian Paul also reported an angry reaction from the audience when the seventh episode of season two, \\"The Return of Amanda,\\" depicts MacLeod sleeping with Amanda less than a month after Tessa's death. Tessa's death was seen by fans as a turning point in Highlander: The Series. It marked the first time that a regular character died in the show and would be followed by others. Horvath recalled that \\"it changed the tone of the show. It made Highlander the show where you couldn't be positive that the characters were safe because they were in the credits.\\" Tessa's death also gave the show a pessimistic tone that influenced the remaining characters. Lineberger said, \\"Richie and Duncan relate to each other differently from now on, and Duncan is bereft of much of his joy [and] moodier as well. Tessa is no longer around to lighten him.\\" Tessa remained extremely popular with the audience after her death, prompting the producers to develop the season two finale episode \\"Counterfeit\\" to bring her back in some way, at least temporarily.Bill Panzer, in , Bonus Material, Bill Panzer's interview, in Highlander: The Series (season 2) (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2003), disk 7. According to actor Stan Kirsch, Vandernoot did not realize her, or her character's, popularity before attending conventions. Adrian Paul said Vandernoot was surprised her character had so much influence on the show.Adrian Paul, in Highlander: Counterfeit, Bonus material, Audio commentary (DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2004). In the two-part finale to series two, \\"Counterfeit\\" (1994), Vandervoort returned as the character Lisa Halle, a woman who undergoes plastic surgery and vocal training so she can resemble Tessa in voice and appearance. Pretending to be Lisa Millon, a French artist with a striking resemblance to Tessa, she lures MacLeod into a false sense of security so his enemies can attack him when he's vulnerable. While playing Lisa, Vandervoort sometimes spoke with the character's \\"real\\" voice rather than the voice the villain used to imitate Tessa. This was achieved using automated dialogue replacement during post-production, with actor Meilani Paul providing Lisa's true voice.Don Paonessa, in Fans and critics enjoyed Vandervoort's return and she enjoyed playing a different type of character. Adrian Paul said Lisa Halle was fun for Vandervoort \\"to play a different character which was similar to Tessa but also had an evil intent to her.\\" Reviewing \\"Counterfeit\\", David M. Gutierrez of DVDVerdict.com wrote that \\"despite the fact that the having an exact twin of Tessa's pop up is flatly ludicrous, it plays out due to MacLeod's desire to have Tessa back overriding his sense of reason... [Vandernoot] looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range.\\" Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com said \\"a visit from Tessa in 'Counterfeit,' even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan a moment or two to reflect on his recent lost love.\\" References External links *Alexandra Vandernoot at the Wolf 359 Convention, Unofficial report, archived on February 26, 2005 by the Internet Archive, last accessed October 6, 2007 Category:Female characters in television Category:Highlander (franchise) characters Category:Fictional artists Category:Television characters introduced in 1992 Category:Fiction set in the 20th century ","title":"Tessa No√´l"},{"id":"2192118","text":"F√ºrstenberg-Wolfach was a county in western Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany during the Middle Ages.

January 29, 1783 ‚Äì January 19, 1840) was a soldier, educator, politician, Republic of Texas Senator, and revolutionary. Early life and family Ruiz was born in San Antonio de Bexar in the interior province of Spanish Texas, to Juan Manuel Ruiz and Mar√≠a Manuela de la Pe√±a. Appointed the first schoolmaster of San Antonio in 1803, he designated as the first school a house acquired by his father, on Military Plaza. This house was carefully reconstructed in 1943 and moved to the grounds of the Witte Museum, where it is still used for educational purposes. In 1805 Ruiz became a city councilman, or regidor, in San Antonio. He served in various official capacities including city attorney, or procurador. Military career Ruiz began a long military career in 1811, joining the Bexar Provincial Militia with the rank of lieutenant. He joined the Republican Army at Bexar and took part in failed revolution from Spain in 1813, fighting at the battle of Medina on August 18. Forced into exile from Texas until 1822, Ruiz returned after Mexico won its independence from Spain. He was ordered by the Mexican government to make attempts at peace with the hostile Native American tribes of the North, the Comanches and the Lipan Apaches. Appointed to the mounted militia upon his return, he successfully led a peace treaty delegation of Lipan Apache to Mexico City later in 1822. The next year, Ruiz received a promotion to army captain, unassigned, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, receiving confirmation of his commission in 1825. He was sent to Nacogdoches in December 1826 to help put down the Fredonian Rebellion, receiving command of that detachment in April of the next year.Bernice Strong, \\"RUIZ, JOSE FRANCISCO,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed October 13, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Ruiz was a member of the Comisi√≥n de L√≠mites (Boundary Commission), which was assigned to explore areas of Texas following the Adams-On√≠s Treaty of 1819. This commission left Mexico City on November 10, 1827, under the command of General Manuel de Mier y Ter√°n. Ruiz returned to Bexar in 1828, where he commanded the famed Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras, which established Fort Tenoxtitl√°n in 1830. In the fall of 1828, Ruiz led the Mier y Teran group of 30 Mexican soldiers and commission members, including naturalist Jean-Louis Berlandier, on a bear and buffalo hunt on open lands northwest of San Antonio, with the cooperation of local Comanche leaders Reyuna and El Ronca. From November 19 to December 18, Ruiz and a military party explored the silver mines on the San Saba River. During this time, he wrote his Report on the Indian Tribes of Texas in 1828, preserved in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University. An insight into the trust Ruiz garnered with the Indian tribes of Texas can be found in the Shawnee tribe's reference to him as \\"a good man no lie and a friend of the Indians.\\" Ruiz retired from the military at the end of 1832. Texas politician Ruiz allied himself with the Texas Revolution in 1835 and traveled to Washington-on-the-Brazos in late February 1836, as a delegate to the Convention of 1836. There on March 2, 1836, Ruiz, along with his nephew Jos√© Antonio Navarro, signed the Texas Declaration of Independence - the only native Texans among the fifty-nine men to sign this historic document. During the revolution he was an outspoken supporter of independence, and he eloquently wrote to his family, \\"Under no circumstance take sides against the Texans, for only God will return the territory of Texas to the Mexican government.\\" Later life and family Ruiz's son Francisco Antonio Ruiz, San Antonio mayor or alcalde, at the time, was an important eyewitness to the Battle of the Alamo, having been placed under house arrest at his San Antonio home by Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna and later forced by the Mexican dictator to identify the bodies of the deceased after the battle. Jos√© Francisco Ruiz represented the Bexar district as its Senator in the 1st Congress of the Republic of Texas. He died in 1840 and was buried in his beloved San Antonio.

It flows south-eastward out of the Douglas Ranges of the Coast Mountains, draining into the Harrison River. Though the river's valley is heavily logged--earlier in the 20th century the area was covered by a dense network of logging railways--the river itself flows through a small canyon before a short relatively flat stretch leading to its confluence with the Harrison. The Chehalis is a fishing stream and, together with its tributaries such as Statlu Creek, offers opportunities for class III and IV whitewater kayaking. The Chehalis River starts in the mountains above and just west of Statlu Lake, which it soon flows into. Shortly after exiting the lake, it drops over impressive Statlu Falls, which is difficult to view without putting yourself in real danger.Waterfalls of the Pacific Northwest: Statlu Falls People have died when they have slipped and fallen over the falls. After the falls, the river turns south, eventually flowing into Chehalis Lake. After it exits the lake it continues its journey south to the Harrison River. The river's canyon and the peaks and cliff-faces of the range encircling its basin, which comprises most of the area of the Douglas Ranges, is popular with rock-climbers and hikers, who call the area \\"the Chehalis\\". There is a small ski resort, Hemlock Valley, on the eastern side of the Chehalis River basin. A road penetrates the northeast rim of the range into the Harrison Lake basin and on to historic Port Douglas, at the head of that lake, and beyond up the Lillooet River via Skookumchuck Hot Springs to Pemberton-Mount Currie.

Overview 440 meters long and 42 meters wide, the Cours Mirabeau is one of the most popular and lively places in the town. It is lined with many caf√©s, one of the most famous being Les Deux Gar√ßons and during its history frequented by famous French cultural figures such as Paul C√©zanne, √âmile Zola and Albert Camus. The street has wide sidewalks planted with double rows of plane-trees. The Cours Mirabeau is decorated by fountains, the most notable of which is the Fontaine de la Rotonde , a large fountain that makes up a roundabout at one end of the street. The street also divides Aix into two portions, the Quartier Mazarin, or \\"new town\\", which extends to the south and west, and the Ville comtale, or \\"old town\\", which lies to the north with its wide but irregular streets and its old mansions dating from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. History From 1646 onwards, rich locals started moving into the Mazarin quarter, built by Michele Mazzarino (1605 - 1648), known as \\"Michel Mazarin\\", the Dominican who was appointed Archbishop of Aix-en- Provence in 1645 by Pope Innocent X. Mazzarino had been professor of theology at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome, and Master of the Sacred Palace under Pope Urban VIII in 1642. Mazzarino was also the brother of Giulio Mazzarino, known as \\"Jules Mazarin\\" who served as chief minister under Louis XIV of France.Hotels, mansions, Aix en Provence history - Tourism France In 1650, the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence commissioned the building of a thoroughfare for carts where there was a crumbled rampart. The idea was for it to become the new place of dalliance for Aix dwellers, instead of the place des Pr√™cheurs. The thoroughfare cost 100,000 pounds, and was paid for by property buyers, the town (15,000 pounds), Provence communes (20,000 livres) and Louis, Duke of Vend√¥me. A long enclosure closed off by ramparts, town houses were gradually built on each side. A balustrade would look to fields and gardens downwards. By 1696 four fountains had been built : Fontaine des 9 canons, Fontaine \\"Moussue, Fontaine du Roi Ren√© and, to the west, \\"les Chevaux-Marins\\", now vanished. Whilst he first thought of building a palace there, the Duke of Vend√¥me came around and decided on the 'wildness of fields'. Instead he commissioned the Pavillon Vend√¥me, where he died in 1669. His son, Louis Joseph de Vend√¥me (1654‚Äì1712), sold their part of the Cours Mirabeau back to Pierre de Creissel, who sold it again to four buyers, thus dividing it into four town houses. In 1876, Patrice de Mac-Mahon (1808-1893) signed a decree for it to be named after Honor√© Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau.

It corresponds temporally to the first volume of Nin's published diaries, written between October 1931 and October 1932, yet is radically different, in that that book begins with a description of the landscape of and around her home and never mentions her husband, whereas Henry and June begins with discussion of Nin's sex life and is full of her struggles and passionate relationship with husband Hugo, and then, as the novel/memoir progresses, other lovers. This, the first of currently five volumes of unexpurgated diaries, concentrates on her passionate involvement with the writer Henry Miller and his wife June Miller. Nin's source material‚Äîher diaries‚Äîwas able to spawn two dramatically different narratives about the same time period, both widely read and praised. The expurgated diary reveals Nin the philosopher and amateur but astute psychologist. The unexpurgated diary reveals a woman breaking out into wild sexual discovery. It is introduced by her second‚Äîbigamous‚Äîhusband. A film based on the book was released in 1990.  Plot  At the end of 1931, Nin finds herself dissatisfied with being a timid, faithful wife to her banker husband, Hugh Parker Guiler. Nin and her husband contemplate the possibility of opening their relationship, and determine that it would threaten their marriage. However, when Anais meets June Miller, she is magnetically drawn to her and perceives June to be the most beautiful and charismatic woman she has ever met. Nin pursues an extremely intense, ambiguous, sexually charged friendship with her. When June leaves, Nin becomes involved with Henry, and begins an uninhibited sexual and emotional affair with him, which prompts an intellectual and sensual awakening. A friendship is formed between the two that was maintained throughout both artist's lives.  Adaptations  The book was later filmed as Henry & June directed by Philip Kaufman, with Fred Ward as Henry, Uma Thurman as June, and Maria de Medeiros as Ana√Øs Nin. The movie, released in 1990, is notable as the first film to be released in the United States with an NC-17 rating. The same year the book was also adapted into a film as The Room of Words (), a low-budget Italian production directed by Franco Mol√©.

The stalls could be found not only in Central, but also in Wan Chai and the peripheries of Happy Valley Racecourse around Wong Nai Chung Road. In fact, the fire at the racecourse in 1918 was caused by food stalls set beside the podium.Lai, Kam- biu, Bill, \\"Policy analysis and policy windows: fire fighting policy in Hong Kong\\" , Appendix V, University of Hong Kong, 1999 There were also stalls assembled by wharf piers, which formed the so-called Waisik Matau (ÁÇ∫È£üÁ¢ºÈ†≠ lit. \\"Gluttonous Pier\\"), to serve ferry passengers. After World War II came to an end in 1945, the colonial Hong Kong government issued ad hoc licenses to families of deceased and injured civil servants, allowing them to operate food stalls in public and thereby earn a living. This type of license was physically considerably larger than the ones normally issued, as a photograph of the licensee was required to appear on them. The licence, therefore, was jocularly called \\"dai pai\\" (big license) by the locals. From then on, the \\"big license stalls\\" began to flourish on every busy street and lane in Hong Kong. A dai pai dong selling congee on Yiu Tung Street, Sham Shui Po, in 2005. However, dai pai dong soon became the cause of traffic congestion and hygiene problems, and some licensees even began to let out their stalls on the black market. In response, the government stopped issuing new \\"big licenses\\" in 1956, and limited their transfer. The licences could no longer be inherited, and could only be passed on to spouses upon the licensee's death. If the licensee did not have a spouse, the licence would simply expire. Since 1975, many dai pai dong have been moved into temporary markets, like the ones on Haiphong Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, or into cooked food centres, usually located in municipal services complexes managed by the Urban Council, for easier control. To improve worsening public hygiene, the government began to buy back \\"big licenses\\" from the license-holders in 1983. Since most of the licensees were aged, and the licenses are only legally transferable to their spouses, many of the licensees were willing to return their licenses for compensation. Since then, the number of traditional dai pai dong has declined rapidly. Today, most dai pai dong survive by operating in cooked food centers, while the more successful ones have reinvented themselves as air-conditioned restaurants (some of them keep their original stalls operating at the same time, like Lan Fong Yuen (Ëò≠Ëä≥Âúí) in Gage Street, Central). It was reported that revenues of dai pai dong increased considerably in 2003 when Hong Kong was plagued by SARS; as people regarded air-conditioned places as hotbeds of the virus and patronised open-air and sun-lit stalls instead.Ming Pao, A6, 31 July 2005. Features Milk tea and a bowl of instant noodle with pig liver, served at a dai pai dong on Yiu Tung Street, Sham Shui Po. *One can tailor dishes on the menu to their liking, such as asking for a non-spicy variation. *The Hong Kong Local dishes are in large portions, cheap and tasty. It is part of the Hong Kong people's collective memory. *It is customary to have to share tables with complete strangers when there is a shortage of seating. *Some of the dai pai dong have problems with hygiene and upkeep, for example, rickety tables and stools, battered metal pots and bamboo chopsticks, and unappetizingly slick floors. *As dai pai dong is set up by four canvas stands, all one-storey tall, into the road it is better to add a cover, prevent some stuff dropped while people eating. *Many dishes are cooked in a wok over a large flame. Chefs cook quickly and utilise stir-frying techniques to mix flavours and ingredients speedily. *Unlike cha chaan teng, most dai pai dong do not provide set meals. *\\"Cross-stall ordering\\" is possible: for instance, when one is sitting and eating in a stall selling noodles, he or she can order a cup of milk tea from another stall, which may be several stalls away. *The stalls can be roughly divided into those operating in daytime and those doing business at night. The dai pai dong which operate at night usually sell seafood and other more costly dishes: one dish usually costs from HKD$40‚Äì70. The day-time dai pai dong, on the contrary, provide cheap food including: **Congee and youtiao (aka yau cha kwai); **Milk tea, toasts, sandwiches and instant noodles with ham, egg, luncheon meat or sausage; **rice or noodles with siu mei (ÁáíÂë≥ roasted meats); **fried rice and dip tau fan (Á¢üÈ†≠È£Ø rice plates); **Chiuchow-style noodles (ÊΩÆÂ∑ûÁ≤âÈ∫µ). Preservation In May 2005, the existence of dai pai dong in Hong Kong caught considerable public attention, as Man Yuen Noodles, a dai pai dong selling noodles in Central, faced imminent closure due to the death of the licensee. The news came after the closure of a bakery notable for its egg tarts, also located in Central and forced to close because of the rise of rent. Despite calls for its preservation by many locals, including some politicians, the stall was closed on 30 July 2005. The Hong Kong government was criticised for not trying its best to preserve dai pai dong as part of the Hong Kong culture. The news of the closure coincided with the government's proposal of the development of West Kowloon Cultural District. The bakery reopened in October 2005. Ê≥∞ÊòåÂæ©Ê•≠ Ë≤∑Êíª‰∫∫ÈæçÂÜçÁèæ, Sina.com, 1 October 2005. The stall unexpectedly reopened at a nearby shop on 1 December 2005. Ê∞ëÂúíÈ∫µÂÆ∂ÂèàËø´ÈÅ∑Ôºü, Apple Daily, 10 October 2006.

He was a member of the Alberta New Democratic Party for the district of Athabasca-Lac La Biche. Piquette is largely remembered for what would come to be known as the \\"Piquette Affair.\\" On April 7, 1987, Piquette attempted to ask a question in French in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Speaker David J. Carter twice prevented him from asking the question, ruling that English was the only language permitted in the legislature. Piquette appeared before a special hearing of the legislature's Election and Privilege Committee to argue the legislature had a duty to let members speak both English and French. He relied on section 110 of the Northwest Territories Act, which provided that members of the Northwest Territories legislature could use both English and French in debates. Piquette reasoned that the Act (which governed the territory that contained Alberta before Alberta became a province in 1905) had never been repealed, and was still in effect. The incident sparked two rallies at the legislature in April and December 1987, where hundreds of francophones from across Alberta demonstrated in support of francophone language rights. In February 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in R. v. Mercure, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234. The Court ruled that s. 110 continued in force in both Saskatchewan and Alberta but also held that the legislatures of those provinces could unilaterally modify these language rights. The Alberta Legislature responded by allowing members to speak in French, but only if they provided the Speaker with a written translation of their comments, in advance. After his electoral defeat in 1989, L√©o Piquette stayed active in the francophone community and provincial politics. In 1994, he helped pioneer francophone education in Alberta after the Alberta government granted francophone parents the right to francophone schools. He became a school board member of the Conseil Scolaire Centre-Est in 1994 and was Chair of the Board until 2004 when he was elected as President of the F√©d√©ration des Conseils Scolaires de l'Alberta. He was also a founding member and President of the Chambre √âconomique de l'Alberta.

Along with his contemporary New York critics Richard Aldrich, Henry Finck, W.J. Henderson, and James Huneker, he was part of the first generation of American critics to establish a uniquely American school of criticism. A critic with a strong bend towards empiricism, he frequently sought out first hand experiences, accounts and primary sources when writing; drawing his own conclusions rather than looking to what other writers had already written. A meliorist, Krehbiel believed that the role of criticism was largely to support music that uplifted the human spirit and intellect, and that criticism should serve not only as a means of taste making but also as a mode to educate the public. His book How to Listen to Music (in print from 1896 to 1924) was widely used as an instructional guide by the music consuming public in the United States during the last years of the 19th century and first several decades of the 20th century. As a critic he was particularly complimentary of German romanticism, and was a great admirer and promoter in the United States of Beethoven, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Schumann, and especially Richard Wagner and his musical theories. He was a close friend and admirer of the conductor Anton Seidl who greatly enhanced his appreciation for Wagner and his music, and whose work he gave his most complimentary reviews. He was not so complimentary to Wagner's main successors: Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler, and was also critical towards French impressionism and works of the Italian school. Krehbiel was a champion of the music of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k whom he hoped would help establish an authentically American school of music when Dvo≈ô√°k was appointed head of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City in 1892. Already an admirer of folk music, Krehbiel was inspired by Dvo≈ô√°k's work as a folk song collector and composer, and spent many years researching and collecting folk songs from Americans and immigrants. He collected the folk songs of Magyars, Scandinavians, Russians, Native Americans, and African Americans. This work resulted in numerous publications, including the first book published on African-American spirituals Afro-American folksongs: a study in racial and national music (1914). He also served as annotator for the programs of the concerts by the New York Philharmonic, and translated several German opera libretti for performance or publication in English. He also translated Alexander Wheelock Thayer's seminal three volume German language biography on Beethoven for its 1921 English language publication. Thayer had left a planned fourth volume unwritten at the time of his death, and Krehbiel wrote a fourth volume to complete the series in his final years. It was published posthumously in 1925 for the second publishing of his English translation. Biography Krehbiel was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1854, the son of a German clergyman of the Methodist Episcopal Church. A first generation American, he was educated by his father, and grew up in a bilingual household speaking, reading, and writing in both German and English. He later mastered the French, Italian, Russian, and Latin languages. In 1864 his family moved to Cincinnati where his father took up the post of clergymen at a Methodist Church. There, Henry became the conductor of the church's choir while just a youth. In 1872 he began the study of law in Cincinnati, Ohio. In June, 1874, he was attached to the staff of the Cincinnati Gazette where he began his career as a writer on sports and crime, reporting mainly on baseball games and murders. He quickly progressed to reporting on music events, and remained with the paper in that post until November 1880. He then went to New York, where he joined the staff of The New York Tribune, initially as a journalist attached to the city desk who occasionally wrote editorials. As in Cincinnati, he quickly progressed to covering music events and rapidly rose to post of musical editor. He became an influential music critic, writing many articles for the Tribune, Scribner's Monthly, and other journals. In researching his articles, he would often seek out first hand experiences, and do his own unique research exhuming primary sources. For example, when writing on Wagner's Die Meistersinger, he traveled to Nuremberg, and when writing on cantorial chant, he attended synagogues. Krehbiel wrote many books about various aspects of music, including Afro- American folksongs: a study in racial and national music (1914); one of the earliest examinations of African American music. His interest in the music was African-Americans dates back to his attendance of World's Columbian Exposition where he was enthralled with performances of music by black musicians at the Midway Plaisance. He annotated concert programs (including many of Paderewski's recitals). The Impresario toured the United States in 1921. Krehbiel translated some opera libretti, including: Nicolai's Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor (1886), Paderewski's Manru (1902), and Mozart's Der Schauspieldirektor (1916). (Dates given are the first performance of the English translation.) When Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte was performed for the first time in the US, in 1922, it was in a new English version with a text by Krehbiel.Aldrich, Richard. \\"Henry Edward Krehbiel\\", Music & Letters, July 1923, pp. 266‚Äì268 He also translated the three volume German language biography of Beethoven written by Alexander Wheelock Thayer, for its first English language publication in 1921. A fourth volume had been planned but was left uncompleted by Thayer at the time of his death in 1897. Krehbiel penned his own fourth volume numbering 1,137 pages which was included in the 1925 republication of his English language translation. Krehbiel was a strong supporter of music by Wagner, Brahms, Dvo≈ô√°k,Krehbiel, Henry Edward. Afro- American Folksongs: A Study in Racial and National Music: 6-7 and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky when they were not yet well known in America. He detested French music, and together with his assistant, Richard Aldrich, he waged a continuing campaign against it.Brody, Elaine. \\"Vive La France: Gallic Accents in American Music from 1880 to 1914\\", The Musical Quarterly, vol. 65, no. 2, 1979, pp. 200‚Äì211 After Debussy's La mer was introduced in the US in 1907, Krehbiel wrote: It caused some amusement when after Debussy's work became a staple of the orchestral repertoire Krehbiel felt obliged write in 1922 that La mer was \\"a poetic work in which Debussy has so wondrously caught the rhythms and colors of the seas.\\"Leary and Smith, p. 135 He was also highly critical of Gustav Mahler, both as a conductor and composer, once describing him as \\"a prophet of the ugly\\", and attacked Strauss for embracing hedonist themes in his works which he viewed as an amoral subject that did not uplift humanity as great music should. When Krehbiel died in March 1923, still in post as critic of The New York Tribune, Aldrich wrote in a tribute that Krehbiel had been \\"the leading musical critic of America\\" who raised musical criticism to an eminence it had never previously enjoyed in the US.

(UK: Nostalgia) is a 1983 Soviet-Italian drama film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and starring Oleg Yankovsky, Domiziana Giordano, and Erland Josephson. Tarkovsky co-wrote the screenplay with Tonino Guerra.At one point, Domenico questions mathematics, displaying that \\"1+1‚â†2\\" with two drops of olive oil. This is a reference to one of Guerra's collaborations with Michelangelo Antonioni, Red Desert. The film depicts a Russian writer (Oleg Yankovsky) who visits Italy to carry out research about an 18th-century Russian composer, but is stricken by homesickness. The film utilizes autobiographical elements drawn from Tarkovsky's own experiences visiting Italy, and explores themes surrounding nostalgia and the untranslatability of art and culture. The film won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, the prize for Best Director and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. It received generally positive reviews from critics. The film received nine total votes in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made. Plot The Russian writer Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) travels to Italy to research the life of 18th-century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, who lived there and committed suicide after his return to Russia.Sosnovsky is modeled on Ukrainian composer Maksym Berezovsky. He and his comely interpreter Eugenia travel to a convent in the Tuscan countryside, to look at frescoes by Piero della Francesca. Andrei decides at the last minute that he does not want to enter. Back at their hotel Andrei feels displaced and longs to go back to Russia, but unnamed circumstances seem to get in the way. Eugenia is smitten with Andrei and is offended that he will not sleep with her, claiming that she has a better boyfriend waiting for her. Andrei meets and befriends a strange man named Domenico (Erland Josephson), who is famous in the village for trying to cross through the waters of a mineral pool with a lit candle. He claims that when finally achieving it, he will save the world. They both share a feeling of alienation from their surroundings. Andrei later learns that Domenico used to live in a lunatic asylum until the post-fascistic state closed them and now lives in the street. He also learns that Domenico had a family and was obsessed in keeping them inside his house in order to save them from the end of the world, until they were freed by the local police after seven years. Before leaving, Domenico gives Andrei his candle and asks him if he will cross the waters for him with the flame. During a dream-like sequence, Andrei sees himself as Domenico and has visions of his wife, Eugenia and the Mary as being all one and the same. Andrei seems to cut his research short and plans to leave for Russia, until he gets a call from Eugenia, who wishes to say goodbye and tell him that she met Domenico in Rome by chance and that he asked if Andrei has walked across the pool himself as he promised. Andrei says he has, although that is not true. Eugenia is with her boyfriend, but he seems uninterested in her and appears to be involved in dubious business affairs. Later, Domenico delivers a speech in the city about the need of mankind of being true brothers and sisters and to return to a simpler way of life. Finally, he plays the fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth and immolates himself. Meanwhile, Andrei returns to the mineral pool in Bagno Vignoni (Val d'Orcia) to fulfill his promise, only to find that the pool has been drained. He enters the empty pool and repeatedly attempts to walk from one end to the other without letting the candle extinguish. As he finally achieves his goal, he collapses.

It was to be filmed in Italy with the support of Mosfilm, with most of the dialogue in Italian. The film was in pre-production as far back as 1980. Initially the film was titled Viaggio in Italia (Voyage to Italy), but since there was already the film Journey to Italy (1954) by Roberto Rossellini, starring Ingrid Bergman, that already bore that name, they searched for something else, eventually deciding upon Nostalghia. When Mosfilm support was withdrawn, Tarkovsky used part of the budget provided by Italian State Television and French film company Gaumont to complete the film in Italy and cut some Russian scenes from the script, while recreating Russian locations for other scenes in Italy. Luciano Tovoli was considered for director of photography, although ultimately Giuseppe Lanci shot the film, though Tovoli would take that role in Tarkovsky‚Äôs 1982 documentary Tempo di Viaggio, or Voyage in Time. Donatella Baglivo filmed a ninety minute documentary on the making of the film titled Andrei Tarkovsky in Nostalghia (1984), providing a fascinating glimpse into the making of the film, including interviews with cast and crew. =Casting= Anatoly Solonitsyn was initially cast as Andrei Gorchakov, but died from cancer in 1982, forcing Tarkovsky to seek a new protagonist, eventually deciding upon Oleg Yankovsky who had appeared in his previous film The Mirror'. =Locations= Several scenes of the film were set in the countryside of Tuscany and northern Lazio; as the Abbey of San Galgano, the spas of Bagno Vignoni, the Orcia Valley, in the Province of Siena, the mysterious crypt of the Chiesa di San Pietro (Tuscania) and the flooded Church of Santa Maria in San Vittorino of Cittaducale, in the Province of Rieti.Filming locations of Nostalghia at the Internet Movie Database =Style= Similarly to Tarkovsky's previous films, Nostalghia utilizes long takes, dream sequences, and minimal story. Of his use of dream sequences, to the question asked by Gian Luigi Rondi: ‚ÄúA realism of dream, like that of Mirror?‚Äù Tarkovsky answered: ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt 'realism' on the one hand, and on the other hand (in contrast, in contradiction) 'dreams.' We spend a third of our life asleep (and thus dreaming): what is there that is more real than dreams?‚Äù Tarkovsky spoke of the profound form of nostalgia which he believes is unique to Russians when traveling abroad, comparing it to a disease, \\"an illness that drains away the strength of the soul, the capacity to work, the pleasure of living\\", but also, \\"a profound compassion that binds us not so much with our own privation, our longing, our separation, but rather with the suffering of others, a passionate empathy.\\" Tarkovsky's goal in Nostalghia, in terms of style, was to portray the soul, the memory, of Italy, of which it felt to him being there. When he visited Italy to begin studying the project of Nostalghia with Tonino Guerra, as they visited cities Tonino would show him Renaissance architecture, art, monuments, and he admired them, and would take notes, but what struck him the most was the sky, the blue sky, black sky, with clouds, with the sun, at dawn, at noon, in the evening. A sky, he said, is always simply just that, but a change in the hour of the day, the wind, climate, can have it speak to you in a different way, with love, violence, longing, fear, etc. Cinema, he said, can give these \\"ways\\" back to you and that it must, with courage, and honest, always starting from the real. According to Tarkovsky, while shooting the film he realized that he would be able to express \\"something distinctive\\", which he believed he couldn't in his previous films ‚Äì for only then he had become aware that \\"a film can make the inner life of its author visible\\", and, thereby, he \\"expanded into [himself].\\" Music The film features music by Ludwig van Beethoven, and Giuseppe Verdi (Requiem), as well as Russian folk songs. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is featured both during Andrei's visit at Domenico's home and during his demonstration in Rome. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times said that Tarkovsky \\"may well be a film poet but he's a film poet with a tiny vocabulary. [...] Nothing happens.\\" Dave Kehr was mildly positive, considering it to be \\"packed with imagery that seems at once hopelessly obscure and crushingly obvious\\" while also arguing that the work \\"does succeed in inducing some kind of trance.\\" The film won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, the prize for Best Director and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called Grand Prix du cin√©ma de creation with Robert Bresson. Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the Palme d'Or, a fact that hardened Tarkovsky's resolve to never work in the Soviet Union again. It is today one of Tarkovsky's lesser-known works. In 2010, scholar Thomas Redwood wrote that \\"critics on the whole have tended to ignore the film. Relatively little has been written about Nostalghia and even less has been understood of it.\\" Nostalghia has an approval rating of 86% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews, and an average rating of 8.22/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Nostalgia demands patience -- and rewards the investment with a hypnotic viewing experience that finds Tarkovsky in gratifyingly uncompromising form..

The film's title was chosen as Kilukkam, since the character of Nandini is introduced in the film with the clink of her anglets when she jump off a train and she is all perky like a kilukkampetti (a toy box that makes clinking sound). The story of a girl who has to face some miseries in her lifeit was the idea Priyadarshan initially intended for the film. While working on the story he met director Fazil and discussed the idea. Fazil at the time was directing Ente Sooryaputhrikku (1991). He told Priyadarshan to \\"reverse think\\" the story of Ente Sooryaputhrikku, which was about a girl trying to find her mother. And in Kilukkam it became, a girl trying to find her father. Mohanlal, who is the usual choice of Priyadarshan was the protagonist in mind from the initial stage itself. Amala who was acting in Priyadarshan's Telugu film Nirnayam at the time, was signed for the role of Nandini. She gave dates from 3 March 1991 to 4 April. Priyadarshan's initial chose for Nischal was Sreenivasan, but he was unavailable during his scheduled date due to another commitment. Hence, Priyadarshan opted for Jagathy Sreekumar, to whom he asked 30 days continuous dates. Sreekumar, at the time, busy acting in multiple films at a time, gave his continuous dates for a long period for the first time. The film's pooja function was held at Kothandapani Studio in Madras (now Chennai). The recording of songs started at the same day in the studio by S. P. Venkatesh. By the time of commencement of filming, Amala got married and had to opt out from the film as her father-in-law Akkineni Nageswara Rao announced her retirement soon after that. She was replaced by Revathi. Jagadish played a pivotal character in the film as a still photographer, the professional rivalry of Nischal, but in the final cut of the film, his portions were cut short to a minor role for reducing the running time. =Filming= The Fernhills Palace in Ooty was a major location. It was shot as Justice Pillai's bungalow. Principal photography began in March 1991 in Ooty, which was the main location where the film is set. In Ooty, The Fernhills Palace was the central location, which was shot as the bungalow of Justice Pillai, played by Thilakan. The mist is utilised in the film to the maximum. The major part of the filming took place early in the morning because the mist lasted for a couple of hours only and the makers wanted to capitalise the mist-covered location. One of the initial scenes in the film, where Mohanlal and Thilakan takes morning walks, are shot in a secluded location in Ooty that was accidentally discovered by the team. They wanted the place to look classy and so the lamp post, a couple of chairs and all those fallen leaves. They painted leaves were brought to the location in a lorry and were scattered to resemble natural foliage. While filming the song \\"Ootyppattanam\\", Mohanlal escaped from what would have been a fatal injury. A sequence in the song was shot over the top of a moving train, where Mohanlal was standing opposite Jagathi and Revathy. There was a leaning electric line over the train passage, which the production team did not notice. While performing, all of a sudden, Sreekumar instructed Mohanlal to lie low, which he immediately obeyed without questioning. The line just touched his hair. In a later interview, Priyadarshan said that, he never laughed while filming Kilukkam, he believed that if they laugh in the sets, the audience will not get that laugh in theatres. Several unscripted dialogues were used by Mohanlal and Revathi in their combination scenes. Reception Kilukkam was released on 15 August 1991, in 32 centres in Kerala. Within 50 days run, it grossed 1.59 crore from the releasing stations. Kilukkam ran for over 365-days at many releasing centres and was the first Malayalam film to gross over 5 crore from theatrical revenue. Kilukkam was the highest-grossing film ever in Malayalam film history at the time. The film is often regarded as a classic, it is considered as one of the best comedy films ever made in Malayalam cinema. In a later interview, Priyadarshan has said that he exploited the Mohanlal Sreekumar chemistry to the maximum and incorporated certain elements of emotions in the film unlike his earlier comedy films Aram + Aram = Kinnaram (1985) and Boeing Boeing (1985), which made the film one of the all-time hits in Malayalam.

In that case, Kilukkam would become the first Malayalam film to be converted into 3D. Priyadarshan confirmed the news that the company approached him but the final call should be made by the producer Ram Mohan. In the Times of India report in late 2012, Mohan said that nothing has been finalised, discussions are going on.

Spanish troops led by General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Arredondo defeated republican forces (calling themselves the Republican Army of the North), consisting of Tejano-Mexican and Tejano-American revolutionaries participating in the Guti√©rrez‚ÄìMagee Expedition, under General Jos√© √Ålvarez de Toledo y Dubois. It was the deadliest battle in Texas history.  Background  Bernardo Guti√©rrez de Lara took up the effort to free Texas from Spain. Colonel Guti√©rrez visited Washington, D.C., gaining some support for his plans. In 1812, Colonel Augustus Magee, who as a lieutenant had commanded U.S. Army troops guarding the border of the Neutral Ground and Spanish Texas, resigned his commission and formed the Republican Army of the North to aid the Guti√©rrez‚ÄìMagee Expedition. The army flew a solid emerald green flag, thought to have been introduced by Colonel Magee, who was of Scots-Irish descent. Nacogdoches was taken on August 12, 1812, with little opposition, and on November 7, 1812, the Republican Army of the North marched into what is present-day Goliad, where they took the Presidio La Bah√≠a. The Spanish Army soon confronted them, beginning a four-month siege. While at La Bahia, however, Colonel Magee died (February 6, 1813). After numerous battles and heavy losses, the Spanish lifted the siege and returned to San Antonio de Bexar. On March 25, 1813, the Republican Army of the North left La Bahia for Bexar after receiving reinforcements. Colonel Samuel Kemper (brother of Reuben Kemper (another soldier very familiar with filibustering) replaced Magee, and Lt. Col. Reuben Ross was elected to second in command.  August 1813 battle  There were approximately 1,400 Texians in Lara's Republican Army at the time, composed of Tejanos, Americans, Euro-Mexicans (Criollos), former Spanish Royalist soldiers aided by an auxiliary force of Indians, and at least one black slave. The army, being led by General Toledo, had camped on the north bank of the Medina River, about six miles north of Arredondo's 1,800 Royalist troops which were encamped near present-day Leming, Texas. The battle lasted for four hours. Toledo's plan called for an ambush on the Royalist troops as they marched through a defile on the Bexar‚ÄìLaredo road. Similarly, Arredondo had sent out a scouting party with some cavalry in the morning to try to determine the location of Toledo's troops. Quite accidentally, they happened upon the Republican ambush and retreated after a brief exchange of fire.Edmonson (2000), p. 41‚Äì42. The Republican soldiers gave chase, apparently mistaking the cavalry which kicked up large clouds of dust for the main army; it is believed that Toledo tried in vain to stop his troops from advancing.Edmonson (2000), p. 42. In their pursuit, they were slowed down by the sandy terrain; the guns they were dragging with them became deeply mired. By the time they reached the Spanish lines, they were tired and thirsty. However, they did manage to rout some Spanish artillery units and were attempting a flanking maneuver when they were repulsed by Spanish cavalry units. The situation had been less than clear for Arredondo, and he was prepared to order his troops to fall back, when he seems to have been informed by a defector that the Republican troops were also attempting to disengage due to exhaustion. He then ordered an advance instead. The Republicans fled in disorder. Toledo and a few of his associates headed straight for Louisiana. Some of the combatants stopped in San Antonio just long enough to gather their families. The Spanish army continued to press, killing many of the fleeing soldiers. Most of the remainder were captured and then ‚Äì in a portent of the future Texas War of Independence ‚Äì were summarily executed.Edmonson (2000), p. 43. Fewer than 100 out of 1,400 soldiers on the Republican side survived, while the Royalists lost only 55 men. The remains of the Republican troops were left to rot and were not buried until 1822 when Jos√© F√©lix Trespalacios, the first governor of Coahuila y Tejas under the newly established United Mexican States, ordered a detachment of soldiers to gather their bones and bury them honorably under an oak tree that grew on the battlefield. Some of Guttierrez-Magee participants were sons of American revolutionaries or had fought with Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812, and of the few who survived, some fought again during the second Texas Revolution in 1835‚Äì36. Jos√© Antonio Navarro, a founding father of Texas and Jos√© Francisco Ruiz, both future signers of the 1836 Texas Declaration of Independence, took part in the 1812-13, Magee, Guti√©rrez, and Toledo resistance movements and later served as leaders in the Texas Revolution.Edmonson (2000), p. 38. Marker placed at one possible site of the battle near Leming, Texas One of the dead, Peter Sides, was an actual veteran of the American Revolution. Sides (originally Seitz) was about 62 when he marched off from his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with Magee and the other revolutionaries. A native of North Carolina of German ancestry, Seitz was a career soldier who fought in the first militia at Nashborough and in Logan County, Kentucky, before he and his family relocated to Baton Rouge in 1799. Markers from the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Daughters of the Republic of Texas have been placed on the battle site in Sides‚Äô honor. Nearly all the names of the other 1,300 or so dead from the Republic Army of the North have been lost to history. Of a very interesting note is a young lieutenant by the name of Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna fought in this bloody battle and followed his superiors' orders of taking no prisoners, heavily influencing how he would fight wars for the rest of his life, most infamously during the Texas Revolution at the Alamo and Goliad.https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfm01 .

Controversy The final two frames of Alas Poor Yagan by Dean Alston In September 1997 The West Australian published an Alston cartoon entitled Alas Poor Yagan, which criticised the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict among the Indigenous Australians of Western Australia, instead of fostering unity. The cartoon could also be interpreted as casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of named indigenous people who were humorously identified with mixed racial heritage. The content of the cartoon offended many Aboriginal people. The elder Robert Bropho levelled accusations of racism against The West Australian. Eventually the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but did not breach racial discrimination law. This ruling was upheld on appeal by the Federal Court of Australia.Federal Court of Australia (2004).

The headwaters of a tributary, the Lerderderg River, are north of Ballan near Daylesford and it flows across the basalt plain, through the suburb of Werribee to enter Port Phillip. A linear park follows the Werribee River along much of its course. In total the Werribee River completes a journey of approximately . The river flows through the Werribee Gorge State Park before being utilised for irrigation of market gardens at Bacchus Marsh, then through Werribee where it is crossed by the Maltby By-pass. It then flows through the Werribee Open Range Zoo in Werribee Park, and finally the small coastal settlement of Werribee South before entering Port Phillip. The Western Treatment Plant, a sewage treatment site, is located near the mouth of the river, and supplies irrigation needs to the zoo. The Werribee River Trail winds beside the Werribee River from Davis Creek in Tarneit to the Princes Highway in Werribee. History Before the arrival of white settlers, the Werribee River was the boundary of the Bunurong tribe whose six clans lived along the Victorian coast across the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay to Wilsons Promontory. In the late 1830s and 1840s, the Werribee River was the scene of conflict between the Wautharong people and the European colonisers. The squatter Charles Franks and a shepherd were speared to death near Mount Cottrell in July 1836. This resulted in the Mount Cottrell Massacre - a punitive party led by John Batman which came upon a large party of aborigines and indiscriminately shot and killed at least ten, There are accounts of arsenic laced flour being given to local aborigines. In 1851, a substantial timber bridge was built to cross the Werribee River to replace an earlier wooden bridge. In 1852, this bridge was washed away when the Werribee river flooded. In August 2004, the Victorian Government pledged 300,000 () towards restoring the Werribee River, removing willows choking the river around the township and replacing them with native plants in a habitat restoration project. Etymology The Hume and Hovell expedition camped by the river on 15 December 1824 and named it the Arndell after Hovell's father-in-law. John Helder Wedge 're-discovered' the river in 1835 and initially called it the Peel, but then decided to call it the Ex or Exe. The name of the town of Exford, an early crossing place on the river, is derived from this name. One of the local Wathaurong-speaking Kulin tribesman that accompanied Wedge said the name for the stream was 'Weariby Yallock' (yallock meaning 'stream'). The spelling changed to the present form of Werribee, the original Aboriginal root word meaning spine or backbone. Fishing Aerial perspective of the K Road cliffs along the Werribee River in January 2018. Werribee River holds fish all along its course, most of which are at the mouth of the river into Port Phillip Bay in the estuary. This area is best fished for southern black bream.  Features and highlights   Things to do  Werribee River in Spring 2017, where pasture meets suburban sprawl. Exploring the river offers an array of outdoor opportunities and is pastime for many local residents. An extensive network of hard-surface bike and walking trails along the river allow visitors to view native flora and fauna that inhabit the river and its banks. There are many fishing spots along the river, and canoe- and boat-launching facilities are located at the Werribee South Boat Ramp and Riverbend Historical Park. Birdwatching is also a popular activity; however, care must be taken as there are known to be eastern brown snakes and other deadly fauna inhabiting the area.

Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris P√©rez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\" and joined Los Kumbia All Starz, formed by A.B. Quintanilla. Mart√≠nez kept what was left of Los Kumbia Kings and formed his own group Los Super Reyes with the remaining members. In October 2009, Quintanilla and Mart√≠nez solved their differences, and announced that the Kumbia Kings would reunite for a series of concerts lasting from late 2009 through early 2010. History Los Kumbia Kings 1999 debut album, Amor, Familia y Respeto, immediately sold over 500,000 copies and earned them a Grammy nomination. 2001 brought the album Shhh!, which in its first week, was number 2 among all Latin releases, and stayed at the top for almost 2 years. By 2003, the Kings had already earned a nomination for the \\"Latin Artist of the Year\\" at the American Music Awards, along with countless other musical awards and achievements. 4 was released in March 2003. It was a bilingual project that brought together innovative fusions of R&B;, pop, reggae, hip hop, vallenatos, and electro- cumbia hits. Latin all-stars, such as Aleks Syntek, El Gran Silencio, Juan Gabriel, and the Grammy winning group Ozomatli brought extra dimension to the Kings' already encompassing style. In October 2004, Los Kumbia Kings released their fourth studio album titled Fuego, another CD that, as well, has gone on to sell over 500,000 copies. This album had again saw the Kings meeting the \\"Gold Standard\\" in the music industry. On November 2, 2006, Los Kumbia Kings won their first Latin Grammy for their album, Kumbia Kings Live (Best Tropical Regional Mexican Album). =2006: The split= Unfortunately, the Latin Grammy was a bittersweet victory for the group amidst the controversy and love/hate relationship between the co-producers of the band, A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Mart√≠nez, as well as the other members and ex-members of the group. A.B. Quintanilla, the founder of Kumbia Kings, left the group and early in the summer of 2006 formed Los \\"Kumbia All Starz\\", a Kumbia Kings styled ensemble that released their first album Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz in early October of that year. A.B.'s new group has launched many hits such as \\"Chiquilla\\", \\"Parece Que Va a Llover\\" and \\"Speedy Gonzales\\". They are now touring all over Latin America and the United States. Cruz Mart√≠nez continued to tour with \\"Los Kumbia Kings\\" until he decided to change the name of the group he now headed to \\"Los Super Reyes\\". Many of the members of the Kumbia Kings opted to stay with Cruz and released their first album as Los Super Reyes, El Regreso de los Reyes in August 2007. Their first single, titled \\"Mu√©velo\\" has topped Latin radio airwaves in the United States as well as Latin America. A.B. Quintanilla successfully petitioned Mexican courts to claim the naming rights to \\"Los Kumbia Kings\\". Fellow Kumbia Kings founder Cruz Mart√≠nez never pursued counter litigation to retain or share the naming rights with Quintanilla. The name \\"Los Kumbia Kings\\" is retired according to Quintanilla, though rumors persist that \\"Los Kumbia Kings\\" will resurface at a later date with new band members. \\"That name will make you money\\", so it's foolish to think that it will not be used again, cites one record company executive. Quintanilla continues to tour with his group Los Kumbia All Starz, and their October 2006 release sold well. Plans for a follow-up album have not been discussed, as the group continues to heavily promote and tour their current release, but in the Latin music market where album releases by the biggest stars average about every 15 months, another release by the All Starz is expected early next year. Cruz Mart√≠nez regrouped and took what was left of Los Kumbia Kings to Warner Music Latina. In late June it was announced that the new venture would be named \\"Los Super Reyes\\" with their first album El Regreso de los Reyes coming August 14, 2007. The single \\"Mu√©velo\\" was released to the public over the internet and radio. The Super Reyes ensemble includes cast-offs from the last edition of \\"Los Kumbia Kings\\". And in a surprising move, Mart√≠nez lured original Kumbia Kings members Alex and Roy Ram√≠rez (who are also working with their own group Kingz One) to help him out with the project. \\"They are original Kumbia Kings, so I thought it would be great to have them back, plus they're family,\\" stated Mart√≠nez to Univision. Los Super Reyes after their huge success on the debut album continued to tour all Latin America and for the first time in Kumbia Kings history will be headed to Japan in October 2008 and Spain in November 2008 due to international hit \\"Mu√©velo\\" which has also certified the group for platinum and gold record sales between the United States and Mexico. The group is again expected to release another very anticipated studio album early 2009. In one interview, A.B. Quintanilla states that the \\"Kumbia All Starz\\" were the evolution of \\"Kumbia Kings\\" leaving out \\"Los Super Reyes\\" and \\"Kingz One\\". =2009‚Äì2010: Reunion tour= It was recently announced by A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Mart√≠nez themselves that the Kumbia Kings will reunite again. An exclusive interview was given on October 26, 2009, through Ventaneando America. As of fall 2009, Kumbia All Starz and Super Reyes feature a combined 18 touring members. Members from both groups that seem to be rooted for the rebirth of Kumbia Kings (according to sources) are A.B. Quintanilla, Cruz Mart√≠nez, Jason \\"DJ Kane\\" Cano, Alex \\"PB\\" Ram√≠rez, Roy \\"Slim\\" Ram√≠rez, Anthony \\"Nino B\\" L√≥pez, Abel Talam√°ntez, Chris P√©rez, DJ Crazy J Rodriguez, Juan Jes√∫s \\"JP\\" Pe√±a, and Ricky Rick. The reunion concert was held at Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City, Mexico on November 21, 2009. The concert started with guest singer Flex who sang songs like \\"Te Quiero\\", \\"Esc√°pate\\", \\"Si No Te Tengo\\" and \\"Dime Si Te Vas Con √âl\\". Then Cruz Mart√≠nez & Los Super Reyes sang songs like \\"Tu Magia\\", \\"No Tengo Dinero\\", \\"Muchacha Triste\\", \\"Sabes a Chocolate\\", \\"Na Na Na (Dulce Ni√±a)\\", \\"Todav√≠a\\", \\"Qu√©date M√°s (I Want You Back)\\", \\"Eres\\" and \\"Mu√©velo\\". Then A.B. Quintanilla & Kumbia All Starz sang songs like \\"Mami\\", \\"Reggae Kumbia\\", \\"Dijiste\\", \\"Por Ti Baby\\" with Flex, performed a special tribute to Michael Jackson and Selena Quintanilla, and \\"Parece Que Va a Llover\\". For the grand finale A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Mart√≠nez and the rest of the Kumbia Kings got on stage and sang songs like \\"Pachuco\\", \\"Te Quiero a Ti\\", \\"Desde Que No Est√°s Aqu√≠\\", \\"Fuiste Mala\\", \\"Dime Qui√©n\\", \\"Se Fue Mi Amor\\", \\"Az√∫car\\", \\"Boom Boom\\" and \\"Shhh!\\". According to various sources a concert planned for early 2010 will feature A.B. Quintanilla's \\"Kumbia All Starz\\" and Cruz Mart√≠nez' \\"Super Reyes\\". With the show culminating with members from both groups reuniting and performing on stage for a \\"Kumbia Kings\\" reunion. Rumors persist that Mart√≠nez and Quintanilla will reunite early next year and begin production on a 2010 Kumbia Kings album, with original Kumbia Kings vocalist DJ Kane on lead vocals.

He is also credited with writing the screenplay for the \\"Romance Tropical\\", the first Puerto Rican film with sound. Early years Pal√©s Matos was born in Guayama, Puerto Rico into a family of well-known poets which included both his parents, Vicente Pal√©s An√©s and Consuelo Matos Vicil and his brothers and sisters, Vicente, Gustavo, Consuelo and Josefa. His family was instrumental in his poetic development and is reflected when at the age of 17 he wrote and published his first book of poetry titled \\"Azaleas\\", a collection of his poems. In high school he became the editor of the school's monthly publication \\"Mehr Licht\\". His family's financial situation was bad and he was forced to drop out of high school and earn a living working in various jobs. Diepalismo movement Luis Pal√©s Matos Bust in Guayama, Puerto Rico In 1918, he moved to the town of Fajardo where he worked for El Pueblo, the town's local newspaper. There he met a young lady by the name of Natividad Suliveres and soon married her. Natividad gave birth to a baby boy, but within a year his wife died of tuberculosis. Pal√©s Matos was devastated and expressed his grief in the poem \\"El palacio en sombras\\" (The palace in shadows). He moved to San Juan and worked for the daily newspapers, El Mundo and El Imparcial. In San Juan he met and befriended Jos√© T. de Diego Padr√≥, a fellow poet and together they created a literary movement known as \\"Diepalismo\\", a name derived from the combination of their surnames. Afro-Antillano poems In 1926, a local newspaper La Democracia published \\"Pueblo negro\\" (Black village), the first known Afro-Antillano poem. This marked the start of a new genre in Latin American literature which blended words from the Afro-Caribbean culture into the Spanish verse of Puerto Rico. These poems were immediately and vitriolically criticized by white, mainstream Puerto Rican intellectuals who viewed black issues as not being noteworthy or appropriate topics for high literature. In 1934, Pal√©s Matos wrote the screenplay for Romance Tropical, the first Puerto Rican movie with sound and the second Spanish movie with sound in the world. The movie, which was produced and directed by Juan Emilio Vigui√©, dealt with the romance between a poor boy and a rich girl. Romance Tropical, which was distributed in theaters throughout Puerto Rico and New York by Pedro Juanera, was an astounding success. The film promised to give the Puerto Rican film industry international recognition, however the development of the industry was affected when a dispute over the copyrights between the Canino family (investors) and Vigui√© became public knowledge.Historia del Cine en Puerto RicoBiographies In 1937, Pal√©s Matos published Tunt√∫n de pasa y grifer√≠a (Drumbeats of Kinkiness and Blackness). This collection of poems received an award of recognition from the Puerto Rican Institute of Literature. Pal√©s Matos gained fame with his literary work but, the experience was bittersweet. Though Pal√©s Matos is considered, together with the Afro-Cuban poet Nicol√°s Guill√©n, the father of the \\"Negrismo\\" movement, he was also criticized by members of the black Puerto Rican community, who considered it an insult to their race that Pal√©s Matos, a white (light-skinned) man, was becoming famous on their account. Nevertheless, black Puerto Rican performers such as Sylvia del Villard and Juan Boria recited Pal√©s Matos's poetry. Written works Some of Pal√©s Matos' works are: * El palacio en sombras (The Palace in Shadows) * Pueblo negro (Black Town) * Danza negra (Black Dance) * Canci√≥n festiva para ser llorada (A festival song to cry for) * Falsa canci√≥n de baquin√© (False Song of a funeral for a child) * Largarto verde (Green Lizard) * Tunt√∫n de pasa y grifer√≠a (Drumbeats of kinkiness and blackness) * Majestad negra (Black Majesty) Later years In 1957, his written work, \\"Poes√≠as\\" was acclaimed by the Academy of the Spanish language. Pal√©s Matos was selected by the faculty of the University of Puerto Rico as their conference representative. Pal√©s Matos died of heart failure in San Juan on February 23, 1959. He was buried at the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Legacy in Guayama is a residence museum dedicated to the memory of the poet.https://prpop.org/2017/05/vive-el-legado-de-pales/ There is a public school in Puerto Rico named after Pal√©s Matos, in the town of Bayam√≥nEscuela Luis Pales Matos and a public housing complex in Guayama.El Nuevo Dia The school of Humanities of the University of Puerto Rico has a building named after him.

It was designed, and is primarily used, as a regional airliner. It is also used as a freight aircraft and corporate transport, and by several governmental and military organisations. With customers favoring larger regional jets, Raytheon ended production in October 2002. The aircraft was designed to carry passengers in all weather conditions from airports with relatively short runways. It is capable of flying in excess of , although few operators use its full-fuel range. In terms of the number of aircraft built and its continued use by many passenger airlines and other users, it is one of the most popular 19-passenger airliners in history. Development An Eagle Airways 1900D The 1900 is Beechcraft's third regional airliner. The Beechcraft Model 18 was a 6- to 11-passenger utility aircraft produced from 1937 to 1970, used by the military, airlines, charter operations, corporations for executive transport, and freight carriers. The 15-passenger Beechcraft Model 99 Airliner was designed to replace the Beech 18, and was produced between 1966 and 1975, and from 1982 to 1986. It was also commercially successful and remains in common use with freight airlines such as Ameriflight. The Beechcraft 1900's design lineage began in 1949 with the Beechcraft Model 50 Twin Bonanza, a 5-passenger, reciprocating engine utility aircraft designed for the U.S. Army. A larger passenger cabin was added to the Twin Bonanza's airframe, and called the Model 65 Queen Air. This aircraft was, in turn, further modified by adding turboprop engines and cabin pressurization, and named the Model 90 King Air. A stretched version of the King Air was later developed and designated the Model 200 Super King Air. Beechcraft developed the 1900 directly from the Super King Air, in order to provide a pressurized commuterliner to compete with the Swearingen Metro and the British Aerospace Jetstream.Francillon 2001, p. 57. The 1900 first flew on September 3, 1982, with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification awarded on November 22, 1983 under Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 41C airworthiness standards. Like the 1900, the 1900C was certified under SFAR 41C, but the later 1900D version was certified to FAR Part 23 \\"Commuter Category\\" standards. The 1900 entered service in February 1984, with the first ExecLiner corporate version delivered in 1985. A total of 695 Beechcraft 1900 aircraft were built, making the airliner the best-selling 19-passenger airliner in history.The Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner series outsold the 1900 series, but many were built as corporate Merlins and purpose-built Expediter freighters. The 19-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter outsold both types, but it is typically used in different operations. With market trends favoring larger 50- to 90-seat regional jets, Raytheon ended production of the Beechcraft 1900 in October 2002. Many airlines continue to fly the 1900. Design Beechcraft 1900C The 1900 has single passenger seats either side of an aisle Since the 1900 is derived from the King Air, all 1900s share certain characteristics with that aircraft. Cockpit controls and operations are similar to those of the King Air. While Federal Aviation Regulations require two pilots for passenger airline operations, the 1900 is designed and certificated for single-pilot operation in corporate or cargo settings, as is the King Air. =Propulsion= The 1900 is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engines. The 1900 and 1900C use two PT6A-65B engines, each flat rated at . The 1900D uses two PT6A-67D engines, each rated at . The propellers are manufactured by Hartzell, with four blades on each propeller. The blades are made from composite materials. =Performance= The 1900D cruises at about 285 knots (328 mph or 528 km/h) true airspeed. Ordinary trip lengths range from 100 to 600 miles (20 minutes to two hours), but with full fuel tanks, the aircraft is capable of flying well in excess of . The Beechcraft 1900 can operate safely on relatively short airstrips and it can take off and land on grass and rough runways. The airplane is certified to fly up to an altitude of above mean sea level with its pressurized cabin. It is designed to operate in most weather conditions, including icing conditions, and it is usually equipped with weather radar to help pilots avoid severe weather. The aircraft can be fitted with a lavatory, using space otherwise available for passenger seating and cargo storage.Beechcraft 1900D Aircraft Flight Manual, Raytheon Aircraft Corporation Variants =1900= The original design is known simply as the Beechcraft 1900. It features two airstair passenger boarding doors: one near the tail of the aircraft much like the smaller King Airs, and a second at the front just behind the cockpit. It has a small cargo door near the tail for access to the baggage compartment, which is behind the passenger compartment. Only three airframes were built, with \\"UA\\" serial numbers of UA-1, UA-2, and UA-3. UA-1 and UA-2 are stored at a Beechcraft facility in Wichita, Kansas. UA-3, registered FAB-043, served in Bolivia until it crashed in November 2011.Aeronave de la FAB aterriza de emergencia, retrieved 18 January 2015 =1900C= Danish Air Transport 1900C It quickly became clear that having two airstair doors on an aircraft holding only 19 passengers was excessive. In creating the 1900C, Beechcraft kept the front airstair, but eliminated the aft airstair door, installing an enlarged cargo door in its place. Other than the redesigned door layout, the early 1900Cs were substantially similar to the original 1900s. These were assigned serial numbers starting with the letters UB. A total of 74 UB version were built, many of which remain in service. Aircraft in the UA and UB series employ a bladder-type fuel tank system in the wings. Later 1900Cs use a wet wing fuel system: entire sections of the wing are sealed off for use as fuel tanks. This design change allowed more fuel to be stored, substantially increasing the 1900C's range. The wet wing 1900Cs were assigned serial numbers beginning with \\"UC.\\" These aircraft are also referred to as 1900C-1s. The wet wings proved popular, and the UC is the most common version of the low-ceiling 1900, with 174 UC airframes built. Raytheon manufactured six 1900C aircraft for use by the U.S. military. These were assigned \\"UD\\" serial numbers, UD-1 through UD-6. =1900D= The 1900D has a larger cabin to allow passengers to walk upright inside While the 1900C had become a popular regional airliner, Beechcraft undertook a substantial redesign of the aircraft, and in 1991 introduced a new version called the 1900D. The 1900 and 1900C, like most 19-passenger airliners and small business jets, have fairly small passenger cabins, with ceilings so low that passengers (of typical male heights) cannot walk through the interior without bending forward. The 1900D was designed to remedy this by providing a \\"stand-up cabin\\", which would allow most passengers to walk upright. It is one of only two 19-seat airliners with this feature, the other being the British Aerospace Jetstream 31/32. Because the taller passenger cabin adds both weight and drag to the airplane, other elements of the 1900D were also changed. More powerful engines and modified propellers were installed, winglets were added to reduce drag and increase the wings' efficiency, and the tail was made larger in response to the more powerful engines. The cockpit was updated with an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS). The 1900D was certified under the then-new FAR Part 23 \\"Commuter Category\\" standards, which had replaced the earlier SFAR 41C. Since the UD serial numbers were already in use by the military 1900s, the 1900D airplanes have serial numbers beginning with UE. The 1900D is the most popular version of the airliner, with 439 of the 1900D built. = Super Freighter = A supplemental type certificate has been awarded to Alpine Air Express to convert 1900D into cargo aircraft. The STC involved adding a second emergency exit to the cockpit and converting the interior to a cargo configuration. The 1900D can carry 900 cubic feet of cargo, 30% more than a 1900C. Powered by PT6-67D, the super freighter has a max takeoff weight of 17,120lbs and is certified under the commuter category. Due to its standup cabin, the 1900D has a large internal volume. The large volume lends the aircraft well to the cargo industry where many packages are bulky and low in density. The 1900D is able to carry nearly as much volume as an EMB-120 and is certified for single pilot cargo operations. The single pilot crew and surplus of airframes allows for reduced operator costs. =Military C-12J= The U.S. military designation for the Beechcraft 1900C is C-12J. This is a variant of the C-12 Huron, which is the most common designation for military King Airs. The C-12J includes the six Beechcraft 1900s with 'UD' serial number prefixes built for the U.S. military, as well as other 1900Cs in U.S. military service. Examples of C-12J aircraft in military service include one used for GPS jamming tests at the 586th Flight Test Squadron, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and three based at the 459th Airlift Squadron, Yokota Air Base, Japan. The U.S. Army operates both C-12J and 1900D aircraft along with other C-12 (King Air) aircraft. =King Air ExecLiner= The King Air ExecLiner was a marketing name for a corporate version of the Beechcraft 1900C.

Flight 103 was fully loaded (all 19 seats occupied; 1437 pounds of cargo) when it took off from Kodiak. The aircraft lifted off the runway, fell back and accelerated for about another 15 knots before it became airborne. The aircraft was approaching Homer when it was cleared for the localizer/DME approach to runway 3. The crew reported a final five minutes later. On short final the wings were seen to rock back and forth; the aircraft then dropped steeply to the ground in a rather flat attitude, struck the airport perimeter fence and slid to a stop on its belly. Both pilots and sixteen of the nineteen passengers were killed. The investigation into the crash (the first crash of a 1900) stated the probable cause as \\"the failure of the flight crew to properly supervise the loading of the airplane which resulted in the center of gravity being displaced to such an aft location that the airplane control was lost when the flaps were lowered for landing.\\" * May 18, 1990: a 1900C, operating for Aerolift Philippines as Flight 75 to Surigao, took off from runway 13 at Manila's international airport. During takeoff the no. 2 engine failed. The airplane began turning to the right as the crew radioed that they were returning to the airport. With the undercarriage down and the flaps still in takeoff position the airplane impacted a house in the suburban Paranaque neighbourhood. All 21 on board the aircraft and a family of four inside the house were killed making the crash the deadliest involving the Beechcraft 1900.aviation-safety.net * August 21, 1990: a Republic of China Air Force 1900C crashed in Yunlin County in central Taiwan, killing 18 officers on board.Military Aviation Accidents, TaiwanAirPower.org * December 28, 1991: a Business Express Airlines 1900C crashed during a training flight when the instructor refused to take back the controls after the students became disoriented due to heavily stressing conditions imposed by the instructor, against the company's flight manual. This conclusion was controversial, as an investigation by the Airline Pilots Association showed that there were many indications of catastrophic airframe failure, not due to pilot error. * December 7, 1995: an Air St. Martin 1900D drifted off course and crashed into a mountain in Haiti, killing all 20 people on board. * November 19, 1996: a United Express 1900C collided on a runway with a Beechcraft King Air at Quincy Regional Airport in Illinois, killing all 14 people on board both aircraft. * July 30, 1998: Proteus Airlines Flight 706, a 1900D, collided in midair with a Cessna 177RG over Quiberon Bay in France.

Since their founding in 2001, they have released four full-length albums and one EP. They have also appeared on several compilations with original songs and covers. The band's self-titled fourth album, their second on Fearless Records, peaked at number 22 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart and number 28 on the Top Independent Albums chart. The band drew their name from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby. The band's music has been influenced by alternative rock, post-hardcore, and progressive rock. History =Origins and Why We Fight= The prototypes for the songs on the band's first record, Why We Fight, were (according to Bobby) written by his earlier band, One Point Two on Together Records (Killed For Less Records) out of Richmond Indiana. Scott George owner of Together Records/Killed For Less Records says One Point Two CD is still available on interpunk.com and to this date claims it to be ahead of its time and ground breaking. This band was made up of Bobby, Casey Bates, Josh Berg, and Dustin McGhie. The group later met up with the former guitarist and singer of Good for Nothing, Nic Newsham and Ryan Van Wieringen, and formed Gatsbys American Dream. Although Casey Bates never joined the band, he has remained their producer throughout the band's career. When Acceptance guitarist Kaylan Cloyd heard a Gatsbys demo, he handed it to Darrick Bourgeois, owner of local record label Rocketstar Recordings. Shortly afterward, Gatsbys signed a two-record deal with Rocketstar and worked with producer Aaron Sprinkle to record their 2002 debut album Why We Fight. Their first show after being signed drew in a crowd in excess of 500, which was largely due to Rocketstar's extensive promotion. Shortly after the release of their first album, the line-up changed when bassist Josh Berg left and Kirk Huffman (formerly of K Through Six) was recruited. He is often recognized as the only bassist because Berg never toured with the band. After the band's first tour, Dustin McGhie also left and the band found Rudy Gahadjar, formerly of Waxwing and Bugs in Amber. . =Ribbons and Sugar= In 2003, the band released their second record, Ribbons and Sugar, a concept album based loosely on George Orwell‚Äôs fable Animal Farm. Musically, the album found them exploring a harder-edged pop sound, opting for unusual time signatures and tempo changes. Although literary references are common through most of their material, Ribbons and Sugar also began a motif of record label disdain. The lyrics of \\"Cut the Strings\\" read: > \\"This is awful to think who decides what should or should not stay, what > ends up on the cutting room floor. Apparently it's not my choice to make.\\" =In the Land of Lost Monsters= Gatsbys' two-record deal with Rocketstar was fulfilled with Ribbons and Sugar, and the band decided not to renew their contract. Later, guitarist Ryan Van Wieringen would leave the band to further his college education. Following the release of Ribbons and Sugar, the band did a showcase with Drive Thru Records. Slightly embittered by the process, the band signed a one-record deal with Chicago-based LLR Recordings in 2004. Their contractual record, the more mellow and subdued In the Land of Lost Monsters EP, was in part a response to the post-Ribbons record label attention the band had received. Labels that approached them wanted the band to write choruses for their next record (a standard songwriting technique the band had, up to that point, seemed to avoid). Newsham and Darling's lyrics for Lost Monsters reflected this struggle, criticizing the music industry and expressing the band's wariness of record labels, although this was not the only theme of the album. In addition, many of the literary illusions on this EP centered on A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin as seen by the songs The Dragon of Pendor and The Loosing of the Shadow, although Darling has denied that the lyrics of \\"The Dragon of Pendor\\" were about the Le Guin book in particular. =Volcano= Several months after the EP's release, the band settled on Fearless Records and released their third full-length, Volcano, in April 2005. Thematically, Volcano revolves around Pompeii (as evidenced by the title of the second track on the record), which stands as a metaphor for the uncontrollable intensity of human emotion. The album is rife with literary and cultural references from such diverse works as children's film Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Lionhead Studio's Fable, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, the action film Jurassic Park, and Orson Scott Card's science-fiction epics Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. During the tour that followed the release of Volcano, Gatsbys added Kyle O'Quin (also a member of the band Surrounded By Lions). A few months after O'Quin was added to the band, Ryan Van Wieringen met up with the band in Arizona while they were on tour there and rejoined the line up. Since then, he has been touring and performing live as part of the band. =Self-titled album and hiatus= Gatsbys' self-titled fourth full-length album was released August 8, 2006. The album is peppered with numerous pop culture and literary references, which appear in both the lyrics and song titles, ranging from works by Philip K. Dick to the television show Lost. The band has been relatively inactive since the release of the self-titled album. The band has played a handful of shows in and around the Seattle area, and on April 27, 2007, they played their first out-of-state show since the self-titled album's release at Colgate University. In a forum post at Gatsbys fansite Snicker at the Swine, Bobby stated the following in regards to future albums or tours: During the hiatus, most of the members started side projects. =Reunion= In September 2010, at Forgive Durden's \\"Return to Wonderland\\" show at El Corazon in Seattle, which included Places and Numbers (Bobby Darling with all members except Newsham as a backing band), and Princess Dinosaur (Nic Newsham). The show concluded with all of the members of Gatsbys American Dream going on stage after Places and Numbers and playing \\"Theatre\\" off of Volcano. On October 5, 2010, entirely through newly created Facebook/Twitter accounts, the band announced they were officially reuniting. They also hinted towards the album they began recording by uploading pictures and mentioning Casey Bates' studio. The band also asked fans to contact their booking agent and request cities for a future tour. Gatsby noted that side projects Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground and Wild Orchid Children in particular would not be affected by the reunion.Twitter post by the band. Retrieved October 6, 2010. In January 2011 the band worked with the Overdue Collection Agency, a record label dedicated to remastering vinyl records and sending the profits to a charity of the band's choice. They re-released their first two albums, Why We Fight and Ribbons & Sugar on vinyl, with the label, with the goal of raising $5,500 for water.org. They exceeded their goal well before the due date and planned to release their first EP, In the Land of Lost Monsters, later. On March 4, 2011, the band unveiled new material, with a song titled \\"Modern Man\\" on their new official website. In order to hear it, fans have to play a game similar to Angry Birds. On March 11, a second song, initially named \\"Born Dead\\", was to be streamed, but it was delayed and renamed \\"Untitled\\" after the 2011 Yunnan earthquake. The song was released a few days after the event, under the name \\"Untitled\\". From this point the band went inactive, with no official statements or releases for over two years. On March 12, 2013, Nic Newsham announced via Twitter that the planned reunion album was still incomplete, and would probably never be released.

The video contains three music videos including the Ribbons and Sugar CD release party, touring and recording featurettes, over 150 photos, personal member videos, behind the scenes footage of a year with the band when they were recording and touring in support of Ribbons and Sugar. Side projects The following bands were started during Gatsbys's unofficial hiatus. Of all the Gatsbys members, Rudy Gajadhar is the only one with no other known projects, though he played drums with Search/Rescue at a June 2007 show in Seattle and recorded drums for Forgive Durden's album, Razia's Shadow. =Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground= Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground is an indie band started by Kirk Huffman and Kyle O'Quin. Like Gatsbys, the band is influenced by a wide variety of musical genres. Though the band only has three official members, they have been known to perform with as many as 11 additional musicians on stage. =Search/Rescue= Search/Rescue is a progressive rock band formed by members of Gatsbys American Dream and Acceptance. The band independently released their debut album, titled The Compound, in 2008. =RedRedBlue= RedRedBlue was Newsham's powerpop side project with Justin Harcus of Pale Pacific. The band's name was taken from a Gatsbys song from In the Land of Lost Monsters, which was often thought to be a reference to an army's color code from the book Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card (Newsham has said this was just a coincidence). To date, the band has released 3 tracks for download on their MySpace page. On August 23, Newsham posted a MySpace bulletin stating that due to popular request, he would start writing more songs for RedRedBlue, but that they would likely be acoustic-only. Members * Nic Newsham - vocals, guitar * Justin Harcus - bass =Wild Orchid Children= Wild Orchid Children is another band featuring Huffman and O'Quin. In August 2007, the band started a MySpace page and posted a single song, titled \\"Ahead of Us the Secret\\" which was also made available for free download at Gatsbys fansite Snicker At The Swine. The band features musicians from other prominent Seattle bands The Divorce and Forgive Durden. The band started taking pre-orders in late October 2007 for a 4-song EP, which includes the songs released for streaming on the band's Myspace page. After a manufacturing error caused delays in the release of the EP, the band started shipping orders in January 2008. The EP's artwork is by John Gourley. Wild Orchid Children signed to Equal Vision Records in the summer of 2010, The Wild Orchid Children Are Alexander Supertramp was subsequently released on Tuesday, November 9, 2010. The album features all four tracks from the previous EP, re- recorded with extended sections and additional instrumentation.

Members * Nic Newsham - vocals/guitar * Ryan Short * Jonathan Driscoll =Zero Cool= Zero Cool is a rock band featuring Bobby Darling and Thomas Dutton of Forgive Durden. The band came out of an idea both members had about mapping out an entire album using guidelines for the tempo and key and setting up the session in ProTools before playing a single note. Currently, the band has only released a single song titled \\"Godzilla\\" on Forgive Durden's blog. Members * Bobby Darling - guitar, bass, vocals * Thomas Dutton - drums, vocals =Razia's Shadow= Forgive Durden's \\"Razia's Shadow\\" is a musical involving several artists in the Seattle indie scene.

Together, Lloyd and Lucas were affectionately dubbed the \\"twin towers\\" due to their height in the Bomber forward line.  Football career  Lucas is known for his strong marking and being a powerful, accurate left-foot kick, although his apparent inability to kick with his right foot is almost as notable. Lucas once joked on The Sunday Footy Show in 2006 that the last time he kicked with his right foot was to Gary Moorcroft when he took the 2001 Mark of the Year. He mainly played across half-forward or centre half-forward, but also played at centre half-back and full-forward. Lucas regularly had shots on goal from outside 60 metres with his booming left foot, and he rarely handballed, averaging less than 3 handballs a match. In Round 19, 2005, Lucas played his 200th AFL game and kicked his 300th AFL goal against at Telstra Dome, but the milestones would be remembered for all the wrong reasons, as the Bombers lost by 20 points despite leading at every change. In 2006, Lucas had an outstanding year in an underachieving Essendon side, playing at full-forward and being their main target and goalkicker in the absence of captain Matthew Lloyd. Lucas finished the season with a career-best 67 goals, runner-up in the Coleman Medal behind Brendan Fevola, and polled a joint team-high seven votes from just 36 votes received by Essendon players in the 2006 Brownlow Medal. Lucas was one of just three players who played every match for season 2006. He capped off this season with his second Crichton Medal, winning with 239 votes from Jobe Watson's 221. Lucas had previously won the club trophy in 2003, when the honours were shared with club great James Hird. Against West Coast in Round 11, 2007, Lucas booted his 400th career goal. A vintage display also came against West Coast in Round 22, when, despite being close to 50 points down, Lucas rallied in the last quarter in a remarkable solo effort, booting 7 goals (and just missing for a record-equalling eighth), reducing the margin to just 2 points. In the end, though, a late goal to the Eagles saw a gallant Essendon fall 8 points short of one of the greatest-ever AFL comebacks. This was also the last game of Essendon legend James Hird and coach of 27 years, Kevin Sheedy. During a match against the Western Bulldogs in the 2008 NAB Cup, Lucas managed to kick a record 3 Super Goals, which took his career tally to 7, making him the leading super-goal-kicker in the AFL. Lucas suffered a knee injury (specifically, a torn cartilage) in the first round of the 2008 season against North Melbourne and was out of action for a number of weeks. Along with teammate Dustin Fletcher, Lucas signed a one-year contract in mid-2008.

The city of Seacouver appears in the first 5 seasons of Highlander: The Series, and is best known as the home of Duncan MacLeod and several other Immortals, as well as many Watchers. The city's name is a portmanteau for Seattle and Vancouver, BC. It became the official city for the show. Duncan's U.S. city of residence was first identified by fans who quickly took to calling it \\"Seacouver,\\" because it was clearly meant to evoke the feel of Seattle while looking suspiciously like Vancouver, British Columbia (where the show was filmed). Eventually, the show creators officially adopted the name for the city, in which he owned an antique and sculptures gallery. He sold the place after Tessa No√´l's death and moved back and forth to Paris, France, living in a barge located on the Seine river and in an apartment above a martial arts dojo located in Seacouver. The city of Seacouver was founded in 1793. It celebrated its bicentennial in 1993, as evidenced in the first-season episode \\"Revenge is Sweet\\". In late 1992 (per the date given in the Watcher Chronicles CD-ROM and dialogue from the same episode), Duncan MacLeod's lover, Tessa Noel, was contracted by the city's bicentennial committee to sculpt a work of art for the city's upcoming birthday. The Immortal villain of the episode, Walter Reinhardt, vandalized Tessa's sculpture. Seacouver is known to be architecturally modeled after Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The term Seacouver is sometimes used in a more generic sense when discussing other series or movies set in the United States but filmed in Canada.

KMZQ went through many changes over its 12-year run. KMZQ was known as \\"Q-100\\" and \\"Klassy 100.\\" From 1995 to 2005, it was known as \\"Lite 100.5 FM.\\" On June 24, 2005, at 2 PM, after playing \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" by Sheryl Crow, KMZQ began stunting with Christmas music; 45 minutes later, the stunt shifted to movie theme songs with the sound of a Roulette wheel in between. At 3 PM, the stunt ended with voiceover artist Howard Cogan asking to \\"please cut the cheesy Roulette wheel sound effect\\". Shortly thereafter, Lite 100.5 became Jack FM, with a variety hits format. The call letters were quickly changed to KKJJ. The first song on \\"Jack FM\\" was The Flying Lizards' cover of \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\". KMZQ-FM's call letters later found a new home on FM 99.3 in Payson, Arizona, co-owned with KMZQ 670 in Las Vegas. In July 2010, CBS Radio announced that starting August 16, 2010, KKJJ would be replaced with a simulcast of sister station KXNT and would be known as Newsradio 840 AM/100.5 FM KXNT.http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/78813/kxnt- las-vegas-to-launch-fm-simulcast On August 16, at 5:03 AM, after playing \\"Talk Talk\\" by Talk Talk, KKJJ began simulcasting KXNT.

Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2006 Census. Community Profile Series: East Gippsland Shire (Statistical Subdivision). Released at 29/02/2008. LOCATION CODE: 25005 STATE: VIC The Shire of East Gippsland is confusingly also referred to simply as East Gippsland. It excludes the Shire of Wellington (Central Gippsland). This article (currently) refers mainly to \\"Far East Gippsland\\". East Gippsland's major towns include, from west to east, Bairnsdale (the largest town and administrative centre), Paynesville, Lakes Entrance, Orbost and Mallacoota. Smaller, but significant, towns in the more mountainous northern areas include Ensay, Swifts Creek, Omeo, and Buchan. East Gippsland extends from the western watershed of the Mitchell and Thomson River catchments east and north to the New South Wales border. Rugged terrain makes farming difficult, even with fertilisers. The major industry is often considered to be forestry, which provides less than 1 percent of employment for the region.ABS 2006 Census 250/25005 (see above): Employed persons aged 15 years and over in forestry and logging. East Gippsland: 186 of 28820 (0.6%); East Gippsland Shire: 92 of 14001 (0.7%); Note: Including those employed in \\"agriculture, forestry and fishing support services\\" (which goes beyond the scope of just forestry) raises each of these figures to 1.0%. The East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) was signed by Commonwealth and Victorian governments on 3 February 1997, and is Australia's first RFA. It covers a region similar, but not identical to the East Gippsland Shire. It sets aside 5,811 km¬≤ from logging, an increase of 1.3% over pre-RFA reserves.Australian Bureau of Statistics. Environment by Numbers: Selected Articles on Australia's Environment. Dennis Trewin. 21 Feb 2003. ABS Cataloge No. 4617.0. . p18. Central Gippsland is covered by the Gippsland RFA (signed 31 March 2000), which covers an area similar to the Shire of Wellington, and places 7,805 km¬≤ in reserves. Logging of native forests has caused sustained controversy in East Gippsland, particularly due to the unique species found in areas east of the Snowy River, and the contentious public debate surrounding native forest, particularly old-growth, harvesting. This is despite managed forest having a mitigation effect in climate change. The major river basins of the Mitchell, Tambo and Nicholson drain into the Gippsland Lakes, which in turn empty into the sea through an artificially maintained opening at Lakes Entrance. Thurra River in Croajingolong National Park The area is a major tourist destination, especially for watersports, and is noted for its mild climate. The Great Alpine Road leads north from Bairnsdale into the Australian Alps via Swifts Creek and Omeo, and onto the major ski resorts of Dinner Plain and Mount Hotham. This area is also very popular for bushwalking in the summer. The Buchan district is popular with tourists for its limestone caves. Further east, the Snowy River and several smaller stream catchments, including the Thurra, Wingan, Genoa, Bemm River and Cann River, enter the Tasman Sea. More than 17,000 km¬≤ of East Gippsland is public land with 2,680 km¬≤ being national parks, two of the largest being Snowy River National Park and Errinundra National Park. Both are remote and inaccessible, but they are otherwise entirely different. Snowy River National Park features dramatic gorges and powerful rapids formed by the descent of the Snowy River. Apart from gorges and southern slopes, this park is in a rain-shadow area forming the southern border of the Monaro Tableland. Consequently, many species more typical of inland New South Wales and Victoria are found here. Errinundra National Park is much wetter - inaccessible from June to October in most years - and features some of the most ancient forests in Australia, a matter of controversy as employment in the remote areas east of the Snowy is mainly dependent upon timber milling. Croajingolong National Park between Marlo and Mallacoota features extensive coastal heathlands and tea tree scrub, as well as the only major area of warm temperate rainforest in Victoria. The 4,193 km¬≤ of privately owned land is mainly red gum plains, coastal plains, mountain plateaux and fertile river valleys.

The band released three albums before splitting up in 1996.  History  The band started as the duo of Kelly Riles and guitarist/singer Archie Moore (also of Black Tambourine) in 1989 (the two having met at university), initially going under the name The Gotterdemocrats. They became Velocity Girl with the addition of Brian Nelson (ex-Big Jesus Trashcan, also of Black Tambourine), Jim Spellman (ex-High Back Chairs), and lead singer Bridget Cross (soon to join Unrest).Bonner, Michael (1993) \\"Velocity Girl: Cop This\\", Lime Lizard, May 1993, p. 74 The band took its name from a Primal Scream B-side which appeared on the C86 compilation album. Sarah Shannon joined to replace Cross after the release of the band's debut single \\"I Don't Care If You Go.\\" Unlike some 1990s rock music that featured an abrasive vocal and instrumental style, Velocity Girl's sound, especially post-1993, was more melodic and typically featured \\"clean\\" (non-distorted) electric guitar sounds and two-part harmonies. The band described their influences as \\"the Rough Trade and Postcard labels and some of the early Creation bands.\\" However, on their first seven-inch records on Slumberland and Merge, as well as their first Sub Pop album, Copacetic, Velocity Girl were noted for their shoegaze influences. The band was noted for its love of releasing a steady stream of 7\\" vinyl singles. Slumberland Records was formed in 1989 by members of several D.C.-area bands, including Velocity Girl. They often featured female/male vocals, sometimes simultaneously, with Archie Moore providing the male vocals. Velocity Girl toured frequently, releasing three full-length recordings on the Sub Pop label. Music videos were released for \\"Crazy Town,\\" (1993),\\"Audrey's Eyes,\\" (directed by Phil Harder) (1993) \\"Sorry Again,\\" (1994) \\"I Can't Stop Smiling,\\" (directed by Spike Jonze) (1994) and \\"Nothing\\" (1996). The group disbanded in late 1996 after playing their last show \\"The Buzz Bakesale\\" in West Palm Beach, Florida. Shannon, Riles and Spellman reunited in a short- lived project called Starry Eyes, releasing one EP in 1998.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 1050 Moore had already formed Heartworms before Velocity Girl split up, and later formed The Saturday People with Terry Banks of Tree Fort Angst. Sarah Shannon went on to release her self-titled album in 2002. There was one Velocity Girl reunion show played at the Black Cat in Washington, DC on June 9, 2002. Jim Spellman, now a noted CNN reporter, played guitar in now-defunct Washington, D.C. based power-pop band Julie Ocean.

LDIF conveys directory content as a set of records, one record for each object (or entry). It also represents update requests, such as Add, Modify, Delete, and Rename, as a set of records, one record for each update request. LDIF was designed in the early 1990s by Tim Howes, Mark C. Smith, and Gordon Good while at the University of Michigan. LDIF was updated and extended in the late 1990s for use with Version 3 of LDAP. This later version of LDIF is called version 1 and is formally specified in RFC 2849, an IETF Standard Track RFC. RFC 2849 is authored by Gordon Good and was published in June 2000. It is currently a Proposed Standard. A number of extensions to LDIF have been proposed over the years. One extension has been formally specified by the IETF and published. RFC 4525, authored by Kurt Zeilenga, extended LDIF to support the LDAP Modify-Increment extension. It is expected that additional extensions will be published by the IETF in the future.  Content Record Format  Each content record is represented as a group of attributes, with records separated from one another by blank lines. The individual attributes of a record are represented as single logical lines (represented as one or more multiple physical lines via a line-folding mechanism), comprising \\"name: value\\" pairs. Value data that do not fit within a portable subset of ASCII characters are marked with '::' after the attribute name and encoded into ASCII using base64 encoding. The content record format is a subset of the Internet Directory Information type.RFC 2425  Tools that employ LDIF  The OpenLDAP utilities include tools for exporting data from LDAP servers to LDIF content records (\`ldapsearch\`), importing data from LDIF content records to LDAP servers (\`ldapadd\`), and applying LDIF change records to LDAP servers (\`ldapmodify\`). LDIF is one of the formats for importing and exporting address book data that the address books in Netscape Communicator and in the Mozilla Application Suite support. Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 include an LDIF based command line tool named LDIFDE for importing and exporting information in Active Directory. JXplorer is a cross platform open source java application that can browse and do basic editing of LDIF files.  LDIF fields  ; dn: distinguished name :This refers to the name that uniquely identifies an entry in the directory. ; dc: domain component :This refers to each component of the domain. For example www.mydomain.com would be written as DC=www,DC=mydomain,DC=com ; ou: organizational unit :This refers to the organizational unit (or sometimes the user group) that the user is part of. If the user is part of more than one group, you may specify as such, e.g., OU= Lawyer,OU= Judge. ; cn: common name :This refers to the individual object (person's name; meeting room; recipe name; job title; etc.) for whom/which you are querying.  Examples of LDIF  This is an example of a simple directory entry with several attributes, represented as a record in LDIF: dn: cn=The Postmaster,dc=example,dc=com objectClass: organizationalRole cn: The Postmaster This is an example of an LDIF record that modifies multiple single-valued attributes for two different directory entries (this format is used by Microsoft's LDIFDE tool): dn: CN=John Smith,OU=Legal,DC=example,DC=com changetype: modify replace: employeeID employeeID: 1234 - replace: employeeNumber employeeNumber: 98722 - replace: extensionAttribute6 extensionAttribute6: JSmith98 - dn: CN=Jane Smith,OU=Accounting,DC=example,DC=com changetype: modify replace: employeeID employeeID: 5678 - replace: employeeNumber employeeNumber: 76543 - replace: extensionAttribute6 extensionAttribute6: JSmith14 - Note: the \\"-\\" character between each attribute change is required.

A second game with no related storyline, WinBack 2: Project Poseidon, produced by Cavia for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox game consoles, was released on April 25, 2006. The story follows one Jean-Luc Cougar, a secret agent infiltrating a laser satellite's command center. Gameplay revolves around its innovative cover system, in which the player takes cover behind corners and then ducks out to shoot. The player cannot move while shooting; instead, the control stick is used to aim, a task made easier by the fact that every weapon is equipped with a laser sight. WinBack's cover system eventually went on to influence several later shooters, including Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001) and Kill Switch (2003), which in turn influenced games like Gears of War (2006). The cover system has since become a staple of third-person shooters. WinBack also featured a laser-sight mechanic that was later incorporated in action games such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and Resident Evil 4 (2005), and in turn would also become a staple of third-person shooters.  Story  A terrorist group called \\"Crying Lions\\" takes control of a space-based laser weapon. This is used to attack a military installation housing the controls to the weapon, called the GULF system. The leader of the terrorists calls himself Colonel Kenneth Coleman. The Secretary of Defense contacts the Special Covert Action Team (SCAT) with their orders: Enter the GULF complex and reclaim it. Jean-Luc Cougar is part of the team, and the last to escape the helicopter being shot down. The player takes control of Jean-Luc as he leaps a wall and enters a parking lot. The team is scattered throughout the complex and you must find them and destroy the satellite control center before the GULF satellite laser can recharge and fire again. Along the way you will face a number of laser traps, puzzles, machine gun nests, ambushes and mazes. You will face a series of bosses culminating in the final boss fight (against Kenneth Coleman's deputy Cecile). = Endings = There are two possible endings, depending on how long it takes the player (as Jean-Luc) to reach the control room. ;Good Ending After killing Jin, one of the Crying Lions bosses, in the generator room, a confrontation emerges between the remaining active S.C.A.T. team members (Jake, Jean-Luc, and Lisa) and the remaining Crying Lions' bosses other than Kenneth Coleman (Cecile and Deathmask). A shootout erupts during which Jake is killed while Lisa is knocked unconscious and taken hostage by Cecile, who subsequently departs. Jean-Luc and Deathmask fight in one-on-one combat, with Jean-Luc emerging the victor and killing Deathmask, before Jean-Luc gives chase to Cecile. Cecile, realizing that the Crying Lions objective is likely to fail with the S.C.A.T. team having penetrated so far into the facility, betrays and kills Kenneth Coleman, so as to take control of the terrorist group and the weaponized satellite to achieve his own ulterior motives: blackmailing the US government into giving him a large sum of money. However, S.C.A.T. team leader Dan arrives at the control room and seemingly kills Cecile. Lisa regains consciousness, and is surprised to discover that Dan is working with the Crying Lions, but is again disabled by Dan after he gives her details of how to destroy the satellite. Upon reaching the satellite control room, Jean-Luc encounters Dan, who reveals he is a traitor, the killer of both Steve and Thomas, and forces Jean-Luc into a confrontation. After a fierce battle, Dan is mortally wounded and tells Jean-luc his reasons for his betrayal of the team: he is half-Saroczian. The war split his family in two, his mother and sister defected to Russia with him in tow, whilst his brother and father joined the Saroczian Revolution. Several years later after the separation, he joined the Army and was eventually sent on a mission by the US Forces to keep the government in power by quashing the revolution supported by a majority of the people. The mission was carried out but Dan was filled with regrets which he says fate was responsible for. He also met his brother, Kenneth Coleman, leader of the Crying Lions who fought to end the suffering of the Saroczian people and avenge his father's death. Dan subsequently dies of his wounds, and Cecile, who survived being shot by Dan earlier, appears and fights one last battle against Jean-Luc in which he is ultimately killed. Once the confrontation is over, Lisa arrives to discover that both Cecile and Dan are dead. Jean-luc Convinces Lisa to destroy the GULF satellite, believing it is too powerful for any one country to control. The GULF satellite is destroyed as Jean-Luc, Keith, and Lisa escape, with Operation Winback ending in success. ;Bad Ending Jean-Luc finds both Lisa and Jake dead in the generator room, both presumably killed by Jin, the elusive (bad ending) Crying Lions boss whom Jean-Luc faces and kills in the generator room should he arrive fast enough (the good ending). Upon reaching the satellite control room, Jean-Luc finds Cecile waiting for him. Cecile tells Jean-Luc that he was too late, the satellite has already fired twice, destroying the Pentagon and White house. Jean-Luc confronts and kills Cecile and goes to the communications room to find Kenneth Coleman, pleased that his \\"objective\\" and \\"cause\\" was a success. After some talk, Kenneth shoots himself. Jean-Luc and Keith are the only survivors of Operation Winback, which is ultimately a failure.  Multiplayer  The game featured a standard multiplayer mode and a Bot mode in the PlayStation 2 version of the game and only in the NTSC versions of the game, where players had access to all of the game's abilities and weapons. At the beginning of the game, all the members of Jean-Luc's team are available as selectable characters, all of them come with a basic hand gun as their initial weapon, except for Dan who comes with a unique gun as his main weapon. As the player finished the game or used the cheat code, they will unlock all the bosses and other characters that they had defeated or appeared in story mode. Each boss has a unique weapon that they used in the story mode with infinite ammo.  Gameplay  The game is a third person shooter. Lock ons are required to shoot enemies. There is also a cover system in the game to help avoid taking damage.  Development  Gamers' Republic noted that Winback, along with Dynasty Warriors and Enigma, was an attempt for Koei to branch out from strategy games that they were known for. A gameplay demo of the game was presented at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo and later at the 1999 Nintendo Spaceworld trade show.  Reception  The PlayStation 2 version received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Said console version did slightly better than the N64 version, with its improved controls and graphics, but the voice-acting was criticized. Chris Kramer of Next Generation said of the latter console version, \\"The action is simple and the environments are not very detailed, but Winback [sic] is fun in an arcade-like fashion.\\" Jim Preston later called the former console version \\"a game with awkward controls and stiff action set in a boring world of boxes and bad guys. Skip it.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave both console versions each a score of 30 out of 40.

It is situated near the village of Abbotsbury in Dorset, England, west of Weymouth on a site around the Fleet Lagoon protected from the weather of Lyme Bay by Chesil Beach. The colony can number over 600 swans with around 150 pairs. Written records of the swannery's existence go back to 1393 but it probably existed well before that, and is believed to have been set up by Benedictine monks in the eleventh century.  History  The Fleet lagoon formed at the end of the last ice age as melt water flooded behind the already formed Chesil Beach leaving shallow salty water in which plants grew profusely producing an ideal environment for wildfowl and water birds. The Benedictine monastery of St. Peter's was established on the site in the eleventh century when King Cnut gave the land to his steward, Orc, and the monks managed the swans as a ready source of meat for use at their lavish banquets. The swannery was used by the monks until 1539 when the monastery was dissolved by King Henry VIII. The ruined remains of the monastery are still visible near the Church of St. Nicholas, Abbotsbury. The site was then purchased by Sir Guy Strangeways, and has remained in the ownership of the Strangeways family through fifteen generations up to the present day; an estate of some in Dorset covering Chesil Beach and Abbotsbury is still held by the Ilchester Estate owned by Mrs Charlotte Townshend, the daughter of the 9th Viscount Galway, a descendant of the first Countess of Ilchester.  The swannery today  Cygnets at Abbotsbury The Fleet, besides which the swannery sits, is the largest lagoon in Europe, and runs for about along the Dorset coast. It is brackish and tidal, but sheltered by Chesil Beach, and is a RAMSAR site of international importance and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and has been a nature reserve since as early as 1393. The swannery is at its westerly extremity. Abbotsbury Swannery is today a tourist attraction and the swans have become accustomed to the presence of visitors and allow close but respectful approach even in the nesting season when cygnets are on the nest. Before viewing the swans, visitors can look at the Decoyman's House which sets the scene for the visit with a display explaining how the colony has been managed over the years and how the present situation has evolved. Apart from the swans, the Fleet and Chesil Beach attracts many species of waterfowl and over 300 different varieties have been recorded leading to the area being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protected Area (SPA) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Nesting mute swans are usually intensely territorial, so it is unusual to see this many pairs in proximity to each other. However, the closeness of the nests can sometimes lead to problems as newly hatched cygnets can become attached to the wrong parent bird; to overcome this, rearing pens are used for a few selected families who need more privacy. The daily feeding sessions take place at noon and 4 p.m. A large mass of the birds gather round; children are invited to help with the feeding. At the end of July, the swans become flightless, for around six weeks, due to the moulting of their feathers. Once every two years, the swans are rounded up, so that they can be examined, weighed and measured and any new birds to the colony ringed. The round-up is undertaken by around 50 canoes that start at the eastern end of the lagoon and slowly drive the birds into the swannery bay at Abbotsbury. In the past the round-up has resulted in over 900 birds being caught and recorded, but it varies from year to year. Today, there are around 600 swans. They are free-flying birds and could choose to nest anywhere, but are obviously attracted by the Fleet Lagoon. Visitors can wander on small paths among the various nests, sometimes experiencing the birds' territorial displays. The swannery is open to the public between March and the end of October, and an interesting time to visit is between the middle of May and the end of June when young cygnets are present. Twice a day at noon and 4pm, mass feeding of the swans takes place.  In popular culture  Abbotsbury Swannery features on the cover of the Canadian new wave band, Martha and the Muffins 1980 hit \\"Echo Beach\\". It was also a filming location for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince; the actual location seems to have been a reed bed, but it is unclear exactly where at the swannery the filming occurred.

The army was commanded by Komkor Vasily Kuznetsov. It included the 4th Rifle Corps with the 50th and 27th Rifle Divisions, in addition to the 5th Rifle Division, the 24th Cavalry Division, and the 22nd and 25th Tank Brigades. The units numbered 121,968 men and fielded 752 guns and 743 tanks on 17 September. The 3rd Army saw its first action in September 1939, taking part in the operation in Belarus and Poland. The invasion was conducted under the terms of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which divided Poland between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and guaranteed that neither country would attack the other. Order of Battle on 2 October 1939: * 10th Rifle Corps ** 5th Rifle Division ** 50th Rifle Division ** 115th Rifle Division * 3rd Rifle Corps ** 139th Rifle Division ** 150th Rifle Division * 3rd Cavalry Corps ** 7th Cavalry Division ** 36th Cavalry Division * 15th Tank Corps *25th Tank Brigade Eastern Front After the start of Operation Barbarossa, it included three corps, including the 4th Rifle Corps (27th, 56th, and 85th Rifle Divisions), as well as the 21st Rifle Corps (17th, 24th, 37th and 50th Rifle Divisions) and 11th Mechanised Corps (29th and 33rd Tank Division and 204th Motorised Division).Leo Niehorster, 3rd Army, 22 June 1941 The 3rd Army took part in the operations of the Western, Central, Bryansk during the defenses of Grodno, Lida, and Novogrudok. The 3rd Army also took part in the Battle of Smolensk, where German troops captured the city in a difficult two-month campaign, and the Battle of Moscow, in which the Red Army's winter counter-attack led by Marshal Georgy Zhukov drove back Army Group Center over away from Moscow. During the second half of the Eastern Front, the 3rd Army took part in the Battle of Kursk, where numerically superior Soviet forces, using anti-tank defenses, defeated the German forces, thus stopping Operation Zitadelle and robbing the German Army of all hopes of victory on the Eastern Front. The 3rd Army took part in the Bryansk, Gomel‚ÄìRechitsa, and Rogachev-Zhlobin Offensives. During the final phases of the war, the 3rd Army took part in Operation Bagration, the East Prussian Offensive, and the advance into eastern Germany, where it participated in the Battle of Berlin. On 1 May 1945 the 3rd Army consisted of the 35th Rifle Corps (250th, 290th, and 348th Rifle Divisions), 40th Rifle Corps (5th, 129th, and 169th Rifle Divisions), 41st Rifle Corps (120th Guards, 269th, and 283rd Rifle Divisions), 4th Corps Artillery Brigade, 44th Gun Artillery Brigade, 584th Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, and other formations and units.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 May 1945 Post-World War II The Army headquarters was withdrawn to the Belarussian SSR, where it was reorganised in August 1945 as the short-lived Headquarters Belorussian-Lithuanian Military District. The Belorussian-Lithuanian Military District, according to a Czech internet source (valka), existed 31 Dec 44 ‚Äì 9 July 1945, whereupon it was succeeded by the Minsk Military District. By this time the army consisted of three Rifle Corps with nine rifle divisions. Later, all of them except the 120th Guards 'Rogachev' Rifle Division were disbanded. The army was briefly reformed with headquarters at Slutsk when the Belorussian Military District was being reformed, under the command of Colonel General Nikolai Gusev from July 1946, but was again disbanded in March 1947.

The hardness of a metal is directly proportional to the uniaxial yield stress at the location of the imposed strain. A harder metal will have a higher resistance to plastic deformation than a less hard metal. Processes The five hardening processes are: *The Hall‚ÄìPetch method, or grain boundary strengthening, is to obtain small grains. Smaller grains increases the likelihood of dislocations running into grain boundaries after shorter distances, which are very strong dislocation barriers. In general, smaller grain size will make the material harder. When the grain size approach sub-micron sizes, some materials may however become softer. This is simply an effect of another deformation mechanism that becomes easier, i.e. grain boundary sliding. At this point, all dislocation related hardening mechanisms become irrelevant. *In work hardening (also referred to as strain hardening) the material is strained past its yield point, e.g. by cold working. Ductile metal becomes harder and stronger as it's physically deformed. The plastic straining generates new dislocations. As the dislocation density increases, further dislocation movement becomes more difficult since they hinder each other, which means the material hardness increases. *In solid solution strengthening, a soluble alloying element is added to the material desired to be strengthened, and together they form a ‚Äúsolid solution‚Äù. A solid solution can be thought of just as a \\"normal\\" liquid solution, e.g. salt in water, except it is solid. Depending on the size of the dissolved alloying element's ion compared to that of the matrix-metal, it is dissolved either substitutionally (large alloying element substituting for an atom in the crystal) or interstitially (small alloying element taking a place between atoms in the crystal lattice). In both cases, the size difference of the foreign elements make them act as sand grains in sandpaper, resisting dislocations that try to slip by, resulting in higher material strength. In solution hardening, the alloying element does not precipitate from solution. *Precipitation hardening (also called age hardening) is a process where a second phase that begins in solid solution with the matrix metal is precipitated out of solution with the metal as it is quenched, leaving particles of that phase distributed throughout to cause resistance to slip dislocations. This is achieved by first heating the metal to a temperature where the elements forming the particles are soluble then quenching it, trapping them in a solid solution. Had it been a liquid solution, the elements would form precipitates, just as supersaturated saltwater would precipitate small salt crystals, but atom diffusion in a solid is very slow at room temperature. A second heat treatment at a suitable temperature is then required to age the material. The elevated temperature allows the dissolved elements to diffuse much faster, and form the desired precipitated particles. The quenching is required since the material otherwise would start the precipitation already during the slow cooling. This type of precipitation results in few large particles rather than the, generally desired, profusion of small precipitates. Precipitation hardening is one of the most commonly used techniques for the hardening of metal alloys. *Martensitic transformation, more commonly known as quenching and tempering, is a hardening mechanism specific for steel. The steel must be heated to a temperature where the iron phase changes from ferrite into austenite, i.e. changes crystal structure from BCC (body-centered cubic) to FCC (face-centered cubic). In austenitic form, steel can dissolve a lot more carbon. Once the carbon has been dissolved, the material is then quenched. It is important to quench with a high cooling rate so that the carbon does not have time to form precipitates of carbides. When the temperature is low enough, the steel tries to return to the low temperature crystal structure BCC. This change is very quick since it does not rely on diffusion and is called a martensitic transformation. Because of the extreme supersaturation of solid solution carbon, the crystal lattice becomes BCT (body-centered tetragonal) instead. This phase is called martensite, and is extremely hard due to a combined effect of the distorted crystal structure and the extreme solid solution strengthening, both mechanisms of which resist slip dislocation. All hardening mechanisms introduce crystal lattice defects that act as barriers to dislocation slip. Applications Material hardening is required for many applications: *Machine cutting tools (drill bits, taps, lathe tools) need be much harder than the material they are operating on in order to be effective. *Knife blades ‚Äì a high hardness blade keeps a sharp edge. *Bearings ‚Äì necessary to have a very hard surface that will withstand continued stresses. *Armor plating - High strength is extremely important both for bullet proof plates and for heavy duty containers for mining and construction. *Anti-fatigue - Martensitic case hardening can drastically improve the service life of mechanical components with repeated loading/unloading, such as axles and cogs.

Its goal is to support and develop student exchange on a local, national and international level. It is composed of around 15.000 members in over 530 local sections in 42 countries in Higher Education Institutions, including universities, polytechnics, and university colleges. The local ESN sections offer help, guidance and information to both exchange students and students doing a full degree abroad. ESN provides information about academic exchange programmes and student mobility in general. History In 1987, the European Community approved a plan to create a mobility scheme for higher education. Part of it was the Erasmus programme - an exchange programme for students to provide students with the opportunity to spend part of their studies abroad. In 1989 the Erasmus Bureau invited 32 former Erasmus Students for an evaluation meeting in Ghent, Belgium. This meeting was the starting point for the Erasmus Student Network. The lack of peer-to-peer support was singled out as a major issue and the driving force behind the creation of the Erasmus Student Network, named for the Dutch Renaissance humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam.ESN website, http://esn.org/erasmus By 1994 ESN had 60 sections in 14 countries. In 2004 the ESN network consisted of 170 sections in and outside Europe, from Scandinavia to Morocco. In 2005, ESN established its headquarters in Brussels and legally registered as a Belgian non-profit organisation.

Every year, representatives of the local sections meet at the Erasmus Generation Meeting (EGM). =National level= The national level represents the needs of international students towards governments and national authorities. Local sections in the same countries form a National Platform (NP) and, each year, they elect a National Board which represents the local sections on the international level. =International level= The International Board is the executive body of ESN International and consists of five Board members (President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Communication Manager and Web Project Administrator). Since 2005, the members of the International Board are full-time volunteers living and working in Brussels. The International Board is supported by the Secretariat composed of employed staff and trainees. ESN has five International Committees that work together with its respective international board member in charge. The Committees of ESN are - International Committee for Education (ICE), Network Committee (NEC), Finance Committee (FICO), Communication Committee (ComCom) and IT Committee (IT). International events Since its foundation in 1989, ESN holds Annual General Meetings (AGM), alternating in major cities throughout Europe. Other activities include annual Cultural Medleys (CM) from 1999 until 2012, and annual meetings of the organization's five Regional Platforms. These Regional Platforms are: * Central European Platform (CEP) - Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia * Northern European Platform (NEP) - Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, and Sweden *Western European Platform (WEP) - Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom *South-Western European Platform (SWEP) - France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain *South- Eastern European Platform (SEEP) - Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Georgia, Greece, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Turkey.

It was inaugurated in 1991 and sponsored by the Amparo Foundation, which was founded in 1979 by Manuel Espinoza Yglesias in honor of his wife. The museum is housed in two colonial-era buildings that date from the 17th and 18th centuries, which were popularly known as the Hospitalario. One of the buildings was the Hospital de Nuestra Se√±ora y San Juan de Letr√°n founded in 1534. This building was made into a college for women by Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza in the middle of the 18th century, and remained so until the 20th century. The other building is from the 18th century with a brick facade. It was part of the hospital for a time, then was converted into a ‚Äúrefuge‚Äù for married women. From 1871 to the 1980s, this building was the home of the Espinoza family. At that time, both buildings were restored and adapted for use as a museum. The museum‚Äôs permanent collection traces Mexico‚Äôs development over its history. It has one of the most important collections of pre- Hispanic, colonial and modern art in Mexico, with dates of pieces ranging from 2,500 BCE to the present day, covering the pre-Classic period to the Spanish Conquest. The collection contains jars, figures, steles, altars, sculptures and utensils, from the Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Huastec, Totonac, Maya, Olmec, Chichimec, Mixtec and Aztec civilizations. The Colonial Area is concentrated what was the home of the Espinoza Family, occupying eleven halls. These halls have been decorated to imitate how homes looked like during the various centuries of the colonial period. These rooms are filled with furniture, wood and ivory sculptures, silver items, Talavera pottery and well as oil paintings. Parts of the collection have been lent for temporary exhibits such as in Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City, including the museums emblematic pre- Hispanic piece, a throne from the late Classic Period from Rio Usumacinta, Chiapas. As a cultural center, the museum hosts temporary exhibits by national and international artists. It also presents conferences, seminars, concerts and workshops to support education, research and the creative arts. It was one of the first museums in Mexico to integrate technology such as multimedia systems and interactive CDs, which can provide guided tours in English, Spanish, French and Japanese through twenty one computer stations located in the fourteen halls of the permanent collections. Because of its collection and avant-garde use of technology, this museum is considered to be one of the most important in Mexico and Latin America.

Born in Tucson, Arizona, Shannon moved to Dumas, Texas when he was nine, where he originally started as a guitarist, though he started playing bass at the age of 21. He appeared with Johnny Winter at Woodstock in 1969. He later joined Double Trouble in 1981 and became a permanent member of Double Trouble until Vaughan's death in 1990. Shannon and bandmate Chris Layton later formed supergroups such as the Arc Angels. Early life Shannon was born in Tucson, Arizona, and moved to the Texas Panhandle when he was nine. He grew up mainly in Dumas, Texas, north of Amarillo on Highway 287. Shannon joined his first band, The Avengers, around age 13. The band members were Shannon (guitar), Tim Easley (vocals), Jim Love (guitar) and David Davis (drums). It would be a while before they realized the importance of the bass guitar, but eventually Shannon did. Their first gig paid them $80. That excited them so much, they gave half their paycheck back. In high school Shannon was in the band Ekos. Soon after high school he moved to Dallas and joined a soul cover band in 1966, initially called The New Breed, and later The Young Lads. Shannon recorded two 45s with this band, which featured Tim on vocals and Uncle John Turner on drums. Music career = Early career = Shannon had the first of two important meetings at The Fog in Dallas in the late 1960s. There he first saw Johnny Winter. Shannon ended up backing Winter, and they formed a project known as The Progressive Blues Experiment in 1968. They cut one album for Sonobeat Records titled The Progressive Blues Experiment before being signed to Columbia Records by Clive Davis for $600,000 in 1969. Shannon appeared on both of these Columbia LPs, each released 1969; Johnny Winter (self-titled), and Second Winter. At Woodstock, Johnny's brother Edgar joined them onstage. Johnny Winter ended up moving to a band featuring Rick Derringer in early 1970 that already had a rhythm section,Being former members of The McCoys, as was Derringer. Randy Hobbs (d. 1993) became Winters' bass player. and there was no room for Shannon or Turner. They landed in a San Francisco band called Krackerjack that comprised Uncle John Turner, drums; Mike Kindred, piano; Shannon, bass; Bruce Bowland, vocals; and John Staehely, guitar. Jesse \\"Guitar\\" Taylor played lead guitar with the band as well for a time during 1970 (there is a band photo as proof). According to Tommy's website, Stevie Ray Vaughan, known as \\"Skeeter,\\" was part of this band in its later Austin incarnation, along with Robin Syler on guitar. Among other personnel changes, Shannon eventually left the group and was replaced by Dwight Davis. Krackerjack remained a group from 1970 to 1973. During the 1970s, Shannon became involved with drugs, and began a cycle of jail, probation and rehab that would last for some time. He played with the Austin band The Fools briefly. Due to recurring drug arrests and failure of rehab in San Antonio and other locations, Shannon was finally sent to a \\"farm\\" in Buda and, as a result of his probation on release, he was not allowed to join any bands because of the pervasiveness of drugs in the music scene. Shannon became a bricklayer for a few years until he was eventually able to return to music in 1977. He played in a few unknown bands, then received a call from Rocky Hill, brother of ZZ Top's Dusty Hill. He moved to Houston to play with Hill and Uncle John, and in the late 1970s went on to play with Alan Haynes in the \\"Texas Boogie Band\\" (Shannon later played on Haynes' well received 1994 release, \\"Wishing Well\\"). Shannon also toured, opening for Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive and for KISS at the Warehouse in New Orleans. =With Stevie Ray Vaughan= Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble (Shannon at right) in 1983. Shannon moved between Dallas and Austin, and saw Stevie Ray Vaughan at The Fog with Vaughan's group Blackbird. Vaughan later formed a group called Double Trouble, and in 1980 Shannon wound up taking the place of the bass player, Jackie Newhouse, after seeing Double Trouble at Rockefellers in Houston. Vaughan was tapped to do some guitar tracks for David Bowie (including guitar on \\"Let's Dance\\"), and was then offered the chance to tour with Bowie, putting the new group's future in doubt. Ultimately, though, Vaughan's manager turned down the offer. Vaughan, Shannon and drummer Chris Layton would stay together as Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble‚Äîand become one of the most famous blues bands of all time. After joining Double Trouble, Shannon met his future wife Kumi and they eventually married in 1986. His drug-use returned, and in increasing volumes, often with the band leader, Vaughan. Eventually both realized a need to change that lifestyle, and both checked into rehabilitation in separate cities, becoming clean and sober. The newly healthy band was on the upswing, making popular music and gaining wider fame, until the helicopter carrying Vaughan crashed into a hillside after a show at Alpine Valley Music Theater, near East Troy, Wisconsin, on August 27, 1990, killing all aboard. = Later career = After a period of mourning, Shannon's musical career eventually continued. He played with Doyle Bramhall, Denny Freeman and Chris Layton in The Mighty Zor. Shannon was asked by The Rolling Stones to audition to replace Bill Wyman, but did not get the role. Other notable projects included the Arc Angels with Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton, and Storyville with Malford Milligan. He toured with Susan Tedeschi and, along with Chris Layton, toured and recorded with Kenny Wayne Shepherd. He and Layton played on Jimmy D. Lane's \\"It's Time\\". He has played with other notable musicians, including Eric Clapton, The Rolling Stones, Little Richard, Hubert Sumlin, Mike McCready, Jonny Lang, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, Eric Johnson, David Grissom, Mato Nanji, Jeff Beck, Lou Gramm and John Mayer. In 1999 Shannon, in company with Chris Layton, provided the rhythm section for the Debbie Davies release ‚ÄúTales From the Austin Motel‚Äù on Shanachie Records. In 2001, Double Trouble reformed, releasing their only album without Vaughan. Titled \\"Been a Long Time\\", it featured many guest performers (including Tedeschi) filling Vaughan's frontman role. His primary bass was a battered Arctic White 1962 Fender Jazz Bass with a red tortoise shell pickguard. He has been seen playing Yamaha BBs, Music Man StingRays, other Fender Precision and Jazz basses (mostly American, American Deluxe and Custom Shop models) and custom Fodera basses. Awards Shannon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Double Trouble in 2015.

It was a steam-powered design, using a wet heater engine burning decaline, with a typical range of about while running at . It was replaced beginning in 1942 by the electrically powered G7e torpedo, which did not leave a trail of bubbles in the water and thus did not reveal the location of the submarine. G7a's remained in service in other roles, including surface ships, until the end of the war.  Design  The G7a (TI) torpedo was 533.4 mm (21 in) in diameter, 7163 mm (23 ft 6 in) in length (with a type Ka or Kb warhead and Pi1 or Pi2 pistol), the warhead holding a charge of approximately 280 kg (617lbs) of so-called Schie√üwolle 36. It was Kriegsmarine's first operational torpedo (hence \\"TI\\" = Torpedo number one), and the standard issue torpedo for all German U-boats and surface torpedo-bearing vessels from ca 1935 to the end of WW2. The GA VIII gyroscope, as used in the G7a(TI) torpedo The torpedo was of a straight-running unguided design, controlled by a gyroscope. The TI was of variable speed, running a distance of 5,000 m at 81 km/h (5,500 yd at 44kt), 7,500 m at 74 km/h (8,250 yd at 40 kt), and 12,000 m at 55.6 km/h (13,200 yd at 30 kt). The 44 kt setting was used only by torpedo boats like the Schnellboote on torpedoes with a reinforced engine. The TI was the last naval torpedo of German design in operational use with the traditional standard wet heat method of propulsion. The torpedo was powered by an engine fed by a mixture of compressed air and steam. Decaline fuel was burning in a combustion chamber, creating steam from fresh water. The torpedo's speed was determined by the level of pressure (three settings for 30/40/44 kn) from the low-pressure regulator feeding air to the bottom of the combustion chamber. The resulting superheated steam powered a four cylinder reciprocating engine, in turn powering a pair of contra-rotating propellers. Though this system of propulsion gave the TI great speed and endurance ‚Äì the greatest of any production model German torpedo of World War II ‚Äì it had the distinct disadvantage of being very noisy and leaving a long wake of bubbles, common to most torpedoes of the period, with the exception of the Japanese Type 93 and submarine Type 95, which were fuelled by enriched oxygen. For U-boats, this relegated the TI for use mainly at night, when its wake was least noticeable, so as to not give away the element of surprise and the location of the submarine that fired it. During daytime, the electric torpedoes were favoured. The TI was initially fitted with a combined mechanical/magnetic exploder, which was inadequately tested (like the U.S. Navy's Mark 14), having never been live fired.Bekker, Cajus. Hitler's Naval War (New York: Zebra, 1977), p.132. In addition, because the G7a's performance had never been assessed, between deep running and premature explosionsBekker, pp.128, 133, and 137. (both also familiar to the Mark 14),Blair, Clay, Jr. Silent Victory (New York: Bantam, 1976), pp.160 & 413. the G7a suffered a thirty percent failure rate early in World War II.Bekker, p.125. The response of the high command, ignoring complaints and blaming the operators,Bekker, p.125. was also common to the U.S. Pacific Fleet's Submarine Force.Blair, pp.62 & 361. The problems were so serious, Admiral D√∂nitz said, \\"...never before in military history has a force been sent into battle with such a useless weapon.\\"Bekker, quoted p.132.  Use  There is at least one recorded case of a U-boat being bombed based upon her position being given away by a TI's wake. On 14 September 1939, U-30 was attacked by loitering United Kingdom Fairey Swordfish naval bombers when she fired a TI from her stern torpedo tube at the SS Fanad Head. U-30 was undamaged in the attack and served until she was scuttled at the end of the war. Though the T1 could easily be spotted by surface ships, it remained the torpedo of choice for some U-Boat captains until the release of the G7e(TIII) electric torpedo in 1942, largely due to the inferior performance and tendency of the G7e(TII) (the wakeless electric torpedo available to U-boats from 1939‚Äì1942) to fail to detonate, both on proximity and contact fuses. The TI were also issued in versions with programmed-steering gyroscopes, using the Fat I ladder search pattern and the Lut I or Lut II pattern running for attacking convoys.

Note 2) Black used only from shore torpedo batteries, red from surface vessels and blue from submarines. Note 3) Early versions had 4-blade propellers. Post war use: The TI were used post-war by several navies with different modifications and designations (Marina Espa√±ola: G-7a, Bundesmarine: DM11, Royal Danish Navy: T1T, Royal Norwegian Navy: T1 mod 1). Last known operator was RNoN with the T1 mod 1 (G7a with wire-guidance: Although four modifications to the torpedo were carried out over the years ‚Äì the last with computerised control in 1992 ‚Äì the same designation \\"mod 1\\" was applied throughout its service). In the RNoN, T1 mod 1 was used from FACs (until 1992), submarines (until the 1980s) and Coastal artillery shore batteries (until 1999). Other versions: * G7a(TI) Fat I: TI with Fat I programsteering 1) * G7a(TI) Lut I: TI with Lut I programsteering 1) * G7a(TI) Lut II: TI with Lut II programsteering 1) * G7a(TI√º): TI dedicated for use with Schulboote at U-Flotillen. The torpedo was equipped with the older type depth-mechanism, the lead ballast was removed from the water chamber and a special \\"light\\" exercise head was fitted (it was empty, i.e. no water and blowing mechanism). This was done to ensure positive buoyancy at the end of the run. Minor adjustments were also done to the air regulators and combustion chamber to lower the temperature of the drive gas (i.e. mixture of steam and pressurized air). These measures lead to a decrease in range, but achieved the overall goal of significantly less damage/losses of torpedoes and a higher number of exercise- shots for the crews. * G7a(TI√º) Lut II: T1√º with Lut II 2) * G7a(TIV): TI with changed buoyancy (max air pressure reduced from 200 to 100 kg/cm^2) for the Seehund midget submarine, with sinker-mechanism (never fielded). * G7as: TI with acoustic seeker (never fielded, nor designated a KM torpedonumber) Note 1) For launch with program setting, speed could only be set to 30 kn. Note 2) For launch with program setting, speed could be set to 30 or 40 kn.

The defining characteristic of a preselector gearbox is that the gear shift lever allowed the driver to \\"pre- select\\" the next gear, usually with the transmission remaining in the current gear until the driver pressed the \\"gear change pedal\\" at the desired time. The design removed the need for the driver to master the timing of using a clutch pedal and shift lever in order to achieve a smooth shift in a non-synchromesh manual transmission. Most pre-selector transmissions avoid a driver-controlled clutch entirely. Some use one solely for starting from a standstill. Preselector gearboxes were most common prior to the widespread adoption of the automatic transmission, so they were considered in comparison to the \\"crash gearbox\\" type of manual transmission. Preselector gearboxes were often marketed as \\"self-changing\\" gearboxes, however this is an inaccurate description as the driver is required to choose the gear (and often manually actuate the gear change). An automatic transmission is a true \\"self-changing gearbox\\" since it is able to change gears without any driver involvement. There are several radically different mechanical designs of preselector gearbox. The best known is the Wilson design.Peter Banjo Meyer: The Wilson Preselector Gearbox, Armstrong Siddeley Type; pbm verlag, Seevetal, Hamburg, Germany, 2011 Some gearboxes, such as the Cotal, shift gears immediately as the control is moved, without requiring the separate gear change pedal.  Benefits  Compared with the contemporary (non-synchromesh) manual transmissions, preselector gearboxes were easier for drivers to operate smoothly, since they did not require techniques such a double de-clutching. Preselector gearboxes also had faster shift times, could handle greater power outputs and had less mass and could shift under load. A design advantage of many preselector gearboxes is that the friction components are brakes, rather than clutches. This meant that non-rotating brake bands could be used for the parts which are subject to wear, which results in a simpler design than a rotating component such as a typical clutch. The wearing components could also be mounted on the outside of the mechanism (rather than buried within it), providing easier access for maintenance and adjustment.  Designs  = Wilson = 1931 Bugatti Type 51 cockpit, with Wilson preselector gearbox The most common type of pre-selector gearbox was the Wilson, which used an epicyclic design. A precursor to the Wilson gearbox was the manually- controlled epicyclic gearbox used in the 1901-1904 Wilson-Pilcher cars built in the United Kingdom. One of the company directors, Walter Gordon Wilson, had become an advocate for the benefits of the epicyclic gearbox, which allowed large torques to be transmitted whilst still being controllable through a small input force. Walter Wilson was a major co-inventor of the armoured tank during and after World War I, and was responsible for the 1918 British Mark V tank using an eypicyclic steering gearbox. The Lanchester Motor Company in the United Kingdom also produced cars with manually-controlled epicyclic gearboxes from 1900 and built an experimental tank (the Lanchester Gearbox Machine or Experimental Machine K) fitted with an epicyclic gearbox. Walter Wilson continued experimentation with epicyclic gearboxes for cars and in 1928 his \\"Wilson gearbox\\" was invented. Walter and one of the co-owners of Armstrong Siddeley Motors formed the Self-Changing Gears Ltd. company (initially called Improved Gears Ltd.) to design and build the Wilson gearbox. The 1929 Armstrong Siddeley Thirty was one of the first cars to use the Wilson gearbox. The gearbox was also built under licence by other manufacturers including Cord, ERA, Daimler and Maybach. The driver pre-selected the next gear using a lever mounted to the steering wheel, then pressed the 'gear change pedal' (often located in place of the usual clutch pedal) to activate the gearchange at the desired time. The Wilson gearbox was produced with a variety of clutches. The best-known is the fluid flywheel, used for touring cars such as the Daimler (Armstrong Siddeley used a centrifugal clutch). Sports cars used a Newton centrifugal clutch. This was a multiple plate dry clutch, similar to racing manual clutches of the time, but with the pressure plate centrifugally actuated to engage at around 600rpm. Pure racing cars, such as the ERA, avoided a clutch altogether and relied on the progressive engagement of the gearbox's band brake on lowest gear when starting. When fitted with a centrifugal clutch or fluid coupling, starting from a standstill involved simply selecting first gear, then the clutch would automatically engage once the accelerator pedal was pressed. On other cars, the gear change pedal functioned like a clutch when starting from a standstill. The Wilson gearbox relied on a number of epicyclic gears, coupled in an ingenious manner that was also Wilson's invention. Successive gears operated by compounding or 'reducing the reduction' provided by the previous gear. A separate epicyclic was required for each intermediate gear, with a cone clutch for the straight- through top gear and a further epicyclic for reverse. Four gears were provided, at a time when many cars (especially American ones) usually only had a three speed gearbox. This was owing to the sporting, or indeed racing, market for the Wilson gearbox, so that the ratios could be more closely spaced. Although this same arrangement of epicyclics would become the precursor for the post-war automatic transmission, the automatic transmission's use of a torque converter, together with the broad power band and excess power of US V8 engines, meant that wider-spaced, thus fewer, ratios were acceptable. Unlike the \\"crash\\" gearboxes of the first half of the 20th century, the gearwheels in a preselector box are permanently in mesh in an epicyclic layout. Changing gear with the Wilson box relied on the control of the brake bands that held each epicyclic's annulus in fixed position. The brake band to be selected was controlled by a rotating cam, moved by the gear shift lever. Only one band was engaged for each gear selection. This small hand-operated lever could not provide enough power to engage and lock the brake band, thus the need for the foot pedal. The actual movement of the brake bands was controlled by the 'toggle' mechanism, a distinctive feature of the Wilson design. When the pedal was pressed and released, a series or 'busbar' of finger-like levers were pressed upwards by a strong coil spring, against a series of light linkages or 'operating struts'. The position of each linkage was controlled by the gear selection camshaft. If the cam (for each gear) held the linkage in place, rather than allowing it to swing out of the way, the busbar finger would then press, via the operating strut, onto the toggles controlling the brake bands themselves. These toggles provided the additional leverage necessary to hold the brake band in place, under the force of the coil spring, until the pedal was next pressed. A further characteristic of the Wilson design was the use of self-adjusting nuts on each band, to compensate for wear. The action of engaging and disengaging each band was sufficient to advance the ratchet nuts and so adjust for wear by taking up any slack. = Other epicyclic designs =  Cotal  1954 Salmson 2300S; gear selection lever mounted on the left side of the steering column During the 1920s and 1930s, several French luxury car manufacturers used three-speed or four-speed preselector gearbox manufactured by Cotal. A unique aspect of the Cotal gearbox was the use of electromagnetic clutches (instead of band brakes) to engage the gears. A downside to this approach was that a loss of electrical power meant that the engine could no longer drive the wheels. The clutches were controlled by a simple dashboard or column-mounted switch, described as \\"a cherry on a cocktail stick\\", and relays. There was no mechanical servo action, so no need for the Wilson's cam or toggle arrangements and the change gear pedal.  de Normanville  During the 1930s, Humber cars were fitted with a four-speed preselector gearbox produced by Laycock-de Normanville. It was broadly similar to the Wilson, but used direct hydraulic actuation of the brake bands (selected via a lever on the steering column) therefore avoiding the need for a change-gear pedal.  Talbot  Several Talbot cars in the 1930s‚Äî such as the 1932-1935 Talbot AX65 Darracq‚Äî used an \\"accelerating gearbox\\" designed by Georges Roesch, based on the Wilson patents. The Roesch gearbox was vastly revised in both design and materials, resulting in a lighter gearbox that was able to withstand three times the power of the Wilson gearbox. This gearbox would automatically pre-select first gear when reverse was engaged. On engaging second gear, the gearbox would then pre-select third, and fourth when third was engaged. It would then cycle between third and fourth until another gear was pre-selected manually. Initial versions were produced without any form of clutch, however a centrifugal clutch was soon added to the design. Described by Talbot as the 'Traffic Clutch'. this was a simple device, with two radially swinging shoes (similar to a drum brake).  Viratelle  An early pre-selector gearbox was a prototype three-speed motorcycle gearbox patented by :fr:Marcel Viratelle in France in 1906 the design and production were very compact.. = Tiger tanks = The 1942-1945 German Tiger I armoured tank used a form of pre-selective gearbox that was built by Maybach and offered 8 ratios. The shift mechanism was hydraulic, to reduce driver effort. Clutches were used in combinations, allowing many more ratios than actuators. There were three hydraulic cylinders, each with two positions and controlling dog clutches for gear trains arranged on four shafts. The cylinders were controlled by a rotary valve on a simple quadrant gear lever and activated by pushing the lever sideways into its gate. The combination of the three cylinders permitted eight different ratios, although in reverse these were limited to just the lowest four. When a captured Tiger I tank was studied by the British in 1943, the report on the gearbox was carried out by Armstrong Siddeley motors.  Comparison with other transmissions  = Multi-clutch gearboxes = A multi-clutch gearbox avoids the difficulties of shifting gear by avoiding the need to shift at all. It operates as a number of separate gearboxes, each one controlled by a separate clutch, interlocked to avoid multiple selection. Selecting a gear is a matter of selecting the appropriate clutch. An advantage of this type is that it's simple to arrange remote operation, as there is no gear shift linkage as such, merely duplication of a clutch linkage.  Single ratio per clutch  This type of gearbox appeared in the March 1917 Oldbury gearbox trials testing different transmissions on eight British Heavy Tanks. Each ratio has its own shaft, and its own clutch. Provided the clutches are interlocked so that only one may be engaged at a time, the system is simple. In the early 1980s this transmission was developed for urban buses in the UK as the Maxwell, with a four-speed gearbox. UK buses are mostly double-deckers with rear-mounted transverse engines. Their use also involves much stop-start driving, thus heavy clutch wear for conventional gearboxes. The advantage of this arrangement was its use of four clutches, all easily serviced from outside the engine assembly, without needing to remove the engine. The clutches were multi-plate oil- supplied wet clutches. The first gearboxes gained a reputation for unreliability and in 1985 the original developers, Brockhouse, licensed them to Avon Maxwell Transmissions. A developed version, with an enlarged oil pump, was available as a retrofit for most UK buses. An unusual feature of this gearbox was the ability to engage first and second gear simultaneously. This acted as a 50 hp hydraulic retarder.  Dual-clutch  The idea of rapid shifting by clutch alone has also been developed as the dual-clutch transmission, in recent high-performance cars. This combines the simplicity of a shifting gearbox with the rapid shifts of a clutch-based design. There are effectively two separate gearboxes, each offering alternate ratios from the overall set, and the two clutches select which gearbox is in effect. Changes within the gearbox are done automatically, to predict which ratio the driver will require next. Provided that the next ratio has been selected correctly (i.e. the computer guessed correctly as to an up-shift vs. a down-shift) the shift itself is merely a rapid movement of the clutch. Unexpected shifts may confuse the system though and it must first select the correct ratio before engaging the clutch, giving a far slower shift.  Semi-automatic transmissions  Several other methods have been used to automate the process of clutch operation or gear selection, such as the automated manual transmissions introduced by several car manufacturers in the 1990s.

The AEC RT type, a bus commonly used in London during this period, used compressed air to actuate the gear shifts, while other gearboxes used mechanical actuation. Typical operation of London buses was they had a very low first gear, only used on hills, so the driver when starting would select second gear, depress and release the change gear pedal to engage the transmission, and then select third ready for changing gear on the move, all this done while the bus was still stationary. On starting, just the accelerator pedal was pressed, with the eventual shift into third gear made by simply pressing the gear change pedal. = Armoured vehicles = * 1937-1943 Matilda II * 1939-1945 Panzer 38(t) and the related Praga LT-38 * 1939-1945 Panzer III, using the Maybach-Variorex gearbox * 1940-1974 Daimler Dingo * 1943-1945 Stridsvagn m/42 * 1952-1971 Daimler Ferret * 1952-1976 Alvis Saracen * 1958-1972 Alvis Saladin * 1963-197?

She also served as regent of Cooch Behar during the minority of her son. In Baroda Jagaddipendra Narayan of Cooch Behar Indira was born the only daughter of Sayajirao Gaekwad III' of and his second wife Maharani Chimnabai (1872‚Äì1958). She grew up with her several brothers at the opulent Lakshmi Vilas Palace in Baroda, and was betrothed at a young age to Madho Rao Scindia, the then Maharaja of Gwalior. During the period of engagement, Indira attended the Delhi durbar of 1911, where she met the Jitendra, younger brother of the then Maharaja of Cooch Behar. Within days, they were in love and had decided to marry. =\\"The Letter that broke the engagement\\"= Indira knew that her parents would be aghast; many issues were involved: the diplomatic repercussions of breaking a standing engagement with the Scindia ruler of Gwalior, one of the premier 21-gun-salute princes of India; the scandal and universal opprobrium that would certainly ensue; also the fact that Jitendra was the younger son and thus unlikely ever to become king. Indira circumvented her parents by taking the initiative in breaking her engagement herself, a daring act for an 18-year-old Indian maiden of that era. She wrote to her fianc√© saying that she did not wish to marry him. In Baroda, Indira's father received a single-sentence telegram from the Maharaja of Gwalior: \\"What does the princess mean by her letter?\\" This was the first inkling her stunned parents had of Indira's intentions. The Maharaja behaved in exemplary fashion, writing an understanding letter to Indira's father which he signed off as \\"your son\\"; however, the disgrace was great and was felt keenly by Indira's parents. =Wedding= The breaking of the engagement was accomplished, but this defiance of her parents did not serve to reconcile them to her marrying Jitendra. Indira's parents apparently regarded Jitendra as a playboy from a feckless family; they even ventured to summon him and give him a personal warning to stay away. Nothing worked; Indira and Jitendra were equally adamant. Eventually, perhaps also in recognition of the fact that respectable alliances for Indira were now unlikely, her parents made a half-way compromise. They allowed Indira to leave their roof, proceed to London and wed Jitendra. Indira and Jitendra were wed at a hotel in London with no member of Indira's family present. They were wed by the rites of the Brahmo Samaj, the sect to which Jitendra's mother, Suniti Devi, daughter of Keshub Chunder Sen, adhered. In Cooch Behar It happened that at the time of the wedding, Jitendra's elder brother, Rajendra Narayan, the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, was grievously ill. Within days of the wedding, he died of ailments arising from alcohol abuse, and Jitendra became maharaja of Cooch Behar. The couple lived a relatively happy life and rapidly became the parents of five children. However, alcoholism was endemic in Jitendra's family, and he died at a young age, within a decade of the wedding. Indira was now not only a young widow and the mother of five, but also regent of Cooch Behar during the minority of her elder son. She faced her situation not merely with courage but indeed with verve. Her administrative skills were deemed by observers very mediocre, but Indira quickly gained a reputation for her highly-active social life, and spent prolonged periods of time in Europe and away from Cooch Behar. =Children= Indira was the mother of three daughters and two sons. #Her elder son, Jagaddipendra Narayan, succeeded his father as Maharaja of Cooch Behar, and was the last ruling prince of his dynasty; Cooch Behar was merged with the Dominion of India (later the Republic of India) during his reign. He had no legitimate children, and was succeeded by his nephew Virajendra. #The second son, Indrajitendra, married a daughter of the Maharaja of Pithapuram estate in present-day Andhra Pradesh. They were the parents of Virajendra and also of Uttara Devi, Maharani of Kotah in Rajasthan. #Indira's eldest daughter, Ila, married the Maharaja of Tripura. Her son took for wife the actress Moon Moon Sen; they are the parents of Bollywood starlets Raima and Riya. #Indira's second daughter, Gayatri, became the third wife of the Maharaja of Jaipur, and was a noted celebrity in her own right. #Indira's youngest daughter Menaka married the Maharaja of Dewas Jr in central India. Later life Indira's elder son assumed full powers as ruler of Cooch Behar in 1936. Indira thereafter spent a major portion of her time in Europe. Indira Devi faced many tragedies in her lifetime. Indira Devi lost two of her children: Princess Ila Devi who died at a very young age and Prince Indrajit Narayan Bhup, who died in an accidental fire leaving behind his wife Princess Kamala of Pithapuram. Maharani Indira Devi spent the last years of her life in Mumbai and died there in September 1968.

It is part of the environmental movement. The roots of Sierra Club Canada go back to 1963, when environmentalists in British Columbia affiliated themselves with the Sierra Club of the United States (many of these individuals were prominent in the founding of Greenpeace). Sierra Club Canada became a pan-Canadian organization in 1989, and was legally incorporated as a Canadian organization in 1992. it has approximately 10,000 members and supporters. Its main office is in Ottawa. Organization Sierra Club Canada is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors, three members of which are elected each year in an election in which all SCC members can vote. Two of the seats are reserved for youth members of the Club. SCC currently has five Chapters (Atlantic, British Columbia, Ontario, Prairies, and Quebec) and the Sierra Youth Coalition. It has offices in Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria. In addition, SCC includes several local groups working mostly at the municipal level. Executive Directors # 1989‚Äì2006: Elizabeth May # 2006‚Äì2009: Stephen Hazell # 2009‚Äìpresent: John Bennett Affiliates and subsidiaries SCC is also affiliated with the Sierra Club Canada Foundation and the Sierra Club British Columbia Foundation. The Sierra Youth Coalition is the youth-led wing of the Sierra Club Canada. SCC is a major member of the Canadian Environmental Network. Successes Over the years Sierra Club Canada has influenced environmental policy and legislative initiatives. The following list of milestones provides an indication of some of the campaigns that Sierra Club has been involved in, both in coalition with others and as a leading advocate. 2009 * Reducing smog pollution ‚Äì Sierra Club Canada initiated and led a joint industry/environmental group coalition that has brought together provincial and federal governments with other stakeholders in a collaboration for a comprehensive federal and provincial regulatory regime to improve air quality standards, an air zone approach to managing air quality, and a multistakeholder Air Quality Council to oversee the regime * Raising public awareness about oil sands development - Sierra Club Canada and Sierra Club Prairie raise public awareness about the adverse environmental impacts of oil sands development. 2008 * Stopping the Digby Neck Basalt Quarry and Marine Terminal - Working closely with local citizens' groups, Sierra Club Canada and Sierra Club Atlantic persuaded an environmental review panel to oppose construction of a basalt quarry and marine terminal, the ships from which would have damaged threatened right whales and damaged a community committed to sustainability. The federal and Nova Scotian governments accepted the panel's recommendations; the quarry and terminal were never built * Ensuring that greenhouse gas emissions are assessed in oil sands projects - Sierra Club Canada won a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Canada requiring that greenhouse gas emissions are assessed as part of the federal environment assessment for an oil sands mine, specifically the Kearl Oil Sands Project. 2007 * The cleanup of the Sydney Tar Ponds in Nova Scotia will not include an incinerator for toxic waste, which would have further polluted local communities. * The Mackenzie Gas Project has been delayed for five years and may never be built. * Federal funding has been committed to protect the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, which is a quarter of the Earth‚Äôs remaining ancient coastal temperate rainforests. * Phase-out of a federal tax subsidy to oil sands companies, as well as growing support for a moratorium on new Alberta tar sands projects. 2006 * The announcement that two million hectares of temperate rainforest would be protected from logging. The Great Bear Rainforest announcement is British Columbia‚Äôs decade-long effort that saw blockades, international markets campaigns, and an agreement between as unlikely allies as logging companies and environmentalists. 2005 * Stopping proposal to transport Great Lakes water out of the watershed via the Sustainable Water Resources Agreement. * Achieving the commitment to a minimum of 5 percent mix of biofuels in gasoline and diesel by the end of 2010. * The passage of Bill C-15, which is designed to bring an end to the dumping of bilge oil from ships, which results in the deaths of some 300,000 seabirds annually off the coast of Newfoundland alone. 2004 * Both the Ontario Government and the federal government accepted Sierra Club Canada's position against any diversions from the Great Lakes. The plan to allow diversions was halted. The Sierra Club was the first environmental group to identify the proposed Annex from the Council of Great Lakes Governors as a major threat to the lakes * The federal Ministers of Environment and Natural Resources jointly committed to push the car makers to 25% decreases in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010, directly in response to a Sierra Club of Canada campaign * The British Columbia government received a report from public hearings, chaired by Roland Priddle, clearly stating that British Columbians were massively opposed to lifting the moratorium on offshore oil and gas development. SCC and our BC Chapter had been heavily involved in the coalition opposing oil and gas * The Quebec environmental assessment agency (Bureau d'Audiences Publique -BAPE) issued a report harshly critical of the threat to whales from seismic testing ‚Äì the first step in oil and gas exploration ‚Äì an issue which SCC had been coordinating and to which we had appeared in order to give evidence. The Quebec government blocked testing at the mouth of the St. Lawrence in the Gulf * After years of pressure, the federal government came through with $4 billion for the clean-up of toxic waste sites, with a very specific mention of the need to clean up the Sydney Tar Ponds. By May, the federal and provincial governments signed a $400 million agreement to clean up the notorious toxic site. SCC has been the only environmental group, national or provincial, championing the plight of the local environment and Sydney residents * The precedent created by Sierra Club of Canada's victory in the Federal Court, quashing a permit for a massive mussel aquaculture facility in Cape Breton, was preserved when the company dropped its appeal. Although the aquaculture facility is proceeding under a new permit, it has been forced to adopt a phased approach * Nine municipalities drafted pesticide by-laws, and five adopted them in 2004. Often their efforts were supported by our materials and local volunteers. A total of 70 municipalities now have by-laws restricting the use of toxic chemical pesticides for cosmetic purposes. 2003 * Passage of Species at Risk Act * Reform of the Pest Control Products Act * Pesticide bylaws in 65 municipalities to date * Sierra Club successfully intervenes in Supreme Court of Canada which upholds Canadian Patent Board's refusal to patent Oncomouse (Harvard Mouse Case) * $4 billion committed to Toxic Waste Site Clean Up in the federal budget * Sierra Club was the only intervener in environmental hearings in Fort McMurray appearing to oppose any expansion in the Athbasca Tar Sands. * Arctic National Wildlife Refuge protected another year * Failure of the WTO in September in Cancun * Key role in developing a strong new National Forest Strategy ITER project In 2003, Sierra Club Canada lobbied extensively to stop Canadian participation in the ITER project. The SCC, arguing that the research project was a subsidy, influenced public opinion against the project. Canada is now no longer involved in ITER.

During the British Raj, the town of Cooch Behar was the seat of a princely state of Koch Bihar, ruled by the Koch dynasty. Etymology The name Cooch Behar is derived from the name of the Koch or Rajbongshi tribes indigenous to this region for many centuries. The word behar is derived from vihara. History Maharaja Nripendra Narayan =Early period= Cooch Behar formed part of the Kamarupa Kingdom of Assam from the 4th to the 12th centuries. In the 12th century, the area became a part of the Kamata Kingdom, first ruled by the Khen dynasty from their capital at Kamatapur. The Khens were an indigenous tribe, and they ruled till about 1498 CE, when they fell to Alauddin Hussain Shah, the independent Pathan Sultan of Gour. The new invaders fought with the local Bhuyan chieftains and the Ahom king Suhungmung and lost control of the region. During this time, the Koch tribe became very powerful and proclaimed itself Kamateshwar (Lord of Kamata) and established the Koch dynasty. The first important Koch ruler was Biswa Singha, who came to power in 1510 or 1530 CE.Royal history of Cooch Behar. Coochbehar.nic.in (1 January 1950). Retrieved on 18 July 2015. Under his son, Nara Narayan, the Kamata Kingdom reached its zenith. Nara Narayan's younger brother, Shukladhwaj (Chilarai), was a noted military general who undertook expeditions to expand the kingdom. He became governor of its eastern portion. After Chilarai's death, his son Raghudev became governor of this portion. Since Nara Narayan did not have a son, Raghudev was seen as the heir apparent. However, a late child of Nara Narayan removed Raghudev's claim to the throne. To placate him, Nara Narayan had to anoint Raghudev as a vassal chief of the portion of the kingdom east of the Sankosh river. This area came to be known as Koch Hajo. After the death of Nara Narayan in 1584, Raghudev declared independence. The kingdom ruled by the son of Nara Narayan, Lakshmi Narayan, came to be known as Cooch Behar. The division of the Kamata Kingdom into Koch Behar and Koch Hajo was permanent. Koch Behar aligned itself with the Mughal Empire and finally joined the India as a part of the West Bengal, whereas remnants of the Koch Hajo rulers aligned themselves with the Ahom kingdom and the region became a part of Assam. As the early capital of the Koch Kingdom, Cooch Behar's location was not static and became stable only when shifted to Cooch Behar town. Maharaja Rup Narayan, on the advice of an unknown saint, transferred the capital from Attharokotha to Guriahati (now called Cooch Behar town) on the banks of the Torsa river between 1693 and 1714. After this, the capital was always in or near its present location. In 1661 CE, Maharaja Pran Narayan planned to expand his kingdom. However, Mir Jumla, the subedar of Bengal under the Mughal emperor Aurangazeb, attacked Cooch Behar and conquered the territory, meeting almost no resistance. The town of Cooch Behar was subsequently named Alamgirnagar. Maharaja Pran Narayan regained his kingdom within a few days. =British Raj= 1907 Map of Bengal with Sikkim In 1772‚Äì1773, the king of Bhutan attacked and captured Cooch Behar. To expel the Bhutanese, the kingdom of Cooch Behar signed a defence treaty with the British East India Company on 5 April 1773. After expelling the Bhutanese, Cooch Behar again became a princely kingdom under the protection of British East India company. The Victor Jubilee Palace was based on Buckingham Palace and built in 1887, during the reign of Maharaja Nripendra Narayan. In 1878, the maharaja married the daughter of Brahmo preacher Keshab Chandra Sen. This union led to a renaissance in Cooch Behar state. Maharaja Nripendra Narayan is known as the architect of modern Cooch Behar town. =Post Independence= Under an agreement between the kings of Cooch Behar and the Indian Government at the end of British rule, Maharaja Jagaddipendra Narayan transferred full authority, jurisdiction and power of the state to the Dominion Government of India, effective 12 September 1949. Eventually, Cooch Bihar became part of the state of West Bengal on 19 January 1950, with Cooch Behar town as its headquarters. A geopolitical curiosity was that there were 92 Bangladeshi exclaves, with a total area of 47.7 km2 in Cooch-Behar. Similarly, there were 106 Indian exclaves inside Bangladesh, with a total area of 69.5 km2. These were part of the high stake card or chess games centuries ago between two regional kings, the Raja of Cooch Behar and the Maharaja of Rangpur. Twenty-one of the Bangladeshi exclaves were within Indian exclaves, and three of the Indian exclaves were within Bangladeshi exclaves. The largest Indian exclave was Balapara Khagrabari which surrounded a Bangladeshi exclave, Upanchowki Bhajni, which itself surrounded an Indian exclave called Dahala Khagrabari, of less than one hectare (link to external map here ). But all this has ended in the historic India-Bangladesh land agreement. See Indo- Bangladesh enclaves.

Its body is a slender, slightly curved plank carved from kiri (Paulownia tomentosa) wood. Its raw silk string is plucked with a tubular plectrum placed on the index finger of the right hand while a tubular ivory device similar to a guitar slide placed over the middle finger of the left hand slightly depresses the string‚Äîthough not so hard that it presses against the hardwood soundboard‚Äîto vary the pitch. Both the plectrum and slide are referred to as rokan. As with the Chinese guqin, from which it was likely originally adapted, the ichigenkin has no frets, so sliding tones are an important part of the technique of the instrument. Traditionally, the ichigenkin is used to accompany traditional singing, although there are also purely instrumental works in its repertoire. The instrument was once popular among samurai, literati, and priests, but today players of the instrument are very rare. The only unbroken line of ichigenkin transmission is Seikyodo Ichigenkin, whose current Iemoto (hereditary Grand Master) is Issui Minegishi. Minegishi performs widely in North America, Europe, and Asia, and occasionally with Canadian multi-instrumentalist Randy Raine-Reusch, perhaps the only non-Japanese ichigenkin performer, who composes and records new works for the instrument. A two-string version called a yakumogoto (ÂÖ´Èõ≤Áê¥, literally \\"eight cloud zither\\") was developed in 1820 by Nakayama Kotonushi.Rowe, Charles Edward. The Role Of Music In Omoto, A Japanese New Religion. School of Oriental and African Studies, Unpublished. p. 123. This instrument had a closed back resonant body and a bridge at either end of the strings. The yakumogoto has become strongly associated with the Shinto religion.

Early career Fydrych was born in Toru≈Ñ, Poland on April 8, 1953. He is a graduate of the History and History of Art Faculty of the University of Wroclaw. Fydrych began his independent public activity in the 1970s. He created a branch of the Independent Students Union (NZS) in Wroc≈Çaw and launched the Movement for New Culture in the city. He was also one of the co-organizers of a massive peace march that took place in April 1981. During the Martial Law, many Poles first made acquaintance with Fydrych's work through his picturesque dwarf images painted on building walls, covering up the paint that was used to cover up anti-regime slogans. The Orange Alternative Starting in 1986, he began organizing a chain of happenings, which were eventually named the \\"Orange Alternative.\\" These happenings involved hundreds up to thousands of participants at a given time. At its heyday in 1987, 1988 and 1989, Major Fydrych's \\"Orange Alternative\\" spread to other Polish cities, Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Wroc≈Çaw and Lublin being the most active. Altogether in the period of 1986 to 1990 the Orange Alternative organized over 60 street happenings. In March 1988, after distributing women's sanitary pads on the street (an item that was in severe shortage in Communist Poland), Waldemar Fydrych was arrested and sentenced by the Court of Justice to three months of imprisonment. He was released following general public uproar, including a letter to the military junta signed by the foremost Polish intellectuals and artists. Nickname At the time of the communist regime, when Fydrych was called upon to fulfill his military service obligation, he appeared before the army commission dressed in a uniform of a major. Unwilling to enter the army, he pretended the opposite, simulating madness. Asked to use an appropriate tone in regard to his superiors, Fydrych began addressing his interlocutors per \\"colonel,\\" at the same time describing himself as a \\"major,\\" a nickname which remained with him ever since. Recent activities Fydrych, alongside a group of students, participated in the Orange Revolution in Ukraine organizing events in Poland and Ukraine. He and the students made in the streets an \\"Orange Scarf\\" of support for the revolution. This scarf was started in Warsaw by one of the icons of the Orange Revolution - famous Ukrainian singer Ruslana Lyzhichko. On the night of the \\"Orange Victory,\\" the 15-meter long scarf was handed by Lyzhichko to President Yushchenko as one of the main symbols of the brotherhood between Ukraine and Poland. In 2002, Fydrych presented himself in elections to the post of the Mayor of the City of Warsaw. He also ran for mayor of Warsaw in 2006 elections, gaining 2914 votes (0,41%). His organization was Dolts and Dwarves (Gamonie i Krasnoludki). In 2012, Fydrych received Ph.D. in Fine Arts from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Poland after defending his thesis \\"Happening as the integrating and healing operation transforming art and reality\\" written under supervision of Professor Stanis≈Çaw Wieczorek. In 2013, Major Fydrych and his dwarf graffiti were featured in Brad Finger‚Äôs book ‚ÄûSurrealism - 50 Works of Art You Should Know‚Äù published by PRESTEL Publishing along with works of such great artists as Artaud, Duchamp, Bu√±uel, Dali and Picasso.

It was disbanded after the fall of the Soviet Union, with its divisions being withdrawn to Russia and disbanded. World War II =First Formation= The Fourth Army was created in August 1939 in the Belorussian Special Military District from the Bobruisk Army Group as an independent army.BOVO (00 –°–í–≠, √î.8, √ü.468.)(00 –°–í–≠, —Ç.8, —Å.468.) 00; Western Special MD, A.G.

Chuykov, the defender of Stalingrad. Its order of battle in that operation is listed here. Elements of the army, apparently 4th Battalion, 29th Light Tank Brigade, took part in the German‚ÄìSoviet military parade in Brest-Litovsk on September 22, 1939. When the German invasion of the Soviet Union commenced on 22 June 1941, the Army was part of the Western Front and had the 28th Rifle Corps (6th Rifle Division and 42nd Rifle Division), 14th Mechanised Corps, and 49th and 75th Rifle Divisions,Niehorster, Order of Battle, 22 June 1941 as well as the 62nd Fortified Region. General Colonel Pavlov, Commander of the Western Front, had decided to redeploy some of 4th Army‚Äôs troops early in 1941, and John Erickson wrote that 12th Rifle Division was accordingly moved into Brest, and HQ 14th Mechanised Corps to Kobrin, which in Erickson‚Äôs words, ‚Äòdeprived 4th Army simultaneously of its reserve and its second echelon.‚ÄôJohn Erickson, Road to Stalingrad, 2003 Cassel Military Paperbacks edition, p.86-7. It should be clearly understood that John Erickson (historian) was writing in the pre-1990 period when formation designations could be unclear, sometimes to the point of deliberate deception (Soviet 'maskirovka'). According to Sharp the 12th Rifle Division was identified by the Germans on the Western Front, but the unit was assigned to the Far East for the entire war. was assigned to Brest Fortress at the beginning of Operation Baraborossa The formation that appears to have been moved into Brest Fortress was 42nd Rifle Division. Facing the 4th Army across the Bug River was deployed the German Fourth Army, with twelve infantry divisions and a cavalry division, as well as Panzer Group 2. Some units faced several difficulties; when General Major A.A. Khorobkov, the army commander, saw his officers on 10 June, General Major Stepan Oborin, 14th Mechanised Corps commander, emphasized that more than half his soldiers were untrained recruits, that his artillery had received guns for which there was no ammunition, and that he only had enough lorries to make a quarter of the corps mobile ‚Äì the rest would have to march.Erickson, 2003 edition, p.90-1 On the eve of the attack, 4th Army suffered, as did many Soviet formations, from German communication sabotage. Units lost telephone connections, electrical power, and the Brest Fortress lost its water supply. From about 5 am on 22 June fierce fighting began around the Brest fortress, but the seven battalions around the fortress, from 28th Rifle Corps, were undermanned, disorganized, and slow off the mark to man the defences. Despite these deficiencies the final German reduction of the fortress took some time in the face of determined Soviet resistance. By 1600 hours on 22 June, 4th Army HQ was back at Zapruda, whereupon Front HQ ordered that 14th Mechanised Corps be launched in an attack to clear Brest and reach the frontier line. However the Army staff felt the plan had no chance of success, and so it proved; when the attack was launched the next day, only insignificant progress was made.Erickson, 2003, p.130-1, 133 Three days later Western Front ordered a general withdrawal to try to keep the frontier armies out of threatened German encirclement; 4th Army was directed to fall back on a line from Bytin to Pinsk. Further instructions came through from Pavlov after a chance meeting later the same day; to cover the concentration of reserve armies on the Dnieper, 4th Army was to hold the Shchara, the Slutsk ‚Äòfortified district,‚Äô and the Sluch river line. However the Slutsk fortified district, as the district commander reminded Khorobkov, had long ago been instructed to dispatch all its weapons to the Brest fortress (which was continuing to hold). The planned defence was thus practically non-existent, and Slutsk fell on 27 June.Erickson, 2003, p.150-2, 155 The Army took part in the defenses of the area around Babruysk. At the end of July 1941, the Fourth Army began to dissolve. The Fourth Army's staff members were absorbed into the general staff of the Central Front, and the troops were absorbed into other armies.

The field staffs of the 52nd and 54th Armies were used to fill the command contingent of the Army. The new formation was made up of the 285th, 292nd, and 311th Rifle Divisions along with the 27th Cavalry Division, a Tank brigade, the 2nd Reserve aviation group, and other artillery and support units. The Fourth Army participated in the defense and attack of Tikhvin from October to December 1941. On December 17, 1941, the Fourth Army was allocated to the Volkhov Front. From January 1942 to November 1943, the Fourth Army fought on the front in Volkhov and Leningrad while also doing many rear-area duties. Unlike in other parts of the Eastern Front, the Red Army was not making significant gains in the north by 1943. =Third Formation= The 4th Army was disbanded in November 1943 and set up again in January 1944 as part of the Transcaucasus Front. The staff of the 4th Army was formed from the staff of the 34th Army. The 4th Army was stationed in Iran until August 1945 in accordance with the Soviet-Iranian treaty of 1921.

Most of the divisions listed below joined the Army's forces in the Baku region toward the end of the 1940s. From its wartime divisions, toward the end of the 1980s only the 60th Motor Rifle Division ' named for Marshal of the Soviet Union F.I.

It is in the civil parish of Standon. History The earliest known settlement was founded by the Catavellauni, Celts from north- eastern France. The Celts began to arrive around 250 BC. The Belgae arrived around 180 BC. A Roman town existed just to the north of the existing village and the village is at the crossroads of two major Roman roads, Ermine Street and Stane Street. By 200AD the Romans had built a town, at the north of the current village, called Ad Fines. It was a regional capital and was also the start point for the roads to St Albans and Baldock ‚Äì all-important pre-Roman Celtic centres. Ad Fines had a large temple dedicated to Minerva. It also had at least two bath houses on the banks of the River Rib. The town survived until the end of the 5th century. The neighbouring villages of Standon and Braughing are recorded in the Domesday Book but Puckeridge is not although it was probably in existence. It survived the Black Death in the 14th century. A number of charities were established in Puckeridge in the 17th century, which gave grants of land that enabled the expansion of the village.http://www.puckeridgevillage.co.uk/ The village developed and thrived because it was on the coaching route between London and Cambridge; Samuel Pepys records that he stopped at the Falcon (now the Crown and Falcon). Eventually, the coming of the railway in the 19th century led to a decline in the fortune of the many Taverns and Inns in the village. The village is now a popular place to live close to good road networks leading into and around London. Near Puckeridge, there was Puckeridge DECCA tower, a free-standing tower radiator used for DECCA. Today The village houses three schools, small convenience stores and two pubs with a mixture of old and relatively new houses. HMS Puckeridge The village shares its name with HMS Puckeridge, a Hunt class destroyer which was lost to enemy action during World War II. On 8 September 2003, a 60th Anniversary Commemoration Service was held in the village to honour members of the ship‚Äôs company who lost their lives while serving aboard. This was attended by five survivors, members of the Royal Naval Association, British Legion and the Puckeridge and Standon community.

Taking place on the Eastern Front, the engagement was part of the wider Battle of Kursk, and occurred when the 5th Guards Tank Army of the Soviet Red Army attacked the II SS-Panzer Corps of the German Wehrmacht in one of the largest tank battles in military history. In April 1943, the German leadership began preparing for Operation Citadel, with the objective of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of the leadership and the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, Stavka, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. The Soviet leadership also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the Stavka Reserve. This army group, the Steppe Front, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured formation of the Steppe Front. On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht launched its offensive. On the northern side of the salient, the German forces bogged down within four days. On the southern side, the German 4th Panzer Army, with Army Detachment Kempf on its eastern flank, attacked the Soviet defences of the Voronezh Front. They made slow but steady progress through the Soviet defensive lines. After a week of fighting, the Soviets launched their counteroffensives ‚Äì Operation Kutuzov on the northern side and a coinciding one on the southern side. On the southern side of the salient near Prokhorovka, the 5th Guards Tank Army engaged the II SS-Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army, resulting in a large clash of armoured fighting vehicles. The 5th Guards Tank Army suffered significant losses in the attack, but succeeded in preventing the Wehrmacht from capturing Prokhorovka and breaking through the third defensive belt ‚Äì the last heavily fortified one. The German high command, unable to accomplish its objective, cancelled Operation Citadel and began redeploying its forces to deal with new pressing developments elsewhere. The Red Army went on a general offensive, conducting Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev on the southern side and continuing Operation Kutuzov on the northern side. The Soviet Union thus seized the strategic initiative on the Eastern Front, which it was to hold for the rest of the war.  Background  Map showing the German plan for Operation Citadel (blue arrows) to cut off the Kursk salient into a pocket, and the deployment of Soviet and German forces ahead of the operation. The blobs of red dashed lines show the position of Soviet reserves upon their arrival. The map shows the starting position of the II SS Panzer Corps, the initial redeployment positions of the 5th Guards Tank Army (\\"5. GpzA\\") and the 5th Guards Army (\\"5. GA\\"). Prokhorovka (not shown) is northeast of Pokrovka (\\"Pokrowka\\"). After the conclusion of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive. Strategic discussions also occurred on the German side, with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition. But for political reasons, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for Unternehmen Zitadelle (Operation Citadel). The German offensive plan envisioned an assault at the base of the Kursk salient from both the north and south, with the intent of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the salient. The two spearheads were to meet near Kursk. From the south, the XLVIII Panzer Corps and General Paul Hausser's II SS- Panzer Corps, forming the left and right wings of the 4th Panzer Army commanded by Colonel General Hermann Hoth, would drive northward. The III Panzer Corps of Army Detachment Kempf was to protect Hoth's right flank. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf were under Army Group South, commanded by Manstein. Air support over the southern portion of the offensive was provided by Colonel General Otto De√üloch's Luftflotte 4 and its major air formation, the 8th Air Corps. The German offensive, originally slated to commence in the beginning of May, was postponed several times as the German leadership reconsidered and vacillated over its prospects, as well as to bring forward more units and equipment. The Soviet leadership, through their intelligence agencies and foreign sources, learned about the German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, OKW, allowed them a great deal of time to prepare their defences. Employing defence in depth, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches, and anti-tank gun emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of the salient. The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of the salient until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive. This formation included Lieutenant General Alexei Zhadov's 5th Guards Army and Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army. = German advance leading up to Prokhorovka = Panzer IIIs and IVs on the southern side of the Kursk salient at the start of Operation Citadel The extent of the German advance during Operation Citadel (red dashed line arrows) The Wehrmacht launched its attack on the morning of 5 July 1943 and met heavy resistance. There were far more Soviet anti-tank guns, minefields, anti-tank ditches and overall Soviet resistance than had been anticipated, making a breakthrough more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, from the outset they were subjected to frequent counterattacks from Soviet tank units. Despite this, by the end of 5 July the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced through the first defensive belt on the southern side of the salient and reached the second, although the plan was to breach the first two belts and reach the third on the first day. Nonetheless, the panzer corps' penetration caused great concern among Soviet commanders, compelling Vatutin to commit almost all of Voronezh Front's operational reserves by the end of the first day. The III Panzer Corps met with stiff resistance as well and had great difficulty creating and maintaining a bridgehead across the Northern Donets River. They eventually succeeded by the morning of 6 July, but the delay in their advance kept them from protecting the east flank of the II SS-Panzer Corps. Late on 6 July, the 5th Guards Tank and the 5th Guards Armies of the Steppe Front began moving up from their reserve position. The 5th Guards Tank Army covered the over three days, and arrived at the Prokhorovka area on the night of 9 July, and the 5th Guards Army's 33rd Guards Rifle Corps arrived at the settlement on the night of 10 July. Both armies completed their journey and deployment intact without any substantial interference from the Luftwaffe. Slow progress by the XLVIII Panzer Corps caused Hoth to shift elements of the II SS-Panzer Corps on 8 July to aid the XLVIII Corps' drive toward Oboyan and Kursk. On the same day, the Soviet units counterattacked the II SS-Panzer Corps with several tank corps. These attacks did not destroy the panzer corps as hoped, but slowed its progress. By the end of 8 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced about and broken through the first and second defensive belts. On the following day, 9 July, a meeting of the commanders of the German forces on the northern side of the Kursk salient concluded that a breakthrough on the northern side of the salient was unlikely. Nevertheless, they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties, thereby tying down the Soviet forces there. Any level of success for Operation Citadel now depended on a breakthrough being achieved by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf on the southern side of the Kursk salient. = German attack toward Prokhorovka = A German soldier inspects a T-34 tank knocked out at Pokrovka that is still smoldering. Pokrovka is southwest of Prokhorovka On the evening of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the settlement of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had discussed it with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, and he did not want his corps to be caught crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German forces had faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer forces had been severely weakened. Soviet intelligence reports issued from 8 to 9 July reported that defensive works were being constructed by German infantry on the flanks of the 4th Panzer Army, and that German armoured formations were not present in these locations, despite the fact that Soviet armoured formations were situated opposite these flanks. Voronezh Front headquarters supposed the Germans must be reaching their limit, and on 10 July decided to set its counterattack to coincide with the planned Soviet counteroffensive on the northern side of the Kursk salient, Operation Kutuzov, which was set for 12 July. Starting on the morning of 10 July, the II SS- Panzer Corps began its attack toward Prokhorovka. Its 3rd SS-Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf attacked across the Psel River and secured a bridgehead. The 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler captured Komsomolets State Farm and Hill 241.6. The 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Division Das Reich defended the panzer corps' flank from Soviet armoured counterattacks. Vehicles of II SS-Panzer Corps advancing toward Prokhorovka on 11 July The II SS-Panzer Corps continued its attack toward Prokhorovka on 11 July. The advance of Leibstandarte was checked by the 2nd Tank Corps, which had been reinforced by the 9th Guards Airborne Division and 301st Anti-tank Artillery Regiment, both from the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. Totenkopf was resisted by the 31st Tank Corps, the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 95th Guards Rifle Division, and the 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 10th Tank Corps. To the south of Leibstandarte, the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 48th Rifle Corps' 183rd Rifle Division opposed the advance of Das Reich. By day's end on 11 July Leibstandarte had advanced deep into the Soviet third defensive belt. They had moved up the Psel corridor, cleared Soviet resistance at the Oktyabrsky (\\"October\\") State Farm (), crossed a 15-foot (4.6 m)-deep anti-tank ditch at the base of Hill 252.2 and seized the hill itself after a brief but bloody battle, leaving them only south of Prokhorovka. To its northwest, the panzergrenadiers of Totenkopf had achieved a bridgehead across the Psel and tanks had been brought across, but they had yet to take Hill 226.6 and there was a gap between Totenkopf and Leibstandarte. To the south of Leibstandarte, Das Reich had also met stiff resistance and lagged behind some . With its advance, Leibstandarte‚Äç was exposed on both of its flanks. Late on 11 July the 5th Guards Tank Army prepared for its forthcoming counterattack. Leibstandartes advance had disrupted Rotmistrov's preparations, as the assembly areas he intended to use for the tank army's 18th and 29th Tank Corps were in German hands by the end of the day, forcing him to hastily revise his plans and select new positions. The arrival of the 5th Guards Tank Army just days earlier was detrimental to it in two major ways: the tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoitre the terrain they would be travelling across, and the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire.

The black dashed line shows the railway running from Prokhorovka southwest through the Psel corridor (the strip of land between the Psel River and a tributary of the Northern Donets River).  Planning  = German plans for 12 July = Late on the evening of 11 July, Hausser, the commander of the II SS-Panzer Corps, issued orders for the next day's advance on Prokhorovka. It was known that the Red Army had dug in many anti-tank guns on the southwest slopes of Prokhorovka, making a direct attack by Leibstandarte very difficult. The plan was for Totenkopf to capture Hill 226.6, and advance northeast along the Psel River to the Kartash—ëvka-Prokhorovka road, and then strike southeast into the flank and rear of Soviet forces at Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was ordered to make a limited advance and secure Storozhevoe and Lamki just outside Prokhorovka, then it and Das Reich were to wait until Totenkopfs attack had disrupted the Soviet positions, after which Leibstandarte was to attack the main Soviet defences on the southwest slope of Prokhorovka. To Leibstandartes right, elements of Das Reich were also to advance eastward to the high ground south of Prokhorovka, then turn south away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet defences opposing the III Panzer Corps' advance and force a gap. The 8th Air Corps was to concentrate its effort to supporting the advance of the II SS-Panzer Corps, with the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west assigned limited air resources. Pavel Rotmistrov, commanding officer of the 5th Guards Tank Army = Soviet plans for 12 July = The 5th Guards Army and 5th Guards Tank Army of the Steppe Front had been brought up from reserve and reassigned to the Voronezh Front on 8 and 11 July respectively. On 11 July, Vatutin ordered the armies of the Voronezh Front to go over to the offensive on the following day. This Soviet counterattack on the southern side of the Kursk salient was planned to coincide with the offensive against Orel on the northern side, Operation Kutuzov. Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to destroy the German forces near Prokhorovka with his 5th Guards Tank Army, without allowing the German forces to withdraw southward. For the battle, Rotmistrov ordered his tanks to move forward at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the advantages the Tiger tanks had in the range and firepower of their 88 mm guns. He believed the more manoeuvrable T-34 medium tanks would be able to quickly close in and obtain effective flanking shots against the German heavy tanks. In fact, Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of Ferdinand Jagdpanzer tank destroyers and Tiger tanks possessed by the II SS-Panzer Corps. In actuality there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South, as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army. Soviet tank crews frequently mistook the versions of Panzer IV tanks that were armed with the 7.5 cm KwK 40 anti-tank gun, which also had extra armour added to their turret, for Tigers; therefore Soviet reports tended to overestimate the number of Tigers employed by the German side during the Battle of Kursk. Soviet air support in the southern part of the salient was provided by the 2nd Air Army and the 17th Air Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Stepan Krasovsky and Lieutenant General Vladimir Sudets, respectively. However, the bulk of the air support was committed in support of Soviet units attacking XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west of Prokhorovka and the III Panzer Corps to the southeast, and only limited numbers of aircraft were available to support 5th Guards Tank Army's attack. Rotmistrov's plans for a counterattack were threatened by events to the south. The III Panzer Corps managed to cross the Northern Donets at Rzhavets on the night of 11 July, and was about southeast of Prokhorovka, and advancing northwards. This threat jeopardised Rotmistrov's entire plan by threatening the flank and rear of the 5th Guards Tank Army. Early on 12 July, Vatutin ordered Rotmistrov to send reinforcements to the Soviet 7th Guards and 69th Armies facing the III Panzer Corps. He organised a task force under the command of his deputy, Major General Kuzma Trufanov, which consisted of the 26th Guards Tank Brigade from the 2nd Guards Tank Corps, the 11th and 12th Guards Mechanized Brigades from the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps, and the 53rd Guards Tank Regiment of the 5th Guards Tank Army. Other units of the Voronezh Front also joined the group on its way south. In doing so, Rotmistrov committed over half of his army's reserves before the Battle of Prokhorovka had begun.  Opposing forces  = Disposition of German forces = German Panzer IV and Sd.Kfz. 251 halftrack on the Eastern Front, July 1943 The German forces involved in the Battle of Prokhorovka were from the three Waffen-SS divisions of the II SS-Panzer Corps: Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf. On the evening of 11 July, the serviceable armour strength of the II SS-Panzer Corps was 294 tanks and assault guns, which included 15 Tigers. The armoured strength of Leibstandarte, Das Reich, and Totenkopf were 77, 95, and 122 tanks and assault guns respectively. Ten of the Tigers were to the north of the Psel River with Totenkopf, four were with Leibstandarte, and Das Reich had just one. Leibstandarte had advanced the most deeply toward Prokhorovka and was situated in the centre of the German position. A railway line, with a 30-feet high railbed, divided Leibstandartes area into north and south. The bulk of the division was positioned to the north of the rail line, including the division's 1st SS-Panzer Regiment and 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment, as well as its reconnaissance, artillery and command units. To the south of the rail line was Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment, along with the division's 1st SS-Panzerj√§ger Battalion. Das Reich was positioned to the south of Leibstandarte, and it protected the southern flank of the II SS-Panzer Corps. Totenkopf was positioned to the northwest of Leibstandarte. Totenkopfs 3rd SS-Panzer Regiment had largely crossed over the Psel in preparation for the assault. Leibstandarte placed its lightly armed 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion in the gap between it and Totenkopf to provide some flank protection. The unit was, later on 12 July, buttressed by the division's four remaining Tigers, commanded by SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer Michael Wittmann. = Disposition of Soviet forces = The main Soviet armoured formation involved in the battle was the 5th Guards Tank Army, which controlled five corps, two of which were Guards units, by 12 July: the 2nd Guards, 2nd, 5th Guards Mechanized, 18th and 29th Tank Corps. Altogether they fielded 793 tanks and 37 to 57 self-propelled guns for a total of approximately 840 armoured fighting vehicles. About two-thirds of these tanks were T-34s, while the remainder were T-70 light tanks, with some 31 to 35 Churchill heavy tanks as well. Not all of the 5th Guards Tank Army was present in the Prokhorovka area during the battle, as part of the formation had been sent south to check the advance of the III Panzer Corps. The Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army ‚Äì including the newly attached 2nd Guards Tank Corps and 2nd Tank Corps, as well as the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps held in reserve ‚Äì that faced the II SS- Panzer Corps on 12 July was about 616 tanks and self-propelled guns. In addition, five artillery regiments, one artillery brigade, and one anti- aircraft artillery division were attached to the 5th Guards Tank Army for the assault. The main attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army was conducted against Leibstandarte by its fresh 29th and 18th Tank Corps that had been brought up from the Soviet strategic reserve. These two Soviet tank corps together provided the greatest number of tanks in the attack, with the 18th Tank Corps fielding 190 tanks and self-propelled guns, and the 29th Tank Corps fielding 212 tanks and self-propelled guns. Infantry support to the 18th and 29th Tank Corps was provided by the 9th Guards Airborne Division. A portion of the 18th Tank Corps was directed against the eastern flank of Totenkopfs 6th SS- Panzergrenadier Regiment Theodor Eicke. On the southeastern wing of the 5th Guards Tank Army, Rotmistrov deployed the 120 tanks of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps. Later on 12 July during the battle, the 26th Guards Tank Brigade of that tank corps with its estimated 40 tanks were sent south to face the III Panzer Corps. The remainder of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps, supported by the remnants of the 2nd Tank Corps, was to attack Das Reich. Their infantry support was provided by the 183rd Rifle Division. The western flank of the 5th Guards Tank Army, which faced Totenkopf, was defended by the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps' 42nd and 95th Guards Rifle Divisions, which were supported by the remnants of the 31st Tank Corps and the heavily depleted 23rd Guards Rifle Corps' 52nd Guards Rifle Division. The forces of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps that were not sent south were held as reserve northwest of Prokhorovka, and they numbered about 113 tanks and self-propelled guns. Vatutin directed Soviet air assets to commit their main effort toward checking the III Panzer Corps' drive northward, and in supporting the attack against the XLVIII Panzer Corps. Missions were flown in support of the attack of the 5th Guards Tank Army as well, but to a limited extent. The 2nd Air Army had some 472 aircraft operational on 12 July, while the 17th Air Army had 300 operational aircraft.  Battle  At 05:45 on 12 July, Leibstandartes headquarters started receiving reports of the sound of many tank engines as the Soviet tanks moved into their assembly areas for the attack. At around 06:50, elements of Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment nudged forward and drove the Soviet infantry out of Storozhevoe, while elements of the division's 2nd SS- Panzergrenadier Regiment fanned out from the Oktyabrsky State Farm. The Soviet forces began a preparatory artillery barrage at around 08:00, and as the last shells fell at 08:30, Rotmistrov radioed the code words \\"Stal! Stal! Stal!\\" (\\"Steel, Steel, Steel!\\") ‚Äì the order to commence the attack. With that the Soviet armour of the 5th Guards Tank Army began their advance. = Ground engagement = In total, about 500 tanks and self-propelled guns of the 5th Guards Tank Army attacked the positions of the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July, doing so in two waves, with 430 tanks in the first echelon and 70 more in the second. Down from the slopes in front of Prokhorovka, the massed Soviet armour charged with five tank brigades of the 18th and 29th Tank Corps, firing as they came at Leibstandartes positions. As the Soviet tanks rolled down the slopes, they carried the men of the 9th Guards Airborne Division on their hulls (\\"tank desant\\"). The troops of Leibstandarte were not slated to go into action until later in the day. Exhausted from the previous week's fighting, many were just starting their day at the outset of the attack. As the Soviet armour appeared, German outposts all across the corps' frontage began firing purple warning flares signalling a tank attack. Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Rudolf von Ribbentrop, commander of a panzer company under the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, stated that he knew at once a major attack was underway. He ordered his company of seven Panzer IVs to follow him over a bridge across an anti-tank ditch. Crossing the bridge they fanned out on the lower slope of Hill 252.2. On the crest of the hill, Sturmbannf√ºhrer Joachim Peiper's 3rd Panzergrenadier Battalion of the 2nd SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment were being overrun. As Ribbentrop's tanks spread out, he and the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment were suddenly confronted by Soviet tanks of the 29th Tank Corps' 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades: \\"About 150‚Äì200 meters in front of me appeared fifteen, then thirty, then forty tanks. Finally there were too many of them to count.\\" The Soviet armour, firing on the move, charged down the western slopes of Hill 252.2 into the panzer company, and a tank battle ensued. Rotmistrov's tactic to close at high speed disrupted the control and co-ordination of the Soviet tank formations and also greatly reduced their accuracy. In a three-hour battle, the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment engaged the attacking Soviet tanks and repulsed them, reporting that they destroyed about 62 Soviet tanks. Later that afternoon, tanks from the 31st Tank Brigade and the 53rd Motorized Brigade overran elements of the 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion and reached Komsomolets State Farm, threatening Leibstandarte lines of communication and the division's command post located at Hill 241.6. The Soviet tanks attacked the division's 1st SS-Panzer Artillery Regiment, killing some of the crews before they themselves were destroyed by direct fire from anti-tank teams. Wittmann's group of four Tigers provided support to the reconnaissance battalion in its effort to protect Leibstandartes left flank, and faced off with the 18th Tank Corps' advancing 181st Tank Brigade. In a three-hour battle the Tigers engaged the Soviet tanks at ranges from 1,000 metres down to point- blank, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet tankers and successfully repelling their attack. None of the Tigers were lost. Later, elements of the 170th Tank Brigade engaged the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment, which was already fighting the 31st and 32nd Tank Brigades. Despite losing its commander and about 30 tanks in the fight, by early afternoon the 170th Tank Brigade had forced the 1st SS-Panzer Regiment back to the Oktyabrsky State Farm and reached the position of the 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion. At around 18:00, the 170th and 181st Tank Brigades penetrated the German line connecting Totenkopf and Leibstandarte. Assault guns and panzers supporting Totenkopfs 6th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment Theodor Eicke repelled the Soviet attack and re-established the line, forcing the Soviet tanks to withdraw to the village of Andreevka. The advance of Soviet armour down Hill 252.2 was disrupted when they reached the anti-tank ditch at the base of the hill. A number of tanks crashed into the 15-foot deep ditch while others moved along the edge looking for a way to cross. Heavy fire was exchanged between the Soviet tanks and two companies of a panzergrenadier battalion on the opposite side of the ditch. Peiper's surviving panzergrenadiers engaged the Soviet infantry and attacked the Soviet tanks with Hafthohlladung magnetic anti-tank grenades. Twenty of his battalion's half-tracks were lost in the fighting, some destroyed in ramming the much heavier Soviet tanks in an effort to stop them. Eventually, due to heavy Soviet pressure and dangerously exposed flanks, Leibstandarte withdrew from the Oktyabrsky State Farm and established firmer defensive lines to the south. = Air combat = The 2nd and 17th Air Armies flew 893 sorties compared to the German 8th Air Corps's 654 sorties over the southern part of the salient. Of note, most of the Soviet sorties flown that day were flown against the XLVIII Panzer Corps to the west and the III Panzer Corps to the south. Low clouds in the morning and thunderstorms in the afternoon inhibited air operations over Prokhorovka for both sides. Over the Prokhorovka battlefield the Luftwaffe gained control of the air. Formations of Stukas, including a small number of the G-2 variants, experimentally equipped with twin Bordkanone BK 3,7 cannon in gun pods, that were commanded by Staffelkapit√§n Hans-Ulrich Rudel, attacked the Soviet formations. They were joined by Fw 190 single engine fighter-bombers and Hs 129 twin-engined ground- attack aircraft, both equipped with anti-tank cannon. In particular, the Hs 129 formations from SG 1 inflicted grievous losses on Soviet tanks. The Stuka wings, StG 2 and StG 77, made their weakest contribution to the Kursk operation since the 5 July ‚Äì 150 sorties ‚Äì down from 1,071 on 5 July, but the small Ju 87G contingent proved effective. Luftwaffe liaison officers allotted to German ground forces were able to guide the close air support units to carry out pinpoint attacks. SG 1 and Panzerj√§gerstaffel/JG 51 flew 248 attack missions, virtually all of them in support of the II SS Panzerkorps. The 31st Tank Brigade, 29th Tank Corps, reported: \\"We suffered heavy losses in tanks through enemy artillery and aircraft. At 10:30 our tanks reached the Komsomolets State Farm, but due to continuous air attacks, they were unable to advance any further and shifted to the defence.\\" The tank brigade also reported: \\"our own air cover was fully absent until 13:00.\\" The 5th Guards Tank Army reported: \\"the enemy's aircraft literally hung above our combat formations throughout the entire battle, while our own aircraft, and particularly the fighter aviation, was totally insufficient.\\" The 36th Tank Brigade lost its commander to an air attack. German domination of the Prokhorovka air space occurred for several reasons. During the initial stages of the battle it was Soviet tanks that were hit and burned, obscuring the battlefield which made it difficult for Soviet commanders to develop a clear picture of the situation. Added to that was the failure to provide air liaison officers with Red Army forces, who were then unable to call for air support when the German assault formations first appeared. Whereas the German 8th Air Corps assembled powerful concentrations over the Prokhorovka battlefield, the 17th Air Army spread its forces thinly, to support other sectors; the Soviets dominated the air over the 4th Panzer Army's flanks, leaving the skies over Prokhorovka clear. The 2nd Air Army's fighter aviation had been reduced to 266, and this force was used in the fighter escort, not the air superiority role. The battle of Prokhorovka absorbed the 8th Air Corps' combat power to the extent it was unable to intervene to support the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, enabling Soviet defences to defeat the attempted breakthrough in that sector. The posture, dispositions and tactics on 12 July led to few losses on either side in air combat. The 8th Air Corps reported 19 aircraft damaged and destroyed. Only one German aircraft was reported lost in combat with Soviet fighters; the rest were victims of Soviet ground-fire. In return, the 2nd Air Army reported 14 fighters damaged and destroyed (German fighter pilots claimed only seven; though they claimed 16 aircraft of all types shot down). Soviet bomber losses are unknown. = Result of the engagement = German troops during a lull in the fighting during Operation Citadel on the southern side of the Kursk salient By the end of the day, Leibstandarte still held Hill 252.2, but had been exhausted by the effort of turning back five Soviet tank brigades. To its left, Totenkopf had succeeded in capturing Hill 226.6 and had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River to reach the Karteschevka‚ÄìProkhorovka road, northwest of Prokhorovka in accordance with plan. It was in position to outflank the Soviet forces at Prokhorovka, but was under pressure from Soviet attacks and its hold on the forward ground was tenuous. Forced onto the defensive by the attacks of the 2nd Guards and 2nd Tank Corps, Das Reich was unable to conduct its planned offensive manoeuvres. On the Soviet side, all the tank units under Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army involved in the battle on 12 July suffered heavy losses. Rotmistrov later wrote that the 29th Tank Corps lost 60 percent of its armour and the 18th Tank Corps lost 30 percent on 12 July. A Soviet General Staff report recorded: \\"Thus on 12 July, the 5th Guards Tank Army failed to accomplish its assigned mission. As a result of the frontal attack, the army's corps fought heavy battles against large enemy tank forces during which they were forced to assume defence.\\" Rotmistrov was forced to shift the 18th and 29th Tank Corps over to defence and reinforce them with infantry. They dug more trenches, dug in some of their tanks, laid new minefields, prepared anti-tank strong points and massed their artillery. The 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps made preparations to push Totenkopf back the next morning. Stalin was very disappointed and infuriated by the early reports of heavy Soviet losses in the battle and on the evening of 12 July, he berated Rotmistrov via a phone call. The same evening, he dispatched Zhukov, who had been overseeing Operation Kutuzov, to Vatutin's headquarters as Stavka representative, in order to assume control of coordinating the operations of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts. A commission was dispatched to investigate the cause of the high losses and the role of Rotmistrov and his plans in the battle; its findings were completed and submitted to Stalin two weeks later, and initially considering sacking Rotmistrov and hauling him before a military tribunal, Stalin eventually changed his mind after the Chief of the General Staff Aleksandr Vasilevsky interceded.  Following the main engagement  On the night of 12 July, Vatutin ordered Soviet forces to prevent any further German advance on Prokhorovka, destroy German forces that had advanced along the northern bank of the Psel River, and stop the III Panzer Corps from making further progress. Orders issued by the German command for 13 July instructed Totenkopf to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the Soviet forces around Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was to strengthen its front line and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with Totenkopfs attack from the northwest. Das Reich was to consolidate and strengthen its front line and prepare for an offensive operation to link up with the III Panzer Corps. = Further fighting around Prokhorovka = On the morning of 13 July, the 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades, in cooperation with the 95th and 52nd Guards Rifle Corps, launched attacks against Totenkopf. These Soviet attacks preoccupied Totenkopf and prevented it from attacking toward Prokhorovka. Around noon, Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to attack northward toward the Psel River to consolidate its front line with Totenkopf, while the division's panzer units were to attack toward Soviet positions northeast of the Oktyabrsky State Farm toward Prokhorovka. The 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion attacked the defensive positions held by the 42nd Guards Rifle Division and the remaining armour of the 18th Tank Corps, while the panzer units attacked the defences of 9th Guards Airborne Division and the 29th Tank Corps. These German attacks were repelled by concentrated anti-tank artillery fire. The 29th Tank Corps responded with a counterattack and penetrated German lines, reaching Komsomolets State Farm before being beaten back by direct fire from German artillery. That afternoon, Totenkopf was ordered to abandon their positions northwest of Prokhorovka and return to tenable positions around Hill 226.6. Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful, and Totenkopf completed its withdrawal by nightfall. = Termination of Operation Citadel = On 13 July Hitler summoned Manstein and the commander of Army Group Center, Field Marshal G√ºnther von Kluge, to his headquarters, the Wolfsschanze in East Prussia. The Allied invasion of Sicily on the night of 9‚Äì10 July, combined with the Soviet counteroffensive of Operation Kutuzov against the flank and rear of General Walter Model's 9th Army on the northern side of the Kursk salient on 12 July, and the attacks by strong Soviet forces at Prokhorovka the same day had caused Hitler to stop the offensive and begin redeploying forces to the Mediterranean theatre. He ordered his generals to terminate Operation Citadel. Kluge welcomed the decision, as he was already in the process of withdrawing units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted for the rest of the summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved. = Operation Roland = After the meeting with Hitler on 13 July, Manstein hastily put together the plans for Operation Roland, realizing that he only had a few days to conduct the operation before he lost the II SS-Panzer Corps due to redeployment. The plan called for Das Reich to attack east and south and link up with III Panzer Corps, which would attack to the northwest. Totenkopf and Leibstandarte were to anchor the western and northern flanks of Das Reich, respectively. Once the link was achieved and the Soviet forces encircled, Prokhorovka would then be attacked shortly thereafter by the combined forces of the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps. The goal of the operation was to destroy the Soviet armoured reserves massed in the southern sector of the Kursk salient, and thereby check Soviet offensive capacity for the rest of the summer. The orders for Operation Roland were issued in the closing hours of 13 July 1943. But after meeting with Manstein, Hitler countermanded the XXIV Panzer Corps' deployment to the Kursk salient, sending them on 14 July to support the 1st Panzer Army to the south. The assault began at 04:00 on 14 July. Following a brief artillery barrage, the 4th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment Der F√ºhrer of Das Reich struck out for the high ground south-west of Pravorot, evicting the remnants of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps from the village of Belenikhino following house-to-house and hand- to-hand fighting. Das Reichs 2nd SS-Panzer Regiment fought off a series of counterattacks and forced the Red Army units to withdraw eastward to a new line. Zhukov ordered the 10th Guards Mechanized Brigade of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps to reinforce the line. The 7th Panzer Division of the III Panzer Corps made contact with Das Reich, but Trufanov, commanding the Soviet forces in the gap, was aware of the threat and conducted a fighting withdrawal. The link-up failed to trap the Soviet forces, though they abandoned a substantial number of their anti-tank guns. Operation Roland failed to produce a decisive result for the German side, and Totenkopf began withdrawing from its positions north of the Psel, following orders issued late on 15 July, as the II SS-Panzer Corps assumed a defensive stance along its entire front. On 17 July the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts launched a major offensive across the Mius and Donets Rivers against the southern wing of Army Group South, pressing upon the 6th Army and 1st Panzer Army. In the early afternoon of 17 July, Operation Roland was terminated with an order for the II SS-Panzer Corps to begin withdrawing from the Prokhorovka sector back to Belgorod. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf anticipated the order and began executing it as early as the evening of 16 July. Leibstandartes tanks were distributed between Das Reich and Totenkopf, and the division was hastily redeployed to Italy, while Das Reich and Totenkopf were dispatched south to meet the new Soviet offensives.  Casualties and losses  Losses for 12 July are difficult to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, in part due to the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka are difficult to establish. = German = The II SS-Panzer Corps reported 842 soldiers killed, wounded, or missing for 12 July, and 2,672 for 12 to 16 July inclusive. Since the German forces controlled much of the Prokhorovka battlefield until 17 July, they were able to recover most of their disabled armoured vehicles. The II SS-Panzer Corps' logistics report for 12 July did not record any confirmed permanent tank losses. Other German sources show that three tanks of the II SS-Panzer Corps (two Panzer IVs and a Tiger) that were immobilized in the battlefield could not be subsequently recovered and therefore the permanent losses can only be adjusted to a possible maximum of three tanks for 12 July. A study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation attributed six permanent tank losses, not counting Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks or German assault guns if any. Archival files of the II SS-Panzer Corps and 4th Panzer Army show that the II SS-Panzer Corps permanently lost 17 tanks and assault guns from 12 to 23 July inclusive, which therefore represents the maximum permanent losses the unit could have incurred for the engagement on 12 July up till the end of Operation Roland. Archival data of the II SS-Panzer Corps shows that the corps had 294 operable tanks and assault guns on the evening of 11 July, and 251 on the evening of 13 July. Allowing for the possibility that some repaired tanks were returned to service on 13 July, these numbers indicate that at least 43 tanks and assault guns became inoperable during this period, which includes all ten Tigers belonging to Totenkopf and one belonging to Leibstandarte. An estimated total of 60‚Äì80 tanks and assault guns of the II SS-Panzer Corps were damaged or destroyed in combat on 12 July. By the end of 16 July, the II SS- Panzer Corps had 292 serviceable tanks and assault guns, almost the same number it had at the beginning of the battle on 12 July. On 12 July, Schlachtgeschwader 1 of the 8th Air Corps reported 11 aircraft damaged, all by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery, of which 6 were total write-offs. = Soviet = Destroyed Soviet T-34, 1943 A document prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised the combat losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive for all of its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self- propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of the losses reported in the document must have occurred on 12 July. Soviet personnel losses at Prokhorovka for 12 July were estimated by the historian Christer Bergstr√∂m to have been as high as 5,500 men. For equipment damaged or destroyed, David Glantz and Jonathan House estimate that the whole 5th Guards Tank Army lost at least 400 tanks in its attacks on 12 July. The Soviet historians Grigoriy Koltunov and Boris Soloviev estimate about 300 tanks and self-propelled guns of 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed on 12 July. The study by the US Army's Center for Strategy and Force Evaluation reports that the 2nd Guards, 18th and 29th Tanks Corps altogether permanently lost 144 tanks on 12 July, not including self- propelled guns. George Nipe estimates that 600‚Äì650 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army were damaged or destroyed while fighting both the II SS-Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps on 12 July.  Outcome  Debate exists over the significance and outcome of the battle. The German forces destroyed many Soviet tanks and temporarily degraded the striking power of the 5th Guards Tank Army, but they were unable to take Prokhorovka or break through into open ground before developments elsewhere forced the termination of Operation Citadel. For the Soviet side, the massive armoured attack of 12 July failed to destroy the II SS-Panzer Corps, but succeeded in exhausting the Germans and eventually contributed to checking their advance. Thus, neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS-Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives for 12 July. While the battle is generally considered a tactical success for the German side due to the high numbers of Soviet tanks destroyed, in the wider perspective the Soviets successfully completed their defensive operation at Prokhorovka and created the conditions for their decisive counteroffensive, Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev, just as planned. Ultimately there was no German breakthrough at Prokhorovka or elsewhere in the Kursk salient, becoming the first time in the Second World War that a major German offensive was halted before it could break through enemy defences and penetrate into their operational or strategic depths. With the end of Operation Citadel, the strategic initiative permanently swung over to the Soviet Union for the rest of the war.  Misconceptions and disputes  =Size of the tank battle and German losses= The battle has been widely described as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200‚Äì1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but this is incorrect as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from erroneous Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported during and after the battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that repeated this erroneous narrative. Some Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks and assault guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July. Comparing Soviet and German archives, the total number of tanks and other heavy armoured fighting vehicles such as assault guns and self-propelled guns deployed by the 5th Guards Tank Army and the II SS-Panzer Corps around Prokhorovka during the battle numbered only about 910. The II SS-Panzer Corps never had the number of tanks and assault guns attributed to it by Soviet estimates at any point during Operation Citadel, not even at the start when it fielded only 494. Even if the definition of the battle was broadened to include the III Panzer Corps and the portion of the 5th Guards Tank Army that faced it, the total number of tanks and other heavy armoured fighting vehicles comes out at a maximum of 1,299. In contrast, for example, the Battle of Brody during Operation Barbarossa involved over 2,000 tanks, up to 6,000 tanks over the duration of the battle, engaged in combat over a 70 km front. Nonetheless, the Battle of Prokhorovka is still regarded as one of the largest tank battles in military history. High figures for tanks lost during the battle have been widely attributed to the Germans, but these are incorrect. For example, Rotmistrov in his postwar accounts of the battle stated that the Germans lost 350‚Äì400 tanks, including 70 Tigers, and 3,500‚Äì10,000 soldiers on 12 July, and a Soviet General Staff study of the Battle of Kursk reported that the Germans lost 300 tanks, 20 assault guns and over 4,500 soldiers in the battle from 12 to 16 July inclusive. However, archival data and aerial recognisance pictures of the German units involved show that much lower losses were incurred by Germany, and much higher losses by the USSR during the battle.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16161262.2019.1606545 = Impetus for the attack at Prokhorovka = The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House asserted that the original intention of the 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving abreast toward Oboyan and then Kursk but that on 9 July, heavy Soviet resistance along the road to Oboyan forced Hoth to alter his plan disastrously by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from northwest to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intentions or planned for but was engendered by tactically-flawed late improvisations to the original German plan. That narrative has been disputed by the historian Steven Newton, who dedicated a section of his 2002 publication about Operation Citadel to refuting it. Using first-hand accounts of German officers who executed Operation Citadel and scrutinizing Glantz's and House's sources, Newton contended that the plan for the 4th Panzer Army to swing from the Oboyan direction to Prokhorovka was decided as early as May 1943, well before Operation Citadel had commenced, as German planners of Army Group South had always expected an encounter between the 4th Panzer Army and Soviet reserves that would arrive at the Psel River and Prokhorovka. Other historians have corroborated those conclusions. Newton also asserts that has always been the accepted narrative in postwar literature. = Surprise factor = Some historians state that the German troops did not expect the Soviet armoured counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However, other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of or at least anticipated the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka and so the troops could not have been genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.

They are native to Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, the western Pacific Islands and Malaysia, with the greatest species diversity in southeastern Australia. Plants in this genus have leaves with a few more or less parallel veins, and tube-shaped flowers usually with a white beard inside. Description Plants in the genus Leucopogon range from prostrate shrubs to small trees. The leaves are arranged alternately and usually have about three, more or less parallel veins visible on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets either singly or in spikes of a few to many flowers. There is a single egg- shaped to circular bract and a pair of similar bracteoles at the base of each flower immediately below the five sepals. The sepals are similar to the bracts but larger. The petals are fused to form a tube with the five petal tips rolled back or spreading, usually with a beard of white hairs inside. The stamens are attached to the tube near its tip and have a short filament and the tip of the style is thin. The fruit is a drupe. Taxonomy and naming The genus Leucopogon was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in his Prodromus. In 2005, following cladistic analysis, in a paper published in Australian Systematic Botany, Christopher John Quinn and others transferred some species previously known as species of Leucopogon to other genera, including Androstoma Hook.f., Acrotriche R.Br., Acrothamnus Quinn and Agiortia Quinn. These species include the former L. colensoi, L. milliganii, L. maccraei, L. montanus. These, and other changes proposed have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census (\\"APC\\") but not the change of L. melaleucoides to Acrothamnus melaleucoides. Further molecular phylogenetic analysis of Styphelia and related genera by Crayn and others in 2018 have led to further proposed changes, not yet assessed by the APC as at April 2020. These changes include moving 75 species of Leucopogon to Styphelia. The genus name, Leucopogon is derived from ancient Greek words meaning \\"white\\" and \\"beard\\", referring to the petal tube.Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 108 =Species list= The following is a list of species accepted by the Australian Plant Census as at April 2020 and by the New Zealand Plant Conservation Network for species occurring in New Zealand.

John Westland Marston (30 January 1819 ‚Äì 5 January 1890) was an English dramatist and critic. Life He was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, on 30 January 1819, was son of the Rev. Stephen Marston, minister of a Baptist congregation. In 1834, he was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, a London solicitor; but although he was not inattentive to the duties of the office after obtained a fair knowledge of law, literature and the theatre had much greater attractions for him. His evenings were devoted to the theatre and becoming acquainted with Heraud, Francis Barham, and other members of the group which gathered around James Pierrepont Greaves. He contributed to Heraud's magazine The Sunbeam, and himself became editor of a mystical periodical entitled The Psyche. Among its chief supporters were some wealthy ladies near Cheltenham, Through them he made the acquaintance of Eleanor Jane Potts, eldest daughter of the proprietor of Saunders's News- Letter, who had retired to Cheltenham. She was not, as has been stated, a member of the Earl of Mayo's family. A warm and durable attachment on both sides was the consequence, which resulted in marriage in May 1840, notwithstanding the strongest opposition on the part of the lady's family. Marston idealised and inverted his love story in his first play, the Patrician's Daughter (1841, 8vo), performed in December 1842. Marston had already produced a little volume entitled Gerald, a Dramatic Poem, and other Poems (1842, 12mo), respectable, like everything he wrote. Bulwer and Knowles had ceased to write, and for many years Marston was almost the only acted dramatist who wrought with any elevation of purpose. The Heart and the World (1847) was a failure, but in 1849 Marston, laying his theories aside for a time, appeared with a historical drama, Strathmore, which obtained great success, and which he himself regarded as his best work. It has fine literary qualities, although the author's inability to think himself into the age he exhibits constitutes a grave defect. The same may be said of Philip of France and Marie de Meranie (1850), 'a stirring tragedy, of which the verse has an appropriate martial ring,' and in which Helen Faucit produced a great impression. It is based to some extent on G. P. R. James's novel Philip Augustus. In the interim (1862) had appeared Anne Blake, another domestic drama, clever, but marred by such situations and denouements as only occur on the stage. In A Life's Hansom (1857) the domestic and historical elements are in some measure blended, the action being laid at the revolution of 1688. Such a piece might be easily produced by a man of Mareton's literary ability, but his next tragi-comedy, A Hard Struggle (1858), required genuine feeling in the author and great command over the resources of the stage. Being written in prose, it produces a greater impression of reality than his more ambitious efforts; it drew tears and enthusiastic praise from Dickens, and obtained a greater success than any of his pieces, owing in part to the powerful acting of Dillon. After his marriage, Marston lived entirely in London, except for occasional visits to France and short lecturing tours in Scotland and Lancashire. He had become well known in London literary society, especially to Dickens and his circle, and had taken a part in Bulwer's comedy of Not so bad as we seem, acted for the benefit of the Guild of Literature and Art. About the same time a tragedy on the history of Montezuma, which would have afforded ample scope for scenic display, was written for and purchased by Charles Kean, but never produced. In 1837, Marston undertook the editorship of the National Magazine in conjunction with John Saunders. The early numbers had excellent contributions from Sydney Dobell, Mrs. Crowe, and other writers of mark, and illustrations after young artists of genius like Arthur Hughes and W. L. Windus, and with adequate capital the enterprise would probably have succeeded. Relinquishing it, and also renouncing vain attempts in fiction, for which, strangely enough, he did not appear to possess the slightest qualification, Marston returned to the theatre, and produced successively The Wife's Portrait (1862) and Pure Gold (1863), prose dramas of little account; Donna Diana (1863), the best of all his plays, but mainly taken from Moreto's masterpiece, El Desden con el Desden; and The Favourite of Fortune (1866). It achieved a conspicuous success upon its production. The same remark applies to A Hero of Romance, adapted from Octave Feuillet in 1867, and Life for Life (1869), written for Miss Neilson. Broken Spells followed in 1873, but with his last play, Under Fire (1885), he experienced a mortifying failure. The piece was the weakest he ever wrote, and he had entirely lost touch with the time. From about 1863, Marston contributed much poetical criticism to the Athen√¶um. The celebrated review of Atalanta in Calydon was written by him. Criticism, indeed, seemed rather his forte than original composition. His theoretical knowledge of the histrionic art was also profound; but though he showed little disposition to cultivate it practically, he was an excellent mimic, and Miss Neilson, like many other actors and actresses, owed much to his tuition. No one judged an actor more accurately, and the admonitions of few were more valuable. He proved his power as a critic of acting in his Our Recent Actors: Recollect ions of late distinguished Performers of both Sexes, 1888. From 1860 to about 1874, Marston's circumstances were prosperous, and his house near the Regent's Park was a favourite meeting-place for poets, actors, and literary men. The latter years of his life were clouded by calamity, especially the successive deaths of his wife in 1870, of his two daughters, Eleanor, wife of Arthur O'Shaughnessy, in February 1879, and Cicely in July 1878, and of his gifted and only son, Philip Bourke Marston. His circumstances also became much impaired; but his friend Mr. Henry Irving generously organised (1 June 1887) a special performance of Werner for his benefit at the Lyceum Theatre. The full receipts, amounting to ¬£928 16s., were paid to Marston; all the expenses being borne by Mr. Irving. Marston died at his lodgings in the Euston Road, 5 January 1890, after a long illness, and was interred with his wife and children in Highgate cemetery.

Field of view ~1.6 cm across. Purplish red = pyrope garnet. Bright green = chromian diopside. Dark greenish-black = orthopyroxene. Olive-green= olivine. Lherzolite is a type of ultramafic igneous rock. It is a coarse-grained rock consisting of 40 to 90% olivine along with significant orthopyroxene and lesser amounts of calcic chromium-rich clinopyroxene. Minor minerals include chromium and aluminium spinels and garnets. Plagioclase can occur in lherzolites and other peridotites that crystallize at relatively shallow depths (20 ‚Äì 30 km). At greater depth plagioclase is unstable and is replaced by spinel. At approximately 90 km depth, pyrope garnet becomes the stable aluminous phase. Garnet lherzolite is a major constituent of the Earth's upper mantle (extending to ~300 km depth). Lherzolite is known from the lower ultramafic part of ophiolite complexes (although harzburgite is more common in this setting), from alpine-type peridotite massifs, from fracture zones adjacent to mid-oceanic ridges, and as xenoliths in kimberlite pipes and alkali basalts. Partial melting of spinel lherzolite is one of the primary sources of basaltic magma. The name is derived from its type locality, the Lherz Massif (an alpine peridotite complex, also known as orogenic lherzolite complex), at √âtang de Lers, near Massat in the French Pyrenees; √âtang de Lherz is the archaic spelling of this location. The Lherz massif also contains harzburgite and dunite, as well as layers of spinel pyroxenite, garnet pyroxenite, and hornblendite. The layers represent partial melts extracted from the host peridotite during decompression in the mantle long before emplacement into the crust. The Lherz massif is unique because it has been emplaced into Paleozoic carbonates (limestones and dolomites), which form mixed breccias of limestone- lherzolite around the margins of the massif.

The case drew national attention by focusing on the safety of children in casinos and on the revelation that Strohmeyer's friend, David Cash Jr., said he saw the crime in progress but did not stop it.Teen pleads guilty in Nevada casino killing of girl, CNN.com, September 8, 1998. (retrieved on August 25, 2008). The crime In the early morning hours of May 25, 1997, two males, Jeremy Strohmeyer (age 18) and David Cash Jr. (age 17), were at the Primadonna Resort & Casino at Primm, Nevada, near the California state line. The two young men had arrived at the gambling establishment, accompanied by Cash's father, from their homes in Long Beach. Strohmeyer was a student at Wilson High School in Long Beach. \\"While Wilson High classmate Jeremy Strohmeyer drew gasps of media attention in late May with his arrest on charges he raped and strangled a 7-year-old at a Nevada casino,[...]\\" At around 4 a.m., Strohmeyer began repeatedly making apparently \\"playful\\" contact with 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson, who was roaming the casino alone. The young girl's father was gambling and drinking. Her father left Sherrice in the care of her 14-year-old brother, Harold, in the casino's arcade. This resulted in Sherrice running around unmonitored. The girl had been returned to her father several times through the day, having been found alone by security. Eventually, Strohmeyer followed Sherrice into a women's restroom. While in the restroom, the two began throwing wet paper wads at one another. Sherrice then reportedly tossed a yellow plastic \\"Wet Floor\\" sign at Strohmeyer. At around this time Strohmeyer's friend, David Cash, entered the restroom and witnessed Strohmeyer forcibly taking Iverson into a stall. When Cash looked in from the adjacent stall, he saw Strohmeyer holding his left hand over Iverson's mouth and fondling her with his right. After this, Cash left the restroom and was followed 20 minutes later by Strohmeyer, who immediately confessed to him that he had molested and killed the girl.Nevada v. Strohmeyer - \\"Casino Child Murder Trial\\", CourtTV (retrieved on August 25, 2008). Three days later, Strohmeyer was taken into custody at his home. Two classmates in Long Beach had identified him after security tape footage captured by cameras at the casino was released by Nevada police and played on the television news. Strohmeyer was charged with first-degree murder, first- degree kidnapping, and sexual assault of a minor. When questioned by police, Strohmeyer stated that he molested Iverson and strangled her to stifle her screams. Before leaving, Strohmeyer noticed Iverson was still alive and twisted her head in an attempt to break her neck. After hearing a loud popping sound, he rested her body in a sitting position on the toilet with her feet in the bowl. Strohmeyer's attorneys later tried to have the confession suppressed because he was not given legal counsel. However, the police claimed that Strohmeyer waived his right to have an attorney present during questioning. Plea bargain Strohmeyer's defense attorney was Leslie Abramson, who represented many high-profile clients, including the Menendez brothers. Strohmeyer claimed he was high on alcohol and drugs at the time and did not remember committing the crimes. It was even suggested that perhaps the witness, David Cash, had, in fact, been the one to murder Sherrice, as Strohmeyer claimed to have no recollection of his actions and the witness was the one to actually tell him what he had seen him doing in the bathroom that night. Abramson also noted that Strohmeyer's biological father is in prison and his biological mother is in a mental hospital. Strohmeyer's trial was scheduled to begin in September 1998. Prosecutors claimed that Strohmeyer had asked his former girlfriend to dress up as a school girl for him. Strohmeyer was originally facing a possible death sentence for the murder (had the case gone to trial), but hours before his trial was to start, Abramson entered a plea bargain on his behalf. On September 8, 1998, Strohmeyer pleaded guilty to four charges: first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, sexual assault on a minor with substantial bodily harm and sexual assault on a minor. On October 14, 1998, he was sentenced to four life terms, one for each crime he pleaded guilty to, to be served consecutively without possibility of parole.Killer of Girl in Casino Gets Life Term, New York Times, October 15, 1998. (retrieved on August 25, 2008) After the trial =Imprisonment= Strohmeyer was initially incarcerated at Ely State Prison, a maximum security prison located north of Ely, Nevada where most prisoners in Nevada who are serving life without parole are imprisoned for at least the early portion of their sentences. He was placed in administrative segregation, meaning that he was not placed in the general inmate population, but rather in his own cell in a special secured section.Strohmeyer taken to Ely prison, Associated Press (reprinted by Las Vegas RJ News), October 24, 1998 (retrieved on August 31, 2008).

In 2000, he was unsuccessfully defended by Camille Abate.LAS VEGAS RJ:NEWS: Justice unchanged for killer Strohmeyer recanted his confession and accused Abramson of lying to him and bullying him into pleading guilty in order to cover up her misunderstanding of Nevada law. Strohmeyer's new attorneys also suggested that Abramson wanted him to plead guilty because Strohmeyer's parents could not afford to pay her additional fees if the case went to trial. Abramson denied all the allegations.Abramson testifies she didn't force Strohmeyer to take plea by Harriet Ryan, Court TV Online, February 8, 2000. Retrieved on August 25, 2008 Ultimately, his appeal was rejected. In 2001, the Nevada Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Strohmeyer to withdraw his guilty plea.

They claimed that social workers deliberately withheld crucial information that would have stopped them from adopting him as an infant. Specifically, they claimed they were never told that Strohmeyer's biological mother had severe mental problems, including that she suffered from chronic schizophrenia and had been hospitalized more than 60 times prior to Strohmeyer's birth.Adoptive parents of convicted killer sue social workers by Jennifer Auther, CNN.com, October 27, 1999 (retrieved on August 25, 2008). However, the Strohmeyers have stated that they will continue to support their adopted son despite the fact that he will almost certainly spend the rest of his life in prison. =David Cash= Sherrice Iverson's mother demanded that David Cash Jr., also be charged as an accessory to murder, but authorities stated there was insufficient evidence connecting him to the actual crime, and Cash was never prosecuted for any offense related to the murder. In the weeks following Strohmeyer's arrest, Cash told the Los Angeles Times that he did not dwell on the murder of Sherrice Iverson. \\"I'm not going to get upset over somebody else's life. I just worry about myself first. I'm not going to lose sleep over somebody else's problems.\\" He also told the newspaper that the publicity surrounding the case had made it easier for him to \\"score with women.\\" Cash also told the Long Beach Press-Telegram: \\"I'm no idiot ...

Two local Los Angeles radio hosts, Tim Conway Jr. and Doug Steckler, subsequently held a rally to have Cash expelled from the University of California at Berkeley, but University officials stated that they had no basis to remove him since he was not convicted of any crime. Cash did express equivocal remorse over Iverson's death in a radio interview, stating that \\"I have a lot of remorse toward the Iverson family. It was a very tragic event...The simple fact remains I don't know this little girl ... I don't know people in Panama or Africa who are killed every day, so I can't feel remorse for them. The only person I know is Jeremy Strohmeyer\\", but still insisted that he did nothing wrong.Protesters want student expelled , The Daily Bruin, August 31, 1998 (retrieved on August 31, 2008) =The Sherrice Iverson bill= Sherrice Iverson's murder led to the passage of Nevada State Assembly Bill 267, requiring people to report to authorities when they have reasonable suspicions that a child younger than 18 is being sexually abused or violently treated. The impetus for the bill stemmed from Cash's inaction during the commission of the crime. The \\"Sherrice Iverson\\" bill, introduced by Nevada State Assembly Majority Leader Richard Perkins (D-Henderson), provides for a fine and possible jail time for anyone who fails to report a crime of the nature that led to the creation of the bill. The bill was enacted in 2000.https://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/19/local/me-23477 Sherrice Iverson's murder also led to the passage of California Assembly Bill 1422, the Sherrice Iverson Child Victim Protection Act, which added section 152.3 to California's Penal Code. This duty to rescue law requires that a person notify law enforcement if they witness a murder, rape, or any lewd or lascivious act, where the victim is under 14 years old. =Increased Security at Nevada Casinos= As a result of this murder, hotels in Nevada increased security in their arcades, often having a security guard even in small arcades.

In the days before elevators this was the least prestigious position in a building, at the very top of the stairs.  Etymology  The word entered Middle English through Old French with a military connotation of watchtower, garrison or billet ‚Äì a place for guards or soldiers to be quartered in a house. Like garrison, it comes from an Old French word of ultimately Germanic origin meaning to provide or defend..  History  In the later 1800s, garrets became one of the defining features of Second Empire architecture in Paris, France, where large buildings were stratified socially between different floors. As the number of stairs to climb increased, the social status decreased. Garrets were often internal elements of the mansard roof, with skylights or dormer windows.

Originally a maker of farm machinery, Glas evolved first into a producer of motor scooters, then automobiles. It was purchased by BMW in 1966, mainly to gain access to Glas's patents; they were the first to use a timing belt with an overhead camshaft in an automotive application. Its limited model range was shortly phased out by its new parent. History alt= Mechanic Andreas Glas (born 1857, son of Maurus who founded in 1860 in Freising the first agricultural machines factory of Bavaria) founded an own repair company for agricultural machines at 1883 in Pilsting. He named the company Andreas Glas, Reparaturwerkst√§tte f√ºr landwirtschaftliche Maschinen mit Dampfbetrieb (in English: Andreas Glas, repair-shop for steam- powered agricultural machines). During the summer periods about 16 people worked for him. In 1905 Andreas Glas' company built their first crop sowing machines (seed drill). He then had sufficient work to employ all his employees during the winters. The production of sowing machines rose from year to year: :Winter period 1905/06 - 10 sowing machines :Autumn 1906 - 20 pieces :Winter period 1906/07 - 40 machines :1907 - 60 pieces :Winter period 1907/08 - 254 sowing machines. 1906 the Andreas Glas partened with a financer becoming Glas & Lohn and changed it brand name from Bavaria to Isaria; the partnership ended 1911. 1908 Glas production moved to Dingolfing to overcome the mandatory rule which was forbidding not local factories to participate to the important local agricultural machine exposition. The new factory started with 150 sowing machines per year. The production count rose each year. 1920 Glas Werke AG became a share company partnering with Stumm Group. 1924 Hans Glas (1890-‚Ä†1969) became CEO of Glas Werke AG. 1931 failure of the Stumm Group. 1933 Hans Glass boughs Glas Werke by the shareholders After World War II, the market for sowing machines was declining, and the company began building little carrows and later working machines for bakers along with sowing machines. 1949 Glas Werke becomes a family company renamed Hans Glas GmbH (Ltd) involving son Andreas (1923-‚Ä†1990) and daughter Hertha Products Goggomobil TS 250 Coupe.Glas were known for small cars like the Goggomobil. However, in 1964 the company introduced the Glas 1300GT coupe and later the 1700GT. The body was designed by Pietro Frua. However competition, mostly from British cars, was tough and in 1966 they released the 2600GT powered by a SOHC V8 engine, with a volume just under 2.6 litres. However this didn't help and later the same year the company was sold to BMW. The Glas models were kept in production by BMW, but fitted with BMW engines. The Glas 1300 GT coupe was fitted with a 1.6-litre BMW engine and renamed BMW 1600 GT. BMW also fitted a 3-litre engine and named it 3000 GT. This model kept the Glas name, but had a BMW logo in the front and rear. In 1968 BMW created their own large coupe, the BMW 2500 CS, and this meant the end for Glas. 277 copies of 2600 GT was made and 389 of the 3000 GT. =Scooters= Glas Goggo scooter with sidecar In 1951 Andreas Glas (1923-1990), son of Hans Glas, saw the Vespa scooter from Piaggio in an agricultural machines exposition in Verona, Italy. He was so enthused that he began production of motor scooters that July. The scooter debuted with a 125 cc motor, increased over time to 150 cc and 200 cc. Until 1956 46,181 motor scooters were built. Production of scooters stopped because of the Goggomobil cars. From 1953 on, load-carrying scooters were built as well. With the 200 cc engine and 9.5 bhp, they had a load capacity of 200 kg. =Cars= Glas 2600 with Glas logo, nicknamed Glaseratialt= BMW Glas 3000GT.

The popular four-door compact's success exhausted the production capacity of the Munich plant. In 1966 the management decided to buy Glas and absorb the Glas model line. Most of Glas' existing lineup was retired, while some models ended up being badged as BMWs until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,Toronto Star 3 July 2004 although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.

It was conceived by a group of scholars surrounding Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, notably by the lawyer and politician Aurel Popovici. Nationality conflict The first program for the federalisation of the Habsburg Empire was developed by the Hungarian nobleman Wessel√©nyi Mikl√≥s. In his work titled Sz√≥zat a magyar √©s a szl√°v nemzetis√©g √ºgy√©ben and published in Hungarian in 1843 and in German in 1844, he proposed not only social reforms but reforms of the state structure of the Empire and its nationality policy.

Kossuth proposed to transform the Habsburg Empire into a \\"Danubian State\\", a federal republic with autonomous regions.\\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Kossuth article\\"Lessons of the War and the Peace Conference : Oreste Ferrara The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The Compromise partially re-established the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, separate from, and no longer subject to the Austrian Empire. However, the favoritism shown to the Magyars, the second largest ethnic group in the dual monarchy after the Germans, caused discontent on the part of other ethnic groups like the Slovaks and Romanians.Cornwall, Mark. Last Years of Austria-Hungary: A Multi-National Experiment in Early Twentieth-Century Europe, 2nd ed. Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 2002. As the twentieth century started to unfold, the greatest problem facing the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was that it consisted of about a dozen distinctly different ethnic groups, of which only two, the Germans and Hungarians (who together accounted for about 44% of the total population), wielded any power or control. The other ethnic groups, which were not involved in the state affairs, included Slavic (Bosniaks, Croats, Czechs, Poles, Ruthenians, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes and Ukrainians) and Romance peoples (Italians, Romanians). Among them, only Croats had limited autonomy in the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. In the Kingdom of Hungary, several ethnic minorities faced increased pressures of Magyarization. The idea of the Dual Monarchy system of 1867 had been to transform the previous Austrian Empire into a constitutional union, one German-dominated and one Hungarian-dominated part, having also common institutions. However, after various demonstrations, uprisings and acts of terrorism, it became readily apparent that the notion of two ethnic groups dominating the other ten could not survive in perpetuum. The population of Hungary according to the census of 1880-81 Franz Ferdinand had planned to redraw the map of Austria-Hungary radically, creating a number of ethnically and linguistically dominated semi-autonomous \\"states\\" which would all be part of a larger federation renamed the United States of Greater Austria. Under this plan, language and cultural identification was encouraged, and the disproportionate balance of power would be corrected. The idea was set to encounter heavy opposition from the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy, since a direct result of the reform would have been a significant territorial loss for Hungary. However, the Archduke was assassinated at Sarajevo in 1914, triggering the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, Austria-Hungary was dismantled and several new nation-states were created, and various Austro- Hungarian territories were ceded to neighbouring countries by the victorious Entente powers. States proposed by Aurel Popovici According to Popovici's plans, the following territories were to become states of the federation after the reform.

The band was short-lived, released two albums, the self-titled Blackjack in 1979 and Worlds Apart in 1980, and embarked on a small US nationwide tour. Biography Blackjack was formed in late 1978 after Bruce Kulick had come off the road touring with Meat Loaf behind the Bat Out of Hell album. Kulick and his older brother Bob had done a show backing up Michael Bolton, then a solo artist with two albums, at a club show in Connecticut. Afterwards both Kulick brothers were invited to join Bolotin in a proper band. While Bob declined, Bruce accepted. The band's manager Steve Weiss, also an attorney for Led Zeppelin, brought drummer Sandy Gennaro and bassist Jimmy Haslip into the fold to complete the line-up. The band was quickly signed to Polydor Records and named Blackjack. At the behest of their record company and management, the foursome went to work with producer Tom Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida to record their debut album. Blackjack was released in 1979 and peaked at No. 127 on the Billboard charts selling around 100,000 copies. The album's biggest single, \\"Love Me Tonight\\", reached No. 62 on Billboard. Blackjack shot videos for both \\"Without Your Love\\" and \\"Love Me Tonight\\", which were part of a 9-minute promotional movie circulated by the label, and toured with acts such as Peter Frampton and the Marshall Tucker Band. In 1980, Bruce Kulick played guitar on Billy Squier's solo debut album, The Tale of the Tape, produced by Eddie Offord of Yes fame. Offord also became the producer for Blackjack's second album Worlds Apart. But, with the disappointing sales of their debut album and a regime change at Polydor, Blackjack were no longer a priority act at the label and Worlds Apart was released in 1980 with very little backing and no tour support from the record company. It spelled the end for Blackjack as individual members had opportunities and offers to join more promising musical situations. After break-up By 1981, Gennaro had replaced Tommy Aldridge in the Pat Travers Band, making his debut on the Radio Active album. Haslip would re-team with members of the Robben Ford Band under the name Yellowjackets who issued their self-titled debut album in 1981. After turning down a touring gig with Billy Squier in favor of staying with Blackjack, Kulick recorded Great American Music with The Good Rats in 1981 and also played guitar on Michael Bolton's eponymous 1983 debut album for Columbia Records before joining Kiss in 1984. Rap appeal The Blackjack song \\"Stay\\" off their second album Worlds Apart was sampled by rapper Jay Z for the song \\"A Dream\\" off his 2002 album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse which reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts. In 2004, rapper Kanye West re-recorded a section of \\"Maybe It's the Power of Love\\" off Worlds Apart for inclusion on his song \\"Never Let Me Down\\"; it was released on his triple platinum selling debut album The College Dropout which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Speaking to the website Genius in 2015, Bolton gave his approval of the sampling, stating that \\"the song turned out beautifully\\". Album re-issues Blackjack and Worlds Apart were first issued on CD as a two-for-one package by PolyGram in 1990, with a Japanese release following in 1996. UK-based label Lemon Records would do another 2-for-1 reissue in 2006, titled Anthology, with extensive liner notes by English rock journalist Malcolm Dome. The most recent re-issues came in December 2013 when both albums were released individually by Universal Music Japan in the cardboard sleeve mini-LP format as SHM-CD remasters.

He was the first of the Carolingians to become king. The younger son of the Frankish prince Charles Martel and his wife Rotrude, Pepin's upbringing was distinguished by the ecclesiastical education he had received from the monks of St. Denis. Succeeding his father as the Mayor of the Palace in 741, Pepin reigned over Francia jointly with his elder brother Carloman. Pepin ruled in Neustria, Burgundy and Provence, while his older brother Carloman established himself in Austrasia, Alemannia and Thuringia. The brothers were active in suppressing revolts led by the Bavarians, Aquitanians, Saxons and the Alemanni in the early years of their reign. In 743, they ended the Frankish interregnum by choosing Childeric III, who was to be the last Merovingian monarch, as figurehead king of the Franks. Being well disposed towards the church and papacy on account of their ecclesiastical upbringing, Pepin and Carloman continued their father's work in supporting Saint Boniface in reforming the Frankish church, and evangelising the Saxons. After Carloman, who was an intensely pious man, retired to religious life in 747, Pepin became the sole ruler of the Franks. He suppressed a revolt led by his half-brother Grifo, and succeeded in becoming the undisputed master of all Francia. Giving up pretense, Pepin then forced Childeric into a monastery and had himself proclaimed king of the Franks with support of Pope Zachary in 751. The decision was not supported by all members of the Carolingian family and Pepin had to put down a revolt led by Carloman's son, Drogo, and again by Grifo. As king, Pepin embarked on an ambitious program to expand his power. He reformed the legislation of the Franks and continued the ecclesiastical reforms of Boniface. Pepin also intervened in favour of the papacy of Stephen II against the Lombards in Italy. He was able to secure several cities, which he then gave to the Pope as part of the Donation of Pepin. This formed the legal basis for the Papal States in the Middle Ages. The Byzantines, keen to make good relations with the growing power of the Frankish empire, gave Pepin the title of Patricius. In wars of expansion, Pepin conquered Septimania from the Islamic Umayyads, and subjugated the southern realms by repeatedly defeating Waiofar and his Gascon troops, after which the Gascon and Aquitanian lords saw no option but to pledge loyalty to the Franks. Pepin was, however, troubled by the relentless revolts of the Saxons and the Bavarians. He campaigned tirelessly in Germany, but the final subjugation of these tribes was left to his successors. Pepin died in 768 and was succeeded by his sons Charlemagne and Carloman. Although unquestionably one of the most powerful and successful rulers of his time, Pepin's reign is largely overshadowed by that of his more famous son, Charlemagne. Assumption of power Pepin's father Charles Martel died in 741. He divided the rule of the Frankish kingdom between Pepin and his elder brother, Carloman, his surviving sons by his first wife: Carloman became Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, Pepin became Mayor of the Palace of Neustria. Grifo, Charles's son by his second wife, Swanahild (also known as Swanhilde), demanded a share in the inheritance, but he was besieged in Laon, forced to surrender and imprisoned in a monastery by his two half-brothers. In the Frankish realm the unity of the kingdom was essentially connected with the person of the king. So Carloman, to secure this unity, raised the Merovingian Childeric to the throne (743). Then in 747 Carloman either resolved to or was pressured into entering a monastery. This left Francia in the hands of Pepin as sole mayor of the palace and dux et princeps Francorum. At the time of Carloman's retirement, Grifo escaped his imprisonment and fled to Duke Odilo of Bavaria, who was married to Hiltrude, Pepin's sister. Pepin put down the renewed revolt led by his half-brother and succeeded in completely restoring the boundaries of the kingdom. Under the reorganization of Francia by Charles Martel, the dux et princeps Francorum was the commander of the armies of the kingdom, in addition to his administrative duties as mayor of the palace. Boniface, Archbishop of Mainz First Carolingian King  As mayor of the palace, Pepin was formally subject to the decisions of Childeric III who had only the title of King but no power. Since Pepin had control over the magnates and actually had the power of a king, he now addressed to Pope Zachary a suggestive question: :In regard to the kings of the Franks who no longer possess the royal power: is this state of things proper? Hard pressed by the Lombards, Pope Zachary welcomed this move by the Franks to end an intolerable condition and lay the constitutional foundations for the exercise of the royal power. The Pope replied that such a state of things is not proper. In these circumstances, the de facto power was considered more important than the de jure authority. After this decision the throne was declared vacant. Childeric III was deposed and confined to a monastery. He was the last of the Merovingians. Pepin was then elected King of the Franks by an assembly of Frankish nobles, with a large portion of his army on hand. The earliest account of his election and anointing is the Clausula de Pippino written around 767. Meanwhile, Grifo continued his rebellion, but was eventually killed in the battle of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in 753. Pepin was assisted by his friend Vergilius of Salzburg, an Irish monk who probably used a copy of the \\"Collectio canonum Hibernensis\\" (an Irish collection of canon law) to advise him to receive royal unction to assist his recognition as king. Anointed a first time in 751 in Soissons, Pepin added to his power after Pope Stephen II traveled all the way to Paris to anoint him a second time in a lavish ceremony at the Basilica of St Denis in 754, bestowing upon him the additional title of patricius Romanorum (Patrician of the Romans) and is the first recorded crowning of a civil ruler by a Pope. As life expectancies were short in those days, and Pepin wanted family continuity, the Pope also anointed Pepin's sons, Charles (eventually known as Charlemagne), who was 12, and Carloman, who was 3. Expansion of the Frankish realm Muslim troops leaving Narbonne in 759, after 40 years of occupation Pepin's expedition to Septimania and Aquitaine (760) Pepin's first major act as king was to go to war against the Lombard king Aistulf, who had expanded into the ducatus Romanus. After a meeting with Pope Stephen II at Ponthion, Pepin forced the Lombard king to return property seized from the Church. He confirmed the papacy in possession of Ravenna and the Pentapolis, the so-called Donation of Pepin, whereby the Papal States were established and the temporal reign of the papacy officially began. At about 752, he turned his attention to Septimania. The new king headed south in a military expedition down the Rhone valley and received the submission of eastern Septimania (i.e. N√Æmes, Maguelone, Beziers and Agde) after securing count Ansemund's allegiance. The Frankish king went on to invest Narbonne, the main Umayyad stronghold in Septimania, but could not capture it from the Iberian Muslims until seven years later in 759, when they were driven out to Hispania. Aquitaine still remained under Waiofar's Gascon-Aquitanian rule, however, and beyond Frankish reach. Duke Waiofar appears to have confiscated Church lands, maybe distributing them among his troops. In 760, after conquering the Roussillon from the Muslims and denouncing Waiofar's actions, Pepin moved his troops over to Toulouse and Albi, ravaged with fire and sword most of Aquitaine, and, in retaliation, counts loyal to Waiofar ravaged Burgundy. Pepin, in turn, besieged the Aquitanian-held towns and strongholds of Bourbon, Clermont, Chantelle, Bourges and Thouars, defended by Waiofar's Gascon troops, who were overcome, captured and deported into northern France with their children and wives. In 763, Pepin advanced further into the heart of Waiofar's domains and captured major strongholds (Poitiers, Limoges, Angoul√™me, etc.), after which Waiofar counterattacked and war became bitter. Pepin opted to spread terror, burning villas, destroying vineyards and depopulating monasteries. By 765, the brutal tactics seemed to pay off for the Franks, who destroyed resistance in central Aquitaine and devastated the whole region. The city of Toulouse was conquered by Pepin in 767 as was Waiofar's capital of Bordeaux. As a result, Aquitanian nobles and Gascons from beyond the Garonne too saw no option but to accept a pro-Frankish peace treaty (Fronsac, c. 768). Waiofar escaped but was assassinated by his own frustrated followers in 768. Legacy Allegoric depiction of Pepin Pepin died during a campaign, in 768 at the age of 54. He was interred in the Basilica of Saint Denis in modern-day Metropolitan Paris. His wife Bertrada was also interred there in 783. Charlemagne rebuilt the Basilica in honor of his parents and placed markers at the entrance. The Frankish realm was divided according to the Salic law between his two sons: Charlemagne and Carloman I. Historical opinion often seems to regard him as the lesser son and lesser father of two greater men, though a great man in his own right. He continued to build up the heavy cavalry which his father had begun. He maintained the standing army that his father had found necessary to protect the realm and form the core of its full army in wartime. He not only contained the Iberian Muslims as his father had, but drove them out of what is now France and, as important, he managed to subdue the Aquitanians and the Gascons after three generations of on-off clashes, so opening the gate to central and southern Gaul and Muslim Iberia. He continued his father's expansion of the Frankish church (missionary work in Germany and Scandinavia) and the institutional infrastructure (feudalism) that would prove the backbone of medieval Europe. His rule, while not as great as either his father's or son's, was historically important and of great benefit to the Franks as a people. Pepin's assumption of the crown, and the title of Patrician of Rome, were harbingers of his son's imperial coronation which is usually seen as the founding of the Kingdom of France. He made the Carolingians de jure what his father had made them de facto‚Äîthe ruling dynasty of the Franks and the foremost power of Europe. Known as a great conqueror, he was undefeated during his lifetime. Family Pepin married Leutberga from the Danube region. They had five children. She was repudiated some time after the birth of Charlemagne and her children were sent to convents. In 741, Pepin married Bertrada, daughter of Caribert of Laon. They are known to have had eight children, at least three of whom survived to adulthood: * Charles (2 April 742 ‚Äì 28 January 814), (Charlemagne) * Carloman (751 ‚Äì 4 December 771) * Gisela (757‚Äì810) * Pepin, died in infancy. * Chrothais, died young, buried in Metz. * Adelais, died young, buried in Metz.

Marine conservation, also known as ocean conservation, refers to the study of marine plants and animal resources and ecosystem functions. It is the protection and preservation of ecosystems in oceans and seas through planned management in order to prevent the exploitation of these resources. Marine conservation is driven by the manifested negative effects being seen in our environment such as species loss, habitat degradation and changes in ecosystem functions and focuses on limiting human-caused damage to marine ecosystems, restoring damaged marine ecosystems, and preserving vulnerable species and ecosystems of the marine life. Marine conservation is a relatively new discipline which has developed as a response to biological issues such as extinction and marine habitats change. Marine conservationists rely on a combination of scientific principles derived from marine biology, oceanography, and fisheries science, as well as on human factors such as, demand for marine resources and marine law, economics and policy, in order to determine how to best protect and conserve marine species and ecosystems. Marine conservation may be described as a sub- discipline of conservation biology.Marine conservation has been addressed in sustainable development goal 14 that ensures sustainable use of marine resources for sustainable development. Coral reefs Coral reefs are the epicenter of immense amounts of biodiversity and are a key player in the survival of entire ecosystems. They provide various marine animals with food, protection, and shelter which keep generations of species alive. Furthermore, coral reefs are an integral part of sustaining human life through serving as a food source (i.e., fish and mollusks) as well as a marine space for ecotourism which provides economic benefits.Trist, Carolyn. \\"Recreating Ocean Space: Recreational Consumption and Representation of the Caribbean Marine.\\" Professional Geographer. 51.3 (1999). Print. Also, humans are now conducting research regarding the use of corals as new potential sources for pharmaceuticals (i.e. steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs). Unfortunately, because of the human impact on coral reefs, these ecosystems are becoming increasingly degraded and in need of conservation. The biggest threats include overfishing, destructive fishing practices, sedimentation, and pollution from land-based sources.Burke, Lauretta, Liz Selig, and Mark Spalding (2001). \\"Reefs At Risk in Southeast Asia.\\" World Resources Institute, p. 72. This, in conjunction with increased carbon in oceans, coral bleaching, and diseases, means that there are no pristine reefs anywhere in the world. Up to 88% of coral reefs in Southeast Asia are now threatened, with 50% of those reefs at either \\"high\\" or \\"very high\\" risk of disappearing, which directly affects the biodiversity and survival of species dependent on coral. This is especially harmful to island nations such as Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines, because many people there depend on the coral reef ecosystems to feed their families and to make a living. However, many fishermen are unable to catch as many fish as they used to, so they are increasingly using cyanide and dynamite in fishing, which further degrades the coral reef ecosystem.\\"Coral reef destruction and conservation\\" . tamu.edu (18 May 2011). This perpetuation of bad habits simply leads to the further decline of coral reefs and therefore perpetuates the problem. One way of stopping this cycle is by educating the local community about why the conservation of marine spaces that include coral reefs is important.Rodrigo, Raul (1998). Resource at Risk: Philippine Coral Reefs. Human impact Increasing human populations have resulted in increased human impact on ecosystems. Human activities has resulted in an increased extinction rate of species which has caused a major decrease in biological diversity of plants and animals in our environment. These impacts include increased pressure from fisheries including reef degradation and overfishing as well as pressure from the tourism industry which has increased over the past few years. The deterioration of coral reefs is mainly linked to human activities ‚Äì 88% of reefs are threatened through various reasons as listed above, including excessive amounts of CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. Oceans absorb approximately 1/3 of the CO2 produced by humans, which has detrimental effects on the marine environment. The increasing levels of CO2 in oceans change the seawater chemistry by decreasing the pH, which is known as ocean acidification. The remains from the Exxon Valdez oil spill after the second treatment by oil spill workers in Alaska Oil spills also impact marine environments, contributing to marine pollution as a result of human activity. The effects of oil on marine fish have been studied following major spills in the United States. Shipping is a major vector for the introduction of exotic marine species, some of which can become overabundant and transform ecosystems. Collisions with ships can also be fatal for whales and can impact on the viability of whole populations, including the right whale population off the east coast of the United States. = Overfishing = Overfishing is one of main causes of the decrease in the ocean‚Äôs wildlife population over the past years. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation reported that the percentage of the world's fish stocks that are at biologically sustainable levels have decreased from 90% in 1974 to 65.8% in 2017. The overfishing of these large fisheries destroys the marine environment and threatens the livelihood of billions who depend on fish as protein or as a source of income for catching and selling. According to the World Wildlife Fund, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a major factor in overfishing. Illegal fishing is estimated to account for up to 30% of the catch for some high value species, and the industry is estimated to be worth $36 billion per year. = Overabundance = Overabundance can occur when the population of a certain species cannot be controlled naturally or by human intervention. The domination of one species can create an imbalance in an ecosystem, which can lead to the demise of other species and of the habitat. Overabundance occurs predominately among invasive species.\\"IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\\" IUCN. 12 February 2015.  Introduced species  The international shipping trade has led to the establishment of many marine species beyond their native ranges. Some of these can have adverse consequences, such as the North pacific seastar which was introduced to Tasmania, Australia. Vectors for the translocation of organisms include hull biofouling, the dumping of ballast water and dumping of water from marine aquaria. A tank of ballast water is estimated to contain around 3,000 non-native species.Smith, David. \\"Ballast Water\\" MITSG CCR: Marine Bioinvasions (1 January 2006). Once established, it is difficult to eradicate an exotic organism from an ecosystem. The San Francisco Bay is one of the places in the world that is the most impacted by foreign and invasive species. According to the Baykeeper organization, 97 percent of the organisms in the San Francisco Bay have been compromised by the 240 invasive species that have been brought into the ecosystem.Choksi, Sejal. \\"The Hostile Takeover of San Francisco Bay\\" 1 May 2009. 19 February 2015. Invasive species in the bay such as the Asian clam have changed the food web of the ecosystem by depleting populations of native species such as plankton.Martin, Glen (5 February 2006). \\"The Great Invaders / A New Ecosystem Is Evolving in San Francisco Bay. We Have No Idea What It Is, or Where It's Going\\". SFGate. \\"Foreign Species Invade San Francisco Bay\\". NPR (11 May 2011). The Asian clam clogs pipes and obstructs the flow of water in electrical generating facilities. Their presence in the San Francisco Bay has cost the United States an estimated one billion dollars in damages.Foster, A.M., P. Fuller, A. Benson, S. Constant, D. Raikow, J. Larson, and A. Fusaro. (2014). Corbicula fluminea USGS Non- indigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL. Techniques Strategies and techniques for marine conservation tend to combine theoretical disciplines, such as population biology, with practical conservation strategies, such as setting up protected areas, as with marine protected areas (MPAs) or Voluntary Marine Conservation Areas. These protected areas may be established for a variety of reasons and aim to limit the impact of human activity. These protected areas operate differently which includes areas that have seasonal closures and/or permanent closures as well as multiple levels of zoning that allow people to carryout different activities in separate areas; including, speed, no take and multi-use zones. Other techniques include developing sustainable fisheries and restoring the populations of endangered species through artificial means. Another focus of conservationists is on curtailing human activities that are detrimental to either marine ecosystems or species through policy, techniques such as fishing quotas, like those set up by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, or laws such as those listed below. Recognizing the economics involved in human use of marine ecosystems is key, as is education of the public about conservation issues. This includes educating tourists that come to an area who might not be familiar with certain regulations regarding the marine habitat. One example of this is a project called Green Fins based in Southeast Asia that uses the scuba diving industry to educate the public. This project, implemented by UNEP, encourages scuba diving operators to educate their students about the importance of marine conservation and encourage them to dive in an environmentally friendly manner that does not damage coral reefs or associated marine ecosystems. Scientists divide the process by a few parts, and there are various techniques in each part of it. In marking and capturing, the normal techniques include techniques for restraint in pinnipeds, chemical restraint and immobilization in pinnipeds, techniques for capture-release of cetaceans and techniques for restraint and handling. Recently, some novel approaches include remote sensing techniques to model exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to riverine flood plumes and advanced iconography. Techniques also include many social science researches, many researches have founded the effectiveness of marine conservation through the change of social events and encourage sustainable tourism development to raise the public awareness of it. Researchers suggest to integrating customary management into marine conservation and emphasize that practical and conceptual differences exist between customary management and contemporary conservation which have often led to failed attempts to hybridize these systems. Others have suggest to Integrating Marine conservation and tourism, the establishment of conservation areas can help reduce conflicts through zoning for different uses the protected areas and enables the grouping of compatible activities into specific zones and the separation of those which are incompatible. Common techniques for arise general public‚Äôs attention also include the more exposure of carbon footprint concept, and educate people to make sustainable seafood choices and use fewer plastic products. Technology and halfway technology Marine conservation technologies are used to protect endangered and threatened marine organisms and/or habitat. These technologies are innovative and revolutionary because they reduce by-catch, increase the survivorship and health of marine life and habitat, and benefit fishermen who depend on the resources for profit. Examples of technologies include marine protected areas (MPAs), turtle excluder devices (TEDs), autonomous recording unit, pop-up satellite archival tag, and radio-frequency identification (RFID). Commercial practicality plays an important role in the success of marine conservation because it is necessary to cater to the needs of fishermen while also protecting marine life. Pop-up satellite archival tag (PSAT or PAT) plays a vital role in marine conservation by providing marine biologists with an opportunity to study animals in their natural environments. These are used to track movements of (usually large, migratory) marine animals. A PSAT is an archival tag (or data logger) that is equipped with a means to transmit the collected data via satellite. Though the data are physically stored on the tag, its major advantage is that it does not have to be physically retrieved like an archival tag for the data to be available, making it a viable independent tool for animal behavior studies. These tags have been used to track movements of ocean sunfish, marlin, blue sharks, bluefin tuna, swordfish and sea turtles. Location, depth, temperature, and body movement data are used to answer questions about migratory patterns, seasonal feeding movements, daily habits, and survival after catch and release. Turtle excluder devices (TEDs) remove a major threat to turtles in their marine environment. Many sea turtles are accidentally captured, injured or killed by fishing. In response to this threat the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) worked with the shrimp trawling industry to create the TEDs. By working with the industry they insured the commercial viability of the devices. A TED is a series of bars that is placed at the top or bottom of a trawl net, fitting the bars into the \\"neck\\" of the shrimp trawl and acting as a filter to ensure that only small animals may pass through. The shrimp will be caught but larger animals such as marine turtles that become caught by the trawler will be rejected by the filter function of the bars. Similarly, halfway technologies work to increase the population of marine organisms. However, they do so without behavioral changes, and address the symptoms but not the cause of the declines. Examples of halfway technologies include hatcheries and fish ladders. Laws and treaties International laws and treaties related to marine conservation include the 1966 Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas. United States laws related to marine conservation include the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, as well as the 1972 Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, which established the National Marine Sanctuaries program. In 2010, the Scottish Parliament enacted new legislation for the protection of marine life with the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. Its provisions include marine planning, marine licensing, marine conservation, seal conservation, and enforcement. Since 2006, United Nations introduce vulnerable marine ecosystem concept for the management of deep-sea fisheries in the areas beyond national jurisdiction. This concept has been transposed by the European parliament for Atlantic European waters.REGULATION (EU) 2016/2336 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 2016 establishing specific conditions for fishing for deep-sea stocks in the north-east Atlantic and provisions for fishing in international waters of the north-east Atlantic and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 . Additionally, marine conservation is included in the United Nations framework of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), most notably SDG 14. Organizations and education The shore of the Pacific Ocean in San Francisco, California There are marine conservation organizations throughout the world that focus on funding conservation efforts, educating the public and stakeholders, and lobbying for conservation law and policy. Examples of these include Oceana, the Marine Conservation Institute (United States), Blue Frontier Campaign (United States), Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (international), Frontier (the Society for Environmental Exploration) (United Kingdom), Marine Conservation Society (United Kingdom), Community Centered Conservation (C3), the Reef-World Foundation (United Kingdom), Reef Watch (India), Marinelife Alliance (Bangladesh), Live Ocean (New Zealand), ProtectedSeas (United States), and Australian Marine Conservation Society. Zoox (United Kingdom) is an example of an organization that provides both marine conservation training and professional career development to volunteers who are also working on marine conservation projects such as Green Fins. On a regional level, PERSGA, the Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Environment of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, is a regional entity which serves as the secretariat for the Jeddah Convention-1982, one of the first regional marine agreements. PERSGA member states are Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. = Prominent campaigns = There have been a number of organized efforts from marine conservation groups such as those aforementioned in this article to raise awareness of the human impact on the situation and inspire people to take action. Some groups take on more public facing campaigns that directly attempt to get civilians engaged with the issue compared to other groups who encourage donations from civilians which goes towards lobbying and advocacy towards the government. Ocean Conservancy and its International Coastal Cleanup is an example of a public-facing campaign that aims to increase participation in conservation efforts among every day civilians. On a predetermined date every year, Ocean Conservancy promotes The International Coastal Cleanup to rally communities to volunteer to collect trash from the coastlines across the globe. The campaign has expanded originally from its two founders and has now reached over 100 countries. Oceana is an example of an advocacy/lobbying group that encourages donations as a means to enact legislation and protect the laws of the ocean. Specifically, Oceana is currently lobbying to prevent the expansion of offshore drilling with emphasis in areas such as the Arctic and Belize. Oceana is currently mentioned in a wide range of bills in the US Congress regarding issues such as anti-drilling protections on the Atlantic coast and the penalty for buying, selling, possessing, or transporting shark fins. Greenpeace is another non-profit organization that seeks to campaign for a healthier environment and more sustainable environmental practices. While the organization addresses a wide range of topics outside of ocean conservation, it is currently focusing in on plastic pollution, sustainable seafood, and protecting the Arctic. They provide information online on their website regarding their current efforts which can help people get connected to the correct resources to make a difference in their community.  Events and initiatives  There have been a wide variety of different events and initiatives to spread the message about the issue. = Events =  International Ocean Film Festival  This film festival is the largest ocean destination event according to the MCI. Also known as the IOFF, this event is a four-day film festival that includes over 50 films related to ocean-life around the globe. This event is made to educate viewers and the audience on the environmental issues that are negatively impacting the ocean. Films also include potential solutions to help protect the ocean and environment as well.  Rising Tide Summit  This summit is led by Boardriders Foundation, XPRIZE Foundation, and Marisla Foundation. The summit is more interactive as it provides a panel of speakers as well as a portion for questions and answers. Towards the latter half of the event, companies and individuals are able to participate in a workshop so they can learn more about the benefits of a ‚Äúblue economy‚Äù. This event is centered towards the California population = Initiatives = #SaveOurOceans is a social media campaign that draws NGOs and social media platforms together in the form of a TikTok contest. TikTok has partnered with Conservation International to protect marine life. The #SaveOurOceans campaign was able to reach globally due to influencers spreading the message to a wide audience. Local and global influencers alike played a role in spreading the campaign. TikTok declared that they would donate $2 for every video uploaded with the hashtag, up to $100,000, towards protecting oceans and marine life by reducing plastic waste. #SuitUpToCleanUp is another social media campaign centered around promoting marine conservation. Launched in August and September of 2018 by Ocean Conservancy, the campaign was intended to inspire participants to clean up pollution in their local waterways. The campaign was meant to coincide with Ocean Conservancy's 33rd Annual International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) on September 15, 2018. The phrase #SuitUpToCleanUp was a way for people to share their stories of how they helped clean up in unique ways. Extinct and endangered species =Marine mammals= Baleen whales were predominantly hunted from 1600 through the mid-1900s, and were nearing extinction when a global ban on commercial whaling was put into effect in 1986 by the IWC (International Whaling Convention).Ray, G. Carleton (2004) \\"Issues and Mechanisms\\", part 1 in Coastal-marine Conservation: Science and Policy. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub. .\\"Ending Commercial Whaling.\\" ifaw.org (19 February 2015).

The Hawaiian and Mediterranean monk seals are considered to be one of the most endangered marine mammals on the planet, according to the NOAA. The last sighting of the Caribbean monk seal was in 1952, and it has now been confirmed extinct by the NOAA.\\"Hawaiian Monk Seal (Neomonachus Schauinslandi)\\" . NOAA Fisheries (15 January 2016).\\"Caribbean Monk Seal Gone Extinct From Human Causes, NOAA Confirms\\". ScienceDaily (9 June 2008). The vaquita porpoise, discovered in 1958, has become the most endangered marine species. Over half the population has disappeared since 2012, leaving 100 left in 2014. The vaquita frequently drowns in fishing nets, which are used illegally in marine protected areas off the Gulf of Mexico.\\"Vaquita\\". World Wildlife Fund (12 February 2015). =Sea turtles= In 2004, the Marine Turtle Specialist Group (MTSG), from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), ran an assessment which determined that green turtles were globally endangered. Population decline in ocean basins is indicated through data collected by the MTSG that analyzes abundance and historical information on the species. This data examined the global population of green turtles at 32 nesting sites, and determined that over the last 100‚Äì150 years there has been a 48‚Äì65 percent decrease in the number of mature nesting females.\\"Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)\\" NOAA Fisheries. 19 February 2015. The Kemp's ridley sea turtle population fell in 1947 when 33,000 nests, which accounted for 80 percent of the population, were collected and sold by villagers in Racho Nuevo, Mexico. In the early 1960s only 5,000 individuals were left, and between 1978 and 1991, 200 Kemp's Ridley Turtles nested annually. In 2015, the World Wildlife Fund and National Geographic Magazine named the Kemp's ridley the most endangered sea turtle in the world, with 1000 females nesting annually.\\"Kemp's Ridley Turtle (Lepidochelys Kempii).\\" NOAA Fisheries (19 February 2015). =Fish= In 2014, the IUCN moved the Pacific bluefin tuna from \\"least concerned\\" to \\"vulnerable\\" on a scale that represents level of extinction risk. The Pacific bluefin tuna is targeted by the fishing industry mainly for its use in sushi.\\"Sushi Edging Pacific Bluefin Tuna Toward Extinction\\" DNews 19 February 2015. A stock assessment released in 2013 by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) shows that the Pacific bluefin tuna population dropped by 96 percent in the Pacific Ocean. According to the ISC assessment, 90 percent of the Pacific bluefin tuna caught are juveniles that have not reproduced.Satran, Joe (19 February 2015). \\"Pacific Bluefin Tuna Overfishing Has Led To 96 Percent Population Reduction, Study Says\\" The Huffington Post Between 2011 and 2014, the European eel, Japanese eel, and American eel were put on the IUCN red list of endangered species.\\"European Eel Is Critically Endangered\\" . National Biodiversity Data Centre (19 February 2015). In 2015, the Environmental Agency concluded that the number of European eels has declined by 95 percent since 1990. An Environmental Agency officer, Andy Don, who has been researching eels for the past 20 years, said, \\"There is no doubt that there is a crisis. People have been reporting catching a kilo of glass eels this year when they would expect to catch 40 kilos. We have got to do something.\\"Morris, Steve (30 April 2009). \\"Eels in Crisis after 95% Decline in Last 25 Years\\". The Guardian. =Marine plants= Johnson's seagrass, a food source for the endangered green sea turtle, is the scarcest species in its genus. It reproduces asexually, which limits its ability to populate and colonize habitats. This seagrass is the only marine plant to be listed under the Endangered Species Act, and in 1998, it was granted protection as an endangered species. Data on this species is limited, but it is known that since the 1970s there has been a 50 percent decrease in abundance.\\"Johnson's Seagrass (Halophila johnsonii) ‚Äì Office of Protected Resources\\". NOAA Fisheries (1 March 2013). There are many reasons behind the decline in the seagrass's proliferation, such as degradation of water quality, careless boating activities, anchoring. In addition to that hurricane activity caused by climate change, increase the risk of extinction of the Johnson's seagrass. History of marine conservation Modern marine conservation first became globally recognized in the 1970s after World War II in an era known as the \\"marine revolution\\". The United States federal legislation showed its support of marine conservation by institutionalizing protected areas and creating marine estuaries. In the late-1940s the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)was formed.Zacharias, Mark (2014). \\"Marine Environmental Protection Policy: International Efforts to Address Threats to Marine Biodiversity\\" in Marine Policy: An Introduction to Governance and International Law of the Oceans. Routledge. . This program eventually developed into a platform where nations could communicate and make agreements about marine conservation. After the formation of the IUCN, new independent organizations known as non-governmental organizations started to appear. These organizations were self-governed and had individual goals for marine conservation. At the end of the 1970s, undersea explorations equipped with new technology such as computers were undertaken. During these explorations, fundamental principles of change were discovered in relation to marine ecosystems. Through this discovery, the interdependent nature of the ocean was revealed. This led to a change in the approach of marine conservation efforts, and a new emphasis was put on restoring systems within the environment, along with protecting biodiversity.Hinrichsen, Don (2011).

It received generally good reviews as a showcase for the band's experimental/psychedelic pop. The album is the band's first major change in production style compared to earlier albums. Up until The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone, producer and band leader Robert Schneider would usually implement a Wall of Sound style of production on his records whereas on this album he chose to pursue a more \\"raw\\" sound. This was to portray a sound more similar to how the band sounded during live performances versus a typically more orchestrated quality of sound. In an interview flexi disc, included on the vinyl-LP version of the album, Schneider remarks: \\"That was a lesson I learned from Led Zeppelin and from the Beatles--is that one guitar can go a long way. I used to take a Phil Spector approach which was that a lot of guitars can go a long way. Now I‚Äôm kind of going more for the feeling of the way we sound.\\" In addition to change in production style, the style of genre itself is also something of a departure from the usual 1960s psychedelic pop sound trademarked by earlier Apples in Stereo records. In songwriting, Schneider took more of an influence from R&B; artists such as Sly & the Family Stone and early artists featured on the Motown label. Schneider also wanted the songs to sound more disconnected and unique to themselves than on previous albums. He stated, \\"I wanted every song to be self contained...on our other records we always had our songs run together. On this record we left big spaces between all the songs so you have a place to put your needle down on the record.\\" This was influenced by records such as The White Album by the Beatles.

The basic concept is to introduce a split element into a telescope's optical path so as to produce a double image. If one element is moved using a screw micrometer, precise angle measurements can be made. The simplest arrangement is to split the object lens in half, with one half fixed and the other attached to the micrometer screw and slid along the cut diameter. To measure the diameter of the sun, for example, the micrometer is first adjusted so that the two images of the solar disk coincide (the \\"zero\\" position where the split elements form essentially a single element). The micrometer is then adjusted so that diametrically opposite sides of the two images of the solar disk just touch each other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the (angular) diameter of the sun. Similarly, a precise measurement of the apparent separation between two nearby stars, A and B, is made by first superimposing the two images of the stars and then adjusting the double image so that star A in one image coincides with star B in the other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the apparent separation or angular distance between the two stars. Heliometer by Carl Bamberg, Berlin, around 1880/90. Diameter of the lens 4.2 cm. Double image of the solar disk The first application of the divided object-glass and the employment of double images in astronomical measures is due to Servington Savary from Exeter in 1743. Pierre Bouguer, in 1748, originated the true conception of measurement by double image without the auxiliary aid of a filar micrometer, that is by changing the distance between two object-glasses of equal focus. John Dollond, in 1754, combined Savary's idea of the divided object-glass with Bouguer's method of measurement, resulting in the construction of the first really practical heliometers. As far as we can ascertain, Joseph von Fraunhofer, some time not long before 1820, constructed the first heliometer with an achromatic divided object- glass, i.e. the first heliometer of the modern type. The first successful measurements of stellar parallax (to determine the distance to a star) were made by Friedrich Bessel in 1838 for the star 61 Cygni using a Fraunhofer heliometer.. This was the aperture Fraunhofer heliometer at K√∂nigsberg Observatory built by Joseph von Fraunhofer's firm, though he did not live to see it delivered to Bessel. Although the heliometer was difficult to use, it had certain advantages for Bessel including a wider field of view compared to other great refractors of the period, and overcame atmospheric turbulence in measurements compared to a filar micrometer.

The taxon name comes from Greek kynos (meaning \\"dog\\") and anchein (\\"to choke\\"), hence the common name for several species is dog-strangling vine. Most species are non-succulent climbers or twiners. There is some evidence of toxicity. Morphology These plants are perennial herbs or subshrubs, often growing from rhizomes. The leaves are usually oppositely arranged and sometimes are borne on petioles. The inflorescences and flowers come in a variety of shapes. Like other species of the milkweed family, these plants bear follicles, which are podlike dry fruits. Distribution These species are found throughout the tropics and subtropics. Several species also grow in temperate regions. Importance The root of Cynanchum atratum is used in Chinese traditional medicine and called Bai wei. Several other species had traditional Chinese medicinal uses.

He also participated in the 1896 Summer Olympics, where he came third at the military rifle. Life Trikoupis c.1920 Born in Mesolongi in 1868 to Themistoklis Trikoupis (member of the Trikoupis family, related to PM Charilaos Trikoupis), he entered the Greek Army Academy, which he graduated in 1888 as an Artillery Second Lieutenant. He furthered his studies in France, where he remained from 1889 to 1895, completing his tour there with courses at the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Guerre. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics, held in Athens, in the military rifle and the free rifle events. He came third in the first with a score of 1,713, after hitting the target 34 times out of a possible 40. His place and score in the second event are unknown, except that he did not finish in the top five. In the Greco- Turkish War of 1897, he participated as chief of staff of the 1st Infantry Division. He joined the newly established General Staff Corps in 1904, and participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13 as chief of staff of the 3rd Infantry Division and the Damianos Detachment. After the Balkan Wars he served as regimental commander, and served as chief of staff of the III Army Corps and then as Deputy Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff. From 1917, he fought in the Macedonian front of the First World War as commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, being promoted to Major General in 1918. He again commanded the 3rd Division in the spring and summer 1921 offensives during the Asia Minor Campaign. During the advance onto Eski≈üehir he also commanded the Northern Group of Divisions, and in July was placed in charge of the Southern Group around Afyonkarahisar. In September, he was moved to command of II Corps and in December to I Corps. During the Turkish offensive in August 1922, Trikoupis was the senior Greek commander on the spot, having 5 divisions at his disposal. Having neglected to provide for adequate reconnaissance, his command was surprised by the Turkish attack. In order to avert the collapse of the front held by the 1st and 4th divisions, he ordered a retreat to the second line of defence NW of Afyon on the 13th. The successful Turkish attacks however and the surrender of parts of I and II Corps a few days later sealed the fate of the Greek Army, which began a hasty withdrawal to the Aegean shore. On 29 August, while at Karaja Hisar, also known as Ali Veran (Greek: ·ºàŒª·øÜ ŒíŒµœÅ·Ω∞ŒΩ, modern Allioren, Turkey) near Kutahya, he was attacked by Turkish cavalry and surrendered along with slightly more than 5,000 men and 300 officers.Aggelomatis, Chr., \\"Chronicle of Great Tragedy\\" (The Epic of Asia Minor), Estia, 1963, pp. 194-5 His captors led Trikoupis and General Digenis (CO of II Corps) to Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, who informed him that he had been appointed as commander-in-chief of the Greek Army in Asia Minor, an episode highlighting the level of confusion in the Greek command. He returned to Greece in 1923 as part of the prisoners of war exchange, but unlike other senior officers and politicians, who were charged for their role in the disaster in the Trial of the Six, he was never prosecuted. He was even recalled to active service and promoted to Lieutenant General, before finally retiring on 27 November 1927, after which he served as prefect of Attica and Boeotia. He died in 1956.

History Villa Ferretti in Caslano The center of the village is built within a Roman era fortification. While no trace of the actual fortification still exists, local tradition, the use of Castellano in place names and the compact structure of the once walled enclosure all indicate that the fortress existed. The hamlet of Torrazza was the source of bitter fighting between the Swiss Confederation and the Duchy of Milan. In 1604, the Treaty of Varese decided against the Italian municipality of Lavena Ponte Tresa and finally awarded it to Caslano. The parish church was built in 1653, incorporating an older building. The pre-industrial economy was based on fisheries, mines and kilns for lime and clay, transport by sea, agriculture and by remittances from emigrants. The local wealth is shown in the quality of the buildings in the village and in the neighboring towns of Pura and Collina d'Oro. After World War II, the traditional occupations lost their importance. Agriculture became less common, fisheries disappeared and the mines and furnaces were shut down. Other hand, tourism (hotels, restaurants, vacation homes, second homes), industry, trade and commerce all grew and led to a huge influx of commuters. Construction began throughout the village, and it grew into a tourist destination with a number of suburbs.

He commanded the 59th Brigade of the 30th Infantry Division during World War I, and served as a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1925 until his death. Tyson helped organize the Knoxville Cotton Mills in the early 20th century and served as president of the second Appalachian Exposition in 1911. A graduate of West Point, Tyson first saw military action during the Apache Wars in the 1880s. He moved to Knoxville in 1891 to teach military science at the University of Tennessee, and commanded the 6th Regiment, Tennessee Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. From 1902 to 1908, Tyson served in the Tennessee House of Representatives, and was Speaker of the House from 1903 to 1905. During the Meuse-Argonne Offensive of World War I, the 59th Brigade, under Tyson's leadership, became one of the first Allied brigades to break through the Hindenburg Line.W. Calvin Dickinson, Tennessee's General: Lawrence Tyson In World War I , SouthernHistory.net, July 1, 2003. Retrieved: February 3, 2011. Early life Tyson was born on the farm of his parents, Richard Lawrence Tyson and Margaret Turnage, near Greenville in Pitt County, North Carolina near the Tar River in the Tidewater region.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 498‚Äì499. He graduated from the Greenville Academy, and initially worked as a clerk in Salisbury. In 1878, he scored the highest in his region on a competitive entrance exam for the United States Military Academy at West Point, and was admitted the following year. Upon graduation in 1883, Tyson was commissioned as a second lieutenant, and took part in the Apache Wars against a Geronimo-led faction of Apaches in the West. In 1886, Tyson married Bettie Humes McGhee, the daughter of wealthy Knoxville railroad baron Charles McClung McGhee (1828‚Äì1907). With his father-in-law's help, Tyson was appointed professor of military science at the University of Tennessee in 1891.Lawrence D. Tyson: Philanthropist . Retrieved: February 3, 2011. He also enrolled in the university's law school, from which he graduated in 1894. After his admission to the Tennessee Bar, he resigned his military commission. He began practicing law. At one point, he worked for the law firm of Edward Terry Sanford (1865‚Äì1930), future Supreme Court justice. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and business ventures Upon the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, Tyson returned to active military duty. Appointed a colonel by President William McKinley, he organized and trained the 6th Regiment U.S. Volunteer Infantry in the Summer of 1898. In October, he and his unit were shipped to Puerto Rico, where they garrisoned the Arecibo area on the northern half of the island.John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, 1900; reprinted by Kessinger Books, 2010), pp. 188‚Äì189. As the war wound down in February 1899, Tyson's unit was ordered to Savannah, Georgia, where they were mustered out a month later. Tyson entered the National Guard reserve units. Back in Knoxville, Tyson returned to private law practice. He organized the Knoxville Cotton Mills, which would grow to become one of Knoxville's major textile companies in the early 20th century. In 1907, he chaired a conference in Nashville, which called for reform in child labor practices across the South.Perry Cotham, Toil, Turmoil & Triumph: A Portrait of the Tennessee Labor Movement (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 1995), p. 39. In December 1910, several dozen children were still working at a Knoxville Cotton Mills factory, as shown in a photograph by National Child Labor Committee photographer Lewis Hine.Lewis Hine (photographer), Doffer boys in Knoxville Cotton Mill. Smallest boy said he had been working there one year, e.g. State politics Tyson's first foray into politics came in 1902, when he was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1889, the Democrats had gained control of the state legislature and quickly passed four acts which they described as \\"electoral reform,\\" including literacy tests, grandfather clauses and poll taxes. These resulted in the disfranchisement of most of the African-American voters in the state, as well as many poor white voters. This sharply reduced competitive politics in the state, leading to Democratic dominance.Connie L. Lester, \\"Disfranchising Laws\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009/updated 2011 From 1903 to 1905, Tyson served as the elected Speaker of the House. Simultaneously, he served as a brigadier general and inspector general of the Tennessee National Guard, a position he held from 1902 to 1908. In 1913, he made an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate, seeking the Democratic nomination from the state legislature. That year, the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, providing for popular election of US senators. It generally affected elections for US senators beginning in 1914. World War I Upon U.S. entry into World War I, Tyson applied to return to active military duty, and was appointed brigadier general over all Tennessee National Guard troops by Governor Tom C. Rye. This commission was subsequently federalized by President Woodrow Wilson. Tyson was assigned to the 59th Brigade, 30th Infantry Division, and helped train the brigade at Camp Sevier near Greenville, South Carolina. The 30th embarked for France in May 1918, and were among the first American troops to enter Belgium in July of that year. In September 1918, the 30th Infantry Division was ordered to the Somme area in northern France, and positioned opposite the heavily fortified Cambrai-Saint Quentin Canal section of the Hindenburg Line. On the morning of September 29, the 30th attacked German fortifications along this section of the line. Marching in dense fog, the troops pushed across a stretch of \\"wire entanglements and trench defenses\\" before crossing the canal and securing the area. According to some reports, the 59th was the first Allied brigade to break through the Hindenburg Line. In subsequent weeks, the 59th captured the northern French villages of Pr√©mont, Brancourt, and Busigny, and fought its last action on October 20. In the course of the war, 1,879 of the 59th's 8,000 troops were killed or wounded. The brigade received nine Medals of Honor, the most of any single brigade in World War I. Tyson was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. In October 1918, Tyson's son, Charles McGhee Tyson (1889‚Äì1918), a Navy pilot, was lost over the North Sea while scouting for mines. After Germany's surrender, Tyson left the front to help search for his son off the coast of Scotland. He located his son's body, and shipped it back to Knoxville for burial. Tyson left active duty for the final time in 1919. Senate career Senator Tyson, photographed in his office in December 1925 In 1920, Tyson made an unsuccessful effort to gain the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention. In 1923, he purchased a newspaper, the Knoxville Sentinel. When he won the popular election to the U.S. Senate the following year, he sold the newspaper to Scripps-Howard.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 292‚Äì293. In 1926, Scripps-Howard merged the Sentinel with the Knoxville News to form the Knoxville News Sentinel. In the early 1920s, the Democratic Party had grown frustrated with Senator John Knight Shields, who had opposed President Woodrow Wilson's League of Nations, and had stalled a number of the Executive Branch's political appointments. Sensing Shields' vulnerability, Tyson ran against and defeated Shields in the Senate Democratic primary in 1924.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 284, 306‚Äì307. He defeated Republican candidate, Hugh B. Lindsay, in the general election later that year. He was sworn in as a Senator on March 4, 1925. Tyson's first major piece of legislation was the Tyson-Fitzgerald Act of 1925, which authorized federal compensation for disabled World War I officers. After President Calvin Coolidge vetoed the bill, Tyson rallied enough opposition in the Senate to override the president's veto. In 1926, Tyson sponsored legislation authorizing the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.Mark Banker, Appalachians All: East Tennesseans and the Elusive History of an American Region (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2010), p. 173. Death and legacy Tyson died in 1929 at a sanitarium in Strafford, Pennsylvania. He is buried in Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville. The obelisk marking the Tyson family plot is among the tallest monuments in the cemetery. In 1927, Lawrence and Bettie Tyson donated the land for what is now Tyson Park, as well as land for an airstrip (originally in West Knoxville), to the City of Knoxville, asking in return that the city name the airstrip for their son, Charles McGhee Tyson.

Gaiswinkler was born in Bad Aussee, Austria. In 1934, he was a political prisoner for some months. In 1944, while serving with the German Wehrmacht in France, he deserted and joined the Maquis, bringing with him four trucks of arms and ammunition and 500,000 francs. When the U.S. Third Army liberated Alsace in September 1944, he gave himself up to them (along with 17 German prisoners). He then went to work for the British Special Operations Executive and, in 1945, he was parachuted back into the Aussee area with three colleagues: Valentin Tarra, Johann Moser and Hans Renner. The Germans had pillaged a huge number of European art treasures during the Nazi period, and many had been stored in the Altaussee salt mine near Gaiswinkler's home town of Bad Aussee. After being dropped into the local area, Gaiswinkler raised a force of around 300 men and armed them with captured German weapons. He spent the last weeks and months of the war harassing local German forces. When the Americans arrived, his information helped them capture several eminent Nazis. He and his colleagues had captured the salt mine, prevented the destruction of the artworks held there and were able to hand over \\"a number of Nazi treasure hoards, including the Mona Lisa and the Austrian Imperial Crown Jewels\\". Other artworks rescued included the Ghent Altarpiece. The administrators of the Louvre have stated that the Mona Lisa was kept in France during the Second World War, but that it is possible that a 15th- or 16th-century copy of the Mona Lisa was held in Austria. After the war, Gaiswinkler was a SP√ñ member of the Austrian Parliament from 1945 to 1949. He died in Bad Aussee in 1979.

Geography Naka Ward is located in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and east of the geographic center of the city of Yokohama. Its name means \\"middle ward.\\" In the low-lying Northern district, commonly referred to as Kannai, it hosts the Yokohama city hall and the headquarters of the Kanagawa prefectural government. The central part of the ward includes elevated ground; this area, known as Yamate, has long been a residential area. Along the shore lies reclaimed land upon which port facilities, part of the Minato Mirai 21 complex, and Yamashita Park were built.

The northernmost and southernmost points are upland. =Surrounding municipalities= *Nishi Ward *Minami Ward *Isogo Ward History In the Edo period, the area of present-day Naka Ward was part of the tenry≈ç territory in Musashi Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various hatamoto. In the Bakumatsu Period, the signing of the Kanagawa Treaty provided for the opening of treaty ports, and the area of what is now central Naka Ward was designated as open to foreign settlement in 1859. The Yokohama Cricket Club (now known as the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club) was established in 1868. Yokohama Chinatown was also established during this period. After the Meiji Restoration, the area was transferred to the new Kuraki District in Kanagawa Prefecture. Yokohama's wards were established on October 10, 1927, with this area becoming Naka Ward. The 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake devastated downtown Yokohama. Yamashita Park was established in 1930 with landfill from the earthquake rubble. In December 1943, Minami Ward was separated from Naka Ward, which also gave up some territory to Kanagawa Ward and Hodogaya Ward. Nishi Ward was separated from Naka Ward in 1944. During World War II, the Yokohama Air Raid of May 29, 1945 left 14,157 people dead, injured, or missing. After the surrender of Japan, some 74% of the land, 90% of port area in Naka Ward was occupied by the American military. The last of this territory was not returned to Japan until March 31, 1982.

Early life Girodias was born Maurice Kahane in Paris, France, the son of Manchester-born Jack Kahane and a French heiress, Marcelle (n√©e Girodias).Jack Kahane, Memoirs of a Booklegger, The Obolus press, 2010, p. 5. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic.http://dongxi.net/b11tR/print\\"Pornography\\", Maurice Girodias, reply by Gore Vidal, New York Review of Books, May 12, 1966. Girodias lived a relatively idyllic childhood until the Depression forced his father to take up a new profession in Paris, publishing risqu√© books in English for the consumption of foreign tourists, who because of censorship could not obtain such materials at home. French censorship laws had a loophole allowing English works to be published without domestic confiscation. Kahane's venture (Girodias later took his mother's birth name to hide his partially Jewish background from the Nazis) was called Obelisk Press. It published notorious works by Frank Harris, Henry Miller and Ana√Øs Nin, as well as several pieces of light erotica written by Kahane himself. Girodias's involvement with his father's business started early. In 1934, at the age of 15, Girodias drew the disturbing crab picture seen on the original cover of Tropic of Cancer. After his father's early death in 1939, Girodias took over publishing duties, and at the age of 20 managed to survive Paris, World War II, Occupation and paper shortages. After the war, with his brother Eric Kahane, Girodias expanded operations, publishing Zorba the Greek (in French) and Henry Miller's Sexus, among other texts. The latter volume touched off a firestorm in France, with trials and arrests for obscenity. The 'Affaire Miller' ended with Girodias out of jail, but bankrupt and no longer in control of his company. The Olympia Press Expatriate writer Austryn Wainhouse introduced Girodias to a number of writers living in Paris associated with Merlin, a literary review; in order \\"to publish books legally in Paris, [Merlin] needed to demonstrate to the French authorities it had a French business partner.\\"p. 11, Nile Southern, The Candy Men: The Rollicking Life and Times of the Notorious Novel Candy. New York: Arcade Publishing, 2004. Girodias famously advised the group that the way out of poverty was for everyone to come and write dirty books for his new venture Olympia Press, which took its name from the similarity to his father's company, and Manet's famous portrait of a courtesan. Among those who wrote for Girodias in the early days were American author Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, John Glassco and Christopher Logue. Alexander Trocchi, John Stevenson (Marcus Van Heller), Glassco and Logue penned \\"db's\\" (\\"dirty books\\") for the Atlantic Library Series, a short-lived line of erotica. Beckett published Watt and his Malone Trilogy through the more literary Collection Merlin. The South African poet Sinclair Beiles was an editor at Olympia. After several police crackdowns, Girodias shifted his imprints, replacing the Atlantic Library with the Traveller's Companion Series, beginning with The Enormous Bed by John Coleman. Legal difficulties persuaded Girodias to include less openly erotic and more literary works in the series, and number six, Denny Bryant's Tender Was My Flesh, was followed by The Ginger Man, by J. P. Donleavy. Other famous titles published in the Traveller's Companion Series were Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov, The Naked Lunch by William S.

Other Olympia Press imprints included Ophir Books, Ophelia Press and Othello Books. =The Ginger Man= Girodias, very much against Donleavy's intention, published The Ginger Man as pornography. He seemed unable to grasp the literary merit of the work. When he did belatedly understand that he had a brilliant and original book, instead of acknowledging this, he tried to steal the rights from the author. Girodias and Donleavy sued each other back and forth for a period of 20 years following the publication of The Ginger Man. This litigation continued, even after Girodias' bankruptcy, when at auction Donleavy's wife bought the rights to the Olympia Press. Analysis of the original manuscript for The Ginger Man shows, in Donleavy's words, \\"a few major blunders and distinctly misplaced paragraphs and an odd misprint here and there, but the work with these exceptions had meticulously followed the manuscript\\". Donleavy won almost every case, though it was an expensive ordeal for both parties. =Lolita= A complicated arrangement accorded the Olympia Press roughly one-third of the royalties for Lolita after the novel's breakthrough success in America. However, Girodias lost this share when he failed to pay Nabokov on time for the French royalties. =Marcus van Heller= Girodias used to reprint the successful works of some authors under another imprint belonging to him (Ophelia Press) without the knowledge of the respective authors, in order to avoid giving them royalties for new editions. This was one of the main reasons that determined John Stevenson to end the collaboration with Girodias in 1961. In the years 1955‚Äì1961, under the pen name Marcus van Heller, Stevenson was the most prolific writer for the \\"Traveller's Companion\\" series, turning his pen name into a brand of sorts. Afterwards, Girodias used the fact that the real identity behind Marcus van Haller was largely unknown, commissioning other writers to publish new novels under this pen name. Legal troubles =Criminal= Girodias consistently ran into difficulties with the authorities throughout his career. The Paris police, often pressured by British customs, seized and destroyed many copies of his books. The courts would fine him, and by 1963 he found he had to leave Paris, first for Copenhagen, then for America, where Customs agents destroyed the microfilm copies of numerous TC titles Girodias possessed. He also got into serious trouble with Simon & Schuster and author Irving Wallace over a work called The Original Seven Minutes by J.J. Jadway. Copies of Girodias' Olympia Press title had to be destroyed before reaching the bookstores. His books were published in the United States under the Olympia Press, Traveller's Companion and Ophelia Press imprints. After acquiring the Venus Library name from Kable News, who had taken it from Barney Rosset's Grove Press in settlement of debts, Girodias published also under the Venus Freeway imprint, with distribution being handled by Kable News. His erotic and hardcore pornographic books were published also in the United Kingdom, in West Germany, Denmark and in The Netherlands under the Olympia Press imprint. The first British edition of Story of O by Pauline R√©age was published by Olympia Press. > \\"In 1964, Girodias was prosecuted for publishing obscene literature. He was > sentenced on March 3 to a year in jail, banned from publishing for twenty > years, and received a $20,000 fine. It was the most serious penalty ever > imposed on a publisher for offenses listed outrage aux moeurs par la voie du > livre. Girodias was probably ruined because of collusion amongst French, > American, and British authorities ... As a result, Girodias lost everything > and was ruined.\\" In 1974 Girodias published President Kissinger using the Venus Freeway imprint, a controversial work of science fiction by numerous authors offering a dream of socialism starring Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Girodias, it is said, was set up by the authorities in a phony drug deal and invited to leave the country. =Civil= Girodias tended not to pay his writers, if he could avoid it, not to document his work, or even live up to his contracts. He was involved in litigation concerning Lolita, Candy, The Ginger Man, Stradella and O, among other works. In the cases of Candy and O, Girodias won, setting a great deal of copyright precedents. In the cases of Lolita and The Ginger Man, he lost. Death On 3 July 1990, Girodias died of a heart attack. He was 71.

As of the early 1970s, the Achuar were one of the last of the Jivaroan groups still generally unaffected by outside contact. The name Achuar means ‚Äúthe people of the aguaje palm‚Äù. Lifestyle =Households= Achuar life centers on the domestic household, which consists of a basic family unit often including close relatives. Although the Achuar ideal is household autonomy and independence in terms of subsistence economy,Descola 1994: 108 there are usually about ten to fifteen households within the society dispersed throughout the area but still in a relatively close distance of each other. Each of these groupings tends to be uxorilocal. Marriages are typically polygynous, with partners somewhat related, or in some instances women are taken from nearby groups during raids. Co-wives are often sistersDescola 1994: 9 (see sororal polygyny). The standard Achuar home is settled near a river or lake, but at some distance from major waterways because of mosquitoes and to protect the household against raids by canoe.Descola 1994: 111 It is shaped as a large oval, commonly without outer walls to allow ventilation, with a high roof with straight sides. The roof is often made out of palm tree fronds while two types of palm are used for house beams. Temporary walls are made out of large palms when danger seems close. A large yard and gardens then surround the home on the outside. The size of a house plays a pivotal part in the ego of an Achuar man. The bigger the house is to fit multiple wives and children the more likely that man will be considered a juunt, or \\"great man\\". Conflicts within the Achuar society are minimal. The constant fight is between neighboring tribes and when tensions greatly increase, the Achuar find refuge in large protected houses that hold six to seven families. =Tasks= An Achuar man with a blowgun Women and men hold separate daily tasks that are all beneficial for the survival of a family. The women gather and carry the game, sometimes with their children, while also preparing meals. They also have the opportunity to fish with baskets or with lines but overall their role pertains to domestic duties. Men, on the other hand, work in the forest and hunt. They are also involved in making the tools they use for hunting, like blowguns and traps, and use the technique of clearing for the expansion of their spouses‚Äô gardens. Gardens are maintained solely by women, at least three days a week. They comprise a large quantity and variety of plant species, but their value delves much deeper than just a source of food. Women can find sanctuary in their gardens and express their grief and suffering in private, as public emotion is spurned. Women also give birth to their children in there, demonstrating the importance of gardens in Achuar lives. The Achuar follow an astronomical calendar of seasonal resources, like the fish season, which is divided into days, moons, and year. Aside from the everyday routine, there still remains time for leisure. Thirty- five percent of the day is spent on subsistence production, leaving the rest of the day open. Men and young boys have more time for relaxation compared to women who still have house chores to complete. Before being married, young boys do nothing all day while adolescent girls work in the garden. During the rest of the day, married men drink manioc beer and talk amongst each other while also doing handiwork, for example woodwork. Language The ethnic group Achuar forms part of the conjunction of the Shuar and form one of the four dialect groups that constitute the linguistic family of the Shuar (Achuar, Shuar, Aguaruna y Huambisa). The Achuar speak a Shuar language and Achuar-Shiwiar language, dialects of the Jivaroan languages. Achuar Chicham or Achuar are related to other languages such as Shuar Chicham but they differ greatly with the Awajunt language (except for some words and phrases). For this reason, some researchers believe they are not from the Jivaroana family. In the Achuar language, there are only four vowels: a, e, i, u. The 'e' is pronounced differently. The alphabet consists of 21 letters a, aa, ch, e, ee, i, ii, j, k, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, ts, u, uu, w, y. Religion and cosmology Shamanism is present in Achuar lifestyle and witchcraft is occasionally practiced by both ritual specialists and laypersons. An example of this is an institutionalized form of reciprocal violence that entitles a person to revert any harmful incidents or material another sent. Jivaroans, of which the Achuar are a sub-group, ascribe to a particular form of the pan-Amazonian animistic cosmological phenomenon known as 'Amazonian perspectivism,'see also the tab on Brazilian anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro who has written extensively on the subject of Amazonian perspectivism in which many animals and plants are understood to possess human souls, although their bodily appearance is different. Animals with human souls are significant for the Achuar, as they represent a form of socialized nature. The only way for a hunter to be successful is to live in harmony with the game he hunts and with its guardian spirits, known as kuntiniu nukuri (literally: \\"game mothers\\"). The hunter's relationship with both the prey and their \\"game mothers\\" is personal and cultivated over a lifetime, and these relationships are characterized principally as affinal. He must follow these two rules: taking these animals with moderation and showing respect to the animals he kills. Both of these rules of hunting are codified in cautionary myths. The Achuar believe that entities possessing human souls have the ability to communicate through language and signs. This is sometimes experienced during soul journeys, known as arutam encounters,For a synopsis of the relationships between body, soul, and Achuar self-identity and the role of arutam encounters see Taylor 1996. which represent an extreme state of self-awareness and are induced by the consumption of hallucinogenic drink. Ayahuasca is a ritual sacrament in Achuar religion. Dreams are essential for the Achuar as they are not only revealing, but also can be foretelling. Prior to engaging in any form of predatory behavior, whether warfare, hunting, or some forms of fishing, men often insist upon having a dream. Self-control is a fundamental aspect of Achuar beliefs, which is taught at a young age. Men exercise discipline to show will power and strength and the best place to display this is in their own home. Examples of self-control would be avoiding gluttony, being able to go without sleep, and not wasting anything. As well, another form of control would be over their expressions and attitudes, especially in front of visitors. Evading eye contact is key or else a sense of aggression might arise and mouths are covered when speaking. Saliva is the only product of the body that is publicly exposed. This is because female saliva is believed to be a source of fermentation of the manioc beer and male saliva is socially incorporated into the speech of a conversation. Gardens are watched over by the spirit of gardens, Nunkui. Women sing anents, magical songs, as a medium to communicate with their plants, Nunkui, and other particular objects. The songs are extremely personal so they are either sung in the head or on an instrument, but always in secret. Each anent has basically the same melodic structure but different lyrics. Yet gardens can also be perilous at times, specifically manioc which is believed to have traits of vampirism. Children are the main targets of the manioc and thus are not allowed to enter a garden without supervision. Blood is precious in the eyes of the Achuar who believe there is a finite amount of blood in each person and when lost it can never be replaced, therefore quickening death. Death The traditional form of burial for the Achuar is placing the deceased person in a hollowed-out log, resembling a canoe. During the funeral of a head of household, the canoe is buried in the middle of the house in remembrance of the continuing presence of the late figure. One spiritual belief of the Achuar regarding death, is the role of the remaining body parts of the dead body. These limbs acquire a life of their own and assume the bodies of certain animals. History Achuar were first written about by Western people in 1548; however, they avoided prolonged European contact until the 20th century. Christian missionaries did not gain a foothold in Achuar society until the 1940s and 1950s. Non-Indigenous influence on Achuar people Due to the development of the Amazon Rainforest the Achuar people's numbers and livelihood has been declining. When oil was discovered in the Amazon in 1964 oil companies began to make claims on land for development and profit. Such claims, their development, and a history of violent attacks on oil investment installations throughout the Amazon have resulted in the Achuar being excluded from a portion of operational & drilling areas in the territory traditionally claimed by the Achuar. Non-Indigenous contact has also seen introduction of new diseases (including new STDs) and conflict related to pollution from oil spills, improper business practices, and violent interactions. In multiple but not all cases, oil spills of various degrees have been inadequately remediated by simple burial. Major oil pipelines run above rivers that the Achuar depend on for bathing and drinking. When these oil pipelines break, pollution can and has occurred, thereby degrading the resource and limiting Achuar access to their historic fresh (but untreated) water sources. Violent conflicts with non-Indigenous people have arisen between oil company employees and the native Achuar. As in much of the Amazon Basin, indigenous sexual practices differ from those in non-Indigenous populations, and modern \\"safe sex\\" practices are very poorly disseminated thereby putting at risk their population and culture. As a consequence, some advocates claim that non-Indigenous contact contributes to a majority of indigenous deaths.

All of the G7e models shared standardized dimensions for all German torpedoes designed for use by U-boats during World War II, they measured 534.5 mm (21 inches) in diameter and 7.163 m in length. The standard warhead contained a main charge of 300 kg of Schie√üwolle 36, a mixture of dipicrylamine and TNT. All were powered by 100 hp (75 kW) electric motors and lead-acid batteries which required onboard maintenance to maintain their functionality. G7e(TII) The G7e(TII) went in service with German U-boat fleets in 1936. Its existence was virtually unknown to the British until fragments of one torpedo were recovered following the sinking of the Royal Oak in October 1939. The advantages of the G7e in contrast to the G7a steam-driven torpedo, rested in its simplicity and cheapness of manufacture, (half the cost) and the TII was virtually silent, left no visible trail of bubbles to alert ships that they were under attack. However, in all other respects, the TII was less reliable and performed unpredictably compared to the G7a(TI). It has no setting (for contact or magnetic detonation) beyond fixed range of 5,000m and ran much slower at . Additionally, the batteries of these torpedoes needed to be preheated to a temperature of 30 ¬∞C (85 ¬∞F) to operate with maximum speed and range, though generally this was a non-issue as U-boats had the element of surprise and often had the advantage of firing the first shot. Poor range and speed were not the TII's only problems. Both the contact and magnetic detonators were unreliable, major flaws that also afflicted the United States Navy's standard Mark 14 anti-submarine and anti-ship torpedo. The magnetic influence exploder, designed to allow the torpedo to run under the keel of a ship and detonate, breaking the ship's back, was inconsistent and would often detonate prematurely, or not at all. This led the BdU to order that all G7e(TII) torpedoes be fired only for contact detonation. However, the contact pistol of the TII also proved to be unreliable; the British battleship HMS Nelson managed to survive almost certain destruction when three torpedoes from struck on her keel, two broke upon hitting and the other failed to explode.Lt Cdr Geoffrey B Mason RN (Rtd) (c) 2003 \\"Service Histories of Royal Navy Warships in World War 2\\" \\"HMS Nelson - Nelson-class 16in gun Battleship\\" These technical defects lead to the circumstance that attacks on at least one battleship, seven heavy cruisers, seven destroyers and some cargo ships were not successful. Nevertheless, the German Navy, after much prodding by German U-boat Command (BdU), invested resources into correcting the TII's flaws. Gradually, it improved, and by the end of the Norwegian Campaign problems with the contact exploder and depth-keeping gear had been mostly solved, with significant strides made in improving the magnetic proximity feature. At the same time, the TII's range was increased from 5,000m to 7,500 m. By that time, however, the TII was already being phased out of production. G7e(TIII) Improvements in the design of the G7e(TII) were incorporated into the production of the next model of electric torpedo for Germany's U-boat fleet. Introduced in 1942, the TIII represented a vast improvement over the early TII. The faulty exploders from the TII were scrapped in favor of a new design. The TIII had a range of 7,500 m and could achieve 30 kt. With the improved design of the TIII and the new exploder, the G7a(TI) steam torpedo was totally superseded and was rarely used for the remainder of the war. Using the TIII's perfected proximity feature, U-boat captains could effectively fire under the keel of a ship and break the back of their targets with a single torpedo, increasing the overall effectiveness of the U-boat fleet. The TIII could be fitted with both the FaT (Fl√§chenabsuchender Torpedo) and LuT (Lagenunabh√§ngiger Torpedo) pattern running systems for convoy attacks. Though many opportunities had been missed due to the defects of the TII torpedo, with the new TIII U-boats were deadlier than ever. G7e(TIV) Falke The TIV Model was the adjunct of the earlier TIII model in nearly every way. The TIV was not an ordinary straight-running torpedo, it ran at 20 kt (37 km/h) for 7500 m and it might, depending on the exact date, have been the world's first acoustic homing torpedo in Naval service, since it was introduced in March 1943, the same month and year as the American Mk-24 \\"Mine\\" acoustic homing torpedo. Early in 1933 Germany started development and testing of acoustic homing mechanisms for torpedoes. From the outset of submarine warfare, submariners had dreamed of being able to aim and fire torpedoes without surfacing or using a periscope. The periscope gives away the location of a submarine, and a hull- penetrating periscope greatly weakens a submarine's pressure hull and limits the depths to which it can dive. U-boats also had to come to very shallow depths to use their periscopes, generally about 15 m, leaving them greatly exposed to bombing, depth charging, and even gunfire. With the introduction of Falke, U-boats could remain more deeply submerged and fire at convoys with nothing to give away their position but the noise of their screws. Rather than aiming with a periscope, the torpedo could be roughly aimed at a sound contact as detected by a U-boat's hydrophones, and the homing mechanism could be trusted to find the target without the need for precise aiming. Falke worked much like a normal straight-running torpedo for the first 400 m of its run, after which its acoustic sensors became active and searched for a target. The sensitive sound-sensing equipment in Falke required the torpedo be as quiet as possible, hence it ran at only ; in addition, the firing U-boat was forced to stop its motors. Falke was intended to home on merchant targets, however, so its slow speed was not a great hindrance. Only known to have been fired in action by three U-boats, , and , although regarded as successful, resulting in the sinking of several merchants, and its performance rated satisfactory, Falke was rapidly phased out of service. It was replaced by the G7es(TV) \\"Zaunk√∂nig\\" (referred to by the Allies as GNAT, for German Navy Acoustic Torpedo), which was faster and better able to home onto the sound of fast moving warships as well as merchant traffic. Though its period of operational service was brief, Falke was a proof of concept for the acoustic homing torpedo. Its introduction occurred only two months before the U.S. Navy achieved its initial combat success with the Mark 24 FIDO \\"mine.\\" FIDO was not a mine, but a passive, acoustic-homing torpedo designed for use by long-range patrol aircraft. The initial success with the Mark 24 occurred on 14 May 1943, when a PBY-5 from VP-84 sank with the new weapon. Most sources indicate that the Germans' first combat success with the Zaunk√∂nig (GNAT) did not occur until September 1943. While the Allies became aware in September 1943 that the Germans had brought GNAT into operational service, it was not until the capture of in June 1944 that they obtained reliable data on the German homing torpedo.

ATS traces its lineage back through the New York Tract Society (1812) and the New England Tract Society (1814) to the Religious Tract Society of London, begun in 1799. Over the years, ATS has produced and distributed many millions of pieces of literature. There is a printed pamphlet titled \\"Constitution of the American Tract Society, instituted in Boston 1814\\" referencing the distribution of 'Religious Tracts' by Christians in Europe and America during the previous twenty years. The purpose of which was to combine the energy & activities of various groups & individuals across New England. ATS is theologically conservative. It receives funding through a combination of private donations and tract sales. ATS accepts donations to fund tract and evangelistic resource distribution including start-up funding for foreign tract distribution in regions including Africa, Asia, India, South and Central America, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Churches and other evangelistic groups in the United States can purchase ATS literature at nominal cost for use in their own evangelistic ministries. ATS is board-governed and benefits from the visibility of its Council of Reference, an advisory board of evangelical notables from business, ministry, and other walks of life. ATS is currently headquartered in Garland, Texas. On September 1, 2012, American Tract Society entered into a joint publishing agreement with Good News Publishing, which is a division of Crossway.  Early history  Before ATS was founded, the Bible was the only religious book being distributed widely around the United States. The American Tract Society's founders felt that the American Bible Society was limited in its activities, leading to ATS's establishment. ATS was created from a merger of the New York Religious Tract Society, founded 1812, and New England Religious Tract Society, founded 1814. William Allen Hallock helped the New England Religious Tract Society change its name to the American Tract Society in 1823. The New England society surrendered that name to a national society proposed by the New York society, which was formed on May 10, 1825. The separate tract societies merged and moved into a four-story building at 87 Nassau Street in New York City. The numbering of that house was revised over the years, changing to 144 Nassau Street in 1827 and 150 Nassau Street by 1833. A new tract house was built on the same site in 1846-1847. Upon ATS's 1825 creation, it became the first organization in the U.S. formed specifically to give out religious tracts. Hallock subsequently served as the organization's secretary from 1825 to 1870, and as secretary emeritus until his death in 1880. Sampson Uryling Stoddard Wilder was the first president, serving until 1842, and Moses Allen was the first treasurer, serving until 1863. The organization was dependent on endowments and financial contributions from wealthy backers. It was successful, printing out 700,000 tracts in its first year and 5 million tracts per year by 1850, with branches in multiple American cities. ATS took advantage of the population's growing literacy, distributing tracts to immigrants, Native Americans and freed slaves. In 1894, ATS built its 23-story American Tract Society Building at 150 Nassau Street, which still stands today. At the time of its construction it was one of the tallest buildings in New York City. Throughout the nineteenth century, ATS used traveling salesmen. These peddlers sold tracts, provided counseling, and led church services. Today The American Tract Society has disseminated Christian tracts for over 185 years, and believes its mission and message are as relevant today as when it was formed in 1825. In 1978, ATS relocated its headquarters from New York to Garland, Texas. The move came about as a result of the growing number of churches and ministries purchasing ATS literature in Texas. The leaders of American Tract Society also discovered that it would be cost effective to have the ATS office in Texas. The ever-increasing advances in technology and social media present both challenges and opportunities for ATS in disseminating its message. Over the years ATS has developed a number of ways to present the gospel in a relevant and timely manner. ATS continues to develop new tools to communicate Christian teachings to the next generation. Through its international division (International Tract Society) ATS has approximately 136 print partners in 70 countries who print and distribute tracts in over 100 languages. The goal is to provide ATS print partners with the necessary resources and funding to print and distribute evangelism tools among disadvantaged churches and evangelists worldwide.

The area is also historically important geologically, and featured in one of the most contentious disputes of the 19th century, between the 'Diluvialists' who believed in the Biblical flood, and the ‚ÄòGlacialists‚Äô, who supported the Glacial Theory, which was substantially established by studies of the drift sediments on Moel Tryfan. Between 85-90% of the population of the Nantlle Valley speak Welsh as their first language. Some of the communities came into being as a result of slate quarrying in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries and some have a history stretching back to antiquity. There are Iron Age forts at Caer Engan in Pen-y-groes and on the coast at Dinas Dinlle\\"Aerial photograph of Dinas Dinlle Iron Age hillfort and evidence of Bronze Age settlement on the higher ground. The valley was important during the Middle Ages - with a clas or ecclesiastical college developed at Clynnog Fawr. The Glynllifon estate can trace its foundation historically to the 8th century and there is evidence of occupation on the site going back to the Iron Age. There were a number of quarries in the valley, the largest being the Dorothea and Pen yr Orsedd quarries. Although the major quarries are worked out, there remains demand for slate waste for garden decoration. In 1991, Antur Nantlle Cyf was established as a community enterprise to work for the benefit of the Nantlle Valley and its surrounding area.  Slate quarrying  Dyffryn Nantlle was one of the major slate quarrying regions of Wales during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, having at least 37 operating slate quarries at one given time. It was an innovative region in the development of the slate industry. The Cilgwyn quarry on the north side of the valley is the oldest in Wales and one of the oldest in Europe, dating from the 12th century. The first steam engine to be used in the slate industry was a pump installed at the Hafodlas quarry in the valley in 1807. Slate roofing tiles have been excavated at Segontium Roman camp in Caernarfon and are thought to have originated in the Nantlle Valley. The quarries of the area are being considered as a World Heritage site. Unlike most of the other slate producing regions in Wales the Nantlle Valley developed a large number of small, independent quarries because most of the land in the valley was owned by a number of small landowners rather than a single large landowner. At the height of the industry there were over 50 quarries being worked in the valley. Due to this the quarries were never managed as a large single concern as they were in the Penrhyn, Dinorwic and the Festiniog area quarries and this led to the industry in the area being much more vulnerable to any downturns in the economy. This also led to the development of an industrial landscape that is quite different from the other slate quarrying regions in that there are a large number of small waste slate heaps around the valley. There were considerable difficulties involved in raising slate from the pits and in keeping them free from water, and the ingenious ways which were found to solve these problems, including blondins, chain inclines and vast revetments, are some of the principal reasons why the slate quarrying remains in this area, many of which are unique, are so important. Some of the principal features include the 1906 Cornish beam-engine at Dorothea, a unique survival in Wales, the mill and a number of pyramids, also unique, and the blondins at Pen-yr- Orsedd quarry. Originally there were two lakes on the valley floor but one has now disappeared and the water is largely contained by the Dorothea quarry pit. Richard Wilson, View of Snowdon from Llyn Nantlle - WGA25772. The famous painting depicts the area before industrialisation. A dispute between local crofter-quarrymen and the local large landowner, Lord Newborough of the Wynn family from Glynllifon became an important legal landmark in the early 19th century. In 1823, Lord Newborough tried to have a law passed to give him control of all the Moel Tryfan Commons, including recent encroachments, and to extinguish the rights of common use. This move was met with fearsome opposition, not least from one John Evans who was concerned that enclosure around the Cilgwyn quarries would affect his own interests, particularly over a dam and watercourse that he had constructed on Crown land in 1816. Evans organised a commoners‚Äô petition against the Bill, with seven hundred signatures. The petitioners claimed that their cottages had been built over forty years earlier, that originally the land had been too wild for cultivation, and that they had improved it by hard work. This led to a change in the land enclosure law in the United Kingdom. Another dispute much celebrated in the area took place a generation later centred on the largest quarry in the valley. Dorothea Quarry was bought in 1835 by an Englishman called Muskett. He spent heavily on new equipment to raise the wagons from the quarry bottom. But he overspent, and was declared bankrupt a few years later. The quarry was closed with three months wages owing to most of the workers. They consequently revolted and demolished the new house Muskett had built for himself - Plas y Cilgwyn.  The Nantlle Railway  The Nantlle Railway The horse-drawn gauge Nantlle Railway served the quarries from 1828 to 1963, although from 1865 the line was cut back to Tyddyn Bengam, and in 1871 only the portion from the standard gauge railhead at Nantlle railway station in Talysarn was in use. The Nantlle railway has a long history as an industrial and passenger line. The line received its Act of Parliament in 1825 and was constructed under the supervision of Robert Stephenson, brother of George Stephenson. It opened in 1828 and was operated using horse power. Although built mainly for the transport of slate, the line is known to have carried passengers at various times between Caernarfon and Pen-y-groes. It is the last recorded use of horses by British Railways, and closed only with the closure of the branch line to which it connected after the Beeching Review in 1963.G.H. Williams, Swn y tr√™n sy'n taranu, (Caernarfon, 2018), passim. Culture The Nantlle Valley is famous within Wales for being the main setting of the Fourth branch of the Mabinogion, Math fab Manawydan, the story of Lleu Llaw Gyffes, Blodeuwedd and Gwydion. The story is set mainly in the area with Gwydion finding Lleu transfigured into an eagle in an oak tree at Baladeulyn (the ground that used to exist between the two lakes before industrialisation). There are numerous references to the valley in the Welsh Triads (Trioedd Ynys Prydain) as well. The valley was noted for its woodlands and was an important area in the Middle Ages, being used as a hunting park for the royal family of Gwynedd. After the Edwardian conquest in 1282, one of the first recorded jousts in Britain was held on the fields of Baladeulyn near the village of Nantlle as the royal entourage made its way from Nefyn after the war. Rules were apparently drawn up here which later were the basis of the 1292 Statute of Arms issued by Edward I to regulate jousting. The area is also famous for the variety, breadth and amount of folk-lore associated with fairies, right up until the present times. This lore was recorded extensively by John Owen Huws in the 1970s and 1980s and published in his landmark three- volume work Straeon Gwerin Ardal Eryri (Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 2008). The Nantlle Valley also became one of the power-houses of Welsh literature during the 20th century. Notable examples include the poetsT.H. Parry-Williams from Rhyd Ddu and R. Williams Parry from Talysarn. Mathonwy Hughes, from Mynydd Cymffyrch, and Gwilym R. Jones, from Talysarn, grew up in the valley, as did the modern dramatist John Gwilym Jones (of Y Groeslon) and the novelist Kate Roberts (Rhosgadfan) also grew up there. Prolific author of children's and young adult novels J. Selwyn Lloyd was born near Talysarn. Angharad Tomos, author and children's author from Llanwnda, also attended the local secondary school and now lives in Pen-y-groes, as does the American-born Welsh-speaking author Professor Jerry Hunter. World renowned opera singer Bryn Terfel grew up in Pant Glas, on the outskirts of the valley, and attended the local schools Ysgol Llanllyfni and Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle. Singer and actor Bryn F√¥n from Llanllyfni and actor and author Mari Gwilym grew up in Pontllyfni. In the earlier part of the 20th century Nantlle produced the Brodyr Francis (the Francis Brothers) who toured Wales and beyond. In the 19th century the valley had a number of brass and silver bands. Some famous for their playing ability, such as the Nantlle Royal Silver Band, are still extant. Others were more noted for their drinking ability and prowess with their fists, notably the Llanllyfni brass band and some of the Pen-y-Groes brass bands, as recorded by Geraint Jones in his book about the development of brass and silver bands in north Wales, Cyrn y Diafol (Gwasg Gwynedd 2004).  Mountains  The Nantlle Ridge is regarded by many walkers as a classic route in the UK. Although usually classed as a 'moderate' walk with only minimal scrambling on the eastern side, it can be a challenge because of its route being a traverse only mainly and therefore usually needing transport at the end of the walk back to the start point and also because of the changeable weather--as the westernmost limb of Snowdonia, the area can be the first to experience bad weather coming in from the Atlantic. The views though are considered some of the best in North Wales, with the Snowdon massif to the east, Anglesey to the north, the expanse of Caernarfon Bay and the Ll≈∑n Peininsula to the west and Cardigan bay and the Welsh coast all the way down to Pembrokeshire visible to the south. It is regularly voted one of the best and quietest routes in Snowdonia (19th on the 50 Greatest Hill Routes in Trail magazine, 2009; 21st in the Greatest Ridge walks in the UK in The Great Outdoors magazine, 2013). The Nantlle Ridge has two Marilyns and four Hewitts on the route, the ridge is about 8‚Äì9 miles long and the high point is Craig Cwm Silyn at 2,408 feet: Y Garn: 2,077 ft - 633 m (Nuttall) Mynydd Drws y Coed: 2,280 ft - 695 m (Hewitt) Trum y Ddysgl: 2,326 ft - 709m (Marilyn) Craig Cwm Silyn: 2,408 ft - 734 m (Marilyn) Garnedd Goch: 2,300 ft - 701 m (Nuttall) Mynydd Graig Goch: 2,000 ft - 610 m (Hewitt) On the north side of the valley is the well known Mynydd Mawr (also known as Elephant mountain from viewing it from the Caernarfon side as it resembles an Indian elephant) - which trickles down to the Cilgwyn and then gently down to the valley floor - a walking route follows the path down to the valley floor. The pass through the mountains at the eastern end of the valley is known as Drws-y-Coed (the door of the trees) and was a path that reputedly was hewn by Edward I's men after the conquest. In this part of the valley are numerous old copper mining shafts and old industrial linked buildings. There is also a memorial to a chapel that was demolished when a large boulder rolled down the mountainside and crashed into it. At the top of the valley is Llyn y Dywarchen where Giraldus Cambrensis in 1188 told of the lake ‚Äòhaving a floating island in it which is driven from one side to the other by the force of the wind‚Äô. His explanation at that time was perfectly rational. ‚ÄòA part of the bank naturally bound together by the roots of willows and other shrubs may have broken off and being continually agitated by the winds....it cannot reunite itself firmly with the banks.‚Äô The astronomer and scientist Edmund Halley swam out to the island in 1698 to verify that it did indeed float. Thomas Pennant in 1784 claimed to have seen the island and confirmed that cattle which strayed upon it when it was near the shore were occasionally marooned when it began to move. The lake is used for fishing now and the car park there is on the site of a former clandestine Moravian lodging and chapel- one of only about 40 to have been built in the UK and therefore extremely rare, before being demolished - established in the 18th century (1704-1760s) and one of the forerunners of Methodism.  Tourism  A report by Gwynedd County Council in 2006 profiled the tourist industry in the Natlle Valley and made recommendations for the future. The report lists the following tourist-based business in the valley: \\"25 tourist businesses were identified in the Nantlle Valley, 23 of these took part in the survey. Of these 25 there were 7 caravan / camping sites, 4 hotels, 3 guesthouses or B&B;, 3 attractions, 3 educational centres, 2 public houses (who have tourist accommodation), 2 specialist retailers and 1 holiday cottage provider. The 23 establishments questioned have 67 full-time employees and 105-part time1. Hotels are the main full-time employers (19 posts), but it is the caravan sites that are the main full and part-time employers (35 posts).\\" Although the valley has plenty of natural resources ‚Äì hiking, fishing, industrial heritage, the Glynllifon grounds and a long sandy and safe bathing beach at Dinas Dinlle ‚Äì the infrastructure to support and develop tourism is not as well developed as other areas. The report makes recommendations for future development in the area. Some of the already developed attractions are the Glynllifon Estate grounds and the aircraft museum and airport at Dinas Dinlle. An \\"unofficial\\" but hugely popular attraction is the old disused Dorothea Quarry - the old quarry has flooded now and attracts large numbers of divers to it. When the quarry flooded the 'galleries' and all the tackle and machinery that were on them were still present which makes diving there particularly dangerous. The unregulated nature and depth of the site has encouraged some divers to overestimate their capabilities ‚Äì in the decade 1994‚Äì2004 21 divers lost their lives in the quarry. It has also been the site of unofficial raves in the past.  Sport  The Nantlle Valley is predominantly a football-playing region and a number of football clubs have been founded in the area over the years. The most prominent being Nantlle Vale FC which was established in the early part of the 20th century and is still playing, based at Pen-y-groes. Talysarn Celts FC is based at Tal-y-sarn, a team in Llanllyfni and Mountain Rangers in Rhosgadfan.

The film stars Sally Field, Kiefer Sutherland, Ed Harris, Beverly D'Angelo and Joe Mantegna. The story was adapted from Erika Holzer's novel of the same name. The film opened on January 12, 1996. Plot Karen McCann is happily married to Mack and has two daughters, 17-year-old Julie (from Karen's previous marriage) and six-year-old Megan (with Mack). She lives in a lovely two-story home in Pacific Palisades, California and has a good job in a museum. Karen's perfect world is suddenly shattered when Julie is violently raped and murdered while Karen listens helplessly on the phone from her car. Detective Sergeant Joe Denillo assures Karen there is enough DNA evidence to find and convict the killer. He encourages the McCanns to seek counseling. At a support group, they meet people in similar circumstances, including Albert and Regina Gratz, and Sidney Hughes. During the meeting, Karen overhears Albert talking to Sidney about something which alarms Regina. The DNA tests reveal the killer, Robert Doob, a delivery man with a criminal record. At the trial it is clear Doob is guilty, but because the defense did not receive a sample of the DNA evidence, the judge dismisses the case. Karen and Mack are dumbstruck as Doob walks free. When Doob launches an antagonizing apology at Karen it causes Mack to snap and furiously attack Doob, but is overpowered by guards and Doob walks out unharmed. Mack is desperate to return to a normal life, but Karen cannot stop thinking of Doob. She finds the apartment where he lives, then keeps detailed records of his movements, stalking him. After observing Doob urinate on a customer's lawn after a delivery she goes to Denillo ‚Äî but he tells her there's no evidence of intent. Karen attempts to warn the delivery customer, but the woman only speaks Spanish and does not understand her. Karen later learns that the murderer of the son of a member of her support group has been killed in a drive-by shooting, just days after being released from prison. Angel, also in the self-help group, tells Karen the best way to get over her grief is to focus on having good experiences with her living daughter ‚Äî and Karen realizes she has been so fixated on Doob that Megan has been deprived of her attention. Meanwhile, Doob has gone to Megan's school and struck up a conversation with the girl during recess. When Karen comes to pick up Megan, Doob deliberately intimidates her. Worried for Megan's safety, Karen's sanity is on the rocks and remembers what happened to the killer of her friend's son and approaches Sidney, who admits the drive-by shooting was set up by him and Martin. Karen demands their help and they agree to find a weapon, train her, and plan the murder, but tell her she has to carry it out. Karen agrees and they begin plotting. She also joins a self-defense class which helps her gain more confidence, helps rekindle her sex life with Mack, and improves her relationship with Megan. Karen feels encouraged. Although Martin doubts Karen is capable of murder, Sidney gives her a gun. The next day, Angel reveals that she is really an undercover FBI Agent investigating vigilante activity. Angel warns Karen not to kill Doob. Karen calls Sidney to tell him she cannot go through with it. However, she soon changes her mind when she learns that the Hispanic customer she tried to warn about Doob has been raped and murdered just as Julie had been. Karen is so furious she accuses Denillo of not finding enough evidence, letting Doob go free. Hearing Doob has again gotten off on a technicality bolsters her resolve. Karen decides that the only way to avenge her daughter's murder and save her family from Doob is to kill him. She sets a trap to lure Doob into her home, so that she can say killing him was self- defense. It works. She shoots Doob dead and calls the police. Denillo arrives and tells Karen that he knows the truth and that she hasn't fooled him, to which she replies, \\"Prove it.\\" He decides to tell his colleague that it was a \\"clear case of self-defense\\". When her husband arrives, he sits beside her, holding her hand, knowing what she has done.

He is notable for his service as Envoy to Court of St. James's from 1885 to 1889. In addition, Phelps was a founder of the American Bar Association, and served as its president from 1880 to 1881. A prominent Democrat even as Vermont was trending towards the Republicans, Phelps was the son of Senator Samuel S. Phelps and his first wife, Frances (Shurtleff) Phelps. Edward Phelps graduated from Middlebury College in 1840, taught school in Virginia, and studied for a career as an attorney, first at Yale Law School, and then in the office of Middlebury attorney Horatio Seymour. He practiced in Burlington, and served as Second Comptroller of the Treasury from 1851 to 1853. He supported the Union, but as a critic of what he regarded as the excesses of the Abraham Lincoln administration. He served as a delegate to the Vermont constitutional convention of 1870, and was one of the founders of the American Bar Association. Phelps served as ABA president from 1880 to 1881. In 1880, he was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor of Vermont. Phelps was Envoy to Court of St. James's in Britain from 1885 to 1889. He later taught law at Yale Law School, the University of Vermont, and Boston University. He supported Republicans after 1896, in response to his disagreement with the Democratic Party's turn towards the Free Silver movement. He died in New Haven, Connecticut, and was buried at Greenmount Cemetery in Burlington. Schooling Phelps' father Samuel S. Phelps had been a U.S. Senator from Vermont. Edward Phelps was born in Middlebury, graduated from Middlebury College in 1840, and worked as a school teacher and principal in Virginia. He studied law at the Yale Law School, completed his studies in the office of Horatio Seymour, and began practicing in Middlebury in 1843. Phelps moved to Burlington in 1845. Professional and academic life Phelps practiced in Burlington with different partners at various times, the most prominent being David Allen Smalley. Phelps and Smalley included George F. Edmunds among the prospective attorneys who studied law with them. From 1851 to 1853, Phelps served as Second Comptroller of the Treasury. He then practiced law in New York City as a partner in Wakeman, Latting & Phelps, the senior partner of which was Abram Wakeman. He returned to Burlington in 1857 and resumed practicing law. Originally a Whig, after that party's demise he became a Democrat. He served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1870. Phelps was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and was its president in 1880-1881. From 1881 until his death he was Kent Professor of Law at Yale Law School. Political activities In 1880 Phelps was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Vermont. Democrats were a perpetual minority in Vermont, and lost every statewide election from the 1850s to the 1960s. 1880 was no exception, and Phelps was excoriated as an unrepentant Copperhead: > Had he maintained his resolution to accept no political nomination, the > memory of his attitude during the memory of his attitude from 1860 to 1865 > might have quite died; but the Democratic nomination and his speech of > acceptance, in which, with surprising want of tact, he aired afresh his old > hatred of the African and attacked the Southern Republicans, white and > black, with a virulence which few Southern Democrats could equal ‚Ä¶ have > brought it into strong prominence. Still stronger light has been thrown on > it by the publication of a careful stenographic report of a speech made by > Mr. Phelps in September, 1864, before a little club of Copperheads in > Burlington. In this he called Mr. Lincoln a 'wooden-head' and a 'twentieth- > rate back country attorney,' declared that the North was fighting simply to > 'turn loose all the [racial epithet]' and 'whitewash the [racial epithet] in > the blood of millions[.]'.New York Times, \\"Vermont Ready to Vote,\\" September > 1, 1880, page 1 Phelps was Envoy to Court of St. James's in Britain from 1885 to 1889, and in 1893 served as senior counsel for the United States before the international tribunal at Paris to settle the Bering Sea Controversy. His closing argument, requiring eleven days for its delivery, was an exhaustive review of the case. The ruling favored the British, and the Americans were denied the exclusive jurisdiction they had claimed. Phelps lectured on medical jurisprudence at the University of Vermont in 1881-1883, and on constitutional law at Boston University in 1882-1883, and delivered numerous addresses, among them The United States Supreme Court and the Sovereignty of the People at the centennial celebration of the Federal Judiciary in 1890, and an oration at the dedication of the Bennington Battle Monument, unveiled in 1891 at the centennial of Vermont's admission to the Union. In politics, Phelps was always conservative, opposing the anti-slavery movement before 1860, the free-silver movement in 1896, when he supported the Republican presidential ticket, and after 1898 becoming an ardent \\"anti-expansionist.\\" President Grover Cleveland intended to appoint him as U.S. Chief Justice in 1888, but Phelps was concerned that his tenure as ambassador to the Court of St. James's in Great Britain would cause the Democratic Party to lose the support of Irish Americans, and he declined. In 1893, Phelps was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Phelps died in New Haven, Connecticut. Former Yale University president Timothy Dwight V eulogized Phelps. He was buried in Burlington's Greenmount Cemetery. Family Edward John Phelps married Mary S. Haight in 1847; the marriage produced 3 children: Edward Haight Phelps (1847‚Äì1884), Mary Haight Phelps (1857‚Äì1911) who married Horatio Loomis, and Charles Pierpont Phelps (1861‚Äì1912).

Horse-drawn trams were introduced in Kolkata in 1873; electric trams began in Chennai in 1895, and trams were also introduced in Mumbai, Baroda, Nashik, Kanpur, Kerala, Patna and Bhavnagar. They were discontinued in all Indian cities between 1930 and 1970, except for Kolkata. Kolkata Tram in Kolkata Trams in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), West Bengal are operated by the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC). It is the only operating tram network in India and the oldest operating electric tram in Asia, running since 1902. There are 257 trams in total, of which 125 used to run daily on the Kolkata streets, but now only 35 trams run daily. The single-deck articulated cars can carry 200 passengers (60 seated). The first horse-drawn trams in India ran a distance between Sealdah and Armenian Ghat Street on 24 February 1873. The service was discontinued on 20 November of that year. CTC website. Accessed 16 August 2013. The Calcutta Tramway Company was formed and registered in London on 22 December 1880. Metre-gauge horse-drawn tram tracks were laid from Sealdah to Armenian Ghat via Bowbazar Street, Dalhousie Square and Strand Road. The route was inaugurated by Viceroy Ripon on 1 November 1880. In 1882, steam locomotives were deployed experimentally to haul tram cars. By the end of the 19th century the company owned 166 tram cars, 1000 horses, seven steam locomotives and 19 miles of tram tracks. In 1900, electrification of the tramway and reconstruction of its tracks to (standard gauge) began. In 1902, the first electric tramcar in India ran from Esplanade to Kidderpore on 27 March and on 14 June from Esplanade to Kalighat. The Calcutta Tramways Company is in the process of upgrading the existing tram network in Kolkata at a cost of . Mumbai 1920s double-decker tram in Mumbai A mass public-transport system for Mumbai (then Bombay) was proposed in 1865 by an American company, which applied for a licence to operate a horse-drawn tram system. Although a licence was granted, the project was never realised due to the city's economic depression. The Bombay Tramway Company was set up in 1873. After a contract was signed between the Bombay Tramway Company, the municipality and the Stearns and Kitteredge company, the Bombay Presidency enacted the Bombay Tramways Act, 1874 licensing the company to run a horsecar tram service in the city. On 9 May 1874 the first horse-drawn carriage made its d√©but in the city, plying the Colaba‚ÄìPydhone via Crawford Market, and Bori Bunder to Pydhonie via Kalbadevi routes. The initial fare was three annas (15 paise pre- decimalisation), and no tickets were issued. As the service became increasingly popular, the fare was reduced to two annas (10 pre-decimalisation paise). Later that year, tickets were issued to curb increasing ticket-less travel. Stearns and Kitteredge reportedly had a stable of 1,360 horses over the lifetime of the service. In 1899, the Bombay Tramway Company applied to the municipality to operate electric trams. In 1904, the British Electric Traction Company applied for a license to supply electricity to the city with the Brush Electrical Engineering Company its agent. It received the Bombay electric license on 31 July 1905, signed by Bombay Tramways Company, the Bombay Municipality and the Brush Electrical Company. In 1905, the Bombay Electric Supply and Tramway Company (BEST) was formed. BEST received a monopoly on electric supply and an electric tram service in the city, and bought the Bombay Tramway Company's assets for . Two years later, the first electric tram debuted in the city. Later that year, a steam power generator was commissioned at Wari Bunder. In 1916 a power purchase from Tata Power (a private company) began, and by 1925 all power generation was outsourced from Tata. To ease rush-hour traffic, double-decker trams were introduced in September 1920. The trams met travellers' needs until the betterment of the city's train network, and the service closed on 31 March 1964.Tram views of Asia Retrieved 2011-03-16. Nashik Trams in Nashik (then Nasik) were built in 1889 as narrow gauge. The consulting engineer was Everard Calthrop, later known with the Barsi Light Railway. Originally, the tram used two carriages pulled by four horses. It ran from the present Old Municipal Corporation building on Main Road to the Nasik Road railway station, a distance of . The stretch between Nashik and Nashik Road was jungle-covered, and the only mode of transport from the station to the city was horse-drawn carriage or one of two taxis. The tram ceased operations between 1931 and 1933. Chennai Trams in Chennai (then Madras) operated between the docks and the inland areas, carrying goods and passengers. When the system began on 7 May 1895, it was India's first electric tram system. The original conduit system was replaced by a conventional overhead wire system after a series of destructive monsoons. The trams could carry heavy loads and were popular, with thousands of riders daily. The route included Mount Road, Parry's Corner, Poonamallee Road and the Ripon Building. At its height in 1921, 97 cars ran on of track. The tram company went bankrupt about 1950, and the system closed on 12 April 1953. Kanpur In June 1907, trams were introduced in Kanpur (then Cawnpore). There were of track and 20 single-deck open trams. The single-track line connected the railway station with Sirsaya Ghat on the banks of the Ganges. Photographs of Cawnpore trams are rare. The introductory stock was electric- traction single-coach; single-coach trams were also used in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. The service was discontinued on 16 May 1933. Kerala The Cochin State Forest Tramway was a Journal on the Cochin State Forest Tramway forest tramway running from the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary in Palakkad district to Chalakudy in Thrissur district. Operating from 1907 to 1963, it served the then Cochin state (now part of Kerala) and brought teak and rosewood from forests for global shipment. Delhi A tram in Delhi Trams in Delhi began operation on 6 March 1908. At its zenith in 1921, there were 24 open cars on of track. Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazaar, Katra Badiyan, Lal Kuan and Fatehpuri were linked with Sabzi Mandi, Sadar Bazar, Paharganj, Ajmeri Gate, Bara Hindu Rao and Tis Hazari. The system closed in 1963 due to urban congestion. Patna Patna had horse-drawn trams as urban transport\\"First- ever book on Patna soon\\". The Times of India, September 23, 2008 Retrieved 2011-03-16. The tram in Patna ran in the populated area of Ashok Rajpath, from Patna City to Bankipore, with its western terminus at Sabzibagh (opposite the Pirbahore police station). It was discontinued in 1903 due to low ridership, and plans to extend the route westward never materialised. Bhavnagar Bhavnagar had a narrow-gauge tram built by Bhavnagar State. The first section was built in 1926 from Bhavnagar south to Talaja, and was extended to Mahuva in 1938. The total length of the tramway was . The tramway used small 4-8-0 locomotives later classified as T-class. In 1947 the tramway was taken over by the Saurashtra Railway, and later by the Western Railway.Hughes, Hugh 1994 Indian Locomotives Pt. 3, Narrow Gauge 1863-1940. Continental Railway Circle.

It is located at latitude 40¬∞28' 16 N: longitude 71¬∞43' 29 E. at an altitude of 487 meters. According to European legend, Margilan was founded by Alexander the Great. On a lunch stop, he was given chicken (murgh; in ) and bread (nan; in Persian: ), from which the town took its name. More reliable records indicate that Margilan was an important stop on the Silk Road by the 9th century AD, along the route going across the Alay Mountains to Kashgar. Writing in the early 16th century, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, Babur, mentioned that ‚Äúthe pomegranates and apricots are superb .... the game in Margilan is good; white deer may be found nearby.

He was born in Metz, France to copperplate engraver Sebastian le Clerc and his wife Charlotte van den Kerckhove. He was summoned to Denmark at the age of 47, and lived out the rest of his life there as a royal sculptor to the Danish Court and as professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Art. He helped introduce French Rococo artistic ideals to Denmark. Life =Training and student travels= He studied at the French Academy of Art, the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture under sculptor Charles-Antoine Coysevox. There he won two prizes for his work. =Early career= He traveled to Ansbach in Bavaria and Br√ºhl near Cologne in 1734-1735. In Ansbach he worked for the Margrave Carl Wilhelm Friderich. In Br√ºhl he worked for Cologne‚Äôs Archbishop and German Empire Prince Elector Clemens August von Wittelsbach. Here he assisted Bavarian Court master builder, architect Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s 1734-1735 on the Elector‚Äôs hunting lodge Falkenlust (also known as Schloss Falkenlust), on the grounds of Augustusburg (also known as Schloss Augustusburg). These buildings are now considered the most important buildings of the late Baroque and Rococo in all of the Rhineland. They were declared a World Heritage Site in 1984 by UNESCO. Figure groups in wall niches in the upper vestibule sculpted by le Clerc are still extant. =Summons to Denmark= He was summoned to Denmark in the summer of 1735 by King Christian VI to help with the interior decoration of Christiansborg Palace. He arrived that same year along with his wife, Caroline Wilhelmine Isabella, and was named royal sculptor to the Danish Court in December of that same year. He was, along with Elias David H√§usser and Nicolai Eigtved, one of the primary figures involved in the creation of Christiansborg. He was named head of the sculpture and stone work at the palace in 1737. Most of the work he did at Christiansborg, however, was eventually lost, having been destroyed in the fire of 1794. Existing still to this day are wood carved vases in Christiansborg‚Äôs horse stalls, and relief medallions on the side of the Marble Bridge (Marmorbro) that leads to the castle‚Äôs main entrance. Four perspective drawings he made of Christiansborg 1746-1747 are in the collection of the Engraving Museum in Copenhagen. Destroyed work from the castle includes the cornices, capitals and frames of the windows; carved wall panels, fireplaces and console tables in both the king‚Äôs and the queen‚Äôs suites; the golden dining room with buffet and chandelier; sculptures on the balustrade, and all sculpture work in the castle church. In 1739 he created a fountain in the King‚Äôs Garden (Kongens Have) at Rosenborg Castle representing a boy with a swan. The sandstone original was replaced by a bronze figure featuring a similar motif; the replacement was designed and produced by Hermann Ernst Freund in 1837. =Leadership in the early days of the Academy= After Hendrick Krock‚Äôs death in 1738 le Clerc, along with the Venetian history painter Hieronimo Miani, took over the leadership of the burgeoning Royal Danish Academy of Art, then known as the Drawing and Painting Academy (Tegne- og Malerakademiet). He served as leader of the Academy 1740-1748. His first wife died on January 22, 1741. He married his second wife Jacobine Louise Lef√®vre a year later, on January 30, 1742. =Winds of change at the Academy= He continued alone in the role of Academy director after Miani left Denmark in 1745, and until architect Nicolai Eigtved took full control over the Academy. In 1746 Frederik V, the successor king to Christian VI, came to the throne. As the king was an absolute king, and the Academy‚Äôs protector, changes in government could, and often did, mean major changes to organizations dependent on royalty‚Äôs good graces. While le Clerc had been greatly favoured by King Christian VI, who appreciated his artistic abilities, Frederik V favoured other artists. Frederik V affirmed his support for the Academy by issuing a royal resolution on February 12, 1748. In addition to a financial commitment there were specified organizational changes. At the same time le Clerc was named professor to the Academy, one of the first artists to be so named. Frederik V established the current Academy of Art (now called Det kongelige skildre-, billedhugger- og bygningsakademi, in English \\"The Royal Painting, Sculpture and Architecture Academy\\") in 1754. He was made a member of the Academy that same year, and also named professor. Le Clerc did not play a significant role in the new Academy, other than as a teacher. After Frederik V had summoned another French-born sculptor Jacques Saly to Denmark in 1752 to create a monumental equestrian statue of himself for the courtyard of Amalienborg Palace, le Clerc‚Äôs importance went down and his production became small. He continued as professor at the Academy until his death. His artistic skills were not employed much in his later years. He died in Copenhagen, in his house on Brol√¶ggerstr√¶de, on March 8, 1771. He was buried in the Reformed Cemetery in Copenhagen. Aftermath Most of his work has been lost to the ravages of time, especially due to the disastrous fire at Christiansborg. In addition to the few extant pieces previously noted, there is still work of le Clerc‚Äôs in the Knight‚Äôs Hall (Riddersalen) in Moltkes Palace, one of the four buildings at the Amalienborg Palace complex. But even before the great fire destroyed so much of his work, the tides had shifted against him. Rococo, as an artistic ideal, had been discredited, and Frederik V, the successor king to le Clerc‚Äôs great patron, chose to favour other artists. In addition, some drawing of his work are still in existence. His portrait of Carl Gustaf Pilo is in the keepsake of the Academy.

The nonfiction book recounts a double murder on Palmyra Atoll; the subsequent arrest, trial and conviction of Duane (\\"Buck\\") Walker; and the acquittal of his girlfriend, Stephanie Stearns, whom Bugliosi and Leonard Weinglass defended. The book went to No. 1 on The New York Times hardcover bestseller list in March 1991 and is still in print as a trade paperback and ebook. The killings In 1974, a yachting couple from San Diego, California, Malcolm \\"Mac\\" Graham III, 43, and Eleanor LaVerne \\"Muff\\" Graham, 40, sailed a 38-foot ketch to Palmyra Atoll ‚Äî 1,200 miles south of Honolulu ‚Äî hoping to find it deserted and to pass an idyllic year or more there. The wealthy Grahams overcame their disappointment at finding other sailors already on Palmyra, including two male Canadian scientists. The couple found the two men amiable and intelligent, and stayed. Also on Palmyra were Wesley G. Walker (a.k.a. Buck Walker) and Stephanie Stearns (referred to as \\"Jennifer Jenkins\\" in the book), who had sailed there together from Hawaii on Stearns' sailing vessel Iola, a deteriorating, patched-together wooden sloop that lacked a reliable auxiliary engine. In contrast, the Grahams' ketch, the Sea Wind, was beautifully finished and impeccably outfitted, with an onboard machine shop equipped with a lathe and acetylene welding torch. Walker was an ex-convict fleeing a drug possession charge and had come up with the idea of growing cannabis on Palmyra to support himself. The Grahams were a happily married couple touring the world, and Mr. Graham ran his business remotely. The Grahams had brought more than a year's supply of food for their voyage, but Walker and Stearns quickly consumed their own meager supplies and resorted to harvesting the island's few coconuts, often by chopping down entire trees, leaving scars on the island habitat. As Walker's method of farming became unsustainable, he and Stearns were forced to plan a voyage in the rickety Iola, against prevailing winds and currents, to Fanning (Tabuaeran), a nearby atoll in Kiribati, to restock ‚Äî a voyage that was somewhere between difficult and impossible without a working auxiliary engine. According to Stearns, the Grahams disappeared sometime between August 28 and August 30, 1974, and the young couple found the Grahams' Zodiac rigid inflatable dinghy upside down. On September 11, 1974, after days of searching and waiting for the Grahams to return to their boat, Stearns said she and Walker scuttled the Iola and sailed for Hawaii on the Sea Wind. Once in Hawaii, the couple had the Sea Wind repainted and also renamed it, which according to boating superstition brings bad luck. This act aroused suspicion; acquaintances of the Grahams easily recognized the distinctive Sea Wind despite its new paint job. Stearns was arrested in the lower level of the Hawaii Yacht Club for the theft of the Sea Wind, but Walker was able to escape and avoid capture by using a motorized dinghy to race up the \\"400 row\\" of the Ala Wai Harbor. It was believed he fled on foot after leaving the dinghy at the loading dock near the Ilikai Hotel. Early one morning in 1981, other visitors to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from Durban, South Africa, found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container. The remains showed signs of dismemberment and burning (possibly by Mac Graham's acetylene welding torch), and the body appeared to have been concealed underwater in the container. Trial and punishment Buck Walker was tried and convicted of Muff Graham's murder. He was incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Victorville, in California. Although Walker never testified, the defense claimed that he and Stearns were attempting to return the Sea Wind to Hawaii with the Iola in tow, but the Iola ran aground on the reef as they exited the lagoon and had to be abandoned. During the voyage back to Hawaii, it was claimed that a large swordfish damaged the Sea Winds hull below the waterline, necessitating her repair and subsequent repainting and renaming. Stephanie Stearns was tried separately in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. After Bugliosi argued that Buck Walker had committed the Palmyra murders himself without Stearns' participation or knowledge, and following her testimony at the trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Aftermath The book was adapted into the 1991 television film And the Sea Will Tell, directed by Tommy Lee Wallace which aired on CBS as a 4-hour film (Part 1 aired on February 24, and Part 2 was aired 2 days later on the 26th that month.) The trial lawyer who represented Walker, Earle Partington, sued Bugliosi for defamation, claiming that both the book and the docudrama portrayed Partington in a negative light. The court found for Bugliosi, ruling that this was his protected opinion. Walker was released on parole in September 2007 at the age of 69, after serving 22 years of a life sentence, and died of a stroke on April 26, 2010 at the age of 72. Prior to his death, Walker had been living in a trailer home in Willits, California. Walker (writing as Wesley G. Walker), claimed in a book about that case that he had been seduced by Mrs. Graham and, in the midst of lovemaking, had been caught by Mr. Graham, who shot his wife and attempted to shoot Walker. Malcolm Graham's body has never been found.

She is a bounty hunter with a mutation that gives her a vampiric lust for blood. Publication history When the character was first devised, there was some debate over Durham Red or Chelsea Blue as the character's name. The writers, John Wagner and Alan Grant, settled on Durham Red, and the character immediately proved popular from her first appearance. Following the death of Johnny Alpha, she was given a leading role in the spin-off series Strontium Dogs and in her own series, Durham Red. Following the departure of writer Peter Hogan, the series was handed to Dan Abnett. Abnett's first action was to place Red in suspended animation and have her awake a thousand years after Strontium Dog continuity, in a universe where she was worshipped as a mythical saint of mutants. With art by several artists including Mark Harrison, the series has enjoyed a long run. Dan Abnett's final story was printed in 2004, envisioning Durham Red surviving another ten thousand years, watching over the end of the human race and the beginning of a mutant-populated universe. Since then, the character has returned in stories set before Abnett's, in which she is still in the 22nd century. Fictional character biography As a result of radioactive fallout (strontium-90) from a nuclear war in 2150, Durham Red was born with a mutation which made her resemble a vampire in appearance and behaviour, although she had no supernatural attributes. Shunned by other mutants, she joined the Search / Destroy agency at a young age and became a bounty hunter, or \\"strontium dog.\\" While working for the agency she met Johnny Alpha (the lead character in the Strontium Dog series) and they were briefly romantically involved, but he was unable to trust her (and with good reason).2000 AD #571‚Äì572 At some unspecified time after Alpha's death, Red became tired of her life and entered suspended animation. She only intended to do this for a couple of years, but she was not awoken until 1,272 years later.2000 AD #1082 On her revival she discovered that the human race had spread throughout the galaxy but was still divided between pure-blood humans and mutants. As a mutant who drank the blood of normal humans, she had become a mythical figure to the mutants, who revered her as a saint (\\"Saint Scarlet\\"). Her efforts to end the conflict backfired and only made things much worse, costing the lives of billions. However she lived for another ten thousand years, and eventually witnessed a renaissance of human civilisation. In the last episode of Dan Abnett's stories, it is implied that she became an empress and was responsible for a new golden age of humanity, before faking her death and withdrawing from public life.2000 AD #1386 Stories published since then (2004) are set before she entered suspended animation.

He earned his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1929. In 1930, he was granted an International Fellowship, which he used to do postgraduate study and research at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld during the winter of 1930 to the spring of 1931. From the spring through the summer of 1931, he was at Cambridge University. Upon return to the United States, he joined the faculty of MIT.Philip M.

In this article, the following students of Arnold Sommerfeld are mentioned: William V. Houston, Karl Bechert, Otto Scherzer, Otto Laporte, Linus Pauling, Carl Eckart, Gregor Wentzel, Peter Debye, and Philip M. Morse. In 1949 he was named the first Research Director of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG), an organization founded to conduct studies for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he served a year and a half before returning to MIT in the summer of 1950. In 1956 he launched MIT‚Äôs Operations Research Center, directing it until 1968, and awarding the first Ph.D. in OR in the U.S. to John Little. He was a member of a National Research Council committee dedicated to bringing OR into civilian life, and was a prime mover behind the creation of the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA) in 1952. He served as president of the American Physical Society, president of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA), and board chair of the American Institute of Physics. In 1946, he was a recipient of the Medal for Merit from the U.S. President for his work during the war. In 1973 the ASA awarded him the Gold Medal, its highest award, for his work on vibration.  Work  = Operations research = Philip Morse made many contributions to the development of operations research (OR). Early in 1942 he organized the Anti- Submarine Warfare Operations Research Group (ASWORG), later ORG, for the U.S. Navy, after the US had entered World War II and was faced with the problem of Nazi German U-boat attacks on transatlantic shipping. \\"That Morse‚Äôs group was an important factor in winning the war is fairly obvious to everyone who knows anything about the inside of the war,\\" wrote historian John Burchard.John Burchard M.I.T. in World War II (John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1948) p. 92. Philip Morse co-authored Methods of Operations Research, the first OR textbook in the U.S., with George E. Kimball based on the Navy work. His further writings include the influential books Queues, Inventories, and Maintenance and Library Effectiveness. He received ORSA's Lanchester Prize in 1968 for the latter book. Philip Morse gave the opening address at the 1957 organizing meeting of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS). In 1959 he chaired the first NATO advisory panel on OR. = Physics = Philip Morse had a distinguished career in physics. Amongst his contributions to physics are the textbooks Quantum Mechanics (with Edward Condon), Methods of Theoretical Physics (with Herman Feshbach), Vibration and Sound, Theoretical Acoustics, and Thermal Physics. Morse is also one of the founding editors of Annals of Physics. In 1929 he proposed the Morse potential function for diatomic molecules which was often used to interpret vibrational spectra, though the standard is now the more modern Morse/Long-range potential. = Administration = His administrative talents were applied in roles as co-founder of the MIT Acoustics Laboratory, first director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, founder and first director of the MIT Computation Center, and board member of the RAND Corporation and the Institute for Defense Analyses. He chaired the advisory committee that supervised preparation of Handbook of Mathematical Functions, with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables.  Publications  * 1945.

He further developed his theme of existentialism using stream-of-consciousness and surrealist techniques It charts the life of Said Mahran, a thief recently released from jail and intent on having his vengeance on the people who put him there. The novel was published in 1961, and Said's despair reflects disappointment in revolution and new order in Egypt--as Said is not only a thief, but a kind of revolutionary anarchist. Plot summary Said's world revolves around Nabawiyya, his former wife, and Sana', his daughter. Once in love with the former, she has now betrayed him by marrying his friend 'Ilish. Central to the making of Said Mahran is also Ra'uf 'Ilwan, his one-time criminal mentor, who used the same revolutionist rhetoric, but now, being a respected journalist and businessman, is in seeming opposition to Said, whose outlook hasn't changed. These perceived betrayals throw the protagonist into the utmost confusion and his initial calculation in revenge becomes ever more a wild flailing against the whole world. Only Nur, a prostitute, and Tarzan, a caf√©- owner, provide Said with any aid and support from the world at large which is closing in on him, yet in time even they cannot help him. Characters in \\"The Thief and the Dogs\\" *Said Mahran; the main character *Rauf Ilwan; Mahran's erstwhile mentor *Nabawiyya; Mahran's former wife, currently married to Illish *Sana; Mahran's biological daughter *Ilish Sidra; Mahran's friend until he betrays Said (currently married to Nabawiyya) *Nur; a prostitute who loves Said *Tarzan; a caf√©-owner *Sheikh: cleric, of shehab brotherhood Said's father had been a member and to whom Said turns for spiritual guidance Major themes Heavily dependent on imagery, the thief, Said, is depicted as a tragic hero being Rady chased down by those he perceives as dogs. The recurring images of prison, betrayal and darkness amongst others also permeate the text. The novel is remarkable because it is the first novel to employ the stream of consciousness style of writing in Arabic. It helped, therefore, to confirm Mahfouz's stature as a pioneer in the field of literature. Adaptations The novel was adapted into a film and a television series in Egypt. The film was first released in 1962, only one year after the novel was first published, with a screenplay by Salah Jahin. The film starred Shoukry Sarhan (Said), Kamal el-Shennawi, and Shadia (Nur). The television series was released in 1975, and lasted only one season (13 episodes). Although it was an Egyptian series, it was produced by a Dubai-based television station.

Licences to trade are issued by Hackney London Borough Council. The street is on the traditional boundary of the Haggerston area of Shoreditch (the south-west part of the street) and Hackney proper. Old 'Borough of Shoreditch' signs can still be seen above street name signs in that south-west part of the street. History In 1893 the London County Council‚Äôs Public Control Committee states that the Market had existed since 1883 on the southern end of the Street between Andrew Street and Duncan Road and consisted of 35 stalls selling: vegetables and fruit, flowers, eggs, meat, fish, bacon, earthenware, drapery, iron and tinware, mats and pails, and caps and belts. The report describes a growing market serving a local, over-crowded, working-class community. Of the 35 stalls 10 are recorded as being run by Broadway Market shopkeepers with the remainder being independent street traders . In 1936, whilst calling the market London Fields, Benedetta describes the market as a weekday market with a smaller presence on Sundays and reports that it has \\"almost every kind of stall\\". Before the late 20th century, it was the site of a busy fruit and vegetable market, but this slowly dwindled over time‚Äîin the early 2000s, market activity was limited to a couple of stalls selling produce. On 8 May 2004 a food market was launched on Saturdays which has since become firmly established. Broadway Market is closed to traffic when the market is being held (9am‚Äì5pm). Thanks largely to the market a number of new restaurants and boutiques have opened in the area. The ongoing development of Broadway Market has sparked a local debate about the perceived gentrification of Hackney and the way Hackney council disposed of some of their commercial property portfolio. In late 2005, a group of local protestors occupied 34 Broadway Market (Francesca's caf√©) to bring attention to the issue. Despite being evicted on 21 December 2005 the building was successfully reoccupied on 27 December (replacing the demolished roof in the process) before the protestors were again evicted on 23 February 2006. Ultimately, the battle was lost and the former proprietor of Francesca's cafe now runs the Little Francesca's juice stall on Saturdays in Broadway Market. The battle did not end, however, and local shopkeeper Spirit, whose shop was sold to an overseas developer by Hackney Council, fought several court battles to regain his property after proving that Hackney Council had cashed the cheque for his purchase deposit prior to selling his property to an overseas development company. Ultimately Spirit lost his battle too - winning in court but unable to reverse the transaction. In popular culture A fruit stall in the street's market Broadway Market, and specifically the barber shop, was the location for David Cronenberg's 2007 film, Eastern Promises. The opening scenes of the 1988 movie Buster were shot at the Regent's Canal end of the market. It was also used for filming some scenes in the 1947 film Odd Man Out. Along with many squares and streets in the East End of London, it is rumoured that the old Broadway Market partly inspired the BBC soap opera EastEnders.

It was hosted by Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht, who had previously hosted TechTV's The Screen Savers together. Its main purpose was to discuss some of the top stories from Digg, the social news and bookmarking website developed by Rose and others. The first episode \\"aired\\" online on July 1, 2005. The format of the show usually involved Rose and Albrecht reviewing beverages, mostly beer, but occasionally tea, coffee, hard liquors like vodka or whisky at the opening of the show, which they consumed throughout the show, followed by them discussing various Digg stories from the previous week, with often off-topic banter with each other and with producer David Prager and camera operator Glenn McElhose. Both audio and video versions of the podcast are available from Revision3 for streaming or downloading in various formats. The intro sequence was created by Eden Soto in collaboration with David Prager. It was in development for more than three months, according to Eden Soto's website. A spin-off show, The Digg Reel ran from January 2008 to September 2010, and was originally hosted by Jessica Corbin, followed by Andrew Bancroft. The show featured the week's top user submitted videos in comparison to Diggnation's primary focus on news articles. Both were produced by Revision3. On October 3, 2011 David Prager announced the show would end with its 340th episode at the end of 2011. Occasional Reunion Live Shows might happen in the future.Diggnation Retirement On October 13, 2017, Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht announced and released a \\"light Diggnation reunion\\" under the title of \\"Talking Tech\\", released within Kevin Rose's \\"Kevin Rose Show\\" podcast. In the episode, Alex and Kevin confirmed new episodes of \\"Talking Tech\\" will be released every 4 to 5 episodes of the \\"Kevin Rose Show.\\" Episodes Kevin drops his cat after spilling beer on his couch during the first minutes of episode #123. The show begins immediately with a short listing of the podcast's current sponsors, and is usually followed by a humorous fake advertisement (i.e. Bose's Noise Enhancing Headphones, \\"Days of our Prager\\", Cougars: Aged to Perfection, etc.). After the title video, the hosts introduce themselves, tell the viewers where they are filming from, make any relevant announcements, and discuss the drinks they will have during the episode. The beer tasting and beverage aspect of Diggnation is one of the show's unique aspects. The majority of the episode is dedicated to the discussion of news items as well as personal commentary, anecdotes and unrelated banter. The show's humor is generally somewhat vulgar, often due to considerable intoxication. At the end of the show, Rose and Albrecht mention their sponsors once again in a longer advertisement spot, read e-mail from fans, then conclude the show with a seemingly ad libbed phrase or saying. Starting with more recent episodes, larger Digg stories (typically the weeks big news) are discussed after the ads, but before the emails. This is keeping in line with most other Revision3 shows. Distribution San Jose as part of NVISION 08. Diggnation episodes were released weekly on Wednesdays at 6 PM (EST). Previously, the show was released on Friday at the same time for paid members, and Sunday at 12:01 for everyone. There were an estimated 250,000 regular subscribers to the show during its peak. BitGravity handles iTunes and TiVo subscribers, downloads from the website, and RSS feeds. Virgin America airlines also offers on-demand episodes available on the in flight entertainment systems (along with other Revision3 shows). Repeats, edited for content, time and profanity, are also seen on the cable network Youtoo TV as part of Revision3's contract with that network. Diggnation occasionally hosted live shows. These shows have been hosted at CES, SXSW, Reno, Macworld, San Francisco, E3, San Diego, Hollywood, London, St. Louis, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and New York City. The final live show was the Diggnation finale held on December 30, 2011 at The Music Box in Hollywood, CA.Revision3 > Diggnation Finale Name origin David Prager suggested to name the Digg website \\"Diggnation\\". Rose decided on the simpler Digg instead. Rose subsequently chose Diggnation as the name of the podcast.

Prodeinotherium, meaning \\"before terrible beast\\", was first named in 1930, but soon after, the only species in it, P. hungaricum, was reassigned to Deinotherium. During the 1970s, however, the two genera were once again separated, with Prodeinotherium diagnosed to include Deinotherium bavaricum (=P. hungaricum), Deinotherium hobleyi, and Deinotherium pentapotamiae, which were separated based on geographic location. The three species are from Europe, Africa, and Asia, respectively. However, because of usage of few characters to separate them, only one species, P. bavaricum, or many more species, including P. cuvieri, P. orlovii, and P. sinense may be possible. Prodeinotherium is one of three genera of the Deinotheriidae, the others being Chilgatherium from Africa, and Deinotherium from Europe, Africa, and Asia. Chilgatherium preceded Prodeinotherium, while Deinotherium succeeded it. P. hobleyi was the first species of Prodeinotherium, and it migrated into Asia and Europe before evolving into P. pentapotamiae and then P. bavaricum. Prodeinotherium lived for the Early Miocene and Middle Miocene before being replaced by Deinotherium. The deinotheriids are an early branch of proboscideans, although more derived than Barytherium and Moeritherium. All deinotheres were large animals that evolved to be even larger, and many features are shared throughout the group. Prodeinotherium and Deinotherium both had large, downcurved tusks on the lower jaw, but none on the upper jaw. This could have been used to grasp food while the tusks moved branches out of the way. Prodeinotherium was slightly smaller than Deinotherium, yet much larger than more primitive proboscideans. All Prodeinotherium species were similar in size, ranging from tall and weighing about . Description Lateral view of the lower jaws of P. bavaricum at Naturkundemuseum Ostbayern Prodeinotherium was the size of the present Asian elephant, about at the shoulders, but differing from elephants by lacking upper tusks and instead possessing downward-facing lower tusks. In appearance and many characters, it was like Deinotherium, but differed in being of smaller size, having shorter fore limbs, and also in various details in the shape and form of the teeth.Sanders, W. J., Kappelman, J. & Rasmussen, D. T., 2004 New large-bodied mammals from the late Oligocene site of Chilga, Ethiopia. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica Vol. 49, no.3, pp. 365‚Äì392 A potentially adult female specimen of P. bavaricum is estimated to be tall and weigh , while an adult male measured tall and was about . The earliest species P. hobleyi was estimated at similar tall and . Prodeinotherium hobleyi was larger and more specialised than its Oligocene predecessor Chilgatherium. It flourished for several millions of years, before being replaced in the middle Miocene by the much larger Deinotherium. Prodeinotherium is distinguished from Deinotherium from multiple features, including possessing a different dental formula of 003/103 and 0023/1023; M2-3 with an ornamentation; the rostrum turns down parallel to the mandibular symphysis; the rostrum and external nares narrow; the swelling of the preorbital is close to the orbit; the roof of the skull is longer and wider than in Deinotherium; the articulation between the neck vertebrae and skull is more upturned; the skeleton is graviportally adapted; the scapula has a prominent spine and a stout acromion and metacromion; and the carpal bones and tarsal bones are narrow, but not dolichopodous. Skeletal reconstructions of P. baravicum female (left), male (right) Deinotheres such as Prodeinotherium have a muscle attachment for a trunk-like structure. However, instead of an elephant-like trunk, the appendage was more muscular and similar to a tapirs snout. Within the evolution of Deinotheriidae, the paired \\"tongs\\" arrangement consisting of upper and lower incisors possessed by earlier Proboscideans was lost. P. bavaricum, fossils of which come from the Upper Freshwater Molasse, is the most well-studied species of Prodeinotherium, with multiple features shared among all specimens, not necessarily to the exclusion of other species. Some of these features include \\"small size, generally simple dental structure, less enamel plication and crenulation, ... thus the valleys of the premolars are well separated, slender teeth, bicuspid mesial lophid in P3 (the cuspids are distinct but more compressed against each other than in P. hobleyi), and clear mesial projection (‚Äúpreprotolophide‚Äù) in P3; sometimes is bicuspid.\\" Other features noted earlier in 1957 include \\"the mesial lophid of P3 is well separated into two cuspids, the mesial projection of P3 is well developed and often bicuspid, and the base of the protoconid in P3 is longer than that of the metaconid.\\" P. hobleyi differs in morphology from P. bavaricum mostly in these P3 characteristics. All deinothere mandibles have the same basic anatomy, with a downturned symphysis, and lower incisors. Most differences of deinothere genera are in the P3 tooth morphology and dimensions of the mandible and teeth. Measurements of the mandible have shown that the curve of the jaw is relative to the length of the jaw; a longer jaw means a stronger curve. A distinguishing feature of Prodeinotherium is that the area at the base of the curve in the jaw is flat, while a depression is seen in all specimens of Deinotherium. Taxonomy and evolution Range of Prodeinotherium Prodeinotherium lived during the Early Miocene and Middle Miocene, about 19.0 to 18.0 million years ago (Mya). Prodeinotherium likely evolved from Chilgatherium, or the common ancestor of the two genera. The earliest remains of Prodeinotherium come from Kenya, where two deposits preserving the genus date to 22.5 and 19.5 Mya according to one 1978 study. The same study found that fossils from Uganda date to 20.0 Mya. However, more recent studies (from 1988, 1991, and 2002) find that the deposits date to >17.9, 19.5, and 17.0 Mya, respectively. After evolving in Africa, Prodeinotherium spp. likely migrated into Asia and then Europe with the formation of the \\"Gomphotherium land bridge\\". Prodeinotherium may have gone extinct around 15.5 Mya, based on the last known fossils from the Arabian Peninsula. P. hobleyi was the first species to evolve, followed soon after P. pentapotamiae and then P. bavaricum around the same time. These species are from Africa, Europe, and South Asia, respectively. Prodeinotherium was replaced in Asia by Deinotherium indicum, in Europe by D. giganteum, and in Africa by D. bozasi. Deinotheres are quite controversial with regards to the systematics. Many species have been named, yet major studies by Harris and Huttunen find that only three species in each genus are valid, based on distribution and smaller details. Within Prodeinotherium, the species found valid by these authors include P. bavaricum, P. pentapotamiae, and P. hobleyi. Many descriptions of new species of deinotheres are based upon limited material compared to only a small number of the species. Thus, many species of deinotheres are no longer valid. In addition to invalid species, Prodeinotherium has on occasion been synonymized with Deinotherium. Species of Prodeinotherium found to be valid by multiple studies include P. cuvieri, P. sinense, and P. orlovii. In a study 2011 analyzed the mandibles of multiple genera in a phylogenetic analysis. Their results are shown below: History of discovery Skull bones of P. bavaricum, illustrated in 1875 Deinotherium bavaricum was originally mentioned in a paper by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1831. However, his first description of the material came in 1833, in which he also created the new species Dinotherium bavaricum, the accidental change in genus spelling making it a lapsus calami. The material known is the lectotype P3, in the Bayerische Staatssammlung f√ºr Pal√§ontologie und historische Geologie, selected from a group of specimens (a syntype) from Bavaria. Meyer compared the tooth to the material of Deinotherium gigantium, and found enough features to distinguish it as a separate species. Most deinotheres were lumped into Deinotherium until the studies of Harris, who concluded that morphology separated them into two genera, Prodeinotherium and Deinotherium. As the earliest description of a small deinothere in Europe, P. bavaricum became the type species of Prodeinotherium. Prodeinotherium was named in 1830 by Ehik, and its name is derived from pro ‚Äì \\"before\\" Deinotherium ‚Äì \\"terrible beast\\". Another early description of Prodeinotherium is that of Kaup (1832). He described teeth previously assigned to Tapir gigantesque, finding them to be a new deinothere. Kaup assigned these to Dinotherium cuvieri, using size to distinguish it from D. giganteum. However, the size, morphology, and distribution match that of P. bavaricum, thus the latter became the senior synonym. Later in 1836, Lartet described yet another deinothere that eventually became P. bavaricum. This new species was named Deinotherium secondarium, for teeth from France. Lartet published no description, and did not mention this species in later works. Huttunen showed that the distribution of D. secondarium was within that of P. bavaricum, thus considered the two species likely synonymous. Later, Ehik (1930) described the genus and the new species Prodinotherium hungaricum, misspelling the genus name. The species was known from a jaw with teeth and some post cranial elements. This material was from Kir√°ld, and was destroyed, but casts of it remain in the Hungarian Natural History Museum. Diagnosed by dental features, and post cranial morphology, the specimen was later found similar to specimens from elsewhere in Europe, which were assigned to P. bavaricum. Harris found P. hungaricum to be a synonym of P. bavaricum, a conclusion followed by Huttunen. P. petenyii was described in 1989 by V√∂r√∂s, who found it to differ from all other Prodeinotherium species. From Hungary, the material includes a jaw with teeth. The tooth morphology is very similar to that of P. bavaricum, and although the species has the unique feature of tusks that do not curve down and instead project forwards, Huttunen considered it a synonym of P. bavaricum. Lower jaw of P. bavaricum In 1868, Hugh Falconer's notes from before his death were published, including the description of material that he labelled Dinotherium pentapotamiae. This was from the Sewalik of India, he noted that the teeth were possibly the same as D. indium, but were within the range of a midsized individual. This presumption as D. indium was based on the possibility that D. giganteum was the only species of Deinotherium in Europe, and the variation of individuals of Mastodon longirostris within a population. This species was later reassigned to Prodeinotherium, distinct from D. indicum. The African species, P. hobleyi, was first described in 1911 by Charles William Andrews. The species was from East Africa, and was named Dinotherium hobleyi. Andrews described these remains, which included a mandible with teeth, a calcaneum, a patella, and other indeterminable fragments, shipped to him by C.W. Hobley. It was compared to Dinotherium cuvieri, and although they were similar, the minor differences and geographical separation were enough for Andrews to create a new species. This species was later reassigned to Prodeinotherium, as the only species from Africa. P. sinense was described in 2007 as a late species of Prodeinotherium; it was described by Qui et al., and is known from dental material and jaw. It was first found in 2005, in Gansu, China. It is of a Late Miocene age, thus is younger than other Prodeinotherium species. That study also found that the material of P. hungaricum is distinct from P. bavaricum. A study in 2010 by Vergiev & Markow noted that the teeth are quite similar to those of Deinotherium, and based on these features and age the species was thought to either be a species in between Prodeinotherium and Deinotherium, or belonging to the latter genus. Early depictions of deinotheres such as Prodeinotherium were scientifically incorrect. Before postcranial material was known, the genera were considered to be rhinos, giant tapirs, sirenians, whales, and marsupials. However, with postcranial material came the proposal of an elephantine relation. However, early depictions of deinotheres were too elephantine, practically only with the addition of lower tusks. These restorations were inaccurate, because they showed the lower lip directly beneath the trunk, with the tusks projecting from the \\"chin\\". According to a 2001 study, the tusks more likely projected above the lip, which followed the curvature of the jaw down. Another inaccuracy is likely the length of the trunks. Having a long, elephantine trunk was thought of as unlikely by multiple authors, including Harris and the 2001 study. Besides the large opening often associated with a trunk, the general skull structure makes it unlikely for the trunk to be elongated. The upper tusks, retained in all more derived proboscideans, were likely lost so that the upper lip could directly manipulate the food of Prodeinotherium. Paleobiology Restored skeleton of P. bavaricum Prodeinotherium was a herbivorous organism. Based on the known distribution of fossils, Prodeinotherium could only survive along the coast in closed forests. Rodents and fish may have lived in the same environment or region as Prodeinotherium. In Europe, fossils of Gomphotherium have been found alongside those of Prodeinotherium, showing that the genera likely ate different plants. Deinotheres were browsers, meaning they ate plants above ground level. Deinotheres possibly ate specific dicots. These could be found in closed woodland forests. The way they chewed their food was probably similar to that of modern tapirs, with the front teeth being used to crush the food, while the second and third molars have a strong vertical shearing action, with little lateral movement. This chewing action differs from both that of gomphotheres (lateral grinding) and elephants (horizontal shearing). Deinothere molars show little wear, indicating a diet of soft, nongritty, forest vegetation, with the down-turned lower tusks being used for stripping bark or other vegetation. The supports for the tusks used in feeding is also based on the fact that juveniles have a different tusk morphology, which is consistent on them likely possessing a slightly different diet or feeding strategy. The trunks of deinotheres were likely similar to a tapirs, which could have been used for grasping plant matter and moving it to where the tongue could manipulate it.

The book explores and contrasts the viewpoint that \\"all theories are proven wrong in time\\", arguing that there exist degrees of wrongness. The book was the twentieth of a series of books collecting essays from The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Like most of the essays Asimov wrote for F&SF;, each one in The Relativity of Wrong begins with an autobiographical anecdote which serves to set the mood. Several of the essays form a sequence explaining the discovery and uses of isotopes. Title essay In the title essay, Asimov argues that there exist degrees of wrongness, and being wrong in one way is not necessarily as bad as being wrong in another way. For example, if a child spells the word sugar as \\"pqzzf\\", the child is clearly incorrect. Yet, Asimov says, a child who spells the word \\"shuger\\" (or in some other phonetic way) is \\"less wrong\\" than one who writes a random sequence of letters. Furthermore, a child who writes \\"sucrose\\" or \\"C12H22O11\\" completely disregards the \\"correct\\" spelling but shows a degree of knowledge about the real thing under study. Asimov proposes that a better test question would ask the student to spell sugar in as many ways as possible, justifying each. Likewise, believing that the Earth is a sphere is less wrong than believing that the Earth is flat, but wrong nonetheless, since it is really an oblate spheroid or a reasonable approximation thereof. As the state of knowledge advanced, the statement of the Earth's shape became more refined, and each successive advance required a more careful and subtle investigation. Equating the wrongness of the theory that the Earth is flat with the wrongness of the theory that the Earth is a perfect sphere is wronger than wrong. Asimov wrote \\"The Relativity of Wrong\\" in response to an \\"English Literature major\\" who criticized him for believing in scientific progress. This unnamed individual is portrayed by Asimov as having taken the postmodern viewpoint that all scientific explanations of the world are equally in error. Irritated, the rationalist Asimov put forth his views in his monthly F&SF; column, and the result became the title essay of this collection.

The Third Siege of Missolonghi (, often erroneously referred to as the Second Siege) was fought in the Greek War of Independence, between the Ottoman Empire and the Greek rebels, from 15 April 1825 to 10 April 1826. The Ottomans had already tried and failed to capture the city in 1822 and 1823, but returned in 1825 with a stronger force of infantry and a stronger navy supporting the infantry. The Greeks held out for almost a year before they ran out of food and attempted a mass breakout, which however resulted in a disaster, with the larger part of the Greeks slain. This defeat was a key factor leading to intervention by the Great Powers who, hearing about the atrocities, felt sympathetic to the Greek cause.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 Front page (1824) of the early Greek newspaper Ellinika Chronika, published in Missolonghi and edited by Swiss philhellene Johann Jakob Meyer (de; el; ru), who was killed in the sortie. Prelude Missolonghi was first besieged by the Ottomans in 1822, then in 1823. In April 1824, Lord Byron died in Missolonghi of an illness, adding to the fame of the city.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 Siege In spring 1825, the Ottomans came to besiege the Greeks again.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 The Ottoman commander Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha was informed \\"Either Missolonghi falls or your head\\" as the Sultan would not tolerate a third failed siege.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 271. It was a common practice in the Ottoman empire for those generals who failed the Sultan to pay the price of their failure with their lives.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 The location of Missolonghi was on a long spit of land surrounded by a lagoon full of islands, giving it a strong defensive position.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 271. Three islands, Marmaris, Klisova and Aitoliko controlled the entrance to the lagoon.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 271. Much of the ground on the eastern landward side was marshy and on the eastern side was a wide open plain.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 271. The town's was surrounded by earthen walls, but their defences had been strengthened by a military engineer from Chios, Michael Kokkinis who had built a series of 17 bastions containing 48 guns and 4 mortars, forming triangular projections so the defender could bring interlocking fire on any attacker.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 272. Kokkinis named the bastions after heroes for liberty, naming them after Benjamin Franklin, William of Orange, Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, Lord Byron, Karl von Normann- Ehrenfels, Markos Botsaris, Skanderbeg, Lord Sheffield, and so on.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 272. The defenders were some 3,000 men, most Greek, but a few were Italian, Swiss and German philhellenes.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 273. The Greeks were nominally led by a committee of three, but the dominant personality was a Souliot captain N√≥tis B√≥tsaris.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 273. The Ottoman forces were 20,000, of which 8,000 were professional soldiers, the rest Albanian irregulars while some 4,000 were Greeks enslaved to work on building the Ottoman entrenchments.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 272. Reshid promptly put his Greek slaves to work building a series of trenches around Missolonghi that gradually brought his men closer to the town, reaching up to 100 yards of Missolonghi.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 273-274. Reshid was at the end of long and tenuous supply lines and simply did not have enough cannonballs to knock down the walls of Missolonghi.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 274. Whenever a breach was made, attempts to storm it were beaten off with ferocious counter-attacks while all the citizens of Missolonghi, men and women worked together to fill the breaches in during the night.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 274. In August 1825, the Ottomans began building a mound, so they could bring down fire on Missolonghi‚Äôs defenders.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 275. From the mound, the Greeks were forced out of the Franklin battery, but dug a ditch with a rampart behind, which stopped the Ottomans from advancing too deep into Missolinghi.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 275. The Ottomans began building a second mound, but the Greeks destroyed it via a mine full of explosives at the end of August.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 274. In the course of night raids, the Greeks dismantled the first mound and used its soil to rebuild holes in their wall.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 274. The first mound was finally destroyed by a mine in September 1825.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 275. The Ottomans also attempted to mine the walls, but proved to be inept at this.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 274. In September 1825, the Greeks dug a mine under the Ottoman camp, in which they exploded a mine.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 274. Believing the Greeks were attempting a sortie, the Ottomans gathered around the hole in the earth, at which point the Greeks exploded a second and much larger mine killing many, with one Greek remembering: ‚ÄúWe too were terrified and fell to the ground‚Ä¶legs, feet, heads, half bodies, thighs, hands and entrails fell on us and on the enemy‚Äù.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 pages 274-275. Admiral Miaoulis was able to bring in supplies, so the Ottoman attempt to starve the city into surrender came to nothing.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 276. Georgios Karaiskakis, the leading captain of the Roumeli was an enemy of Botsaris, and provided little support for the besieged.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 277. In October 1825, the heavy rains turned the Ottoman lines into a quagmire and, feeling confident of victory, the women and children whom Admiral Miaoulis had taken to the island of Kalamos for their safety returned in the fall.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 277. One of the Greek captains Dhimitros Makris got married, which led the Greeks to get drunk and fire off blank cartridges all night at the wedding party; in the morning the Turks shouted over the walls to ask what the noise was all about, the Greeks shouted back ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the general‚Äôs wedding‚Äù.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 277. The Turks replied ‚ÄúLong life to them! May they be happy!‚Äù.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 277. Despite the conflict, the two sides would fraternize and talk like old friends during truces.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 277. During the truce to celebrate the wedding, the engineer Kokkinis was allowed to visit the Ottoman camp, which he described ‚Äúas earthworks with no coherence, constructions with no logic, and in short by any reckoning a muddle and a hotchpotch‚Ä¶The whole thing is unbelievable-but it‚Äôs Turkish‚Äù.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 277. In the fall of 1825, Mohammed Ali the Great, the more or less independent wali (governor) of Egypt sent a new fleet of 135 ships, which consisted of Algerian, Tunisian, Turkish and Egyptian ships to join the expeditionary force already in Greece under his son Ibrahim Pasha.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 278 Reinforced with 10,000 new Egyptian troops, Ibrahim Pasha marched through the Peloponnese, destroying everything in his path and joined the siege in January.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 278 The High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, Sir Frederick Adam, tried to make both forces sign a treaty, but his efforts were unsuccessful. The Greek Admiral Andreas Miaoulis kept breaking through the Ottoman naval blockade and bringing in supplies. The commander of the Ottoman forces, Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha, was joined early 1826 by Ibrahim Pasha who crossed the Gulf of Corinth. Ibrahim Pasha had also brought with him many cannons and artillery shells, and on 24 February 1826, the Egyptians began a fierce bombardment of the city.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 278. Over the course of three days, the Egyptians fired 5,256 cannon balls and 3,314 mortar shells into the city, destroying much of it.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 278. The Greeks defeated three Egyptian attempts to storm the city in hand-to-hand fighting where many men and women stood shoulder to shoulder against the Egyptians.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 279. At this point, Ibrahim Pasha decided to starve the city into submission.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 To do that, he needed to take the islands in the lagoon.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 279. Ibrahim had a fleet of shallow draught boats numbering 82 and together with five other boats carrying cannons that served as floating batteries.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 279. On 9 March 1826, the island of Vasiladhi commanded by the Italian philhellene Pasquale Iacommuzzi consisting of 34 artillerymen and 27 infantry was attacked by 1,000 Egyptians under Hussein Bey.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 279. After a day‚Äôs fighting, Vasiladhi fell.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 279. On 12 March, the Egyptians attacked the islands of Dolmas and Poros, which surrendered after coming under a heavy bombardment.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280. With the islands under Egyptian control, supplies from the sea could no longer reach the city.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280. When the Ottomans captured the fortress island of Anatolikon, Miaoulis was not able to bring in supplies.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 Ibrahim Pasha now demanded the city surrender, with the people being given the choice of being sold into slavery or converting to Islam, a demand the Greeks rejected.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280. On 6 April 1826, Reshid Pasha led some 2,000 Albanian and Turkish troops onto the island of Klisova, but the Ottoman troops got stuck in the mud as they landed, making them easy targets for Greek snipers with Reshid Pasha himself wounded.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280. After the failure of the first assault, some 3,000 Egyptians under Hussein Bey made a second attempt later that same morning, but were again shot down by the Greeks in the mud banks.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280. The Greeks, knowing that the Egyptians were lost without their officers, concentrated their fire on their leaders and by killing Hussein Bey reduced the Egyptian ranks to chaos.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280 Ibrahim Pasha tried to motivate his soldiers by striking them with his whip and screaming in his fractured Arabic (Ibrahim was an Albanian who never mastered Arabic) that this was a jihad, so the Egyptians should not fear \\"martyrdom\\" for Allah, and that they were free to rape any Greek Christian who crossed their path.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280 Despite Ibrahim's whip and call for jihad, the Egyptians were unable to get past the mud banks and the assault was finally called off.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 280 One Greek Nikolaos Kasomoulis, serving as a secretary to one of the captains described the scene the next day: > ‚ÄùThe lagoon was covered with corpses a gunshot distance away, and they were > drifting like rubbish by the shore‚Ä¶one could see bodies floating all round, > about 2,500 of them, apart from those our boatman had captured and killed at > dawn when they cried out for help. Some, 2,500 guns had been found, some > with bayonets and some without, plus bandoliers and innumerable belts, from > which the Greeks made braces. I made a pair myself, and so did everyone > else. But the clothes were worthless, apart from those of a few officers; > the Greeks got no booty from these and were much displeased‚ÄùBrewer, David. > The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 281. However, with the Ottomans guarding the islands in the entrance to the lagoon, Admiral Miaoulis could not longer bring in supplies of food and soon the people were starving.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 281.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 Sortie The situation soon became desperate for the defenders with the people starving.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 282. The city had no more cats, dogs, donkeys, or horses as the people had eaten them all.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 282. To stay alive, the people were forced to eat seaweed washed ashore, but it failed to provide sufficient nutrients, leaving many to suffer from ulcers, scurvy, diarrhoea, and swelling from the joints.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 180. Many of the townsfolk were described as being ‚Äúskeletal‚Äù beings, with pale, livid skin who could barely walk.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 282. After around a year of holding out, the leaders of the Greeks, Notis Botsaris, Kitsos Tzavelas and Makris made a plan to escape the city in a conference held at the church of Ayios Spiridhon.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 283. When all food supplies had run out and there was no hope of relief, the besieged Greeks decided that some of the menfolk of fighting age should burst out of the gates and attempt to lead the women and children to safety, while the rest would remain to defend the town to the death on 22 April 1826.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 283 Georgios Karaiskakis would attack the Turks from the rear and create a diversion while the besieged Greeks would escape the city.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 283 Of the 9,000 inhabitants only 7,000 were strong enough to take part.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 283 The population consisted of some 3,500 men of military age, 1,000 workers and 4,500 women and children.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 283 The plan was that, on the night of 22 April, the people were to charge over the eastern section of the walls, use wooden bridges they carried to cross the Ottoman ditches and then wait for Karaiskakis to come.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 283 The exodus was to be divided into three with Dhimitrios Makris leading out the women and children on the right, Kitsos Tsavellas leading the group on the left and Notis Botsaris leading the centre.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 283 Those were who were dying and/or too sick were piled into houses packed full of gunpowder to blow themselves up when the Ottomans arrived to kill them.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 All of the Ottoman prisoners were killed while Bishop Joseph quashed what the British historian David Brewer called \\"a crazy plan\\" to kill all the women and children and just have the men escape.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284 The Turks had been made aware of the escape plan by deserters, but Ibrahim, preferring that the Greeks escape to spare his forces further fighting, did little to block the Greeks.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 When night came on 22 April, the moon was obscured by clouds that came in from the sea.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284 In silence, the bridges were dragged over the walls while others threw blankets and pillows into the ditch.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284 Karaiskakis failed to make his promised attack, but the Greeks heard shooting in the hills to the east and assumed he was coming.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284 A thousand soldiers crossed the bridges, followed by the women and children, with the rest all tensely waited for the signal to come out.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284 The clouds now disappeared and the moonlight illuminated the nocturnal exodus, with Karaiskakis still having failed to appear.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284 Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 165-170 A cry of embros (forward) went up and the everyone rushed out, and then somebody shouted opiso (fall back).Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 284 When the refugees charged out of the city gates they were fired upon by Turks and Egyptians from defensive positions.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 285 Many of the Greeks panicked and fled inside the walls while the Ottoman-Egyptian forces had already entered the city, killing, looting and raping.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 285 In the confusion, thousands were trampled to death while others fell into the ditch and drowned.Brewer, David. The Greek War of Independence, London: Overlook Duckworth, 2011 page 285 The Ottomans and Egyptians set the city on fire, leading Kasomoulis to remember: ‚ÄúThe torch that was Missolonghi shed its light as far as Vasiladhi and Klisova and over the whole plain, and even reached us. The flashes of gunfire looked like a host of fireflies. From Missolonghi we heard the shrieks of women, the sound of gunfire, the explosion of powder magazines and mines, all combined in an indescribably fearful noise.

Many of the Greeks killed themselves by blowing themselves up with gunpowder rather than surrender. The rest were slaughtered or sold into slavery, with the majority of the surviving Greek Christian women becoming sex slaves to Egyptian soldiers. The Turks displayed 3,000 severed heads on the walls. Aftermath Though a military disaster, the siege and its aftermath proved a victory for the Greek cause, and the Ottomans paid dearly for their harsh treatment of Missolonghi. After this incident, many people from Western Europe felt increased sympathy for the Greek cause, as manifested for example in the famous Delacroix painting Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi (1827). The siege of Missolonghi also inspired Gioacchino Rossini's opera Le si√®ge de Corinthe. This public sympathy for the Greeks had a significant influence on the eventual decision of Britain, France and Russia to intervene militarily in the Battle of Navarino and secure Greece's independence - with the result that, among other things, within four years Missolonghi fell into Greek hands again. The unfinished poem The Free Besieged by Dionysios Solomos is dedicated to the siege. Victor Hugo‚Äôs poem ‚Äò‚ÄôLes T√™tes du s√©rail‚Äô‚Äô from his ‚Äò‚ÄôLes Orientales‚Äô‚Äô (1829) celebrates the Greek heroes of the siege.

A scientist, scholar, astrologer, philosopher, hymnographer, and poet, Bardaisan was also renowned for his knowledge of India, on which he wrote a book, now lost. Biography =Early life and education= Bardaisan ( bar Dai·π£ƒÅn \\"son of the Dai·π£ƒÅn\\") was a Syriac author born on 11 July 154, in Edessa, Osroene, which, in those days, was alternately under the influence of both the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire. To indicate the city of his birth, his parents called him \\"Son of the Daisan\\", the river on which Edessa was situated. He is sometimes also referred to as \\"the Babylonian\\" (by Porphyrius); and, on account of his later important activity in Armenia, \\"the Armenian\\", (by Hippolytus of Rome), while Ephrem the Syrian calls him \\"philosopher of the Arameans\\" (, FilosofƒÅ d-ArƒÅmƒÅyƒì). Some sources refer to his high birth and wealth; according to Michael the Syrian, Bardaisan's parents had fled Persia and Sextus Julius Africanus reports that he was of the Parthian nobility. His parents, Nuhama and Nah 'siram, must have been people of rank, for their son was educated with the crown-prince of Osroene at the court of Abgar VIII. Africanus says that he saw Bardaisan, with bow and arrow, mark the outline of a boy's face with his arrows on a shield which the boy held. Owing to political disturbances in Edessa, Bardaisan and his parents moved for a while to Hierapolis (now Manbij), a strong centre of Babylonianism. Here, the boy was brought up in the house of a priest Anuduzbar. In this school he learnt all the intricacies of Babylonian astrology, a training that permanently influenced his mind and proved the bane of his later life. At the age of twenty-five he happened to hear the homilies of Hystaspes, the Bishop of Edessa, received instruction, was baptized, and even admitted to the diaconate or the priesthood. \\"Priesthood\\", however, may merely imply that he ranked as one of the college of presbyters, because Bardaisen remained in the world and had a son called Harmonius, who according to Sozomen's Ecclesiastical history, was \\"deeply versed in Grecian erudition, and was the first to subdue his native tongue to meters and musical laws; these verses he delivered to the choirs\\". When Abgar IX, the friend of his youth, ascended the throne (179), Bardaisan took his place at court. While a sincere Christian, he was clearly no ascetic, but dressed in finery \\"with berylls and caftan\\", according to Ephrem, one of his critics. =Preaching activity= Bardaisan is said to have converted prince Abgar IX to Christianity (probably after 202, i.e. after his visit and honourable reception at Rome), and even he did not, he had an important share in Christianizing the city. Both king and philosopher laboured to create the first Christian state. However, while he showed great literary activity against Marcion and Valentinus, Bardaisan himself went to create his own heterodox Christian dogma by mixing its doctrines with Babylonian astrology. Other commentators say his philosophy ended up resembling those of Valentinus, if not adhering to them completely. Epiphanius of Salamis and Bar Hebraeus assert that he was first an orthodox Christian and afterwards an adept of Valentinus. As a gnostic, he certainly denied the resurrection of the body, and so far as we can judge by the obscure quotations from his hymns furnished by Ephrem he explained the origin of the world by a process of emanation from the supreme God whom he called the Father of the Living. His teachings formed the basis of the Manichaeism and later of the batini sects of Shia Islam. Bardaisan and his movement were considered heretic by the Christians, and he was subjected to critical polemics. Those claimed, probably falsely, that he became a Valentinian Gnostic out of disappointed ambitions in the Christian church. In particular, he was vigorously combated by St. Ephrem. who mentioned him in his hymns: =Encounter with religious men from India= Porphyry states that on one occasion at Edessa, Bardaisan interviewed an Indian deputation of holy men ( \\"≈õrama·πáas\\") who had been sent to the Roman emperor Elagabalus or another Severan emperor, and questioned them as to the nature of Indian religion. The encounter is described in Porphyry De abstin., iv, 17Porphyry \\"On abstinence from animal food\\" Book IV, Paragraphs 17&18\\\\. and Stobaeus (Eccles., iii, 56, 141): =Exile and death= Eventually, after 353 years of existence, the Osrhoenic kingdom came to an end by the Romans under Caracalla. Taking advantage of the anti-Christian faction in Edessa, captured Abgar IX and sent him in chains to Rome. Though he was urged by a friend of Caracalla to apostatize, Bardaisan stood firm, saying that he feared not death, as he would in any event have to undergo it, even though he should now submit to the emperor. At the age of sixty-three he was forced to take refuge in the fortress of Ani in Armenia and tried to preach there, but with little success. He also composed a history of the Armenian kings. He died at the age of sixty-eight, either at Ani or at Edessa. According to Michael the Syrian, Bardaisan had besides Harmonius two other sons, called Abgarun and Hasdu. =Bardaisanite school= The followers of Bardaisan (the Bardaisanites) continued his teachings in a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by later Christians. Bardaisan's son, Harmonius, is considered to have strayed farther from the path of orthodoxy. Educated at Athens, he added to the Babylonian astrology of his father Greek ideas concerning the soul, the birth and destruction of bodies and a sort of metempsychosis. A certain Marinus, a follower of Bardaisan and a dualist, who is addressed in the \\"Dialogue of Adamantius\\", held the doctrine of a twofold primeval being; for the devil, according to him is not created by God. He was also a Docetist, as he denied Christ's birth of a woman. Bardaisan's form of gnosticism influenced Manichaeism. St. Ephrem's zealous efforts to suppress this powerful heresy were not entirely successful. Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa in 431‚Äì432, found it flourishing everywhere. Its existence in the seventh century is attested by Jacob of Edessa; in the eighth by George, Bishop of the Arabs; in the tenth by the historian Masudi; and even in the twelfth by Shashrastani. Bardaisanism seems to have merged first into Valentinianism and then into common Manichaeism. Doctrine Various opinions have been formed as to the real doctrine of Bardesanes. As early as Hippolytus (Philosoph., VI, 50) his doctrine was described as a variety of Valentinianism, the most popular form of Gnosticism. Adolf Hilgenfeld in 1864 defended this view, based mainly on extracts from St. Ephrem, who devoted his life to combating Bardaisanism in Edessa. However, it has been argued that the strong and fervent expressions of St. Ephrem against the Bardaisanites of his day are not a fair criterion of the doctrine of their master. The extraordinary veneration of his own countrymen, the very reserved and half-respectful allusion to him in the early Fathers, and above all the \\"Book of the Laws of the Countries\\" suggest a milder view of Bardaisan's aberrations. Like the Early Christians, Bardaisan believed in an Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth, whose will is absolute, and to whom all things are subject. God endowed man with freedom of will to work out his salvation and allowed the world to be a mixture of good and evil, light and darkness. All things, even those we now consider inanimate, have a measure of liberty. In all of them the light has to overcome the darkness. Shashrastani states: \\"The followers of Daisan believe in two elements, light and darkness. The light causes the good, deliberately and with free will; the darkness causes the evil, but by force of nature and necessity. They believe that light is a living thing, possessing knowledge, might, perception and understanding; and from it movement and life take their source; but that darkness is dead, ignorant, feeble, rigid and soulless, without activity and discrimination; and they hold that the evil within them is the outcome of their nature and is done without their co-operation\\". cites Haarbrucker tr. (Halle, 1850), I, 293. He apparently denied the resurrection of the body, though believed Christ's body was endowed with incorruptibility as with a special gift. Bardaisan postulated that after six thousand years this Earth shall have an end, and a world without evil would take its place. Bardaisan also thought the sun, moon and planets were living beings, to whom, under God, the government of this world was largely entrusted; and though man was free, he was strongly influenced for good or for evil by the constellations. According to St. Ephrem, Sun and Moon were considered male and female principles, and the ideas of heaven amongst the Bardaisanites were not without an admixture of sensuality (or \\"obscenities\\"). Led by the fact that \\"spirit\\" is feminine in Syriac, Bardaisan might have held unorthodox views on the Trinity. Writings Bardaisan apparently was a voluminous author. Though nearly all his works have perished, we find notices of the following: * Dialogues against Marcion and Valentinus. cites Theodoretus, Haer. fab., I, xxii; Eusebius of Caesarea, Church History, IV, xxx, 3. * Dialogue \\"Against Fate\\" addressed to an Antoninus. Whether this Antoninus is merely a friend of Bardaisan or a Roman emperor and, in the latter case, which of the Antonines is meant, is a matter of controversy. It is also uncertain whether this dialogue is identical with \\"The Book of the Laws of the Countries\\", of which later on. cites Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica, IV, xxx, 2; Epiphanius, Haer., LVI, I; Theodoretus, Haer. fab., I, xxii. * A \\"Book of Psalms\\", 150 in number, in imitation of David's Psalter. cites St. Ephrem, Serm. Adv. Haer., liii. These psalms became famous in the history of Edessa; their words and melodies lived for generations on the lips of the people. Only when St. Ephrem composed hymns in the same pentasyllabic metre and had them sung to the same tunes as the psalms of Bardaisan, did the latter gradually lose favour. We probably possess a few of Bardaisan's hymns in the Gnostic Acts of Thomas; the \\"Hymn on the Soul\\"; the \\"Espousals of Wisdom\\"; the consecratory prayer at Baptism and at Holy Communion. Of these only the \\"Hymn on the Soul\\" is generally acknowledged to be by Bardesanes, the authorship of the others is doubtful. Though marred by many obscurities, the beauty of this hymn on the soul is striking. The soul is sent from its heavenly home to the earth, symbolized by Egypt, to obtain the pearl of great price. In Egypt it forgets for a while its royal parentage and glorious destiny. It is reminded thereof by a letter from home, succeeds in snatching a raiment of light, it returns to receive its rank and glory in the kingdom of its father. * Astrologico- theological treatises, in which his peculiar tenets were expounded. They are referred to by St. Ephrem, and amongst them was a treatise on light and darkness. A fragment of an astronomical work by Bardaisan was preserved by George, Bishop of the Arab tribes, and republished by Nau.in \\"Bardesane l'astrologue\\" etc. (Paris, 1899) (see ). * A \\"History of Armenia\\". Moses of Chorene cites History of G. A., II, 66. states that Bardaisan, \\"having taken refuge in the fortress of Ani, read there the temple records in which also the deeds of kings were chronicled; to these he added the events of his own time. He wrote all in Syriac, but his book was afterwards translated into Greek\\". Though the correctness of this statement is not quite above suspicion, it probably has a foundation in fact. * \\"An Account of India\\". Bardaisan obtained his information from the Indian Sramana (wandering monks) ambassadors to the Roman Emperor Heliogabalus. A few extracts are preserved by Porphyry and Stobaeus. cites Langlois in Karl Wilhelm Ludwig M√ºller, Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum, V, lxviii sqq. *\\"Book of the Laws of the Countries\\". This famous dialogue, the oldest remnant not only of Bardaisanite learning, but even of Syriac literature, if we except the version of Holy Writ, is not by Bardaisan himself, but by a certain Philip, his disciple. The main speaker, however, in the dialogue is Bardaisan, and we have no reason to doubt that what is put in his mouth correctly represents his teaching. Excerpts of this work are extant in Greek in Eusebius citesPraeparatio Evangelica, VI, x, 6 sqq. and in Caesarius; cites Quaestiones, xlvii, 48. in Latin in the \\"Recognitions\\" of Pseudo-Clement cites IX, 19sqq. A complete Syriac text was first published from a sixth- or seventh-century manuscript in the British Museum by William Cureton, in his Spicilegium Syriacum (London, 1855), and by Nau. It is disputed whether the original was in Syriac or in Greek; Nau is decided in favour of the former. Against a questioning disciple called Abida, Bardaisan seeks to show that man's actions are not entirely necessitated by Fate, as the outcome of stellar combinations. From the fact that the same laws, customs and manners often prevail amongst all persons living in a certain district, or through locally scattered living under the same traditions, Bardaisan endeavours to show that the position of the stars at the birth of individuals can have but little to do with their subsequent conduct, hence the title \\"Book of the Laws of the Countries\\".

The chemistry of helicenes has attracted continuing attention because of their unique structural, spectral, and optical features. Structure and properties The systematic naming for this class of compounds is based on the number of rings: [n]helicene is the structure consisting of n rings. According to IUPAC, only structures where n is at least 5 are considered helicenes. Some specific compounds also have alternate or trivial names. As the number of rings increases, starting at four, the structure becomes non-planar, but instead the planes of consecutive rings tilt to prevent steric collisions. The resulting helix is chiral. For helicenes with six benzene units, a 360¬∞ turn is completed. In the helicene series the dihedral angles between the extremities increases going from [4]helicene (26¬∞) to [6]helicene (58¬∞) and then decreases again for example in [7]helicene (30¬∞). Helicenes are notable for having chirality despite lacking both asymmetric carbons and chiral centers. Instead, there is axial chirality, which results from the handedness of the helicity itself. The clockwise and counterclockwise helices are non-superposable. By convention a left-handed helix is minus and labeled (M), a right-handed helix is plus and labeled (P). Evidence from CD spectroscopy suggests left-handed helices are levorotatory and right-handed helices are dextrorotatory. Synthesis The first helicene structure was reported by Jakob Meisenheimer in 1903 as the reduction product of 2-nitronaphthalene. [5]helicene was synthesized in 1918 by Weitzenb√∂ck & Klingler. The first [6]helicene (also called hexahelicene) was synthesized by M. S. Newman and D. Lednicer in 1955 via a scheme that closed the two central rings by Friedel‚ÄìCrafts cyclization of carboxylic acid compounds. Since then, several methods for synthesizing helicenes with different lengths and substituents are used. The oxidative photocyclization of a stilbene-type precursor is used most often as the key step. The longest helicene, [14]helicene, was prepared in 1975 by this method. In one study, [5]helicene was synthesized in an olefin metathesis reaction of a divinyl compound (prepared from 1,1‚Ä≤-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) in several steps), with Grubbs' second generation catalyst: Helicene synthesis by olefin metathesis Other approach is also non-photochemical and is based on assembly of biphenylyl- naphthalenes and their platinum-catalyzed double cycloisomerization leading to various [6]helicenes: :500px Acenes are the linear 1,3-fused or meta-analogs of helicenes, and phenacenes are a zig-zag configuration. Conceptually related compounds are the circulenes.

There is one line, the A Line, which runs roughly northwest to southeast from J.F. Kennedy to La Poterie via Gare de Rennes (served by Gares metro station), with fifteen stations (thirteen of which are underground). Services run between 05:20 and 00:40 each day (except Thursday, Friday and Saturday between 05:20 and 01:35), and with a waiting time of approximately 80 seconds between trains. From end to end, it takes around 16 minutes, with an average train speed of 32 km/h. All stations are equipped with platform screen doors and lifts. The system has 30 trains, each weighing 28 tonnes and 26 metres long, with a capacity of 170 passengers. In January 2005, three park-and-ride lots were set up, offering 900 places to motorists. Two more opened in 2006‚Äì2007, able to accommodate an additional 700 vehicles. On 1 March 2006, a card called KorriGo was created as a supplement to the ticket system to improve the metro traffic and the city's bus network. The line is maintained by Service des Transports en Commun de l'Agglom√©ration Rennaise (STAR), and managed by Keolis (an SNCF group company). It has a staff of approximately 100. It is operated from a control centre (poste de commande centralis√©e) situated in Chantepie. 120 cameras monitor the stations. The station at La Poterie and viaducts on the line were designed by Norman Foster. With a population of just 205,000 inhabitants for city proper (in 2002), Rennes was the smallest city in the world to boast a metro until 2008 (when Lausanne Metro opened). However in 2013, 425,000 people (211 000 in Rennes) are served by the network in 43 municipalities. On average, there are 135,000 metro trips each day; this figure is expected to rise to 180,000 in coming years, leading to possible gridlock during the rush hours. = Stations = The station names have been chosen for the nearest existing streets or for points of interest near the station locations. * J.F.

Education A graduate from the University of Nairobi (B.ED Arts 1994), attended Musingu High School (1989) and taught Kiptewit High School (1994‚Äì2001) in Kericho Rift Valley province in Kenya. He is a \\"self taught\\" economist. Philosophy Shikwati is a writer and a commentator on public policy with a special interest in development, environment, trade and agriculture related issues. He has written widely on a variety of subjects in Kenyan and international newspapers, magazines, such as The Times, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Business News, The Daily Nation, and The East African Standard. Shikwati was also featured in a November 18, 2006 article in the New York Times: Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Columbia University professor who is a leading aid advocate, calls Shikwati‚Äôs criticisms of foreign assistance ‚Äúshockingly misguided‚Äù and ‚Äúamazingly wrong.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis happens to be a matter of life and death for millions of people, so getting it wrong has huge consequences,‚Äù Sachs said. He has worked extensively with internationally acclaimed opinion leaders to promote ideas that improve productivity, and increase freedom to trade as a way to alleviate poverty. He facilitates several workshops every year throughout Africa geared towards promoting productivity and trade. He recently argued that development is the ability of individuals to understand the world and creatively respond to challenges that confront humanity in a manner that increases levels of human comfort on earth. He is the founder and Executive Director of the Inter Region Economic Network [IREN], an independent and non-partisan think tank that promotes policies geared towards the creation of a free Africa. He is also the Country Director for Students In Free Enterprise [SIFE Kenya] and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of an online business magazine The African Executive that is published weekly by IREN. Awards and decorations On 6 July 2007, Shikwati was named among top 100 most influential Kenyans in a study that was conducted by The Standard Group, one of the Kenya‚Äôs leading media houses, he was described as one person whose decisions and actions are not motivated by the publicity they attract but by passion for what they do. On March 11, 2008, The World Economic Forum named Shikwati among the 250 Young Global Leaders of 2008.

It is known from late Oligocene (27- to 28-million-year-old) fossil teeth found in the Ethiopian district of Chilga. So far, only a few molar teeth have been found, but these are distinct enough that this animal can be identified with confidence. The teeth differ from those of Prodeinotherium, Deinotherium, and the various barytheres in various details, enough to show that this is a distinct type of animal, and has been placed in its own subfamily. Compared to later deinotheres, Chilgatherium was quite small, about tall at the shoulder and weighed about . It is not known if it shared the distinctive downward- curving tusks on the lower jaw that the later deinotheres had. Chilgatherium disappeared prior to the Early Miocene, where Prodeinotherium occurred, instead.

He gained infamy during the early 1990s, when newspapers such as El Nuevo Dia and El Vocero documented his alleged gang activities. Biography Jorge Solano Moreta came into the Puerto Rican public eye during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as many violent events took place in the Bayam√≥n area. The newspapers commonly pointed Solano Moreta and his gang as the perpetrators of many criminal acts, and linked Solano Moreta with the Puerto Rican mafia. It was during that era that he became widely known as Wes by the general Puerto Rican public. According to United States law records, Solano Moreta controlled drug trafficking at the Virgilio D√°vila residential area since 1992. This caused a drug war between his gang and other gangs in Puerto Rico's metropolitan area. From 1992 to 1995, Solano Moreta was featured in many articles in the crime section of Puerto Rico's newspapers. =Arrest and Trial= Solano Moreta was declared a fugitive in 1995 and on June 7 of the same year was surprised and arrested by law enforcement, while living in a friend's apartment. Solano Moreta pled guilty to engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise on May 29, 1996. What ensued was a legal battle, however, because Solano Moreta alleged, among other things, that an agreement outside the bounds of his plea bargain had made him convinced to plead guilty of the charge, and also, that his legal counsel did not properly challenge some tapes of him allegedly talking to other people, which were used as evidence. Another of Solano Moreta's alleged associates, Luis Alicea Cardona, alias Burbuja, was also convicted and fought his conviction, alleging the only evidence used against Burbuja were some beeper messages. Burbuja's conviction was upheld by the court. Solano Moreta was sentenced to 45 years in prison in December 1997. On July 1, 2005, he made the news pages in Puerto Rico again, when he asked judge Salvador Casellas for his sentence of 45 years to be either suspended or modified so he could leave jail at an earlier time.

Like his father, he collected information about the genealogies and history of the ancient Arabs. According to the Fihrist, he wrote 140 works. His account of the genealogies of the Arabs is continually quoted in the Kitab al-Aghani. Hisham established a genealogical link between Ishmael and Mohammed and put forth the idea that all Arabs were descended from Ishmael. He relied heavily on the ancient oral traditions of the Arabs, but also quoted writers who had access to Biblical and Palmyran sources. In 1966, W.

As his nisba shows, he came from the locality of Jarjaraya, south of Baghdad. He came to Egypt along with his brother, and held a succession of offices in the Fatimid bureaucracy. He entered the service of Sitt al-Mulk, before becoming secretary to the police chief of Cairo. He was convicted of disloyalty when he opened letters of the secret services in 1013, as a result of which his hands were cut off.

It once again featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The special was first broadcast May 8, 1987 on CBS and was nominated for Outstanding Animated Program at the 39th Primetime Emmy Awards. It has been released on both VHS and DVD home video. This was the sixth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991. In the special, Garfield attempts to raise money to go to Hollywood and appear on Pet Search.  Storyline  Garfield and Odie believe their dance routines (as performed atop a fence at night) cannot be beaten and so does Jon. They happen to be watching \\"Pet Search\\" (a pets' version of Star Search) when they come up with a great idea to go on the show after seeing a past winner. Jon is hoping to win the $1,000 prize, which Garfield is unimpressed with. They perform as an Elvis style trio called \\"Johnny Bop and the Two-Steps\\" (rather reluctantly, because they did not want Jon involved in their act, as they think he's awful at music). Garfield believes it is embarrassing because they all have to wear kitschy 1950's-era costumes. Despite the silly act, they win the regional competition (after a dog that plays five instruments simultaneously is disqualified after Odie exposes him as just a man in a dog costume) and are able to compete at the national competition in Hollywood. They hit the road to Hollywood and arrive at their fancy Beverly Hills hotel. Garfield and Odie agree that their act is too mediocre to win first prize, so they destroy Jon's guitar when he is not looking, but he gets shocked upon seeing the mess. This allows Garfield and Odie to come up with a better act for the show. Meanwhile the \\"Pet Search\\" finals are underway with a different host named Burt and an announcer named Bob. Bob tells Burt about the prizes the top winner will receive including $1,000,000 and the second place winner will receive a boat. While Jon, Garfield. and Odie watch the other competitors, Jon tells them that even though they were happy they won the first \\"Pet Search\\" contest, $1,000, made it to Hollywood, and would like to take the prizes for first place, he thinks that Garfield and Odie should lose the finals and return to their old lives as a prize of their own, but Garfield disagrees. Garfield and Odie compete in the finals as a tango dancing duo called \\"The Dancing Armandos,\\" only to receive the boat for second place and lose the top prize package to an opera-singing cat. Angry over losing, Garfield destroys the set, but Jon assures him that they won the boat as a prize. The special ends back home where Garfield finally admits to Jon that it was all for the best that they are home again, as they are on their boat fantasizing about sailing to exotic locations worldwide, despite the fact that they live in a landlocked area and have to settle for sitting on it in the backyard.

Their story is told in CP Lee's book When We Were Thin (published 2007 by Hotun Press). The name of the band is a corruption of the Latin American band Alberto y Los Trios Paraguayos. Career Created in 1972 by former member of Greasy Bear, Chris \\"C.P.\\" Lee, with Jimmy Hibbert (vocals, bass) (ex Jacko Ogg and the Head People) and Bob Harding (vocals, guitar, bass), the comedy sketch outfit became a musical group in 1974 and was joined by former Greasy Bear (1968‚Äì1972) drummer Bruce Mitchell (drums), with Les Prior (vocals), Simon White (steel guitar, guitar), Tony Bowers (bass, guitar) and Ray \\"Mighty Mongo\\" Hughes (second drummer). They became a popular support act, supporting Hawkwind on their 1974 tour. The group mercilessly parodied the major rock names of the 1970s ‚Äì \\"Anadin\\" (the trade name for an over-the-counter headache remedy) was a reworking of Lou Reed's \\"Heroin\\" / \\"Sweet Jane\\". By 1975 they were topping the bill in their own right and were supported by such acts as The Police, The Stranglers and Blondie. As with many comedy ensembles, the Albertos belied their comic aspirations by their exemplary musicianship, and they released three albums and a variety of spoof discs, culminating in the musical play, Snuff Rock. Sleak (aka Snuff Rock), inspired by the then recent film, Snuff, and the concept of snuff movies, but carrying the idea to a band who killed themselves for entertainment, was their musical play presented at London's Royal Court Theatre and Round House and was famous for the role of the comic disc jockey played by Les Prior. The accompanying EP, \\"Snuff Rock\\", released on Stiff Records, poked fun at the punk rock phenomenon, targeting the Sex Pistols (\\"Gobbing On Life\\"), The Damned (\\"Kill\\") and The Clash (\\"Snuffin' Like That\\") as well as myriad reggae bands in \\"Snuffin' In A Babylon\\". They reached the UK Singles Chart with the Status Quo spoof, \\"Heads Down No Nonsense Mindless Boogie\\" in 1978. Les Prior died in January 1980 from leukaemia, which left a large gap in the group. After their nationally networked TV show Teach Yourself Gibberish and a crack at America with Sleak, the Albertos disbanded in 1982. The band's brand of spoof rock has been said to be in the same English tradition as that of the Barron Knights and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, but a better comparison might be the American bluegrass/country parody band the Austin Lounge Lizards.

LyonWaldo Kampmeier Lyon (May 19, 1914 - May 5, 1998) was the founder and chief research scientist for the U.S. Navy of the Arctic Submarine Laboratory at the Naval Electronics Laboratory. He retired in 1996 after 55 years of government service. During his career he advised top Navy officials on essential matters of national defense and was personally thanked by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy for his efforts. Military career For 51 years, Dr. Lyon worked for Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego) and its predecessor organizations. Dr. Lyon started work there less than a year after its June 1940 establishment as the Navy Radio and Sound Lab, as their first Ph.D. physicist. He was charged with forming and directing initial efforts of the Sound Division. The lab was used during World War II for testing, repairing and modifying submarine equipment and harbor defense systems in the Pacific Ocean. During the war, German U-boats in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were undetectable, because sonar failed under the surface ice. Dr. Lyon addressed this problem by designing and testing sonar and oceanographic equipment for the submarine and participating in the ship's first under-ice dives. :\\"In 1946 when Admiral Byrd took the expedition to Antarctica, I got a letter asking if there was any research I wanted to do in conjunction with the expedition. I said yes, try a submarine in the cold water down there,\\" Dr. Lyon said. His recommendation initiated an effort that would last over four decades. In 1947 Dr. Lyon became head of the Naval Electronics Laboratory's, Submarine Studies Branch in the Research Division. Dr. Lyon had a test pool constructed at Battery Whistler (a converted mortar battery at NEL) to test equipment for deep submergence vehicles like Bathyscaphe Trieste. The pool was equipped to grow sea ice and study its physical properties. In addition, he established a field station at Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska in 1951. Dr. Waldo Lyon with Admiral Hyman G. Rickover aboard USS Nautilus Equipment and techniques were designed and tested to enable submarine operation in the Arctic Ocean. Brine content and ice elasticity were measured to apply in the design of submarines that could surface through the ice cover. Cold rooms and calibration facilities at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory were used to solve the problem of icing on submarine snorkel head valves. The research culminated in the transpolar submerged voyage of in 1958. Dr. Lyon's career included scores of under-ice cruises to gain scientific knowledge essential to Arctic submarine operations. He and researcher Art Roshon developed an under-ice sonar that allowed completion of the first winter cruise by s. Through the 1970s and 1980s Dr. Lyon's ongoing research at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory resulted in refurbishment and improvement of the Lab's cryogenic facilities. These facilities were used for evaluating icing issues on s, sonar technology developments for remote acoustic measurement of ice thickness, and the ice breakthrough tests for s. Awards Dr. Lyon received major awards including: *The Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award (twice) *The Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award *The President's Distinguished Federal Civilian Service Award *He was a member of teams that earned the Presidential Unit Citation (US) in 1958 and 1969 *He received the Navy Unit Commendation in 1959, 1960, 1962, 1970, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. He also received numerous non-governmental awards including: *Gold Medal of the American Society of Naval Engineers *Silver Century Medal of Societe de Geographie (Paris) *Bronze Medal of the Royal Institute of Navigation (London) *Bushnell Medal of the American Defense Preparedness Association *The Lowell Thomas Medal of The Explorers Club (only the fourth time this medal has been awarded) Last years Dr Lyon remained active in Arctic research even after retirement. He collaborated with Dr. William M. Leary on a book detailing development of the submarine Arctic warfare program entitled, Under Ice: Waldo Lyon and the Development of the Arctic Submarine, published in January 1999. Less than two weeks before his death, he met with the president of the prestigious Explorer's Club to plan an expedition to the North Pole. They had planned to dive to the sea floor at the Pole.

In early 2003, a second rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), emerged in the south, and by June‚ÄìJuly 2003, Charles Taylor's government controlled only a third of the country. The capital Monrovia was besieged by LURD, and the group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as the result of the conflict. The Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed by the warring parties on August 18, 2003 marking the political end of the conflict and beginning of the country's transition to democracy under the National Transitional Government of Liberia which was led by interim President Gyude Bryant until the Liberian general election of 2005. Overview LURD commander \\"Gen. Cobra\\" with his guards The First Liberian Civil War ended with the Liberian general election, 1997 in which Charles Taylor took power. The second civil war began in April 1999, when Liberian dissidents under the banner of the Organization of Displaced Liberians invaded Liberia from Guinea.International Crisis Group, ‚ÄòLiberia: The Key to Ending Regional Instability,‚Äô 24 April 2002, p.8 Guinea became LURD‚Äôs main source of military and financial support. By July 2000, the various dissident groups had coalesced as the LURD led by Sekou Conneh. The dissidents were thought to be mostly Mandinka and Krahn fighters of the former ULIMO-J and ULIMO-K.ICG, ‚ÄòLiberia: The Key to Ending Regional Instability,‚Äô 24 April 2002, p.3 Also important in forming LURD was an alliance, brokered by ECOMOG-SL Nigerian chief General Maxwell Khobe, between Liberian dissidents and the Sierra Leonean Kamajors hunter militia, including chiefs Samuel Hinga Norman and Eddie Massally. Against the dissidents Taylor deployed irregular ex-National Patriotic Front of Liberia fighters with his more privileged units, such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit, positioned to ensure the irregulars did fight. Simultaneous September 2000 counter-attacks on Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone by RUF ‚Äì still loyal to Taylor and Guinean dissidents ‚Äì achieved initial success. By January 2001, however, Taylor‚Äôs forces were pushed back inside Sierra Leone and Liberia. The insurgents were posing a major threat to the Taylor government. Liberia was now engaged in a complex three-way conflict with Sierra Leone and the Guinea Republic. By the beginning of 2002, both of these countries were supporting LURD, while Taylor was supporting various opposition factions in both countries. By supporting ‚Äî practically creating ‚Äî the SL rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Taylor also drew the enmity of the British and Americans. British and U.S. pressure on Taylor increased with rising financial support for Guinea and U.S./U.K.-proposed sanctions, a weaker version of which were imposed by U.N. Security Council May 2001. = Rebels approach Monrovia = technical with a mounted machine gun, Monrovia. By mid-February 2002 LURD troops were just 44 kilometres from Monrovia, at Klay Junction, and Taylor was forced to declare a state of emergency.International Crisis Group, April 2002, p.7, Adebayo, Liberia's Civil War, 2002, p.235 The February 2002 ICG report says that this attack was made by pursuing ‚Äòa strategy of infiltration of south-western Liberia through the thick bush of Southern Lofa, looping around government strongholds and disrupting supply lines... while LURD claims between 300 and 500 men were assigned to that mission, ... the number that actually attacked was likely closer to twenty.‚Äô Any image of a large force gradually pushing toward Monrovia is mistaken; ‚Äòhit and run‚Äô raids, rather than a continuous advance, seem to have been the pattern.Mats Utas, Fluid Research Fields: Studying Excombatant Youth in the Aftermath of the Liberian Civil War, p.213, in Chapter 11, Children and Youth on the Front Line: ethnography, armed conflict and displacement, Dr Jo Boyden & J. de Berry, Oxford and New York: Berghahn Books, 2004. Through the first half of 2002 LURD mounted raids in Bomi, Bong, and Montserrado counties, hitting, in addition to Klay Junction, Gbarnga and Tubmanburg, each time temporarily seizing control from government fighters. In May, an attack on Arthington, less than 20 kilometres from the capital, apparently prompted panic in Monrovia. The state of emergency was lifted in September 2002, after, the government claimed, the township of Bopolu had been retaken.BBC News Africa, ‚ÄòLiberia ends state of emergency,‚Äô Saturday, 14 September 2002. In early 2003, a second rebel group, the Ivoirian-backed Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), emerged in the south, and by the summer of 2003, Taylor's government controlled only a third of the country. Despite some setbacks, by mid-2003 LURD controlled the northern third of the country and was threatening the capital. The capital Monrovia was besieged by LURD, and that group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict. A new bout of fighting began in March 2003 after a relative lull and by early May, LURD and MODEL had gained control of nearly two thirds of the country, and were threatening Monrovia. Regional and wider pressure led to the convening of a conference in Accra by the then Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), President John Kufuor of Ghana, on June 4, 2003. = Siege of Monrovia (July‚ÄìAugust 2003) = By July 2003 Monrovia appeared to be in danger of being occupied and devastated despite ongoing peace talks.S/2003/875, para 9, see also Dr T. Jaye, Liberia: an analysis of post-Taylor politics, Review of African Political Economy, Vol. 30, Issue 98, Dec 2003 The U.S. established Joint Task Force Liberia, built around a U.S. navy amphibious group with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, positioned off the West African coast. In July 2003 the United States (US) sent a small number of troops to bolster security around the US embassy in Monrovia, which had come under attack during Operation Shining Express. On July 25, 2003, the Southern Europe Task Force at Vicenza, Italy was designated the lead U.S. Army command for the operation. On 29 July 2003, LURD declared a ceasefire. ECOWAS sent two battalions of Nigerian peacekeepers to Liberia. The first Nigerian battalion detached from the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, and the second came from Nigeria itself. = President Taylor resigns (August 2003)= President Taylor resigned on August 11, 2003, ahead of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) which formed the negotiated end to the war, and was flown into exile in Nigeria. An arrest warrant for Taylor for war crimes committed by his RUF rebel allies in Sierra Leone was later issued by Interpol but Nigeria refused to deport him for a time unless they receive a specific request from Liberia. Vice-President Moses Blah replaced Taylor. On August 14, rebels lifted their siege of Monrovia and 200 American soldiers landed to support a West African peace force. Thousands of people danced and sang as American troops and ECOMIL, the Nigerian-led West African forces, took over the port and bridges which had split the capital into government and rebel-held zones. An estimated 1,000 people had been killed in Monrovia between July 18 and August 14. Moses Blah handed over power to the National Transitional Government of Liberia on October 14, 2003. However, the transitional government exercised no real authority in the country, 80% of which was controlled by the rebel groups. Riots in Monrovia left approximately 16 people dead, with sources claiming that former combatants were behind the violence.Liberia profile - Timeline. (2018, January 22). Retrieved from https://www.bbc.com/news/world- africa-13732188. Child soldiers LURD child soldier Both LURD and Charles Taylor made extensive use of children press ganged into military service as soldiers or ammunition porters. The use of child soldiers was prolific by both sides, regardless of prohibitions of the practice in the Geneva Convention. Observers from Human Rights Watch described a deadly and chaotic siege of Monrovia, with many very young fighters shooting \\"shiny toys\\" they had not been trained to use. Drugs made up an integral part of Liberian wartime culture. Child soldiers and other combatants were routinely addicted to cocaine, khat, and other drugs as a means of control. Several warlords felt that cocaine made soldiers more effective in battle. United Nations peacekeeping In November 1997, following the completion of the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia UNOMIL on 30 September, the United Nations established the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL), headed by a representative of the Secretary-General. That first United Nations post-conflict peace-building support office was tasked primarily with assisting the government in consolidating peace following the July 1997 multiparty elections. On September 11, 2003, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended deployment of the peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), to maintain the peace agreement. The UN Security Council approved the mission on September 19 in Resolution 1509. Nigeria sent in peacekeepers as part of the interim ECOWAS force. UNMIL was made up of over 15,000 personnel, including both military and civilian troops. The bulk of the personnel were armed military troops, but there were also civilian policemen, as well as political advisers and humanitarian aid workers. On October 1, the first peacekeepers changed their berets and became a UN force, with many more troops earmarked. During three days of riots in Monrovia in October 2004, nearly 400 people were wounded and 15 killed. The UN slowly built up its forces in the country, with 5,500 projected to be in place by November 2003, and worked to disarm the various factions. However, instability in neighbouring countries, an incomplete disarmament process, and general discontent threatened Liberia's fragile peace. Women of Liberia A group of Liberian women headed by Leymah Gbowee formed an organization called \\"Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace\\" and forced a meeting with President Charles Taylor, extracting a promise from him to attend peace talks in Ghana. A delegation of women organized nonviolence protests and continued to apply pressure on the warring factions during the peace process. They staged a silent protest outside of the Presidential Palace, bringing about an agreement during the stalled peace talks. Their creative non-violent protest allowed them to use the power within women and mothers of Liberia; tactics included a sex strike until their men chose to set aside weapons, and threatening to undress during a sit in outside the peace talks in Ghana. Working together, over 3,000 Christian and Muslim women mobilized their efforts, and as a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and helped bring to power the country's first female president. The story is told in the 2008 documentary film Pray the Devil Back to Hell. Among the women leaders who helped end the civil war was Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who would become the first modern elected female head of state in Africa when she was elected in 2005. Her election was inspired by the powerful commitment of women who had seen the war perpetuated by men in their country and were unwilling to put a man back into that powerful role.

Early life He was born in calle Caballeros, Jerez, Spain. His father was Pl√°cido Caballero, a Cuban whose mother was of European descent and whose father was from Cantabria. His mother was Julia Bonald, a descendant of Viscount Louis Gabriel Ambroise de Bonald, a traditional French philosopher who settled in Andalucia in the middle of the 19th century. Education Between 1936 and 1943, he studied at the Marianistas de Jerez School. During the Spanish Civil War, he spent some time in the Sierra de C√°diz and in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda. He read the first books that were to influence him: Jack London, Emilio Salgari, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jos√© de Espronceda. Between 1944 and 1948, he undertook nautical studies in C√°diz, and he wrote his first poems. He made friends with members of the C√°diz magazine Platero, namely Fernando Qui√±ones, Pilar Paz Pasamar, Felipe Sordo Lamadrid, Seraf√≠n Pro Hesles, Julio Mariscal, Jos√© Luis Tejada, Francisco Pleguezuelo and Pedro Ardoy. Caballero spent his military service in the Milicia Naval Universitaria and spent two summers sailing in the waters of the Canary Islands, Morocco and Galicia. His military career was curtailed when he contracted a lung illness and travelled to Jerez to recuperate. Between 1949 and 1952, he studied philosophy and literature in Seville. He continued his studies of literature in Madrid and worked on the First Biennial Latin- American Art Festival. Career Around 1954 he served as Secretary and later as Deputy Editor of the Papeles de Son Armadans magazine. In 1959 he began to make friends with and collaborate with poets who would later make up the Generation of 1950. This group of literary figures were united in their political opposition to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. In February 1959 in Collioure (France), he attended the 20th anniversary of the death of Antonio Machado, along with Blas de Otero, Jos√© Agust√≠n Goytisolo, √Ångel Gonz√°lez, Jos√© √Ångel Valente, Jaime Gil de Biedma, Alfonso Costafreda and Carlos Barral. He moved to Bogot√°, where he taught Spanish literature and humanities at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. There he started his friendship with the Colombian group of the Mito magazine (composed of Jorge Gait√°n Dur√°n, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Eduardo Cote Lamus, Hernando Valencia Goelkel, Pedro G√≥mez Valderrama and Fernando Charry Lara, among others). In 1963 he returned to Spain and took up several publishing posts. Between 1965 and 1968 he spent time in Cuba and became part of an organization aimed at paying homage to Antonio Machado in Baeza in 1966, which was finally prohibited by government order. He published the Narrativa Cubana de la Revoluci√≥n (Cuban Narrative of the Revolution) in 1968, and was again arrested for political reasons, and imprisoned for one month in Carabanchel jail. In 1971 he began working for the Lexicography Seminar of the Royal Spanish Academy, where he stayed until 1975. In 1973 he also started working as literary editor for J√∫car Publications, a position which he also occupied until 1975. He gave courses on narrative in several European universities and attended literary symposia. He worked as a Contemporary Spanish Literature Professor at the Centre for Hispanic Studies at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania from 1974 to 1978. That year he was appointed President of the PEN Club Espa√±ol (from which he resigned in 1980). In Madrid, the National Drama Center performed his version of Abre el Ojo (Open Your Eye), by Rojas Zorrilla. Between 1985 and 1988 he once again spent some time in the United States. In 1989 a high school bearing his name was inaugurated in Jerez. A public library bearing his name was inaugurated in Marbella in 1992. In 1993 he was appointed corresponding member of the North American Spanish Language Academy. The National Classic Theatre Company performed his version of Don Gil de las Calzas Verdes (Sir Gil of the Green Stockings) by Tirso de Molina. The Sanl√∫car de Barrameda Town Council named a street after him. In 1997 the Antonio Gades Company performed his ballet adaptation of Fuenteovejuna. The Jerez City Council created the Caballero Bonald Foundation. He was awarded the title of Favourite Son of Andaluc√≠a. In 1999 he was awarded the title of Favourite Son of the Province of Cadiz. He received the Golden Medal of the Fine Arts Circle and the Juli√°n Besteiro Award for Arts and Literature. In 2004 he was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of C√°diz. He also won the Queen Sof√≠a Latin American Poetry Award. In 2012, he was awarded the Miguel de Cervantes Prize for his achievements in Spanish literature.

Urban Vision Entertainment Inc. was an American-based production/distribution company created in Los Angeles, California formed in July 1996 by Mataichiro Yamamoto to help introduce the animation medium known as anime to the American mainstream. History Urban Vision Entertainment was formed in July 1996 by Mataichiro Yamamoto to help introduce the alternative animation genre known as anime to mainstream media. The company primarily produced and acquired Japanese animation for direct-to-home video release. Urban Vision founder Mataichiro Yamamoto helped pioneer the anime genre in the US with the computer-generated theatrical release, Golgo 13: The Professional in 1983. Urban Vision worked closely with the world-renowned Studio Madhouse animation studio in Tokyo, Japan (Wicked City, Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D). The company's initial release, another Madhouse project, was Bio Hunter, released on home video in July 1997. Additional Urban Vision releases included Gatchaman, Twilight of the Dark Master, Dragon Slayer, Psycho Diver: Soul Siren and Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals. In the mid-2000s Urban Vision shifted its focus from anime to live-action movies with the launch of two sub-labels, Ciudad for Spanish-language films and AsiaVision for Japanese-language films. =Decline= Urban Vision became inactive since the late 00's, not acquiring any more titles. On September 7, 2010, the online retailer Right Stuf removed all of their Urban Vision catalog due to the distributor not shipping out orders to them. The following day, Urban Vision released a statement saying that the company had been restructuring itself and were halting their home video production unit and focusing on digital distribution. In November 2016, the company was shut down. Currently, a majority of their titles have since been re-licensed and re-released by Discotek Media and Sentai Filmworks.

He lives in London. He was a key player in preparing the ‚ÄúLetter of Demands‚Äù of 1991 and the \\"Memorandum of Advice\\" the following year. Both documents were endorsed by a considerable number of prominent figures, including Sheikh Bin Baz, Al-Uthaymeen and Salman Al-Ouda, and were then presented to the king at the time Fahd.Al-Qaeda's Saudi Origin, Middle East Quarterly, Fall 2006; includes material on the history of Saudi political movements around 1991 In 1994, the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights was established and Al-Faqeeh was appointed as the head of its London office, with another Saudi dissident Mohammad al-Massari as the spokesperson. The two separated, and al-Faqih went on to set up MIRA in 1996. Al-Faqih's organisation opposes the current sociopolitical and religious policy of Saudi Arabia. Although campaigning for religious reform, he prefers not to be referred to as a Wahabbist. He maintains that Islam advocates separation of powers, freedom of expression, transparency and women's rights, in contrast to what he maintains is the current Saudi policy. He is also an anti-royalist, asserting the Saudi government has lost its religious legitimacy.  Early life Saad al-Faqih was born in southern Iraq to a Najdi family. He was professor of surgery at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia until March 1994. He was jailed for his involvement in the country‚Äôs reform movement. On his release from prison, he became director of the London office of the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR), which opposed the Saudi government as un-Islamic, then the leading Saudi opposition group. He left CDLR to found MIRA in 1996.  Terrorism Support Allegations  In December 2004, the US Treasury accused al-Faqih of being affiliated with Al Qaeda, and alleges he has maintained relations to the group since 1998.US Treasury announcement on al-Faqih and Batterjee (English) Two days later, the names of al-Faqih and MIRA were added to the UN 1267 Committee's list of individuals and entities belonging to or associated with al-Qaeda. The Treasury statement mentions al-Faqih's past affiliation with Osama bin Laden, Khalid al-Fawwaz, Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, and an obscure al-Qaeda ideologue who writes, or used to write, under the name Lewis Attiyatullah. Sa'ad Al- Faqih asserts that authorities, such as the United States government, wish to vilify him because they are allies with the current Saudi regime, which he opposes and denies all allegations. BBC five reported a claim that in 1996 Saad Al Faqih purchased an Exact-M 22 satellite phone for Osama bin Laden, an allegation which has not even been investigated, nor has he been charged by any court in the world. Al-Faqeeh confirms that he and MIRA are \\"totally committed to peaceful agenda.\\". He has since been removed from the UN sanctions list after the UN Security Council committee accepted the Ombudsman's recommendation to have him removed. The committee's chairman, German Permanent Representative Peter Wittig, announced in a statement on 3 July 2012 that \\"after thorough consideration\\" Dr Al-Faqih and Mira had been removed. \\"The key question the committee has to consider is whether there is sufficient information to provide a reasonable and credible basis for concluding that an individual, group, undertaking, or entity is associated with al-Qaeda,\\" he added. The UK and Germany reportedly supported Dr Faqih's removal, while the US and Saudi Arabia were among those who opposed it. Dr Al- Faqih said it had been a \\"laborious battle\\" to get off the sanctions list. \\"All that has happened in the last eight years is that an innocent, peaceful activist, acting within the law, has been a victim of a conspiracy by tyrants in the Gulf supported by superpowers,\\" he told the Reuters news agency.

It publishes the MSCI BRIC, MSCI World and MSCI EAFE Indexes. The company is currently headquartered at 7 World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York City, U.S. History In 1968, Capital International published indexes covering the global stock market for non-U.S. markets. In 1986, Morgan Stanley licensed the rights to the indexes from Capital International and branded the indexes as the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes. By the 1980s, the MSCI indexes were the primary benchmark indexes outside of the US before being joined by FTSE, Citibank, and Standard & Poor's. After Dow Jones started float weighting its index funds, MSCI followed. In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, Inc., to form MSCI Barra. In mid-2007, parent company Morgan Stanley decided to divest from, and perhaps spin off, MSCI. This was followed by an initial public offering of a minority of stock in November 2007. The divestment was completed in 2009. The company is headquartered in New York City. Some companies in MSCI's peer group includes Glass Lewis, Factset, Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, and Standard & Poor's.

In October 2019, MSCI formally acquired Carbon Delta, a Zurich-based climate change analytics company. Indexes The MSCI global equity indexes have been calculated since 1969 and include MSCI World and MSCI EAFE. Initially, the company used eight factors in developing its indexes: momentum, volatility, value, size, growth, size nonlinearity, liquidity, and financial leverage. In 2018 MSCI announced it would begin including mainland Chinese \\"A\\" shares in its Emerging Markets Index. Initially the domestic Chinese companies received a 5% weighting in the index even though the stated methodology called for a 40% weighting. While MSCI is the last major index provider to include the companies, the decision has proved controversial due to the fact that many Chinese listed companies refuse to permit the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to inspect their financial records, thereby sparking criticism and questions from Senator Marco Rubio and others. In February 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported the decision was the result of pressure from the Chinese government. In March 2019, CNBC reported that MSCI would quadruple the weightings of mainland Chinese shares in its global benchmarks. In April 2020, it was reported that Donald Trump was considering an executive action to prohibit the Thrift Savings Plan from transferring $50 billion to mirror the MSCI All Country World Index fund.

It is situated 13 km north of the capital Panaji. The town is the headquarters of Bardez Taluka. It is located on the main highway NH-17, linking Mumbai to Kochi. In Portuguese, the town is known as Mapu√ßa. History Mapusa is a small town clustered around the Mount (Alto). The name Mapusa is thought to be derived from the Konkani word for a 'measure' - 'map' and the phrase fill up - 'sa'. Ancient Goan agrarian community had a well established Gaunkari or Community Farming System, where villages formed associations, worked on community land and shared profits. Market day was a major event, with goods brought in from every district to one central area. Mapusa has thus remained a prominent market center for many centuries. Geography Mapusa is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Mapusa It has an average elevation of 15 metres (49 feet).It lies on the banks of Mapusa River. Mapusa has a tropical climate with temperatures ranging from a high of 37 ¬∞C in summer with high levels of humidity to a low of 21 ¬∞C in winters. Demographics India census, Mapusa had a population of 40,487. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Mapusa has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 80%, and female literacy is 73%. In Mapusa, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Economy Mapusa vendor selling vegetables Mapusa is close to one of the main centres of Goa's tourism industry. Mapusa's proximity to many beaches in the north of Goa makes it a suitable base during the tourist season (November to April). Because it is a mainly commercial town (for locals) with a large resident population, Mapusa has only a limited number of hotels and accommodation. Mapusa comes alive on Friday, the traditional market day also known as Mapusa Friday Market. People from surrounding villages and towns come to Mapusa to sell their wares. This fair has a lot of local flavour (unlike some other tourist-oriented fairs or markets) and specialises in agricultural produce, vegetables, locally grown fruit, spices, clothes and even plants (mainly during the monsoon planting season). Every Friday, the Mapusa Market bulges at the seams, with seemingly every square inch of space occupied by sellers with only just enough room for the prospective buyers, the alleys between the regular stalls being occupied with temporary mats and boards. From lottery tickets displayed in great swathes to barber shops, the bazaar caters for almost every requirement imaginable. There is the fish street, dried fish of all possible varieties and whole fresh fish from baby shark and squid to the ubiquitous bangda (mackerel). Fresh fruit and vegetables are gathered together and beautifully displayed, from huge sweet potatoes, and pumpkins and the local shiny red brown Moira bananas to the tiny fresh beans and other pulses. Education Mapusa houses several prominent Goan educational institutions, including Saraswat Vidyalaya, St. Mary's Convent High School, St. Britto's High School, New Goa High School, St. Antony's High School, Mapusa High School, Dyanprasarak High School, Shree Ganesh Vidya Mandir, DMC Higher Secondary and college of Art, Science and Commerce, St. Xavier's College of Art, Science and Commerce, and St. Xavier's Higher Secondary School, Agnel Institute of Technical Education (Engg College). Landmarks Mapusa, however, does not have too many tourist sites. There are a few colonial era Municipal building on the Altinho hill, but it is a fairly small town with mostly modern buildings spread around the slopes of Altinho. The most famous local shrine is Shree Dev Bodgeshwar Sansthan of Lord Bodgeshwar, located on the outskirts of the town in the middle of some rice fields, which is beautifully lit up at night and draws thousands of devotees for its annual Jatra. The Church of Our Lady of Miracles, founded in 1594 and rebuilt several times since, located around 600m east of the Municipal Gardens, is famous more for its annual festival than for its architecture. It was built by the Portuguese on the site of an old Hindu temple, and thus the Hindu community still holds the site as sacred. On the sixteenth day after Easter, the church's annual feast day is celebrated here by both Hindus and Christians ‚Äì one of the best examples of the way in which Hinduism and Christianity often coexist merrily in Goa. Maruti Temple, in the centre of town, is a small, pastel-coloured Maruti temple that was built in the 1840s at a site where Hanuman was covertly worshipped during more oppressive periods of Portuguese rule. After temples had been destroyed by the Portuguese, devotees placed a picture of Hanuman at the fireworks shop that stood here, and arrived cloaked in secrecy to perform pujas (prayers). In April 1843 the picture was replaced by a silver idol and an increasing number of worshippers began to gather here. Eventually the business community of Mapusa gathered enough funds to acquire the shop, and the temple was built in its place. The intricate carvings at the doorway of the temple are the work of local artisans. The Mapusa Market gathers Goan traders as well as merchants from adjacent states for goods such as spices, toddy and home-grown goods. For example, there are four varieties of locally growned bananas sold in this market and other varieties imported from Karnataka. There is also a part of the market where the traders specialise in repairing ustensiles such as blenders and food mixers for the preparation of spices. Duler Stadium is an association football stadium located in Mapusa. The 10000 seater stadium has Astroturf surface. Goa Professional League and Santosh Trophy games are held here.

The main difference between Dianhong and other Chinese black teas is the amount of fine leaf buds, or \\"golden tips,\\" present in the dried tea. Dianhong tea produces a brew that is brassy golden orange in colour with a sweet, gentle aroma and no astringency. Cheaper varieties of Dianhong produce a darker brownish brew that can be very bitter. History and etymology Teas grown in Yunnan prior to the Han dynasty (206220) were typically produced in a compressed form similar to modern pu'er tea. Dian hong is a relatively new product from Yunnan that began production in the early 20th century. The word () is the short name for the Yunnan region while () means \\"red (tea)\\"; as such, these teas are sometimes simply referred to as Yunnan red or Yunnan black. However, such references are often confusing due to the other varieties of teas produced in Yunnan. Varieties *Broken Yunnan (): A cheap tea used for blending which contains very few golden buds and is generally bitter on its own. This tea is easily identified by the largely black dried leaves with only a few bursts of golden tips. The brew is dark and not brassy but reddish brown. The taste can sometimes be as strong as cooked pu-erh tea. Classified in Orange pekoe grading as BOP. *Yunnan Gold (): A dianhong with fewer golden buds and more dark tea leaves. It is on par with the pure gold, and is priced similarly, but makes teas with slightly different characteristics. The brew has a brassy red color different from other black teas and a vivid sweetness not quite as intense as \\"Yunnan pure gold\\". Classified in Orange pekoe grading from OP to TGFOP. *Yunnan Pure Gold (): Considered the best type of Dian hong tea. It contains only golden tips, which are usually covered in fine hairs. When viewed from a distance, the dried tea appears bright orange in colour. The tea liquor is bright red in colour and exhibits a gentle aroma and a sweet taste. The leaves are reddish brown after being brewed. Classified in Orange pekoe grading from TGFOP to SFTGFOP. *Golden needle () is a pure black variety of dianhong. The leaves are golden in color and yield an amberish infusion. *Pine Needle () is a preparation technology developed in the 20th century preserving straight leaf form, which makes a mix of differently coloured leaves reminiscent of old needles fallen off a pine tree. Non-curved leaves are a rather common shape for lightly-fermented green teas, however for black teas this is a novelty.

As of 1995, synthetic pine oil was the \\"biggest single turpentine derivative.\\" Synthetic pine oils accounted for 90% of sales as of 2000. In alternative medicine, it is said to be used in aromatherapy, as a scent in bath oils or more commonly as a cleaning product, and as a lubricant in small and expensive clockwork instruments. It may also be used varyingly as a disinfectant, sanitizer, microbicide (or microbistat), virucide or insecticide. It is also used as an effective herbicide where its action is to modify the waxy cuticle of plants, resulting in desiccation. Pine oil is distinguished from other products from pine, such as turpentine, the low- boiling fraction from the distillation of pine sap, and rosin, the thick tar remaining after turpentine is distilled. Chemically, pine oil consists mainly of Œ±-terpineol and other cyclic terpene alcohols.Merck Index, 11th Edition, 7416. p. 1182 It may also contain terpene hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters. The exact composition depends on various factors, such as the variety of pine from which it is produced and the parts of the tree used.  Properties as a disinfectant  Pine oil is a disinfectant that is mildly antiseptic. It is effective against Brevibacterium ammoniagenes, the fungi Candida albicans, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Gram-negative enteric bacteria, household germs, Gram-negative household germs such as those causing salmonellosis, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, influenza type A, influenza virus type A/Brazil, influenza virus type A2/Japan, intestinal bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, odor-causing bacteria, mold, mildew, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleraesuis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhosa, Serratia marcescens, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. It will kill the causative agents of typhoid, gastroenteritis (some agents), rabies, cholera, several forms of meningitis, whooping cough, gonorrhea and several types of dysentery. Detailed Information On Chemical Disinfectants University of Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, accessed June 26, 2007. It is not effective against spore related illnesses, such as tetanus or anthrax, or against non-enveloped viruses such as poliovirus, rhinovirus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.  Froth flotation  Industrially, pine oil is used as a frother in mineral extraction from ores. For example, in copper extraction pine oil is used to condition copper sulfide ores for froth flotation. Therefore, it is important in the industry for the froth flotation process. It has largely been replaced by synthetic alcohols and polyglycol ethers.  Safety  Pine oil has a relatively low human toxicity level, a low corrosion level and limited persistence; however, it irritates the skin and mucous membranes and has been known to cause breathing problems. Large doses may cause central nervous system depression.

Along with Alipore, Ballygunge features amongst the top two most wealthy neighbourhoods of Kolkata and also boasts of being one of the most affluent localities in the entire nation. History The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar, and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Ballygunge was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch. Beltala was a village in Dihi Mohanpur (later Monoharpukur).Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, pp. 14-15, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. Ballygunge grew up around a market for sand (bali in Bengali) and had garden- houses of 18th century Europeans. Amongst the prominent residents were George Mandeville, the zamindar/ collector, and Colonel Gilbert Ironside, a friend of Warren Hastings. In 1840, Emily Eden called Ballugunge 'our Eltham or Lewisham'. It also emerged as a citadel of the educated Bengali middle class after the suburban railway opened up the area.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, pp. 15-20, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. In 1888, Ballygunge and Tollygunge had a combined thana (police station). Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, parts of Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watgunge and Ekbalpur, and parts of Garden Reach and Tollygunge were added to Kolkata Municipal Corporation in 1888. Garden Reach was later taken out.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213, Oxford University Press, . When the Bengal Renaissance started taking roots in 19th century Calcutta, it was initially limited to the predominantly Hindu 'Indian town' stretching north and north-east from the fringes of Burrabazar, with a somewhat later extension south and south-east of the 'European town' to Bhowanipore, and some decades later to Ballygunge, which was then developing as a suburb.Sarkar, Sumit, \\"Calcutta and the 'Bengal Renaissance'\\", in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, p. 100, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. In the first half of the 20th century, \\"in the milieu of relative urban prosperity...

At the 2015 local government reform it became a subdivision and the seat of the municipality Mal√´si e Madhe.Law nr. 115/2014 It was the seat of the former Mal√´si e Madhe District. The population at the 2011 census was 3,734.2011 census results It is situated north of the city of Shkod√´r. As of June 2016, Koplik has been registered and administrated as an international 'free economic trade zone' by the Albanian government. History Cupionich was mentioned by Mariano Bolizza in 1614, being part of the Sanjak of Scutari. It was Roman Catholic, had 60 houses, and 130 men at arms commanded by Pecha Campersa. Koplik was thought to have been founded sometime in the 14th century by Tsar Stephan Dushan of Serbia. Koplik, being a border town, has a long history of warfare. The historical importance of Koplik owes much to the Malissori tribesmen. Their fierce independent nature insured that Koplik was often embroiled in wars against the Ottomans and the Serbs though much of its history. In the town itself there is a monument commemorating the Battle of Koplik, also known as the Battle of De√ßiq on account of being fought both in Koplik and Tuzi. The battle was a result of a rebellion of Malsori tribesmen led by Ded Gjo Luli of the Traboin-Hoti tribe against Ottoman imperial authority. The battle was a costly victory for the Malsori tribesman. After the first world war and the partition of Malsia e Madhe into two component parts, the area surrounding Tuzi was given to the Kingdom of Montenegro whilst the area around Koplik remained Albanian with Koplik being created the regional capital of Malsia e Madhe. During the Ottoman occupation, many of the inhabitants of the town converted to Islam, although the rural population in Mal√´sia e Madhe continued to be mainly Catholic. The communist regime put heavy restrictions on mobility but after the fall of communism in 1991, Koplik experienced a great influx of new settlers from the countryside. In 1984, Koplik was elevated to city status, with a municipality granted following the first democratic elections on 26 July 1992.  Tourism  Lake Shkod√´r and the mountainous areas of the Mal√´ia e Madhe are recreational areas. Koplik receives hundreds if not thousands of tourists every year. These are however mainly expatriate immigrants returning to see family. Koplik and the surrounding areas have seen investment with a casino as well as restaurants being built to accommodate the increased demand from the tourist influx during the summer months. Koplik is a starting point for hikers wishing to explore the literary famous Malsia e Madhe, translated in English as the \\"Great Highlands\\" which receive much literary attention most famously in the travels of the early female anthropologist Edith Durham in her book High Albania as well as others including Lord Byron, Margaret Hasluck and many native figures. Malsia e Madhe is an area that offers hiking opportunities.  Transport  Roads were poor; however in recent years, government investment has improved the central highway running through the province as well as the asphalting of most village roads. There is no availability to passenger trains from Koplik itself. The main method of public transportation is the use of minibuses on the main highway with one arriving every 3 to 5 minutes on average. Each minibus is usually privately owned and operated so there are no fixed fares as such; passengers are expected to pay the market price depending on the length of journey with the price from Koplik to the village of Dober (about a 2 to 3-mile journey) being around 20 lek.  Economy Koplik is the trading center of Malsia e Madhe. It is generally the place where from the rural villages go for anything from buying household items, clothing and other everyday things to attaining services such as health care, haircuts etc. As a result, Koplik is filled with shops, restaurants and hardware stores as well as Internet cafes and a casino. It has branches from the major banks operating in Albania. It also has a variety of business from a few hunting shops for the purchase of licensed fire arms and ammunition to mobile phone shops, bureau de change to a variety of high-street stores to be found in most major settlements. Further, the main high school for the surrounding villages is located there. As a result of Koplik's trade and administrative center status, it benefits from a constant influx of people from the surrounding area. It is also a transport hub as it is somewhat of a gateway into the deep valleys of Malsia itself and therefore a place of congregation for the various minibuses with at least half a dozen being present there at any time in the day.

Description in Seitz T. pruni L. (73 d). Above in the male with a few anal spots, in the female an anal halfband and sometimes a discal spot brick-red. Beneath the line of white bars is very thin, and the brick-red submarginal band of the hindwing is placed between two rows of black spots, which are thinly edged with bluish white, and is sometimes continued on to the forewing. Throughout Central and South Europe, from the Atlantic coast and Great Britain throughout Europe and Asia to Amurland and Corea; but absent from North Africa and probably also from Japan, the specimens recorded from the latter country presumably belonging to mera or prunoides In ab. fulvior Tutt (particularly females) the forewing bears an orange-yellow discal patch, the rest of the wing being dusted with golden brown. In ab. ptorsas Hfngl. both wings have a reddish yellow submarginal band above; transitional specimens have an incomplete band (ab. progressa, excessa). ab. obsoleta Tutt has no reddish yellow anal spots above, while these spots are pale yellow instead of red in ab. lutea Tutt. A lutea specimen in which the underside is dull and has no black spots on the proximal side of the band on the hindwing has received the name ab. paupera Tutt, and individuals with a broad white macular band on the underside parallel to the outer margin are ab. albofasciata Tutt. ‚Äî Egg quite flat, chagreened, greyish brown, with the top concave; deposited singly or in pairs. Larva woodlouse-shaped, green, with a darker dorsal stripe, at the sides of which there are small brown warts or tubercles; from April till the end of May on Blackthorn and Plumtrees. It has been observed to attack other pruni larvae which had fastened themselves before moulting (Frohawk). Pupa anteriorly somewhat angular, black-brown, with darker markings and a pale saddle-patch, the abdomen being tuberculate and strongly raised, the whole resembling a small bud or bird-droppings. The butterflies appear in June, usually flying singty, being so abundant however in certain years that one can easily obtain several dozen within an hour. At such occasions they fly about the twigs of the food-trees and the undergrowth beneath them; they are very partial to flowering privet.Seitz, A. in Seitz, A. ed. Band 1: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Tagfalter, 1909, 379 Seiten, mit 89 kolorierten Tafeln (3470 Figuren) =Great Britain= It is rare in Great Britain and restricted to a number of sites in the south and east Midlands, between Oxford and Peterborough. The largest breeding colony is in Ham Home-cum-Hamgreen Woods in Buckinghamshire. Historically there have been around 90 known colonies since its discovery in 1828 but there have been many, mostly unsuccessful, introductions at various locations in southern England including one in Surrey in 1952 that seemed to be successful until the habitat was destroyed. It is now one of the rarest butterflies in Great Britain. In June 2018, it was announced that a large population had been discovered in East Sussex, and it was observed in Oxfordshire at a site where it had not been seen since 1988. =Continental Europe= It is found in most countries of continental Europe, except Mediterranean coastal regions. While widespread, the species is local and habitat-dependent. It is declining in the east of the region. =Scandinavia= The black hairstreak is found in the south of Finland and Sweden, and extinct in Denmark. Appearance, behaviour (Great Britain) Note that information on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not be consistent with the species in other parts of its range. Illustration from John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 5 This small brown butterfly is very similar to the white-letter hairstreak but the black hairstreak has a row of orange spots along the edge of the upper-side hindwing. In the female these spots also extend to the forewings. The undersides are similar to the white- letter but the white line tends to be straighter and the orange border extends onto the forewings. The most conclusive way to distinguish the two is by the row of black spots accompanying the orange band which the white-letter hairstreak never has. They spend most of their lives in the canopy or in dense scrub, feeding on honeydew, and very rarely come down to ground level. Life cycle and foodplants Eggs are laid singly on young blackthorn Prunus spinosa growth and it is this stage which hibernates. Although blackthorn is the main foodplant, wild plum Prunus domestica and other Prunus spp are occasionally used. The caterpillar hatches the following spring, at the end of April, just before the buds open and feeds on the flower buds. Older larvae are green and well camouflaged against the leaves on which they feed. Pupation takes place on leaves or twigs in June and the pupae are patterned black and white to mimic a bird dropping, as a defence against being eaten. The adult butterflies of this single-brood (univoltic) species are on the wing from the end of June to mid July.

P. Putnam's Sons is an American book publisher based in New York City, New York. Since 1996, it has been an imprint of the Penguin Group. History The company began as Wiley & Putnam with the 1838 partnership between George Palmer Putnam and John Wiley, whose father had founded his own company in 1807. In 1841, Putnam went to London where he set up a branch office, the first American company ever to do so. In 1848, he returned to New York, where he dissolved the partnership with John Wiley and established G. Putnam Broadway, publishing a variety of works including quality illustrated books. Wiley began John Wiley (later John Wiley and Sons), which is still an independent publisher to the present day. George Palmer Putnam, pictured, partnered with John Wiley in 1838 to form Wiley & Putnam In 1853, G. P. Putnam & Co. started Putnam‚Äôs Magazine with Charles Frederick Briggs as its editor. On George Palmer Putnam's death in 1872, his sons George H., John and Irving inherited the business and the firm's name was changed to G. P. Putnam's Sons.Putnam (2001), p.60 Son George H. Putnam became president of the firm, a position he held for the next fifty-two years. In 1874, the company established its own book printing and manufacturing office, set up by John Putnam and operating initially out of newly leased premises at 182 Fifth Avenue.Putnam (2001), pp.61‚Äì62 This printing side of the business later became a separate division called the Knickerbocker Press, and was relocated in 1889 to the Knickerbocker Press Building, built specifically for the press in New Rochelle, New York.Putnam (2001), p.62 Publisher's ImprintOn the death of George H. Putnam in 1930, the various Putnam heirs voted to merge the firm with Minton, Balch & Co., who became the majority stockholders. George Palmer Putnam's grandson, George P. Putnam (1887‚Äì1950), left the firm at that time. Melville Minton, the partner and sales manager of Minton Balch & Co., became acting president and majority stockholder of the firm until his death in 1956. In 1936, Putnam acquired the publisher Coward-McCann (later Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, after John Geoghegan its long-time chairman), and ran it as an imprint into the 1980s. Upon Melville Minton's death, his son Walter J. Minton took control of the company. In 1965, G. P. Putnam's Sons acquired Berkley Books, a mass market paperback publishing house. MCA bought Putnam Publishing Group and Berkley Publishing Group in 1975. Phyllis E. Grann who was running Pocket Books for Simon & Schuster was brought on board in 1976 as editor-in- chief. Grann worked with MCA executive Stanley Newman on a financial model to make Putnam profitable. This model emphasized publishing key authors annually and took Putnam from $10 million in revenue to over $100 million by 1983. While keeping the list at 75 titles a year, Putnam focused on winners like Tom Clancy whose book Red Storm Rising sold nearly a million copies in 1986. Putnam along with other publishers in the 1980s moved to a heavy discount hardcover model to keep up with demand and sales through bookstore chains and price clubs. Phyllis Grann was promoted to CEO of Putnam in 1987 becoming the first woman to be CEO of a major publishing house. By 1993, the publisher was making $200 million in revenue. In 1982, Putnam acquired the respected children's book publisher, Grosset & Dunlap from Filmways. Also in 1982, Putnam acquired the book publishing division of Playboy Enterprises, which included Seaview Books. In the 1990s ownership of Putnam changed a number of times. MCA was bought by Matsushita Electric in 1990. Then the Seagram Company acquired 80% of MCA from Matsushita and then shortly thereafter Seagram changed the name of the company to Universal Studios, Inc. The new owners had no interest in publishing, but Phyllis Grann stepped in and was able to broker the deal for Putnam to be merged with Penguin Group in 1996, a division of British publishing conglomerate, Pearson PLC Putnam and the Penguin Group formed Penguin Putnam Inc. In 2001, Grann abruptly left after speculation over tensions with Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino. In 2013, Penguin merged with Bertelsmann's Random House, forming Penguin Random House.

Fatal duel  As reported in the Times (London, England) on 2 June 1821, a local surgeon, William Cuddie, was courting Mary, the daughter of the wealthy Brittlebank family of Oddo House in Winster. In May 1821 one of her brothers, William Brittlebank, tried to end their association. On the evening of 21 May Cuddie and Brittlebank quarreled violently. The doctor later received a note: Cuddie refused to reply to the letter. The following afternoon three of the Brittlebank brothers and a mutual friend, Edmund Spencer, arrived in his garden with two loaded pistols. Cuddie reluctantly accepted one of the weapons. William Brittlebank walked away, turned and fired. Two shots were heard but only Cuddie was hit. He died a few hours later. Two of the Brittlebanks (Francis and Andrew) were tried in Derby in August 1821, but were found not guilty of murder, while their brother William, fled with a ¬£100 reward on his head.

He is commonly associated with his time in Denmark he served as Director of the Royal Danish Academy of Art (1754‚Äì71). His most noteworthy work is the equestrian statue Frederik V on Horseback at Amalienborg. Life =Training as a sculptor and early career= He was born in Valenciennes to Fran√ßois Marie Saly (1684‚Äì1776) and his wife Marie-Michelle Jardez (1690‚Äì1760). He began his training as a sculptor at nine years of age under local master Antoine Gilles in Valenciennes from 1726-1727. In spite of his parents' meager income, he was sent to Paris in 1732 to train in the studio of the leading sculptor at Paris, Guillaume Coustou. At the same time he attended the school of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture, winning medals in 1734, 1737 and 1738. Le Faune au chevreau Mus√©e Cognacq-Jay Winning that last medal, first place in the Prix de Rome competition, gave him the right to study at the French Academy at Rome, at the time the single mainstream route to a successful official career as a sculptor in Paris. He first received his stipend in 1740, and he arrived in Rome on 13 October 1740. He stayed there for eight years between 1740‚Äì1748, and lived at the Academy. The goal here was that through the study of antiquities and the masters of the past, one would develop and refine one's artistic taste. More practically it meant making marble copies of Roman sculpture for the French king. In 1742 he made a monumental portrait bust of Manuel Pinto de Fonseca, Grand Master of the Order of Malta. In 1744 he made a bust of a little girl which is one of the most reproduced sculptures from the 18th century. He became one of the first French members of the Accademia degli Arcadi in Rome 1744, and of the Academy of Design at Florence, in 1748, and of the accademia di belli arti, Bologna. =Return to Paris= He traveled back to his home via Naples, Florence and Bologna, and arrived back in Valenciennes in the beginning of March 1749. The works he had sent home had received such positive attention that his hometown commissioned a full standing portrait of King Louis XV from him. The marble statue was erected in 1752, and destroyed in 1792. A plaster bust of Louis XV was also made that same year. He went on to Paris, where he became a member of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1751 with his work Le Faune au chevreau. He was assistant professor at the Acad√©mie 1751-1753. He exhibited at the Paris Salons, 1750-1751 and 1753.He created a plaster bust of Madame de Pompadour in 1752, and a statue of Amor for her the next year. Jacque Saly's monumental sculpture of Frederik V on Horseback at Amalienborg Castle in Copenhagen, Denmark. =Summons to Denmark= In 1752 Saly was commissioned to create a sculpture of King Frederick V of Denmark on horseback to be placed in the center of the courtyard of Amalienborg Palace. The equestrian statue was commissioned by Adam Gottlob Moltke, head of the Danish Asiatic Company, as a gift to the king. But while Moltke's company offered to finance the statue, it was the government, however, who chose the sculptor. Count Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff wrote to the Danish Legation secretary to the French Court in Paris Justitsr√•d Joachim Wasserschlebe to find a suitable French sculptor. Sculptor Edm√© Bouchardon rejected the offer, but suggested Saly, who wanted a significant sum for the model and free housing in Copenhagen. The government concluded the contract with Saly in Spring 1752, but due to conflict with ongoing projects Saly did not arrive in Denmark until 8 October 1753, bringing with him his parents, his two sisters and at least one assistant, Journ√©e, along with his family. Work began on the monument that same year. =In Copenhagen: The Academy= During the same period of time the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) was officially established with offices at Charlottenborg, on Frederik V's birthday, 31 March 1754. Saly gave the main speech at the event, a snub to the current Academy Director architect Nicolai Eigtved. Saly was made member of the Academy; was named professor, and received a residence at Charlottenborg. Several months later after Eigtved died suddenly on 7 July 1754, Saly was named Eigtved's successor; he served as Director of the Academy from 25 July 1754 to 15 July 1771, and he was given a lifelong yearly pension in 1760. Saly worked hard to improve the Danish Academy after the model of the French Academy. He sought to bring about these changes, all the while working on his model of the equestrian statue for the king, the primary artistic work associated with his many years in Denmark. Saly was also instrumental in bringing his friend from the French Academy and the years in Italy, fellow-countryman and architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin, to the attention of King Frederik V as the suitable choice to replace Nicolai Eigtved for the design and building of Frederik's Church (Frederikskirke), now known as The Marble Church (Marmorkirken), work on which had had begun in 1749. A contract to bring Jardin to Denmark was concluded on 12 October 1754, a few months after Eigtved's death, and Jardin took over Eigtved's professorship at the Academy. J.M. Preisler's engraving of Saly's equestrian sculpture of Frederik V on horseback. 1768-69. L'Amour de Saly acquired by the Louvre Museum in 2016 =In Copenhagen: The King and his statue= Saly showed the king the first sketch of the equestrian statue on 4 December 1754. The king approved a sketch for the whole monument in August 1755. Then Saly began a thorough study of horses from the king's stalls. This resulted in a little model, which he showed the king in November 1758. Casts of this model are found in both the collection of the Academy and the State Collection, now the Danish National Gallery. Saly also sculpted around this same time a life-size bust of the king, of which seven bronze casts were created, and a sculpture of Moltke, the head of the Asiatic Company, of which three bronze casts were created. Saly, after having set up an appropriate studio, carried out the work on the large model of the equestrian statue 1761-1763, and the plaster cast was presented to the Academy members on 3 February 1764. The king also saw this model. Preparations for the bronze casting took four more years, and Frenchman Pierre Gors did the casting on 2 March 1768. 1768 is officially considered the statue's completion date. Johan Martin Preisler made a large engraving of the equestrian statue 1768-1769 in commemoration of its completion, and The Danish Asiatic Company cast two medallions, one by Wulff and the other by Daniel Jensen Adzer. The base for the statue, however, was first deliverable in 1770, and the unveiling of the equestrian statue finally took place in the courtyard at Amalienborg Palace on 1 August 1771, five years after the King's death in 1766. It commands the site still to this day, and has been restored 1997-1998. =The end of his days in Copenhagen= Equestrian monument (detail) Saly held the post of Academy Director until 15 July 1771, two weeks before the equestrian statue's unveiling. He quit in protest over a new set of rules that gave increased influence to native-born Danes. This all occurred during the oppressive reign of Johann Friedrich Struensee, Saly was named Knight of the Order of St Michel in Paris, but was not allowed to bear the title while living in Denmark. Saly, although no longer Director of the Academy, kept the apartment at Charlottenborg, from 1771 to at least 1774. During this time he tried to justify an additional sum from the Danish Asiatic Company for his extraordinary services on the monument to Frederik V, considering how much longer the statue took to complete than originally planned. He was not satisfied with the conclusion of his financial negotiations. =Return to Paris= He left for Paris along with his father on 2 July 1774; most of the other family members had died by this point. One of his two sisters had married a French sea officer in Danish service. Back in Paris in 1775 he could now bear the title of Knight. He was named Senior Professor at the French Academy in Paris 29 July 1775. Already seriously ill when he left Denmark, he died on 4 May 1776. He was buried at Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois. Legacy Young Girl. Marble bust, (1770-1790), Victoria and Albert Museum, London His artistic achievements are overshadowed by the monumental effort to create the equestrian statue of Frederik V of Denmark under the king's absolute rule. Saly's leading role at the Danish Academy of Art, during its early years helped establish the Academy as a force in art training not only in Scandinavia, but in Europe, and led the way to an emerging and strong Danish artist tradition. In addition to the other Academy memberships already mentioned, Saly was also member of the academies in Marseilles (1762) and St. Petersburg (1768). His sculptures are in the collections of the National Gallery of Denmark (Copenhagen), National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), Mus√©e du Louvre (Paris), Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts (Valenciennes, France) J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles, California), as well as in private collections.

He first started playing guitar as a teenager in the late 1970s. With brother Hamish he formed The Clean, a group that went on to become one of the most popular and most respected bands in New Zealand. Early life and family Born in Ranfurly, Kilgour is the son of McGregor Kilgour and Helen Stewart Kilgour (n√©e Auld). He was educated at Otago Boys' High School from 1974 to 1976. The Clean and The Great Unwashed The Clean are recognised as one of the founders of the New Zealand independent rock scene and a pivotal band in the development of the Dunedin sound, which was centred on the Flying Nun record label and produced other acts including The Verlaines, The Chills, Straitjacket Fits, The Bats (which included The Clean bassist Robert Scott) and the Tall Dwarfs. The Clean broke up in the early 1980s, and David Kilgour proceeded to form and play with other bands such as Stephen and The Great Unwashed. The Clean reformed in 1989 and produced the album Vehicle. Solo career In 1991, Kilgour struck out on his own and recorded his first solo CD, Here Come The Cars, which received much critical acclaim. 1994 showcased the release of his second solo lp, Sugar Mouth. In 1995 he released First Steps and False Alarms, a compilation of recordings & demos, so called the 'best of the worst',done between the late 80s and early 90s. In 1997 he recorded his 3rd lp David Kilgour and The Heavy Eights, made with the help of several other notable Dunedinites such as Martin Phillipps from The Chills. In late 2000, after a four-year hiatus, The Clean reformed again to record Getaway, only their fourth full-length LP‚Äîalong with Vehicle, Modern Rock (1994) and Unknown Country (1996)‚Äîin their 20+ year history. Kilgour has come to be known as one of the most respected and admired songwriters of his generation and certainly one of the greatest rock musicians to come out of New Zealand. His signature guitar twang and languid, carefree melodies are readily identifiable. His more obvious influences include Bob Dylan and Lou Reed, with other, less obvious influences including Brian Eno, to whom an instrumental on First Steps and False Alarms is dedicated. In the 2001 New Year Honours, Kilgour was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music. That same year, he released his 4th solo LP, A Feather In The Engine, hailed by many as his best work yet. His current U.S. label, Merge, describes it as \\"pure psychedelic pop bliss\\". In 2004, his fifth solo album Frozen Orange was released on Arch Hill Recordings (NZ) and Merge Records (USA). For Frozen Orange, Kilgour left his native New Zealand and recorded in Nashville with members of Lambchop and Jason Loewenstein of Sebadoh, along with his longtime backing band The Heavy Eights, consisting of Taane Tokona, Alan Haig, Tony De Raad and Thomas Bell. The album also marked the first recording that Kilgour did not produce himself, a task left to Mark Nevers (producer / engineer of Lambchop). Kilgour released his sixth solo album, The Far Now, on 5 February 2007 on Arch Hill/Remote Control (NZ/Australia) and Merge (USA). The new album was recorded in Kilgour's hometown of Dunedin with his backing band The Heavy Eights. Recording of the album was split into two parts, with some songs laid down in winter 2004 at the Tinshed, and the rest between 2005 and 2006 at Studio One.

The UDMA reflected the change in Abbas' point of view. He considered that after the failure of the implementation of significant reform, the assimilation of the Algerian people into France as French citizens was no longer a viable alternative. He then advocated an autonomous state within the French framework; no longer would Algeria be considered a province of France; rather it would be an autonomous state within the French federalist system. UDMA won the elections to the Constituent Assembly in June 1946, by gaining 11 of the 13 seats devoted to the colonized population of Algeria. After 1948, fraud in the elections prevented nationalist parties from any significant success in the elections. Nevertheless, the UDMA took part in the electoral campaign. After the creation of the FLN (National Liberation Front) and the beginning of the War for Independence, negotiations took place to discuss the UDMA's merging with the FLN. In the end, it was decided that the UDMA, like the Algerian Communist Party, would dissolve and that its members would individually join the FLN. Ferhat Abbas and Ahmed Francis, two of the most prominent party leaders, fled to Cairo and joined the FLN leadership. Sources *Tlemcani, Rachid, State and Revolution in Algeria.

It is semi-automated process which means that it needs some human assistance in order to function properly. Search engines have many different algorithms and ranking factors that they use when measuring the quality of webpages. TrustRank is one of them. Because manual review of the Internet is impractical and very expensive, TrustRank was introduced in order to help achieve this task much faster and cheaper. It was first introduced by researchers Zoltan Gyongyi and Hector Garcia-Molina of Stanford University and Jan Pedersen of Yahoo! in their paper \\"Combating Web Spam with TrustRank\\" in 2004. Today, this algorithm is a part of major web search engines like Yahoo! and Google. One of the most important factors that help web search engine determine the quality of a web page when returning results are backlinks. Search engines take a number and quality of backlinks into consideration when assigning a place to a certain web page in SERPs. Many web spam pages are created only with the intention of misleading search engines. These pages, chiefly created for commercial reasons, use various techniques to achieve higher-than-deserved rankings in the search engines' result pages. While human experts can easily identify spam, search engines are still being improved daily in order to do it without help of humans. One popular method for improving rankings is to increase the perceived importance of a document through complex linking schemes. Google's PageRank and other search ranking algorithms have been subjected to such manipulation. TrustRank seeks to combat spam by filtering the web based upon reliability. The method calls for selecting a small set of seed pages to be evaluated by an expert. Once the reputable seed pages are manually identified, a crawl extending outward from the seed set seeks out similarly reliable and trustworthy pages. TrustRank's reliability diminishes with increased distance between documents and the seed set. The logic works in the opposite way as well, which is called Anti-Trust Rank. The closer a site is to spam resources, the more likely it is to be spam as well. The researchers who proposed the TrustRank methodology have continued to refine their work by evaluating related topics, such as measuring spam mass.

It was an 0-2-2WT locomotive and is now regarded as the first tank engine. It had a unique design of boiler and a number of other novel design features (perhaps explaining the choice of name). Unfortunately, several of the major components had significant design weaknesses which ultimately resulted in its failure at the Trials.  Novelty in the Rainhill Trials  = Ericsson and Braithwaite Partnership = Transport Museum in Nuremberg during the exhibition \\"Adler, Rocket and Co.\\" During the late 1820s Ericsson and Braithwaite were working together building horse drawn fire engines with steam pumps. These used a boiler designed by Ericsson and were built in the London works of John Braithwaite. These fire engines were known for their ability to raise steam quickly and looked very similar to Novelty. Charles Vignoles has also been associated with Novelty, but his practical involvement is not known. He may have aligned himself with the engine because of a continuing feud with George Stephenson. = Building the Engine = It is said that Ericsson and Braithwaite only found out about the Rainhill Trials seven weeks before the event was due to take place, when Ericsson received a letter from a friend referring to a \\"Steam Race\\". This incredibly short space of time has led people to suggest that Novelty is in fact a converted fire engine. It is more likely that it used many of the same parts as their fire engines and these parts may even have been built for an existing order and diverted to Novelty. Novelty was constructed in the London Workshop belonging to Braithwaite and transported to Liverpool by boat. There was no time to test Novelty in London before transportation, and following test runs at Rainhill before the trials, modifications were carried out with the help of Timothy Hackworth. = The Boiler = Section through the boiler, firebox to the right The boiler used on Novelty was designed by John Ericsson. The design was very scientific for the era but proved to be very hard to build and maintain compared with the boiler design adopted for Rocket and most steam locomotives since. The most prominent feature for the boiler is the vertical copper firebox (the large vessel to the right in the illustration here). Within the vertical vessel was the inner firebox and the space between the two was filled with water (to a level just about the same as the driver‚Äôs ankle). (Coke) fuel was added from the top, where a tube passed down through the top of the firebox. This firebox construction was not dissimilar to some types of vertical boiler, but this was only part of Ericsson‚Äôs design. Like George Stephenson, Ericsson understood that a large area was needed to extract heat from the hot gases. This he did in a long horizontal tube filled with water which ran under the full length of the engine. It can be seen in the illustration on top of this page, sticking out to the right, with the vertical chimney attached to it. Within the horizontal section was a tube carrying the hot gases, this formed an ‚ÄòS‚Äô shape so the gases made three passes through the water. This ‚ÄòS‚Äô shaped tube was also tapered causing the gases to speed up as they cooled down. In practice this tube is almost impossible to clean. The resulting boiler was the shape of a hammer and was required to be fitted to the frame before the footplate, cylinders or blower could be added. The boiler used a ‚ÄòForced Draught‚Äô provided by a mechanical blower (the triangular structure on the right in the illustration). This forced air along a pipe and into the sealed ashpan (below the fire). Very few steam locomotives have ever used a forced draught like this, the main reason is that in order to add fuel either the draft must be stopped or some form of airlock fitted. Novelty used an airlock to feed the fuel in, but there was still a chance of flame and hot gases being blown into the face of the fireman. The blower was driven from the rods linking the cylinders to the wheels, thus the draught was proportional to the speed of the engine, not to how hard it is working as with a blastpipe. It is assumed that either the blower was worked by hand when the engine was standing or the drive wheels were lifted off the rails. Details of the blower design are not known for certain. Water was forced into the boiler using a pump driven off one of the cylinders (this was normal practice at the time). = Drive to the Wheels = At this time, engineers were worried about uneven wear on pistons and cylinders when they were mounted horizontally, so most were mounted vertically, but vertical cylinders driving directly on the wheels (as on Sans Pareil) caused problems with poor riding and did not work well with the springs. Cylinder on replica of Novelty On Novelty, the cylinders were mounted vertically towards the rear of the engine (to the right of the men in the illustration). Directly below were bell cranks which changed the drive to horizontal. Connecting rods linked the bell cranks to the crank axle (the axle on the left in the illustration). The valve gear took a similar route to the drive. One effect of this was it had many pins and links, resulting in lost motion. The wheels themselves were of the suspension type (similar to a bicycle wheel). It is easy to think that Novelty is an 0-4-0 locomotive as it had equal sized wheels, however is actually an 0-2-2WT. Only the wheels under the firebox (those to the left on the illustration here) were driven, the other wheels were not normally connected to the drive, although they could be coupled by a chain 'when necessary'.Wood, Nicholas; A Treatise on Railroads (1838) = The first tank locomotive = Novelty was the first tank locomotive as it carried its water in a well tank between its wheels. As one of the rules for the Rainhill Trials related to the weight of the engine without a tender, a special allowance had to be made for Novelty. = Performance in the Trials = Novelty was the crowd‚Äôs favourite to win the Trials. This may be because it looked like a steam carriage (which people associated with speed and improvements in transport) or it may be because it did not look like a typical colliery engine of the time. In the demonstration runs that took place on the first day of the trials, Novelty did not disappoint, managing a speed of around In the preparations for the trials, Novelty was shown to be very lightweight and very quick to raise steam. Novelty was the first locomotive to be tested. Starting on the second day of the trials, it began the planned series of runs but very quickly the blower failed and repairs had to be made. The repairs took up all of the next day. However, when Novelty next ran the water feed pipe burst and more repairs had to be made, which seem to have included a seal on the boiler. At the time, the boilers were sealed with a cement-like substance which required days - if not weeks - to set properly. Time would not allow this and the seal quickly failed once the trial runs were restarted. The recurring boiler problems prompted Ericsson and Braithwaite to withdraw from the Trials. Before it failed, the Stephensons were said to be seriously worried by Novelty, as it was well-suited to meet the conditions of the trial. For one thing the Stephensons considered the weight to be pulled to be too light for a practical railway.  After the Rainhill Trials  Full- size model that includes parts from the original Novelty Once all the repairs were completed, Novelty made a number of successful demonstration runs but it was too late to have any effect on the competition. It is sometimes claimed that one of these demonstration runs included the locomotive reaching a speed of , but there is little to back this up and it may be a misinterpretation of a newspaper report trying to give an impression of the great speeds that the Rainhill engines were achieving. Two further engines were built by Ericsson and Braithwaite named William IV and Queen Adelaide. These were generally larger and more robust than Novelty and differed in a number of details (for example, it is thought that a different design of blower was used which was an ‚ÄòInduced Draught‚Äô type, sucking the gases from the fire). The pair ran trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway but the railway declined to purchase the new designs. Novelty was transferred to the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway and worked there for a few years. During its time there (around 1833) it received new cylinders and a new boiler. Somehow, all the wheels and both cylinders (assumed to be the original one not those from the 1833 rebuild) survived. During 1929 the original wheels and one cylinder were incorporated into a full scale, non-working model that is now on display in the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. This early replica was rebuilt in 1988 and currently includes batteries and an electric motor to allow it to move (all wheels are driven making the engine a 4wBE), although the steam components are non-functional. The other cylinder is on display at Rainhill Public Library. No other British locomotives are known to have been built in this style. Comparisons are made with 20th-century vertical-boilered engines, such as those by Sentinel of Shrewsbury, but in fact the principles were very different.  The Replica  For the Rocket 150 event in 1980, a completely new replica of Novelty was constructed by Locomotion Enterprises in the Springwell Workshop of the Bowes Railway. It was a fully working replica that was built to look correct when display at the planned event. However, many changes were made to reduce the construction costs and meet modern standards. It has been suggested that the replica was built to last no longer than the three days of the Rocket 150 event. Some of the differences between the original and replica are: * Carbon steel used instead of wrought iron :Wrought iron was no longer commercially produced, while carbon steel was understood by every commercial fabricator. * Boiler built from welded steel instead of copper :A copper boiler would have been very expensive in materials and would have needed specialist skills while welded steel had much in common with industrial pressure vessels. * Blower built from plywood and painted copper colour :The blower is likely to have been the subject of development work, plywood being much cheaper and easier to work with. Additionally few people would get close enough to tell the difference. * Handbrake fitted to act on both wheels :This may have been fitted after the ‚ÄòRocket 150‚Äô event. * Boiler fitted with gauge glass and Bourdon pressure gauge :Requirements for any steam boiler, vital if the engine was to be operated safely. * Safety valve is \\"pop\\" type rather than \\"dead weight\\". :Firstly the pop valves were a type used in industry; secondly the dead-weight type could be held down (so it would never work properly); and thirdly a dead-weight valve tends to bounce and thus waste steam. * The boiler of the replica contains approximately twice the volume of water :This is mainly as a result of the construction methods used (flanged joints on the barrels and standard steel pipe for the flue tube). It is also gave bigger water spaces between the inside and outside plates. In consequence, the fire grate must have been considerably smaller than on the original. For a reason that is not fully understood, the wheels of the replica were built with very narrow treads. It is possible that wheels were scaled off a model in the London Science Museum. As a result, it was unable to travel over modern pointwork. During the Rocket 150 event, Novelty was carried on a Well wagon, supported in such a way as to allow the engine to be run and its wheels to rotate freely. Following the Rocket 150 event, Novelty was steamed on a small number of occasions in Manchester. Around 1982, it was sold to the Swedish Railway Museum, G√§vle, and left the UK. Replica of Novelty at Manchester, September 2005 During July 2002, Novelty was collected from its then home in the Angelholm, for use in a TV programme. It was returned to Sweden during the spring of 2003, but made a short visit to the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester during the autumn of 2005. It also made a short visit to the Nuremberg Transport Museum in 2010. = 2002 Restaging ‚Äì The Television Programme = For the BBC TV programme Timewatch ‚Äì Rocket and its Rivals the replica of Novelty was transported to the National Railway Museum in York. Here it was completely dismantled to allow examination of the boiler and working parts. Several items needed to be attended to before the locomotive could be run: * Full boiler inspection for insurance purposes * Minor boiler repairs * Modifications to the wheels to allow safe operation on normal railways * Cleaning and repainting of the water tank * Releasing of several water valves that had seized * Partial repaint Of this work, the major item was the modification of the wheels. The solution adopted by the National Railway Museum Workshop was to employ a metal fabricator to cut four rings from 40-mm-thick steel plate. These were cut with enough precision not to need any further machining. The rings were then bolted to the existing wheels and were a complete success. Following re-assembly, the locomotive was steam tested at York before transport to Carrog station on the Llangollen Railway. Early tests showed up two major problems: firstly the linkage to the blower was not strong enough, and secondly operating the water feed pump caused very serious priming of the boiler. It was later shown that the feed pump was five times the size of that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming. To fully recreate the Rainhill Trials, 20 return runs along a section of the Llangollen Railway were required (between Carrog and Glyndyfrdwy stations). Novelty was only able to complete 10 runs before the fire became completely filled with clinker. The inability to clear clinker from the fire in this type of boiler was a major problem, the only way being to drop the fire completely and start again. During the runs for the restaging of the trials Novelty was run with an electric fan (powered by a petrol generator) in place of the blower. Even allowing for this in the final calculation Novelty was much more efficient than Sans Pareil For the Restaging, the replica of Novelty was too slow to meet the requirements of the original trials and did not complete the course. The maximum speed attained at any point was , possibly because the main steam pipe from the boiler was restricting the flow to the cylinders. The valve gear was also set incorrectly (indicated by the odd noise of the exhaust beats). With all the obvious differences between the original and the replica, added to the fact that the locomotive crew used had only four days experience of operating the locomotive, it cannot be said that in this restaging of the trial the replica of Novelty gave the performance that the original could have achieved if more time had been made available in 1829.  Other locomotives named Novelty  Excluding the original and the replicas, the following locomotives have carried the name Novelty: * LNWR Newton Class no. 1682, built May 1868, replaced June 1892; * LNWR Improved Precedent class no. 1682, built June 1892, scrapped July 1928; * LMS Royal Scot Class no. 6127, built 1927 (renamed in June 1936); * LMS Jubilee Class no. 5733, built November 1936, withdrawn September 1964; * British Rail Class 86, no. 86 235 (ex-E3194), built 1965, named to commemorate Rocket 150, (later renamed).

Ulf was the father of King Sweyn II of Denmark and thus the progenitor of the House of Estridsen, which would rule Denmark from 1047 to 1375, which was also sometimes, specially in Swedish sources, referred to as the Ulfinger dynasty to honor him. Biography Ulf Jarl was the son of Danish chieftain Thorgils Sprakal√§gg. His brother Eilaf was an earl of King Cnut the Great and his sister Gytha Thorkelsd√≥ttir married Godwin, Earl of Wessex. In 1016, he participated in Cnut the Great's invasion of England. He participated in the conquest of England as one of Cnut's most trusted men. From c. 1024 he was appointed the Jarl of Denmark and King Cnut's appointee as regent of Denmark. In the absence of King Cnut, he ruled as the foster-father and guardian of Cnut's son Harthacnut. In 1015‚Äì16, he married Cnut's sister, Estrid Svendsdatter of Denmark, by whom he had sons, Svein, who later became the king of Denmark, and Beorn (Bj√∏rn), who would become an Earl in England. Chronicler Adam of Bremen also gives Ulf a son, √Ösbj√∏rn, but does not explicitly name him as son of Estrith, as he does with Svein and Beorn. There may have also been a daughter - Harald Hardr√•des saga, part of Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson gives an account of √Ösmund, son of Svein's sister, yet he is likely the same √Ösmund named as son of Beorn in Morkinskinna. P. A. Munch (1855), Det Norske Folks Historie, vol. 5, no. 5, p. 287 In 1026, Swedish King Anund Jakob and Norwegian King Olaf II took advantage of King Cnut's absence and launched an attack on the Danish in the Baltic Sea. Ulf convinced the freemen to elect Harthacnut king, since they were discontented at Cnut's absenteeism. This was a ruse on Ulf's part since his role as Harthacnut's guardian would make him the ruler of Denmark. When Cnut learnt what had happened, he returned to Denmark and fought naval engagement against the Swedish and Norwegian forces at the Battle of the Helge√•. The victory left Cnut as the dominant leader in Scandinavia. Ulf Jarl (Nordisk familjebok. 1920) The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which instead places the battle a year earlier in 1025, names the leaders of the Swedes as Ulf and Eglaf, usually identified with Ulf Jarl and his brother Eilaf. Saxo likewise would have Ulf fighting Cnut at Helge√•. However Saga of Olaf the Holy in the Heimskringla gives an account in which while Cnut lost the land battle, he was the overall victor when Ulf helped him win the accompanying sea battle. One possible explanation for this conflict of sources is that Ulf fought with the Swedes against Cnut in a 1025 battle not recounted by the saga because Olaf did not take part, but Ulf switched sides before the battle at Helge√•. A. S. Napier and W. H. Stevenson, eds. (1895), \\"The Crawford Collection of Early Charters and Documents\\", Anecdota Oxoniensia Mediaeval and Modern Series, Part VII, pp. 139-140. If Eilaf fought against Cnut, he was forgiven as he was retained as Earl in England until Cnut's death, and then fled, suggesting he was closely linked to the king.M. K. Lawson, Cnut: England's Viking King (2004), p. 94, says that the identification of the Ulf of Helge√• with the husband of Estrith (Estrid) (and thus by implication, Eglaf with Eilaf) is commonly made but not certain. Any rapprochement with Ulf was short-lived. At a banquet in Roskilde, the two brothers-in-law were playing chess and started arguing with each other. The next day, the Christmas of 1026, Cnut had one of his housecarls kill Earl Ulf in Trinity Church, the predecessor of Roskilde Cathedral.Havhingsten fra Glendalough: The battle of the throne of England References Other sources *Lawson, M.

Ross (born Joseph Roszawikz, March 15, 1914 ‚Äì August 13, 1982) was an American actor known for his trademark \\"Ooh! Ooh!\\" exclamation, which he used in many of his roles. He starred in such TV sitcoms as The Phil Silvers Show and Car 54, Where Are You?. Career Ross was born on March 15, 1914 to Jewish immigrant parents in New York, New York. He dropped out of Seward Park High School at age 16 to become a singing waiter at the Van Cortlandt Inn in the Bronx. When the cafe added a female dancer and singer, Ross was promoted to announcer. He added some jokes and became a comedian. In 1938, he appeared at the Queens Terrace, near Jackson Heights, New York. Jackie Gleason had already been playing there for 16 weeks, and the manager was about to ask Gleason to stay a while longer. Ross heard of the opening, auditioned for it, got the contract, and also stayed 16 weeks. Ross then turned burlesque comic on the Schuster circuit out of Chicago. His career was interrupted by World War II. He served in the United States Army Air Corps at Camp Blanding, Florida, before being stationed in England. Discharged at the war's end, Ross became an announcer-comic at Billy Gray's Band Box in Hollywood. He kept his ties to burlesque, and appeared in Irving Klaw's feature-length theatrical film Teaserama (1955), a re-creation of a burlesque show. In 1955, Ross worked at a nightclub in Miami Beach called Ciro's.Miami Beach \\"Ciro's\\"Nightclubs: Long Ago On Miami Beach, \\"Ciro's: At Alton Road and Dade Boulevard\\" He was spotted by Nat Hiken and Phil Silvers, who were planning You'll Never Get Rich (later known as The Phil Silvers Show and sometimes Sgt. Bilko) and loved Ross's comedy skills. Ross was hired on the spot and cast as the mess sergeant, Rupert Ritzik. Joe E. Ross (left) doing part of a routine with Dave Starr in 1955. Ross made Ritzik memorable. Ritzik was henpecked, dumb, and greedy, always an easy mark for Bilko's schemes. Whenever Ritzik had a sudden inspiration, he would hesitate and stammer \\"Ooh! Ooh!\\" before articulating his idea. The catch phrase came from the actor's own frustration when he couldn't remember his lines. Silvers would deliberately stray from the scripted dialogue and give Ross the wrong cues, prompting a genuinely confused reaction and an agonized \\"Ooh! Ooh!\\" from Ross. After The Phil Silvers Show ended in 1959, Nat Hiken went on to produce Car 54, Where Are You? and cast Joe E. Ross as Patrolman Gunther Toody of New York's 53rd Precinct. Fred Gwynne, another Bilko alumnus, played Toody's partner, Francis Muldoon. Toody could usually be counted on at some point to say \\"Ooh! Ooh!\\", or \\"Do you mind? Doyoumind?\\". Ross became so identified with his policeman role that he recorded an album of songs entitled \\"Love Songs from a Cop\\". Roulette Records released the LP in 1964. Ross did the voice for Toody for the episode \\"Car 54\\" of Hanna-Barbera's Wait Till Your Father Gets Home, in which Toody and Muldoon moonlight running a day care center and one of the children turns up missing. Ross also starred as Gronk in Sherwood Schwartz's ill-fated 1966 sitcom It's About Time, which featured two 1960s American astronauts who were thrown back in time to the prehistoric era. Following the breakup of Allen & Rossi in 1968, Steve Rossi teamed for less than three months with Ross in an act called \\"Rossi & Ross\\".\\"Obiturary for Steve Rossi,\\" Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2014 by Harris M.

Ross also was a prominent cartoon voice into the 1970s, playing the stereotypical bumbling sergeant in many cartoons such as Hong Kong Phooey (as Sgt. Flint) and Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! (as Botch). He also voiced Roll on CB Bears segment Shake, Rattle and Roll. His \\"Ooh! Ooh!\\" phrase was emulated by Frank Welker in the animated series Fangface and Norm Prescott as Theodore H. Bear in The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckles Quacula episodes.

A headphone amplifier is a low- powered audio amplifier designed particularly to drive headphones worn on or in the ears, instead of loudspeakers in speaker enclosures. Most commonly, headphone amplifiers are found embedded in electronic devices that have a headphone jack, such as integrated amplifiers, portable music players (e.g., iPods), and televisions. However, standalone units are used, especially in audiophile markets and in professional audio applications, such as music studios. Headphone amplifiers are available in consumer-grade models used by hi-fi enthusiasts and audiophiles and professional audio models, which are used in recording studios. Consumer models 6922 vacuum tubes (electronic valves) Consumer headphone amplifiers are commercially available separate devices, sold to a niche audiophile market of hi-fi enthusiasts. These devices allow for higher possible volumes and superior current capacity compared to the smaller, less expensive headphone amplifiers that are used in most audio players. In the case of the extremely high-end electrostatic headphones, such as the Stax SR-007, a specialized electrostatic headphone amplifier or transformer step-up box and power amplifier is required to use the headphones, as only a dedicated electrostatic headphone amplifier or transformer can provide the voltage levels necessary to drive the headphones. Most headphone amplifiers provide power between 10 mW and 2 W depending on the specific headphone being used and the design of the amplifier. Certain high power designs can provide up to 6W of power into low impedance loads, although the benefit of such power output with headphones is unclear, as the few orthodynamic headphones that have sufficiently low sensitivities to function with such power levels will reach dangerously high volume levels with such amplifiers. Effectively, a headphone amplifier is a small power amplifier that can be connected to a standard headphone jack or the line output of an audio source. Electrically, a headphone amplifier can be thought of as an amplifier that presents a very high input impedance (ideally infinite) and presents a lower output impedance (ideally zero) and larger range of output voltages (ideally infinite). This allows headphones of a low sensitivity to be driven louder as a result of the extra voltage provided by the amplifier. There are potential fidelity gains if headphones are driven with lower distortion than using a headphone amplifier integrated into a general purpose audio product. In practice, this most often occurs when using low impedance headphones with consumer electronics with insufficiently low output impedance (see impedance discussion below). = Volume = A hybrid headphone amplifier with the chassis cover removed. Most headphone amplifiers support a higher voltage output and therefore higher power (volume) levels. Whereas most portable electronics are powered by a 1.8, 2.5 or 3.3 Vpp supply, many headphone amplifiers use 10, 18 or 24 Vpp supplies, allowing 5-20 dB higher volume. If a pair of headphones is too quiet, adding an amplifier that can output higher voltage/power will increase its volume. = Output impedance = Many headphone amplifiers have an output impedance in the range of 0.5 - 50 Ohms. The 1996 IEC 61938 standard recommended an output impedance of 120 Ohms, but in practice this is rarely used and not recommended with modern headphones. High output impedance can result in frequency response fluctuations, due to varying load impedance at different frequencies. In 2008 Stereophile Magazine published an article that showed that a 120-Ohm output impedance could cause a 5-dB error in frequency response with certain types of headphones. However, the author of the article also states: \\"The ramifications for subjective assessment of headphones are more troublesome because it is usually unclear what assumptions the manufacturer has made regarding source impedance.\\" Howard 2008, p. 4. http://www.stereophile.com/features/808head/index.html More importantly, low output impedance can reduce distortion by improving the control that the source has over the transducer. This is often expressed as damping factor, with higher damping factors greatly reducing distortion. One company shows a 45 dB improvement in THD+N at 30 Hz for their low-impedance amplifier compared to a 30-ohm amplifier. For example, a 32 Œ© headphone driven by a headphone amp with a <1 Œ© output impedance would have a damping factor of >32, whereas the same headphone driven with an iPod touch 3G (7 Œ© output impedance) would have a damping factor of just 4.6. If the 120 ohms recommendation is applied, the damping factor would be an unacceptably low 0.26 and consequently distortion would be significantly higher. Conversely, the same iPod touch driving a pair of 120 ohm headphones would have a respectable damping factor of 17.1, and would most likely not benefit from the addition of a lower impedance headphone amplifier. In addition to output impedance, other specifications are relevant to choosing a headphone amplifier ‚Äî THD, frequency response, IMD, output power, minimum load impedance, and other measurements are also significant. However, most of these will be improved by lowering output impedance and hence improving damping factor. = DIY approach = For those who are electronically inclined, the low-power and fairly simple nature of the headphone amplifier has made it a popular DIY project. There are many designs for headphone amplifiers posted on the Internet varying considerably in complexity and cost. A key example is the simple opamp-based CMoy design, one of the most popular headphone amplifier designs available. The simplicity of the CMoy makes it an easy build, while it can be made small enough to fit inside a tin of breath mints (including batteries). On the other hand, it is often built using op-amps that are not designed to drive loads with as low an impedance as headphones, leading to poor performance and audible differences between op-amps that would not exist in a good design.Op Amps: Myths & Facts- \\"Some op amps have been judged in the wrong applications. The Cmoy headphone amp is just such an example...\\" = Crossfeed and other audio processing = Crossfeeding blends the left and right stereo channels slightly, reducing the extreme channel separation which is characteristic of headphone listening in older stereo recordings, and is known to cause headaches in a small fraction of listeners. Crossfeed also improves the soundstage characteristics and makes the music sound more natural, as if one was listening to a pair of speakers. While some swear by crossfeed, many prefer amplifiers without it. The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) technology led a number of manufacturers to introduce amplifiers with 'headphone virtualization' features. In principle, the DSP chips allow the two-driver headphone to simulate a full Dolby 5.1 (or more) surround system. When the sounds from the two headphone drivers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate the source of a sound. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine as they do with crossfeed, the illusion of sound directionality is created. Professional audio models Distribution headphone amp - front panel Distribution headphone amp - back panel In pro-audio terminology, a headphone amplifier is a device that allows multiple headsets to be connected to one or more audio sources (typically balanced audio sources) at the same time to monitor sounds during a recording session, either singing or playing from the \\"live room\\" or recorded tracks. Headphone amps enable singers and musicians to be able to hear other musicians who are playing in isolation booths. They also enable audio engineers and record producers to monitor a live performance or live tracking. Headphone amps with sub-mixing capabilities allow the listener to adjust, mix and monitor audio signals coming from multiple sources at the same time. This kind of headphone amp is often utilized during recording sessions to sub-mix playback of individual stem-mixes or instruments coming from a mixing board or a playback device. In many cases the listeners have their own sets of controls allowing them to adjust various aspects of the mix and individual and global parameters such as channel level, global loudness, bass and treble. Distribution headphone amplifiers are specialized headphone amps allowing a single signal to be fed to multiple headsets or multiple groups of multiple headsets at the same time. Many distribution headphone amps, like the one shown here, can be cascaded by connecting the audio input of one of the amps to the cascading output, marked \\"THRU\\", of another amp. There are also various other combinations of pro-audio headphone amps with simultaneous sub-mixing and distribution capabilities.

Places of interest  *The Retreat BuildingWithout fear of favour An autobiography. Author: Joginder Singh is the official summer residence of the President of India. Entry to this building is by permission only. The President visits Mashobra at least once every year, and during this time his/her core office shifts to The Retreat at Chharabra. The building housing The Retreat is a purely wooden structure originally constructed in 1850. It has dhajji wall construction, and a plinth area of . The Retreat is the smallest of the Indian President's residences. After the Rashtrapati Niwas at Shimla was handed over to the Government of India in 1962 by the then President, Dr S. Radhakrishnan, in order to become an academic institute - the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, The Retreat was officially assigned to be the presidential mansion. The 16-room residence is surrounded by a forest. The President stays at The Retreat for two weeks a year during the summer, but the building is mostly used by the Government of India to house foreign VIPs visiting Shimla. The property belongs to the former Raja of Koti, and has been given to the Government of India on a permanent lease.\\\\- accessed on 20 December 2007 The building was originally constructed by the then Medical Superintendent of Simla whose name is not known (referred to merely as Mr. C____ in Simla Past and Present by Sir Edward Buck). The Retreat was taken on lease from Raja of Koti by Lord William Hay. During this period, the local population called it \\"Larty Sahib Ki Kothi\\" i.e. house of Mr. Larty as Lord William Hay was named by locals. The lease deed contained stipulations that (i) The two roads from Simla and Mashobra Village should, in interest of native population of Koti State, be open to Public; (2) No trees should be felled and (3) No cattle be slaughtered on the grounds. The lease of the Retreat was then taken by Sir William Mansfiled, Commander ‚Äì in ‚Äì Chief, and then By Sir Edward Buck in 1881. In 1896, Raja of Koti used his right of preemption and took the possession of the estate. Thereafter the Retreat was consigned it to Govt. on permanent lease by Raja of Koti. Earl of Elgin was the first Viceroy to have used The Retreat as Viceregal residence. Lord Elgin secured use of The Retreat for future viceroys and constantly spent his weekends at Retreat.Simla Past and Present by Sir Edward Buck, *Hemkunj or Hem Kunj is the official summer residence of the Governor of Punjab, India. It was formerly known as Dane's Folly. It is situated on the road leading to The Retreat, between Wildflower Hall and The Retreat. The house was originally built by an Englishman called Mr Dane, who, believing that Shimla town would come up at this point, predicted that Shimla would come up on this side of the hill. However, as his prediction was proved wrong he named the house Dane's Folly.\\"When Shimla was Simla\\" by D.K. Mukerjee; last accessed 5 Aug. 2008 A new building was constructed next to the Dane's Folly building, which is used as residence of Governor of Punjab.

Wild Flower Hall Circa 1896 Second building of Wildflower Hall, burned down in 1993 *Wildflower Hall Hoteldescription and history; accessed on 5 Aug 2008 is a luxury hotel constructed on the site of the summer residence of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum. The original building of Wildflower Hall was located higher up than the present building. After the first building was burned, a second building was constructed at the present site. The first owner of Wildflower Hall was Mr. G.H.M. Batten, CS, private secretary to Earl Lytton (1876‚Äì1880). The Hall is also said to have been a favourite retreat of Lord Ripon. The most famous resident of Wildflower Hall was the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces, Lord Kitchener, who spent a considerable amount of money laying out the gardens, and planting trees and flowers. Immediately upon his arrival at Shimla, Lord Kitchener secured lease of the property from the then owner Mrs. Goldstien. In 1909, after Lord Kitchener returned to England, Wildflower Hall was sold to Mr. Robert Hotz and his wife. In 1925, after demolishing the old house, Mrs. Hotz erected a fine three-storey hotel. After Independence, the hotel was taken over by the Indian Government, and given to the Himachal Government to run an Agriculture School. It was taken over by the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation in 1973 which then ran Wildflower Hall Hotel until 1993. On 4-5-1993 the building was razed to the ground by a fire caused by an electricity short circuit. After this event the Himachal Pradesh Government formed a joint venture with the Oberoi Hotel Group to rebuild Wildflower Hall as a luxury hotel.accessed on 5 Aug 2008 The present building is the third building on the Wildflower Hall site. *Kalyani Helipad: There are views of the Himalayas, Shimla and the valley below from this point. This was originally the site of a two storied residential house called Dukani. Dukani was famous for its picnic grounds and terraced flower garden. The Striats Time reports of can competition called \\"Scents of Dukani\\" held here where the people were asked identify the smell of various flowers grown in the garden of Dukani. It was built by Lt. Col. Thomas David Colyear (died 8 August 1875) of 7th Bengal Cavalry. Amongst its famous occupants were Sir John Woodburn, Lt. Governor of Bengal Sir George Robertsoe, Lt. Governor of Bengal Sir George Charles River, etc. Other owners of Dukani included H.B.Goad and Maharaja of Alwar.Simla, Past and Present, by Sir Edward Buck at page 183.

This may be accomplished either by accelerating the water past the swimmer or by supporting the swimmer, either in water or on dry land. The first type, known as a countercurrent swimming machine, usually consists of a water tank at least twice as long and about one and a half times as wide as an average person with the limbs extended. The swimmer swims unrestrained against an adjustable stream of water set in motion by means of mechanical devices, such as jets, propellers or paddle wheels. Sometime in the mid-1970s, o Pe√±a told his brother, Pedro (nephew of artist Wilfredo Lam), about the potential need for an indoor swimming machine due to lack of access to pools in the frigid New Jersey winter. Pedro advised him to patent his idea, but o scoffed at the idea. Once his idea was stolen, o lived the rest of his life in poverty. In mid-2020, amateur animator Marc Matta-Awad had divulged this previously unknown information after getting a potential scare over his original characters potentially being stolen. Countercurrent swimming machines made their appearance in the 1970s, initially in the form of pump-driven jetted streams, which caused a certain amount of turbulence and an un-natural swimming environment. They were followed up in the 1980s by propeller- and paddle-wheel driven machines. These provided a smoother stream of water. Two types of exercise machines make up the second group. Hybrid systems - self-contained micropools similar to the counter-current type but using a flexible tether to keep the swimmer in place are one type. These systems, being human powered, need neither machinery or electricity but have to be carefully designed to suppress wave formation. The second type allows a person to remain on dry land while simulating certain swimming strokes. Machines of the latter type however can not compensate for the weight of the body and the limbs and thus deprive the user of the benefits of exercise in an aquatic environment. However, the higher effort required by such machines, in the absence of the metabolic effects of immersing the body in water, makes these devices more effective than true swimming if one's purpose is to achieve weight reduction. Similar in purpose, but not qualifying as swimming machines since they require access to a swimming pool, are various tether systems. Resistance Swim Spas beat the current stainless steel swim spas. Pressure- driven machines These systems depend on one or more pumps. Discharge rates of 13 L/s (200 US gal/min) and more are possible, from motors of three or four horsepower (2 or 3 kW);http://swimspahottubs.com/reviews/swimex-600s-mount- everest-review/ power requirements are determined from pump curves, where the pump is selected to maximise volumetric flow, as pressure loss is relatively low as the water does not need to be lifted, but only overcome swimmer drag and other pressure losses within the system. One of the earliest models on the market ‚Äî introduced in 1973 ‚Äî was the Badujet which is available only in the form of a bare propulsion system, to be installed into either an existing or newly built pool. Also in this category are a number of swim spas, usually fiberglass shells equipped with several pool pumps to set the water in motion. Seen as more convenient since they come pre-assembled, the quality of the swim has been criticized by indoor swimmers as being somewhat turbulent, as the strength of the current comes from the speed and pressure of the discharged water, rather than its volume. Contrary to this, triathletes and other sea swimmers have praised the system due to the turbulence created by the jets mimicking the behavior of the sea, improving stamina and general fitness. Swim Spas, as the name suggests, are a combination of a spa (or hot tub) and an exercise pool. Single-zone models are typically a fibreglass pressure-driven exercise pool which has swim jets at one end, and one or more spa seats fitted with massage jets at the other. In the 1980s Monarch Spas developed the dual- zone swim spa so that pumps and other equipment needed for the pool could also be used to power a separate spa. Today, the advantage of the modern dual-zone system is that the two pools can be at different temperatures using different chemicals - the Hot Tub (using bromine), is hot enough for relaxation and massage, while the swim zone is cool enough for strenuous exercise (using chlorine). Volume-driven machines In the 1980s a new type of machine made its appearance. In an attempt to correct problems of turbulence and resulting discomfort from swimming against a jet of water, systems were devised to set the water in motion in a smoother fashion. The first, in 1984, was the SwimEx, developed by Stan Charren together with two MIT-trained engineers. This machine, consisting of a fiberglass pool with the machinery housed in an adjacent compartment, sets the water in motion by means of a paddlewheel, thus generating a steady stream of water as wide as the swimming pool itself. In the late 1980s the Endless Pool was developed by James Murdock. This machine places the water-moving equipment - a large propeller encased in a stainless steel box and powered by a remote hydraulic pump, and its stainless steel water circulation tunnels - inside the body of a vinyl-lined metal pool. Its stream of water is narrower than that of the SwimEx, though the swimming experience is comparable. Other companies have copied this system since it was introduced. Around the same time, the Swim Gym, a propeller-driven propulsion system became available commercially. This machine is encased within a large (10\\" diameter) PVC tee which is then incorporated into the concrete wall of a swimming pool. It delivers a current equivalent to that produced by Endless Pools. In 2008, SmartPools Sdn Bhd http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2008/1/31/central/20058530&sec;=central Malaysia launched its Laminar Propulsion system using drive train technology capable of moving up to 30,000 litres of water per minute at low pressure to create a non-turbulent, bubble-free, smooth flow and speed-adjustable swimming treadmill.http://www.simedarbyproperty.com/upload/smartpools.pdf Hybrid systems A number of \\"still-water\\" mini-pools have been built over the years, designed to be used in conjunction with various resistance-swimming tether systems. These human-powered devices combine the self-contained aspect of counter-current swimming machines with the low cost and simplicity and freedom of movement of tether systems used in athletic training. They have major cost and energy-use advantages over mechanical swimming machines. They are valuable for aerobic exercise, endurance and strength training, and for stroke practice. However, they cannot replicate open water conditions, in which the water courses at speed past the swimmer, so that for competition training their use has to be combined with open-water practice. One example of such a device is the Swimergy Swim System, which also makes use of wave-reduction technology.

Life  = Mandelberg seeks training= He was born to painter Johan Edvard Mandelberg and his wife Hedvig Sophia. His father taught him to draw and paint, and he worked in his father‚Äôs workshop in Stockholm. On seeing a battle picture by Johan Philip Lembke at Drottningholm Palace, Johan became determined also to paint battle scenes. Since there was no possibility in Sweden for him to get the necessary training for his ambitions, he received financial backing from three supporters who sent him to Paris in 1752. He went to Paris by way of Copenhagen along with Norwegian-born medallionist Magnus Gustavus Arbien (1716‚Äì1760). It was in Copenhagen that he became acquainted with Carl Gustaf Pilo (1712/1713?-1793), professor at the Drawing and Painting Academy, predecessor to the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi). = He comes to Paris= He came to Paris with good recommendations and came into the leading French art circles where he caught the attention and interest of Count Philippe de Caylus, renowned artist Fran√ßois Boucher, and fellow Swede Alexander Roslin (1718‚Äì1798). He found work at Fran√ßois Boucher‚Äôs atelier in 1753. He was impoverished, and made small battle pictures in pen and ink, as well as copies of paintings to supplement his meager earnings. Arbien helped Mandelburg secure financial support by contacting Pilo in Copenhagen, who then interested the Danish Legation secretary to the French Court in Paris Justitsr√•d Joachim Wasserschlebe, foreign minister Count Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff and Adam Gottlob Moltke, and finally through them King Frederick V of Denmark. The King's support was generous, but conditional‚ÄîMandelburg would need to commit himself to Denmark and his Court. = Subsequent training in Rome= After his three-year studies in Paris he went on to Rome, where from late 1755 he came into the antique art enthusiast circle around Danish Johannes Wiedewelt, Italian Pompeo Batoni and German Anton Raphael Mengs. Wiedewelt would become a lifelong friend. He painted several battle scenes in Rome, among which were paintings made for Wiedewelt, and for Court Marshall B√ºlow. On July 1, 1758 he traveled back to Denmark in the company of Wiedelwelt. They traveled over Caprarola, Siena, Florence, Pisa, Carrara, Lucca, Bologna, Padua, Venice, and Trieste where they studied the local art collections and churches, and on through the Tyrol and Germany. They arrived back to Copenhagen on October 6, 1758. = Career in Copenhagen= Johan Mandelberg. Engraving by Johan Frederik Clemens. Only 4 years after its opening in 1754, he was accepted as a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi). When sculptor Johan Christof Petzold died in 1763, Mandelberg was granted his vacated professorship. He married Anna Margaretha Meyer on May 26, 1781. She died May 5, 1823. He had plenty of work, but unfortunately there came no assignments for him in his specialty area of battle painting; but he would have to be named historical and battle painter for the royal court in order to win these projects. He was mostly employed painting mythological paintings, depictions of courtly life, and decorations paintings. Among these were many large pictures and decorations for the royal palaces. He was so busy that he had to use extra help from competent students at the Academy such as Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, with whom he would again work together on decorations to the Knights' Room at Christiansborg Palace. He died on January 8, 1786 in Copenhagen.

History One of three new garages opened in 1981 by London Buses at a cost of ¬£3.5 million, it had space for 140 buses undercover and a further 30 in the yard. The roof was unusual in being carried by 10 35-ton triangular trusses, said to be the largest in the UK, supported on reinforced concrete columns. Although technically in Hackney, buses showed \\"CAMBRIDGE HEATH Ash Grove Garage\\" on their blinds. On opening the garage took over Hackney's operation of Red Arrow routes 502 and 513 using brand new Leyland Nationals which had been stored at the garage, and also the entire Hackney and Dalston allocations. Unfortunately, Ash Grove found itself in the London Forest operation, and also had a reputation for staff militancy and closed in 1991. The garage was reopened in 1994 by Kentish Bus to operate their Leyton area route gains, although they referred to it as Cambridge Heath. It was also used over the years to house stored vehicles for the London Transport Museum, and again in 2000 to store additional AEC Routemasters that had been acquired to supplement shortages in London. In 2000 it was reopened by the London Buses subsidiary East Thames Buses which took over the former Harris Bus routes after that company ran into financial difficulties. Hackney Community Transport also moved into the garage yard in recent times to house its routes won in the London area although East Thames Buses later moved to new premises in Mandela Way, Southwark and were replaced at the garage by Arriva's new Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses for route 38 following the conversion from Routemasters in November 2005.

History Enfield garage was built in 1927 by the London General Omnibus Company. Further land was soon acquired in the front of the garage for use as a bus stand, which later also got used as a terminus for trolleybuses. The garage was modernised at a cost of over ¬£6 million in the early 1980s, and when it reopened in 1984 it had space for 106 buses. More recently it has become a central part of Arriva London operations with the accident repair centre and undertaking of major refurbishments. =Grays (GY)= As of May 2020, Grays garage operates routes 66, 103, 347, 370, 375. History As part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes with Arriva London, Grays garage was transferred from Arriva Southern Counties on 1 January 2016. =Palmers Green (AD)= One of Palmers Green's Alexander Dennis Enviro400s for route 102 As of October 2020, Palmers Green operates routes 102, 141, 329, 340 and 675./ Opened in July 1912 by the London General Omnibus Company to house their Central London bus fleet operating in competition with the MET trams. Just before World War II the allocation at Palmers Green was entirely AEC Regents, whilst afterwards it was allocated AEC Regent III RT, RTL, RTW and SRTs the only garage to be allocated all four standard double deck types, although none could fit in the garage until the roof could be raised by 10 inches, which was completed in 1952 after a process taking 20 weeks. The garage was further modernised in 1974 by which time 60 buses were allocated. AEC Routemasters arrived in 1969 replacing the RTs, but the RTs lasted there until 1978. One man operated buses in the form of AEC Regal VIs began arriving and were followed in time by AEC Swifts, Daimler Fleetlines, and MCW Metrobuses. The Routemasters lasted on route 29 until the late 1980s, and in 1994 the allocation was 51, entirely MCW Metrobuses. In latter years the allocation has increased slightly and other than Metrobuses, Volvo B10Ms and Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250LFs have been allocated. =Tottenham (AR)= Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B7TL on route 243 at Waterloo station As of May 2020, Tottenham garage operates routes 19, 41, 123, 149, 243, 318, 341, N19 and N41. History Tottenham garage was built in 1913 by the MET to run buses to support their tram network. The buses were requisitioned during World War I, and then between 1917-1919 the garage was loaned to AEC. Before World War II in 1939 the allocation consisted of ST, STL and LTs, but during the war it was the first garage to receive utility Guy Arabs, and later in 1949 London's first 8 ft wide buses. When route 236 moved with its RFs to Dalston in 1971 it signalled an absence of single deckers at the garage that would last until 2001 when route W4 was won. MCW Metrobuses and AEC Routemasters were the staple diet of the garage for many years until the new Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250LFs arrived. The final Routemasters left Tottenham in September 2004 when route 73 was converted to Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated bus operation and moved to Lea Valley. However, Tottenham has retained a single Routemaster for the Arriva London Heritage fleet for use at shows and special events. It is probably the most famous too, being the (numerically) first production Routemaster, RM5. =Wood Green (WN)= Wright Eclipse Gemini bodied Volvo B7TL on route 221 As of May 2020, Wood Green garage operates routes 29, 144, 221, W3, W4 and night route , N29. History Transformed in the early 1900s from a horse tram depot to a modern tram depot with a capacity of 67. It was completely remodelled in the late 1930s to allow for trolleybus operations and a capacity of 108. The garage was further adapted again in 1960 for buses. AEC Routemasters arrived to replace trolleybuses in April 1961, and with the closure of West Green in 1962 more work arrived. Arriva London South Arriva London South Limited operates six bus garages. =Brixton (BN)= Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TL on route 159 As of May 2020, Brixton garage operates routes 50, 59, 133, 137, weekend night route 319, 333 and N133. History Originally built as a depot for cable trams which ran up Brixton Hill in 1892, it was re-built between 1904-06 for use by electric trams. In 1993 it was extended onto a site formerly owned by the water board and containing a large water main, and then in 1949 reconstruction started to bury the main and convert the depot into one large building instead of two smaller ones. The last trams ran from the depot in 1951, by which time AEC Regent III RTs had started to arrive with the last remaining until 1976. In 1971 Brixton became one of the first to receive Daimler Fleetlines and then in 1984 MCW Metrobuses. The garage also received the first production Wright Cadet bodied DAF single deckers in 2001. Brixton was also the last depot to operate AEC Routemasters in regular service in London on route 159 until December 2005. Now the garage has only double-decker buses, all the other single-decker buses have been transferred to other garages. From 12 December 2015, route 159 passed to Abellio London with New Routemaster buses, marking Brixton's last night route. =Croydon (TC)= Alexander Dennis Enviro400 on route 466 As of May 2020, Croydon garage operates routes 60, 166, 194, 264, 312, 412, 466, 612, 627, and 685. History Built by the London General Omnibus Company in 1915, the garage was handed over to Thomas Tilling on opening as part of an agreement between the two operators. The garage had to have roof reconstruction in the early 1930s to allow roofed double deckers to use the garage and was totally destroyed in 1941 after an air raid which also killed four staff and destroyed 56 buses. The reconstruction was finally completed in the mid-1950s. AEC Regent III RTs mainly monopolised the garage until the arrival of AEC Routemasters in 1964. In 1969 experimental XAs and later FRM1 were tested on route 233. When the XAs departed in 1973 they were replaced by Daimler Fleetlines which lasted until January 1993. LSs started to arrive in the late 1970s and MCW Metrobus in 1985 until they were replaced by Leyland Titans. When Elmers End closed a reshuffle took place with the Routemasters departing and the garage became fully one man operated, and later in 1994, the garage became fully double deck with the departure of the last Leyland Nationals. =Dartford (DT)= As of May 2020, Dartford Garage operates routes 99, 160, 229, 269, 301, 335, 401, 428, 469, 492, B12, B13 and B15. History As part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes with Arriva London, Dartford garage was transferred from Arriva Southern Counties on 1 January 2016. =Norwood (N)= As of September 2020, Norwood garage operates routes 2, 137, 157, 202, 249, 417, 450, 468, 690 and night routes N2, and N137. History Norwood garage was opened in 1909 by the London General Omnibus Company. The garage has had a steady allocation over the years and in 1951 took over some of the vehicles for the Festival of Britain services from the nearby Norwood Tram Depot. In 1981 the garage underwent complete reconstruction, with the buses and staff being transferred temporarily to the reopened Clapham Garage until 1984. The allocation has mainly been Leyland Olympians and AEC Routemasters until recently when Alexander ALX400 bodied DAF DB250s were allocated in its completely double-deck allocation which included the Northern Counties Palatine bodied Volvo Olympians which came with the operation of the former Londonlinks routes 176/route 188. The garage previously supplied some buses and drivers for route 19 following the conversion from Routemaster operation in 2005, but this ceased with the closure of Battersea, with the whole of the route transferring to Brixton. =Thornton Heath (TH)= As of May 2020, Thornton Heath garage operates routes 64, 157 (Sunday's only), 198, 250, 255, 289, 410 and night route N250. History Originally opened as the garage for the first horse tramway in Croydon in 1879 it was later rebuilt as an electric tram depot in 1901. Initially, it could house 26 trams but was extended the following year to take 43 cars. Thornton Heath was earmarked for closure as a tram depot for reconstruction at the tram replacement program of 1950‚Äì52 but actually shut before the last tram finished with the work and staff moving to Purley. Buses were starting to operate from the new garage before reconstruction was complete in 1951 with 54 AEC Regent III RTs, just half of its capacity. AEC Routemasters arrived in the early 1960s bringing it up to 84 buses. The RTs lasted until 1976, outlasting the RMs which were replaced by Daimler Fleetlines in 1971, although they did return between 1976‚Äì1978 and 1982‚Äì1987 when the garage became entirely one man operated. By 1994 the garage was worked almost entirely by Leyland Olympians and MCW Metrobuses with a few Dennis Dart and MCW Metroriders. There was also a period where the then South London Transport regularly transferred vehicles about, and whilst Thornton Heath retained its Olympians throughout, they were joined not only by Metrobuses but also Leyland Titans. Thornton Heath also briefly flirted with SR-class StarRiders, as well as sharing vehicle evaluation duties with Bromley for the DA/SA classes of vehicle, operating SA1 From October 1989 to February 1990 before swapping it for DA1, which stayed here for a further 6 months before being moved to Westlink. Former Garages =Battersea (BA)= History The original Battersea garage was opened in 1906 by the London Roadcar Company on the north side of Hester Road, but by 1914 more space was needed and an annexe was built on the south side. Two modernisation schemes were undertaken, first in the 1960s to allow for AEC Routemasters to be allocated and again in 1971 when a new canteen and recreation room was built. The garage closed in 1985 with its allocation being split between Victoria and Wandsworth garages. Battersea was however given a reprieve some time later when it was used to house the London Buses coaches and sightseeing operations until 1988 when the entire operation moved to Wandsworth garage. In 1993, a yard adjacent to the old garage was opened as a base for Kentish Bus route 19 operation after it had moved out of its Covent Garden Market base. Most of the area formally occupied on both the North and South sides of Hester Road has now been built into a luxury flats complex. The only section remaining is the small shed which was originally an outstation from Brixton garage housing the route 19 Routemasters. When the Routemasters left in July 2005 the garage received an allocation of Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TLs for route 19, although some of these need to be parked at (and use drivers from) Norwood garage because there was not enough space for these larger buses. In November 2009, Battersea garage was closed and the site redeveloped. =Beddington Farm (CN)= History A modern purpose built depot that was largely open air. Opened in 1990 by London Country Bus Services, it ran 73 vehicles, although had space for 120. Beddington Farm was to replace the existing garages at Godstone and Chelsham and operated both LB tendered routes and existing London Country Croydon area routes. Beddington Farm became a Londonlinks depot when the Non-London work moved away before coming under Arriva South. It was transferred to Arriva London in 1999 with six routes and buses painted red, green or blue. In 2007 route 450 was transferred to Beddington Garage from Thornton Heath in a swap with route 289.

On 31 May 2014, the garage gained route E10 from Metroline. It used new Alexander Dennis Enviro 200 single deckers. As part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes with Arriva London, Heathrow garage was transferred from Tellings-Golden Miller on 1 January 2016. During December 2017, the operation of route E10 was transferred to London United. As a result, the depot closed soon after. =Lee Valley (LV)= History The depot is at the back of an industrial estate alongside the River Lea close to Northumberland Park. The depot was opened in 2005 to house the Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses for route 149 which were later joined by more with the conversion of route 73.

The Heritage Fleet right AEC Routemaster RML901 at the 2007 Cobham bus rally, showing the Heritage fleet advertising AEC Routemaster RM6 in Queen's Golden Jubilee livery The Heritage Fleet was set up in 2006 by Arriva. It uses AEC Routemasters for private hire work, and was formed after Routemasters in London were withdrawn from normal service in December 2005. =History= Arriva London inherited four Routemaster operator services when it purchased Leaside Buses and South London Transport: routes 19, 38, 73 and 159. Routes 19 and 159 were replaced by one man double deckers and 38 and 73 by Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses. Route 159 was the last London route to be converted on 9 December 2005, bringing 50 years of Routemaster operation to a close. Following this, Arriva London collected some of the more significant Routemasters in their fleet and set up the Heritage Fleet in early 2006. =Current operations= The Heritage Fleet currently offer their vehicles for private hire, such as events celebration and weddings. The buses can also be hired to attend other public events, and often the buses appear at bus events, such as Showbus and the London Bus Preservation Trust Cobham bus rally. =Fleet= The Heritage Fleet is made up of nine AEC Routemasters. As Arriva was the biggest operator of Routemasters before they were withdrawn from normal services, they operated some of the most significant Routemasters. These include; *RM5: This is the lowest numbered production Routemaster, although RM8 was actually built first. *RM6: In 2002, this Routemaster was painted in a gold livery to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee, the livery which it now carries. *RML901: This was part of the first batch of 24 RMLs (Routemaster Lengthened) to enter service. *RM1124: This was retained as it contains a Cummins Euro II engine, meaning it already meets emission standards to be set for London. *RMC1453: This was the first production Green Line Routemaster Coach. *RMC1464: This is an open top bus, so is popular for private hires. *RM2217: The last production standard length Routemaster built. This bus operated the final regular Routemaster service in December 2005. *RML2355: This is still in the condition as when it left service, but is awaiting restoration. It is unusual in retaining its original body and chassis after the Routemaster overhaul scheme. *RML2360: This is being looked after for the London Transport Museum. It has been converted inside for exhibition use.

Peter Hogan (born 5 May 1954) is an English writer and comics creator best known for Resident Alien, which he co-created with Steve Parkhouse. Hogan began his comics career as editor of cult British comic Revolver in 1990‚Äì1991, before working for 2000 AD, American comic book publishers Vertigo, America's Best Comics and Dark Horse Comics. Biography In 1978 Pete Townshend, of The Who, asked Hogan to set up and manage his Magic Bus Bookshop in Richmond. He then worked as commissioning editor for Townshend‚Äôs Eel Pie Publishing from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. Projects included Pennie Smith‚Äôs book of Clash photos, Viv Stanshall‚Äôs Sir Henry At Rawlinson End, Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray‚Äôs Bowie ‚Äì An Illustrated Record. Hogan worked on the editorial side, with John Brown (later the publisher of Viz Comic) on the business side. His known associates at that time were Dave Marsh and Patrick Humphries, rock music journalists. Hogan worked as a record company press officer for Rough Trade during the early days of The Smiths, and for IRS Records where he worked for REM, as well as writing about music and film, for magazines like Melody Maker and Sky and Vox, and much later on Uncut. He went on to write books about The Bangles, The Doors, Queen, REM, The Velvet Underground and Nick Drake. He also was a contributing writer to a biography about The Monkees pop group. Hogan is the brother-in-law of noted UK comic artist/typographer/design guru Rian Hughes. Fleetway then hired Hogan to edit comics, and whilst he was editing Revolver, he also co-edited The Comic Relief Comic with Neil Gaiman and Richard Curtis. Later, Hogan became a scriptwriter for the 2000 AD comic, working on short story series Vector 13 and Tharg's Dragon Tales, as well as reinventing the long-running Strontium Dog series as Strontium Dogs and supervising the Durham Red spin-off series. Hogan also had a short stint working on Sam Slade, Robo-Hunter. He also created the gentle fantasy Timehouse. However, when David Bishop took on the editorship of 2000 AD, he informed Hogan that he would commission no more of Hogan's scripts because he \\"didn't believe his writing fitted the comic [he] wanted 2000 AD to be.\\" The two commissioned scripts, Strontium Dogs \\"Hate and War\\" and Durham Red \\"Night of the Hunters\\" were heavily rewritten and Hogan asked for his name to be removed ‚Äì they were credited to Alan Smithee. With hindsight Bishop says \\"He was rightly furious about having his work summarily rewritten and demanded his name taken off the scripts, which I did. I regret the brutal way I treated Peter: I was in a hurry to make changes and he caught the full force of that haste.\\"Bishop, 2007, page 184 In the 1990s, Hogan wrote for some titles on DC Comics' Vertigo imprint, including The Dreaming and The Sandman Presents: Love Street. Most recently, his unpublished followup to the latter, The Sandman Presents: Marquee Moon, was published online. Like Love Street, Marquee Moon is a tie-in to Neil Gaiman's The Sandman and offers a look at the early days of John Constantine of Swamp Thing and Hellblazer fame. In addition, Hogan has worked with Alan Moore on Moore's America's Best Comics series, including his own spin-off title Terra Obscura. He also wrote three issues of Tom Strong with artist Chris Sprouse and the two of them returned to the character in 2010 with the limited series Tom Strong and the Robots of Doom. Since 2011 Hogan has worked on his own Resident Alien series for Dark Horse. This has been adapted by Chris Sheridan into a live action TV show starring Alan Tudyk. It will air in the summer of 2020. In 2020 Hogan returned to the pages of 2000 AD working with Brendan McCarthy on Zaucer of Zilk: A Zaucer Full of Zecrets. Known, with great affection, by many of \\"The Ealing Lot\\" as The Count ‚Äì for his legendary nocturnal working habits.

History At its 1991 founding, the Governor's School for Government and International Studies was given the Thomas Jefferson High School building to share by Richmond Public Schools. The city school stopped accepting freshmen in 1991, intending to turn the building fully over to GSGIS by 1995. However, parents, students, and alumni of TJHS, as well as city politicians, protested the closing of their school, RPS reversed its decision, and in 1992 TJ started accepting freshmen again and GSGIS started looking for a permanent home. After several years of false starts and administrative turnover, GSGIS finally obtained the Maggie Walker High School building, an abandoned former Richmond City school, as a permanent home. The original building, Maggie L. Walker High School, was first opened in the 1930s as a school for African-Americans. It was named for Maggie Lena Walker, the first woman and African-American to operate a bank in the United States and was once attended by American civil rights lawyer and politician Henry L. Marsh, African American tennis pro Arthur Ashe, as well as pro football Hall-of-Famer Willie Lanier, and NBA great Bob Dandridge. GSGIS took up occupancy in fall 2001 after several million dollars of renovations and adopted the name Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, or MLWGSGIS for short, though commonly shortened further to MLWGS.

Publishers Clearing House was founded in 1953 by Harold Mertz to replace door- to-door magazine subscription sales by a single vendor offering multiple subscriptions by mail. It introduced its sweepstakes in 1967. In the early 1990s, the company was the subject of concerns and legal actions regarding whether consumers were misled about their odds of winning the sweepstakes and whether purchases increased their chances. By 2010, the company had reached settlements with all 50 states. The company acquired search company Blingo in 2006, online gaming company Funtank in 2010, and mobile marketing company Liquid Wireless in 2012. History =Early history= Publishers Clearing House was founded in 1953 in Port Washington, New York, by Harold Mertz, a former manager of a door-to-door sales team for magazine subscriptions. The company started in Mertz's basement with help from his wife LuEsther and daughter Joyce. Its first mailings were of 10,000 envelopes from Mertz's home in Long Island, New York, and offered 20 magazine subscriptions. 100 orders were received. Within a few years the company moved out of Mertz's basement into an office building and started hiring staff. When PCH moved its headquarters in 1969, its prior location was donated to the city and renamed the Harold E. Mertz Community Center. The company revenue had grown to US$50 million by 1981, and $100 million by 1988.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol.64. St. James Press, 2004. In 1967 PCH started its first sweepstakes as a way to increase subscription sales, based on the sweepstakes held by Reader's Digest. The first prizes ranged from 25 cents to $10 and entrants had a 1 in 10 chance of winning. After the sweepstakes increased response rates to mailings, prizes of $5,000 and eventually $250,000 were offered.By, G.J. 1998, Sweepstakes Industry May Not Be a WINNER!, New York, N.Y., United States, New York, N.Y. PCH began advertising the sweepstakes on TV in 1974. It was the only major multi-magazine subscription business until 1977. Former client Time Inc. and several other publishers formed American Family Publishers (AFP) to compete with PCH after the company refused repeated requests by Time for a larger share of sales revenue from magazine subscriptions. AFP and PCH competed for exclusive rights to magazines and for the better promotion and prize ideas. When AFP increased their jackpot to $1 million, then to $10 million in 1985, PCH raised its prizes to match. $7 million in prizes were distributed by 1979, $40 million by 1991 and $137 million by 2000. In 1989 two members of its advertising team, Dave Sayer and Todd Sloane, started the Prize Patrol, a publicized event where winners are surprised with a check at their home. The idea was inspired by the 1950s television series The Millionaire. In 1992 thousands of discarded sweepstakes entries from contestants who had not bought magazine subscriptions were found in the company's trash, reinforcing beliefs that the company favored those who made purchases in selecting a sweepstakes winner. PCH said this was done by a disgruntled employee at their mail processing vendor. A class action ensued, which PCH settled by giving discarded entrants a second chance to win. =Government regulation= In the 1990s PCH and its primary competitor, AFP, experienced a series of legal troubles due to concerns that their mailings misled consumers about their odds of winning and implied that magazine purchases increased their chances. This led to the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act of 2000, which regulates direct mail businesses. At the senate hearings regarding this Act, PCH said most consumers were not confused about their chances of winning or that purchases did not increase their chances. The company said less than five percent of participants spend more than $300. Government officials from California said 5,000 local consumers paid more than $2,500 each in magazine purchases under the false belief that they were increasing their odds of winning the sweepstakes. Industry sources estimated PCH's response rates decreased by 7-12 percent and its sales volume by 22 to 30 percent in response to the bad publicity from the lawsuits. In 2000, PCH laid off a quarter of its 800-person work force. Lawsuits and settlements In 1994 PCH sent mailings telling recipients they were all \\"finalists\\", which led to a lawsuit involving the attorneys general of 14 US states. Later that year, PCH denied wrongdoing, but agreed to pay a settlement of $490,000 and to change their practices. Under the agreement, PCH said it would define terms like \\"finalist\\" and disclose the chances of winning. In 1997, a contestant of competitor AFP flew to Tampa, Florida, thinking he had won, though he had not. The resulting publicity caused more lawsuits for both companies. PCH reached a $30 million national settlement in 1999. In 2000, another $18 million settlement was reached with 24 states, after the company sent mass mailings that said \\"You are a winner!\\" and used mock personalized checks. PCH agreed to avoid similar mailings in the future, and add a \\"sweepstakes fact box\\" to mailings. State attorneys spoke out against the national settlement from 2000 and additional lawsuits were filed by individual states. Another $34 million settlement was reached in 2001 in a lawsuit involving 25 states, bringing the total settlements since 1999 to $82 million. As part of the settlement, PCH was required to avoid terms like \\"Guaranteed Winner,\\" add disclaimers to mailings saying that the recipient has not won and that purchasing merchandise won't increase their chances. PCH reached settlements with all fifty states and agreed to work with a \\"compliance counsel.\\" PCH apologized in the settlement and said it would contact customers who had spent more than $1,000 on merchandise the prior year. PCH also reached an agreement with Iowa in 2007. In 2010 the company paid $3.5 million to the attorneys general of 32 states and the District of Columbia to settle possible contempt charges that it had violated the terms of the 2001 agreement. The company denied wrongdoing, but agreed to work with both an ombudsman and a compliance counsel who would review its mailings quarterly. In April 2014, an investigation by the Senate Special Committee on Aging concluded that PCH had \\"pushed the limits\\" of prior agreements and that additional legislation may be needed. In April, 2018 a lawsuit was filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that PCH engaged in deceptive marketing practices through direct mail and email marketing campaigns, as well as targeting elderly, in violation of federal and state law. =Online development= PCH began selling merchandise in 1985 with two products. After a Hershey's Chocolate Cookbook and a diet cookbook sold more than other products, the company began expanding into jewelry, media, collectibles, household products and others. The company also shifted its focus online. It began selling magazine subscriptions and merchandise on PCH.com in 1996. In 2006, it acquired Blingo Inc., an ad-supported metasearch engine that was later re-branded as PCH Search and Win. PCH ran contests on Twitter, Facebook, and Myspace. iPhone apps for slot games and trivia were developed. The company created online play-and-win sites like PCH Games (formerly Candystand) and PCHQuiz4Cash, with air-hockey and video poker games. In December 2010, PCH acquired Funtank and its online gaming site Candystand.com. In 2011, PCH promoted a \\"$5,000 every week for life\\" sweepstakes in TV ads and the front page of AOL.com. The following year the company acquired a mobile marketing company, Liquid Wireless. The company utilized, then stopped then started again utilizing coregistration (through other websites) to expand its customer base.Publishers Clearing House Clears Coregistration Concerns By Eric Barkin Customer Relationship Management magazine July 2013 Page 52 In 2008, a PCH spokesperson said the digital properties were intended to attract younger consumers. By 2013, the internet had become PCH's primary channel of interaction with consumers. The New York Times described the digital transition as \\"part of an overall effort to collect information on Web users, show them advertisements and use the registration information for PCH‚Äôs mailing lists.\\" Products A screenshot of PCHSearch&WIN.comPCH; is a direct-marketing company that sells merchandise, magazine subscriptions and operates several prize-based websites. While best known for the sweepstakes and Prize Patrol it uses to promote its magazine subscriptions, the majority of the company's revenue now comes from merchandise. The company has been selling books, media, jewelry and other consumer items since the 1980s. PCH operates eight websites, including PCH Search and Win, PCH Lotto, PCH Games, PCH Save and Win, and Candystand. The company also sells magazine subscriptions at a discount and advertises subscriptions along with its sweepstakes. It's estimated that companies like PCH keep 75-90 percent of the fees from the original subscription, while publishers use the increased distribution to improve circulation numbers and revenue from renewals. PCH popularized the idea of using sweepstakes to sell magazine subscriptions in the direct-marketing market and became known by detractors as a producer of junk-mail for advertising through mass-mailings. Documents filed with the New York State Department in 1993 said that year the company mailed 220 million envelopes. Frequent buyers can receive 30-40 mailings a year.Span, Paula, \\"Sweep Dreams, America!,\\" Washington Post, January 28, 1993, pp. C1, C8. Sweepstakes The Prize Patrol delivering an oversized check to a sweepstakes winner for $1 million plus $5,000 a week for lifeAlthough PCH advertises its sweepstakes along with magazine subscriptions, no purchase is necessary to enter or win. In 1995, PCH began the tradition of announcing winners of its $10 million prize just after the Super Bowl. As of 2012, $225 million in prizes have been distributed. Some of its larger prizes are for $5,000 a week for life, or $10 million. Prizes can also range from $1 Amazon gift cards to $2,500, $1 million or $3 million. The larger cash prizes are paid in installments, typically with a balloon payment at 30 years, reducing the present value of prizes to much less than their nominal values. =Odds of winning= According to the official rules, as of June 2020, the odds of winning ‚Äú$5,000 a Week for Life‚Äù in Giveaway 16000 are 1 in 6.2 billion. To put that in perspective the world's population is 7.7 billion. =Prize Patrol= The Prize Patrol surprises sweepstakes winners at their homes, work or other locations with cash prizes and captures the event on video. Since their introduction in 1989, these reality TV-style videos of prize-winners surprised at their doorstep with checks for $1,000 to $10 million have been used in widely broadcast television commercials, and, more recently, in the company's online acquisition efforts, websites and social media communications. In 2013, a $5 million television campaign modified the traditional prize patrol commercial by digitally altering video from classic sitcoms like The Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island to show the prize patrol visiting characters in the show. The Prize Patrol has made in-person appearances or delivered prizes on TV programs such as The Oprah Winfrey Show The Price Is Right. and Let's Make A Deal. Their surprise winning moments have been spoofed by Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and the cast of Saturday Night Live; woven into the plots of movies such as Let's Go to Prison, The Sentinel and Knight and Day; Early Edition, and the subject of cartoons. = Spokesperson = In the summer of 2020 Marie Osmond became a spokesperson for PCH with television advertisements, online, and direct to home mailers.

Its name is often abbreviated to Taq or Taq pol. It is frequently used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method for greatly amplifying the quantity of short segments of DNA. T. aquaticus is a bacterium that lives in hot springs and hydrothermal vents, and Taq polymerase was identified as an enzyme able to withstand the protein- denaturing conditions (high temperature) required during PCR. Therefore, it replaced the DNA polymerase from E. coli originally used in PCR.  Enzymatic properties  Taq's optimum temperature for activity is 75‚Äì80 ¬∞C, with a half- life of greater than 2 hours at 92.5 ¬∞C, 40 minutes at 95 ¬∞C and 9 minutes at 97.5 ¬∞C, and can replicate a 1000 base pair strand of DNA in less than 10 seconds at 72 ¬∞C. At 75-80 ¬∞C, Taq reaches its optimal polymerization rate of about 150 nucleotides per second per enzyme molecule, and any deviations from the optimal temperature range inhibit the extension rate of the enzyme. A single Taq synthesizes about 60 nucleotides per second at 70 ¬∞C, 24 nucleotides/sec at 55 ¬∞C, 1.5 nucleotides/sec at 37 ¬∞C, and 0.25 nucleotides/sec at 22 ¬∞C. At temperatures above 90 ¬∞C, Taq demonstrates very little or no activity at all, but the enzyme itself does not denature and remains intact. Presence of certain ions in the reaction vessel also affects specific activity of the enzyme. Small amounts of potassium chloride (KCl) and magnesium ion (Mg2+) promote Taq's enzymatic activity. Taq polymerase is maximally activated at 50mM KCl and just the right concentration of Mg2+ which is determined by the concentration of nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). High concentrations of KCl and Mg2+ inhibit Taq's activity. Interestingly, the common metal ion chelator, EDTA, directly binds to Taq in the absence of these metal ions. One of Taq's drawbacks is its lack of 3' to 5' exonuclease proofreading activity resulting in relatively low replication fidelity. Originally its error rate was measured at about 1 in 9,000 nucleotides. Some thermostable DNA polymerases have been isolated from other thermophilic bacteria and archaea, such as Pfu DNA polymerase, possessing a proofreading activity, and are being used instead of (or in combination with) Taq for high- fidelity amplification. Fidelity can vary much between Taq's, having profound effects in downstream sequencing applications. Taq makes DNA products that have A (adenine) overhangs at their 3' ends. This may be useful in TA cloning, whereby a cloning vector (such as a plasmid) that has a T (thymine) 3' overhang is used, which complements with the A overhang of the PCR product, thus enabling ligation of the PCR product into the plasmid vector. In PCR In the early 1980s, Kary Mullis was working at Cetus Corporation on the application of synthetic DNAs to biotechnology. He was familiar with the use of DNA oligonucleotides as probes for binding to target DNA strands, as well as their use as primers for DNA sequencing and cDNA synthesis. In 1983, he began using two primers, one to hybridize to each strand of a target DNA, and adding DNA polymerase to the reaction. This led to exponential DNA replication, greatly amplifying discrete segments of DNA between the primers. However, after each round of replication the mixture needs to be heated above 90 ¬∞C to denature the newly formed DNA, allowing the strands to separate and act as templates in the next round of amplification. This heating step also inactivates the DNA polymerase that was in use before the discovery of Taq polymerase, the Klenow fragment (sourced from E. coli). Taq polymerase is well-suited for this application because it is able to withstand the temperature of 95 ¬∞C which is required for DNA strand separation without denaturing. Use of the thermostable Taq enables running the PCR at high temperature (~60 ¬∞C and above), which facilitates high specificity of the primers and reduces the production of nonspecific products, such as primer dimer. Also, use of a thermostable polymerase eliminates the need to add new enzyme to each round of thermocycling. A single closed tube in a relatively simple machine can be used to carry out the entire process. Thus, the use of Taq polymerase was the key idea that made PCR applicable to a large variety of molecular biology problems concerning DNA analysis. Patent issues Hoffmann-La Roche eventually bought the PCR and Taq patents from Cetus for $330 million, from which it may have received up to $2 billion in royalties. Detailed history of Cetus Corporation and the commercial aspects of PCR. In 1989, Science Magazine named Taq polymerase its first \\"Molecule of the Year\\". Kary Mullis received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993, the only one awarded for research performed at a biotechnology company. By the early 1990s, the PCR technique with Taq polymerase was being used in many areas, including basic molecular biology research, clinical testing, and forensics. It also began to find a pressing application in direct detection of the HIV in AIDS. In December 1999, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that the 1990 patent involving Taq polymerase was issued, in part, on misleading information and false claims by scientists with Cetus Corporation. The ruling supported a challenge by Promega Corporation against Hoffman-La Roche, which purchased the Taq patents in 1991. Judge Walker cited previous discoveries by other laboratories, including the laboratory of Professor John Trela in the University of Cincinnati department of biological sciences, as the basis for the ruling.Curran, Chris, Bio-Medicine, Dec. 7, 1999 Domain structure Taq PolA has an overall structure similar to that of E. coli PolA. The middle 3'‚Äì5' exonuclease domain responsible for proofreading has been dramatically changed and is not functional. It has a functional 5'-3' exonuclease domain at the amino terminal, described below. The remaining two domains act in coordination, via coupled domain motion. =Exonuclease domain= Taq polymerase exonuclease is a domain found in the amino-terminal of Taq DNA polymerase I (thermostable). It assumes a ribonuclease H-like motif. The domain confers 5'-3' exonuclease activity to the polymerase. Unlike the same domain in E. coli, which would degrade primers and must be removed by digestion for PCR use, this domain is not said to degrade the primer. This activity is used in the TaqMan probe: as the daughter strands are formed, the probes complementary to the template come in contact with the polymerase and are cleaved into fluorescent pieces.TaqMan Gene Expression - NCBI Projects = Binding with DNA = Taq polymerase is bound at its polymerase active-site cleft with the blunt end of duplex DNA. As the Taq polymerase is in contact with the bound DNA, its side chains form hydrogen bonds with the purines and pyrimidines of the DNA. The same region of Taq polymerase that has bonded to DNA also binds with exonuclease. These structures bound to the Taq polymerase have different interactions. =Mutants= A site-directed mutagenesis experiment that improves the vestigal 3'-5' exonuclease activity by a factor of 2 has been reported, but it was never reported whether doing so decreases the error rate. Following a similar line of thought, chimera proteins have been made by cherry-picking domains from E. coli, Taq, and T. neapolitana polymerase I. Swapping out the vestigal domain for a functional one from E. coli created a protein with proof-reading ability but a lower optimal temperature and low thermostability. Versions of the polymerase without the 5'-3' exonuclease domain has been produced, among which Klentaq or the Stoffel fragment are best known. The complete lack of exonuclease activity make these variants suitable for primers that exhibit secondary structure as well as for copying circular molecules. Other variations include using Klentaq with a high-fidelity polymerase, a Thermosequenase that recognizes substrates like T7 DNA polymerase does, mutants with higher tolerances to inhibitors, or \\"domain- tagged\\" versions that have an extra helix-hairpin-helix motif around the catalytic site to hold the DNA more tightly despite adverse conditions. Taq Polymerase =Significance in disease detection= Because of the improvements Taq polymerase provided in PCR DNA replication: higher specificity, fewer nonspecific products, and simpler processes and equipment, it has been instrumental in the efforts made to detect diseases. ‚ÄúThe use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in infectious disease diagnosis, has resulted in an ability to diagnose early and treat appropriately diseases due to fastidious pathogens, determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of slow growing organisms, and ascertain the quantum of infection.‚Äù The implementation of Taq polymerase has saved countless lives. It has served an essential role in the detection of many of the world‚Äôs worst diseases, including: tuberculosis, streptococcal pharyngitis, atypical pneumonia, AIDS, measles, hepatitis, and ulcerative urogenital infections. PCR, the method used to recreate copies of specific DNA samples, makes disease detection possible by targeting a specific DNA sequence of a targeted pathogen from a patient‚Äôs sample and amplifying trace amounts of the indicative sequences by copying them up to billions of times. Although this is the most accurate method of disease detection, especially for HIV, it is not performed as often as alternative, inferior tests because of the relatively high cost, labor, and time required. The reliance upon Taq polymerase as a catalyst for the PCR replication process has been highlighted during the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020. Shortages of the necessary enzyme have impaired the ability of countries worldwide to produce test kits for the virus. Without Taq polymerase, the disease detection process is much slower and tedious. Despite the advantages of using Taq polymerase in PCR disease detection, the enzyme is not without its shortcomings. Retroviral diseases: HIV, HTLV-1, and HTLV-II; often include mutations from guanine to adenine in their genome. Mutations such as these are what allow PCR tests to detect the diseases but Taq polymerase‚Äôs relatively low fidelity rate makes the same G-to-A mutation occur and possibly yield a false positive test result.

Until 2002 its operations included Colchester. It is a subsidiary of Arriva UK Bus. Operations are split between two registered companies, Arriva East Herts & Essex Limited and Arriva The Shires Limited. Arriva East Herts & Essex Two Optare Solos at Epping Underground station in September 2008 Arriva East Herts & Essex Limited is based in Harlow, and operate two bus garages in Harlow (Fourth Avenue) and Ware (Marsh Lane). Arriva East Herts & Essex emerged from London Country North East (LCNE), one of the successor companies of London Country Bus Services. LCNE was broken in two. One of the successor companies, County Bus & Coach, with depots at Harlow, Hertford and Grays, was bought by its management in 1990. In 1994 County was sold to West Midlands Travel, itself bought by National Express in 1995. The Cowie Group bought County from National Express in 1996. County Bus & Coach was renamed Arriva East Herts & Essex in April 1998. Cowie had also acquired Southend Transport and Colchester Borough Transport with its acquisition of British Bus in 1996. Both companies became part of Arriva East Herts & Essex, but in 2002 were transferred to Arriva Southern Counties together with the former County depot at Grays. =Harlow= Harlow garage was opened by London Transport on 22 May 1963 to serve Harlow New Town and also to replace Epping garage. Harlow was allocated 25 AEC Regent III RTs, 16 AEC Routemasters (to operate Green Line routes 718, 720 & 720A), seven RFs and two coach RFs. London Country North East and County Bus used the garage until The Cowie Group purchased County Bus in 1997. This was previously an Arriva East Herts & Essex garage, but it is now part of the Tellings-Golden Miller subsidiary with buses are branded as Network Harlow. In 2015, it reverted to being part of Arriva Southern Counties. =Ware= Mercedes-Benz Citaro bus on Green Line route 725 in Ware in July 2010 Ware garage replaced the Hertford depot in 1993. It runs part of route 724 along with Harlow garage. Operation of London bus route 327 was transferred from Ware to Arriva London's Enfield garage on 3 January 2009. Ware did briefly become an Arriva The Shires garage in late 2010, before transferring back to Arriva East Herts & Essex. On 4 September 2010 routes 250 and 251 transferred from Harlow to Ware. Arriva The Shires Arriva The Shires Limited is based in Luton and operates bus garages in Luton, Watford, High Wycombe, Aylesbury, Stevenage, Hitchin and Hemel Hempstead. Arriva the Shires evolved from the purchase of the Luton, Aylesbury and Hitchin depots of United Counties by Luton & District Transport in a management buy-out in 1987. paragraph 3.30 Depots at Watford, High Wycombe, Hemel Hempstead, Amersham and Slough were acquired with London Country North West in 1990, although Amersham has since closed and Slough was later sold to Bee Line. LDT was bought in 1994 by British Bus, itself bought in 1996 by The Cowie Group. LDT's was renamed Arriva the Shires in April 1998. paragraph 2.4 =Aylesbury= Aylesbury depot was a depot of United Counties acquired by LDT in 1987. Enviro200 in Oxford city centre on Route 280 in October 2014 Later in 1987 LDT also acquired the long-established Aylesbury independent company, Red Rover. =Hemel Hempstead= Hemel Hempstead was a depot of London Country Bus Services (North West) (one of the companies into which London Country Bus Services was divided in 1986), acquired by Luton & District Transport in 1988. =High Wycombe= Leyland Olympian on route 74 in High Wycombe in July 2009 Mercedes-Benz Citaro on route 300 in High Wycombe in July 2009 High Wycombe was another depot of London Country Bus Services (North West), acquired by LDT in 1988. In 2000 Arriva also bought the High Wycombe depot of the Go-Ahead Group's Oxford Bus Company (which had bought it from the Bee Line in 1994). In 2005 High Wycombe garage moved to a new purpose built depot following the closure of the old bus station in the town, where the previous garage was. High Wycombe operate a number of services. =Hitchin= Hitchin depot was a depot of United Counties acquired by LDT in 1987. Hitchin services have been worked from Stevenage garage since January 2007 following the closure of the old former United Counties garage in Fishponds Road. Services around the Hitchin area have been reduced, and many are operated by other contractors including Centrebus. =Luton= Van Hool bodied DAF on Green Line route 757 at London Victoria in June 2009 Luton depot is purpose- built and is at 487 Dunstable Road. It replaced the previous depot at Castle Street. It also houses the Head Office for Arriva The Shires & Essex as well as the UK bus team. Luton operates Green Line Coaches routes 748, 755, 757, 758 and 759 as well as local bus services, Luton also has an outstation at Stansted Airport which operates the EB2 an easyBus contract. =Hitchin/Stevenage= Arriva the Shires Van Hool bodied DAF coach on 797 route in Hatfield in April 2010 The Hitchin depot was a depot of United Counties acquired by LDT in 1987. Hitchin services have been worked from Stevenage garage since January 2007 following the closure of the old former United Counties garage in Fishponds Road. Services around the Hitchin area have been reduced, and many are operated by other contractors including Centrebus. Arriva is the main operator in Stevenage. They operate most services in the town, along with Centrebus. There are two depots at Stevenage; Babbage Road (ex Sovereign) and Norton Green Road. When London Country Bus Services was broken up in 1986, the Stevenage depot passed to London Country North East, sold in 1988 to AJS Group who established the Sovereign brand. Most of the operation was sold in 1990 to Luton & District Transport, and therefore became part of Arriva in 1996. In 1996 Arriva took over several vehicles and routes from Sovereign, by then owned by the Blazefield Group, in exchange for the London Green Line route 797. paragraph 2.7 In 2004 Arriva acquired the last remaining Sovereign operation. Blazefield had already sold its London operations to Transdev London and its St Albans depot and routes to Centrebus. Arriva the Shires Alexander Dennis Enviro300 on route 301 in Hatfield in April 2010 =Milton Keynes= In February 2006 Arriva bought the operations of MK Metro for ¬£5.6 million, and operational control transferred to The Shires & Essex. The purchase was subsequently considered by the Office of Fair Trading for possible referral to the Competition Commission, but it decided not to. Vehicles and publicity for the Milton Keynes operation continued to use the MK Metro name until April 2010, when they were rebranded as Arriva Milton Keynes, temporarily using the brand name MK Star. The change of name coincided with a number of controversial service changes. Many services were improved in frequency as part of the rebranding but others were reduced or withdrawn and some journey times were increased. =Waltham Abbey= Arriva The Shires previously operated 2 routes in the Waltham Abbey area: * 251, Upshire to Hammond Street * 250, Debden Broadway to Waltham Cross Wrightbus Cadet bodied DAF SB120 in Bletchley in March 2019 Route 250 remained in competition with route 255 operated by Harlow-based Roadrunner buses. Earlier in 2013 Arriva withdrew route 250 service to provide a stronger service on the 251 and to expand onto the 310 route from Waltham Cross to Ware. Many of the buses used on the 250 service can now be seen on the 251 service operating from Upshire to Hammond Street more frequently. Former Garages =Watford (Garston)= Wright Cadet bodied DAF SB120 on route 268 As of May 2015, Watford garage operated London routes 142, 258, 268, 288, 303, 305, 340, 631, 642, H2, H3, H18 and H19. It also operated LSP route 8, and school routes. As part of a decision to consolidate all of Arriva's Transport for London routes, Watford garage was transferred to Arriva London on 1 January 2016. Due to high running costs, Watford depot closed in 2018, with the routes being transferred to Hemel Hempstead. On Sunday 8 April 2018, the Amersham & District Motorbus Society held its annual running day in honour of the depot, with the theme being 'Farewell to Garston garage'. In 2019, the site was sold to Fairview New Homes with the vision to convert it into 165 residential houses. History Watford was a depot of London Country Bus Services (North West) (one of the companies into which London Country Bus Services was divided in 1986), acquired by Luton & District Transport in 1990.

Both operation companies were rebranded Arriva Colchester and Arriva Harlow respectively. The Medway Towns network was upgraded in a ¬£10 million investment marketed as Operation Overdrive. Services =Rural routes= Arriva Southern Counties operate interurban bus routes in West Kent which link Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells with the surrounding villages. One such route is the 6 which is run by the Tunbridge Wells garage using Double Decker Volvo B7TL buses from 2001. These buses started their life in London. There is also the 7. This is run by two bus garages, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells. Anything in the Arriva Kent fleet can appear but Maidstone usually provides more Modern vehicles with Tunbridge Wells using older buses. There are some more rural Interurban routes such as the 5 linking Maidstone and Hawkhurst. The route used to go all the way to Hastings but nowadays you must change at Hawkhurst onto a Stagecoach bus to head to Hastings. There is also the 12 going from Maidstone to Tenterden. Arriva used to run the 'Weald Shopper routes' which were a collection of shopper buses which ran mainly once a week. The 299 was one route which went from Tenterden to Maidstone. Another route was the 293, the most interesting Shopper route which ran from Tunbridge Wells to Rye. Rye was the furthest south Arriva went. New Enterprise Coaches (a subsidy of Arriva) ran these routes with Arriva branded buses, but towards the end of the 293 by Arriva many buses from Tunbridge Wells garage were used. The Weald shopper routes are now run by Autocar. =Park & Ride= Arriva also operates Maidstone park & ride under contract to Maidstone Borough Council.Maidstone Quality Bus Partnership Kent County Council The buses were painted yellow with a green stripe swooping down from the top of the back of the bus to the bottom of the front. The fleet comprised two Wright Cadet bodied DAF SB120s and nine Wright Commander bodied DAF SB200s. In September 2007 the Coombe Quarry Park & Ride site (route 504) was closed due to apparent budget difficulties. As a result, some of the buses were absorbed into the main fleet. Around 2014, the Maidstone Park and ride was upgraded with the Wright Commander buses getting new seats, wifi and a new grey livery. Then, in 2016 the Sittingbourne Road Park & Ride site was closed and the PVR for the Maidstone park and ride was 4. Then in 2018, the Park and ride was in grave danger. It was struggiling and a meeting was held to decide what should happen to it. Some people believed to close the Park and ride, turn the car parks into ordinary car parks and hope a commercial bus service would run. However, the park and ride was given funding to carry on for a year. There were 2 routes, a 501 and 503 which interworked and ran to the two sites. A year later and the park and ride was in trouble again. Thankfully Arriva saved the Park and ride from the axe and a 6 year contract began. 2 year old Enviro 200mmcs came in and provided the Service with Leather seats, Free Wifi and USB charging in a green livery. The Wright Commanders were put into Arriva';s normal fleet. The service was renumbered PR and it runs from London Road Park and Ride site to Willington Street Park and Ride site. Further improvements came when from December 5th to December 23rd buses ran until 9.30pm and a Sunday service was provided for the first time. This was for Christmas Shoppers. Buses were very busy. The final improvement came when a new Park and Ride service began. The H1 which runs from Maidstone Hospital to London Road Park and Ride site. Travel is free for NHS workers. =Arriva Sapphire= Arriva also operates three Sapphire routes in Kent, The buses serve route 700 from Bluewater to Chatham, 101 from Gillingham to Maidstone via Chatham and routes 480 and 490 from Valley Drive to Dartford. The fleet comprises Alexander Dennis Enviro400s, Wright StreetLites and Enviro 400mmc as well as 200mmcs for the 700. The buses were painted in a two tone blue livery. The 101 buses from 2014/2015 are still painted in the livery but the 480/490 and 700 buses are painted in the newer Arriva Sapphire livery. Arriva brought new Wright Streetlites for the 480/490 in 2019 which replaced the older Streetlites which moved to Guildford. They then moved elsewhere. The 700 was made Sapphire status in 2017 with 3 enviro 200mmcs and 3 enviro 400mmcs from Gillingham Depot. Often however, the Sapphire buses end up on non-sapphire routes and non-Sapphire buses end up on either the 101 or 700. The 700 runs along the A2 for about 10-15 mins as well. An upgrade to Sapphire was due for the 6 and 7 routes back in 2014/2015 yet it never happened.There was meant to be new buses for the 101 in 2020 ( but Wrightbus's collapse and the Coronavirus means no-one is sure what happened to the 101's new buses order. It was likely cancelled. =Fastrack= Fastrack liveried Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLE at Dartford in March 2008 Arriva Southern Counties operate the Fastrack busway scheme in the Thames Gateway area of Kent on behalf of the Kent County Council and Prologis. This network currently consists of two routes: Route A runs between Dartford and the Bluewater Shopping Centre, while Route B runs from Temple Hill to Gravesend via Dartford. Since November 2007, Route B has connected with the Eurostar at Ebbsfleet International railway station, and Eurostar passengers are allowed to use the route for free. On 11 February 2008, Arriva started a new \\"m-tickets\\" scheme, where passengers are able to pay for bus tickets using their mobile phones. The route was ran with Volvo B7TL single deckers until 2015 when new Wright Streetlites were ordered. The contract for Fastrack came up again in 2019 and Stagecoach London was rumoured to take it over but they never did, Arriva won the contract and run newer Enviro 200mmcs. Livery Arriva Kent & Sussex Plaxton Pointer bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Royal Tunbridge Wells in April 2009 The main corporate Arriva livery is aquamarine for the body, with a cream \\"swoop\\" at the front and a white separator line in between, blue Arriva \\"circles\\" logos, and a thin yellow line at skirt level. There are many variations of the livery, such as: *Interurban livery ‚Äì Aquamarine, with dark blue band to skirt level and cream \\"cow-horns\\" (a thinned version of the champagne \\"swoop\\"). *London livery - The original London livery was red, with champagne \\"cow-horns\\" as in the interurban livery, orange Arriva \\"circles\\" logo and a thin yellow line at skirt level. The new London livery is completely red, with the thin yellow line at skirt level and the Arriva \\"circles\\" in plain white. *Bluewater livery - No longer used, the Bluewater livery was all over blue, with a water shimmer effect. The services using this livery were replaced by Fastrack in 2006. As well as this, many vehicles operating under different schemes run in different liveries, for example Fastrack and Maidstone Park & Ride.

History =Golden Miller= Wiltax's P701 LCF, a Mercedes-Benz Vario/Plaxton Beaver 2 parked at their depot. It was on loan from another Tellings-Golden Miller company at the time. Reputedly, Fred Varney founded the Golden Miller company with the winnings from a bet made on the horse Golden Miller, which won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Grand National in 1934. In 1955 Golden Miller was sold to FG Wilder & Sons Limited of Feltham with two coaches and a booking office in Twickenham. In 1967 Wilder bought out Tourist Bus Service which had one vehicle and a stage carriage licence for route 601 between Feltham station and East Bedfont, which it had operated since 1955. In 1968 routes 602 (Feltham to Shepperton) and 603 (Feltham to Hanworth via Elmwood Avenue) were added. In 1970 the route from Walton-on-Thames to Walton- on-Thames station was taken over from Walton-on-Thames Motor Co Limited and extended to Oatlands village as route 604. Route 605 was planned for the Claygate area but did not come into effect, and route 606 began in 1971 from Staines to Stanwell Moor and Stanwell village.Fleetbook - Buses of London by RL Telfer & AM Witton =Tellings-Golden Miller= Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart in OFJ Connections livery in April 2008 In June 1985 Wilder sold Golden Miller to Tellings Coaches of Byfleet, a family-run concern which had been founded by Stephen Telling in 1972.

The Golden Miller business continued to operate routes 602 and 606London Bus Handbook Volume 2 (1987) until about 1988. In 1989 the company was taken over by Midland Fox. A small number of London Transport contracted routes were won by the company over the following two years. However, by 1993 Midland Fox had itself been acquired by British Bus and was no longer willing to operate TGM. Stephen Telling re-acquired the company with financial support from Julian Peddle, and also took over Classic Coaches. In 2003 the company was floated on the Alternative Investment Market. TGM operates coaches and maintains subsidiaries in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, Surrey and the North East of England, and operates services under the Classic Coaches, Excel Passenger Logistics, Flight Delay Services, Link Line Coaches, Network Colchester and OFJ Connections brands. The company previously ran bus services in South West London and north west Surrey, inheriting some through acquisition of Capital Logistics. These services were sold to National Express in June 2005 and incorporated into its Travel London business.

Tasini, 533 U.S. 483 (2001), is a leading decision by the United States Supreme Court on the issue of copyright in the contents of a newspaper database. It held that The New York Times, in licensing back issues of the newspaper for inclusion in electronic databases such as LexisNexis, could not license the works of free-lance journalists contained in the newspapers. The lawsuit brought by members of the UAW's National Writers Union against the New York Times Company, Newsday Inc., Time Inc., University Microfilms International, and LexisNexis. The freelance writers, including lead plaintiff Jonathan Tasini, charged copyright infringement due to the use and reuse in electronic media of articles initially licensed to be published in print form. In a 7-2 ruling delivered by Justice Ginsburg, the Court affirmed the copyright privileges of freelance writers whose works were originally published in periodicals and then provided by the publishers to electronic databases without explicit permission of, or compensation to, the writers. As a result of the decision, plaintiffs won a compensation pool of $18 million. History The case was initially heard in the district court of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, who held that the publishers were within their rights according to the Copyright Act of 1976. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court's reversal.Sotomayor's resume, record on notable cases, CNN.com, 26 May 2009. Accessed 26 May 2009. Aftermath The decision involved works generated by 27,000 authors, but it did not allocate any bargaining power to them. The New York Times Company responded to the decision by drafting an ultimatum for the authors. The authors could contact the Times and request that it continue to distribute their works online, but only on the conditions that the authors ask for no additional payment and that they release the Tasini decision's legal claim on the Times and the database licensees. Future freelance contracts with the New York Times included similar terms that allowed the Times to exploit the works in whatever ways the future may reveal.\\"What We Don't See When We See Copyright as Property\\" by Jessica Litman See also * New York Times Co. v.

History One of three garages built by the London Passenger Transport Board, and the only one to survive, Alperton Garage opened in June 1939, adjacent to the Piccadilly line tube station of the same name. When it opened it had an allocation entirely of STLs which were reshuffled from Cricklewood, Hanwell, Harrow Weald and Willesden garages. As Alperton was a new garage and had plenty of headroom it was one of the few garages able to take utility Guy Arabs, and at one stage these made up its complete allocation and lasted until 1954 when they were replaced by STLs. By 1972 with the arrival of numerous AEC Merlin and AEC Swift class single deck buses to operate the numerous one man operated services, and the further allocation of Daimler Fleetlines, parking space was becoming a problem. It therefore became necessary to park a dozen or so buses on nearby Glacier Metals' car park overnight. The garage was consequently enlarged between 1976 and 1978, which encompassed the adjacent former Underground substation, and the LT Lifts and Escalators department which had to move out to new premises. During the reconstruction works, 18 vehicles were outstationed at Stonebridge (SE). The last AEC Regent III RT buses were transferred out in 1975, and until the beginning of the 1980s, Alperton had an entirely AEC Routemaster and Daimler Fleetline allocation. The first MCW Metrobuses arrived in 1981, and gradually replaced the Daimler Fleetlines on all the one man operated routes, and would become the mainstay of the fleet for many years. Following the September 1982 service reductions, all the remaining Routemasters were transferred to other garages, route 83 and 187 being one manned at the same time. Replacement Metrobuses were allocated to make up the allocation (mainly used vehicles from Edgware (EW), Hanwell (HL), and Fulwell (FW), making the garage all Metrobus. By 1995, Alperton was doing most of the maintenance for the CentreWest operation and had also become the home of the training fleet. On 6 August 2016, route 245 was transferred from this garage to Perivale East (PV) garage. From 10 September 2016, Route 483 will operate from Alperton garage. =Greenford (G)= As of February 2017, Greenford garage operated routes 92, 95, 282 and E6. On 27 May 2017, routes E5 E7 and E9 passed to Abellio London. History Greenford bus depot is part of a local council depot and was first used in 1993 as a midibus base. The opening of Greenford garage led to the closure of Hanwell, and in 1995 the garage was operating 110 midibuses. The standard fare of vehicles in the late 1990s were Wright bodied Renault midibuses, and Marshall minibuses but both types had a bad reputation and did not last long. From late 2003 until 14 March 2009 Ealing Community Transport operated route 195 from the Greenford depot using garage code EY. =Hayes (HZ)= History The garage was first opened on Springfield Road in Hayes before moving to a larger depot at Rigby Lane in early 2016. On 11 June 2016, route 195 was transferred from this garage to Greenford (G) garage. On 20 August 2016, routes U4 and U5 was transferred to this garage from Uxbridge (UX) garage. Currently (July 2017) the garage has no operational routes and is in use for vehicle storage only. =Uxbridge (UX)= History The original Uxbridge garage was around half a mile out of town on the Oxford Road and was built by the London General Omnibus Company in 1921, but passed to Thames Valley a year later before reverting in 1929 to work its new local routes which were operated mainly by single deckers. An extension was added in the late 1940s and a new garage was planned, although work didn't begin until the 1980s. The new garage opened in late 1983 next to the underground station occupying the lower ground floor of a multi use building. In 1989 the garage began operating the U-Line network of local routes using 16 seater Alexander bodied Mercedes-Benz midibuses (MAs) in an initiative by London Transport. The growth of use of the U-Line services over the years since 1989 has meant that larger buses have been put into service on these routes. The garage also operated the busy 207. In 1994, the garage was allocated some of London's first low-floor single deckers, Wright bodied Dennis Lance SLFs with Centrewest branding for the then operated route 222. On 20 August 2016, routes U4 and U5 were transferred to Hayes. On 3 September 2016, Uxbridge commenced operating route 114.Tender News Bus Talk (Go-Ahead London) February 2016 page 11Service Changes 23 July to 3 September inclusive Transport for London On 11 February 2017, route U4 was transferred from Hayes (HZ) garage to this garage.

Former Garages =North Wembley (NW)= History North Wembley was opened as a midibus base in 1994, and in latter years buses have been gradually been getting longer, although still single deck. North Wembley had basic maintenance facilities, and therefore some maintenance was carried out by Harrow Weald. On 30 May 2009, North Wembley closed.

In 1939 a new building was built next to the original building which was to become the new bus station, while the remaining open parking area was used to store vehicles for the trolleybus replacement program. In 1984 a new 100 bus garage was built on the site of the long closed Edgware railway station at a cost of ¬£4.5 million. In 1992 plans were made to close Edgware garage as Cricklewood garage was to become a fully functioning garage with new facilities. The outdoor parking area and the bus station then became a midibus base in 1993, with a new bus wash and light maintenance facilities provided in the yard. In 1999, London Sovereign, having won some tenders for bus services in North-West London, took a 10-year lease on half of Edgware garage and invested in a new maintenance facility which was to replace its former base at Borehamwood. In late 2000, Metroline moved back into the other half of the garage, making it one of the few garages to be shared by two operators. On 25 July 2015 London Sovereign commenced operating route 326. =Harrow (SO)= Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart on route H9 in October 2012 As of January 2018, Harrow garage operated routes 183, H9, H10, H11, H13, H14, H18 and H19. History Harrow garage opened in 1994. It is RATP Group's smallest London garage holding just 42 buses. The low roof beam across the middle of the depot building was raised to allow double deckers. The garage has a plot of land next to it, owned by London Sovereign, which is now used to park most of the single decker's due to the 183 allocation, which started on 24 July 2015. The 183 is split between Harrow and Edgware with the majority of buses at Harrow. Route 183 is now fully allocated to Harrow, with routes 398 & H17 transferred to Park Royal (RP) to make room. Fleet As at May 2015, the fleet consisted of 152 buses.

All these identities were originally retained, buses receiving new-style fleetnames incorporating FirstBus's corporate f logo. In December 1997, FirstBus rebranded as FirstGroup. Subsequently, CentreWest was renamed First CentreWest, while the buses' fleetnames were revised again so that \\"First\\" was prominent, the local identities becoming secondary.

History Greenford bus depot is part of a local council depot and was first used in 1993 as a midibus base. The opening of Greenford garage led to the closure of Hanwell, and in 1995 the garage was operating 110 midibuses. The standard fare of vehicles in the late 1990s were Renault/Wrightbus midibuses, and Marshall minibuses but both types had a bad reputation and did not last long. In recent years the allocation has been much diverse, ranging from Marshall bodied Dennis Darts to Dennis Trident 2/Plaxton vehicles. From late 2003 until 14 March 2009 Ealing Community Transport operated London Buses route 195 from the Greenford depot using garage code EY. On 13 November 2010, route 92 was transferred to this garage. On 2 July 2011, route 105 passed to Metroline. =Hayes (HS)= Hayes garage operated London bus route 195, 207, 427 and night route N207.

History It was one of three garages built by the LPTB, and the only one to survive, Alperton Garage opened in June 1939, adjacent to the Piccadilly line station of the same name, to serve the extensive local area that had built up in the mid 1930s. When it opened it had an allocation entirely of STL's which were reshuffled from Cricklewood, Hanwell, Harrow Weald, and Willesden garages. As Alperton was a new garage and had plenty of headroom it was one of the few garages able to take utility Guy Arabs, and at one stage these made up its complete allocation and lasted until 1954 when they were replaced by STLs. By 1972 with the arrival of numerous AEC MB and SM class single deck buses to operate the numerous one man operation services, and the further allocation of Daimler Fleetline DMS, parking space was becoming a problem. It therefore became necessary to park a dozen or so buses on nearby Glacier Metals' car park overnight. The garage was consequently enlarged between 1976‚Äì1978, which encompassed the adjacent former Underground substation, and the London Transport Lifts and Escalators department which had to move out to new premises. During the reconstruction works, 18 vehicles were outstationed at Stonebridge (SE). The last RT buses were transferred out in 1975, and until the beginning of the 1980s, Alperton had an entirely AEC Routemaster and Daimler Fleetline allocation. The first MCW Metrobuses arrived in 1981, and gradually replaced the DMS on all the routes, and would become the mainstay of the fleet for many years. Following the September 1982 service reductions, all the remaining RMs were transferred away to other garages, route 187 and 83 became one manned at the same time. Replacement Metrobuses were allocated to make up the allocation mainly used vehicles from Edgware (EW), Hanwell (HL), and Fulwell (FW), making the garage all Metrobus. By 1995, Alperton was doing most of the maintenance for the CentreWest operation and had also become the home of the training fleet. On 26 November 2011, route 79 passed to Metroline. On 28 April 2012, route 487 was transferred to this garage. =Uxbridge (UX)= Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart on route U5 in Uxbridge in August 2010 painted in the company's final livery, all-red with white First fleetnames, introduced in 2009 Uxbridge garage operated London bus routes 331, 607, A10, U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U10. History The original Uxbridge Garage was around half a mile out of town on the Oxford road and was built by the LGOC in 1921, but passed to Thames Valley a year later. The garage was taken back by the LGOC in 1929 to work its new local routes which were operated mainly by single deckers. An extension was added in the late 1940s and a new garage was planned, although work didn't begin until the 1980s. The new garage came into commission in late 1983 and is situated next to the underground station occupying the lower ground floor of a multi use building. In 1989 the garage began operating the U-Line network of local routes using 16 seater Mercedes Alexander midibuses (MAs) in an initiative by London Transport. The growth of use of the U-Line services over the years since 1989 has meant that larger buses have been put into service on these routes, in particular the U4 which has seen upgrades from MA's to DMLs (older Marshall versions) to the current fleet of double deck TNs. The garage also operated the busy 207 and (since 1991) the express version 607 from Uxbridge to Shepherds Bush (extended to White City Bus Station/Westfield London shopping centre since January 2009). In 1994 the garage was allocated some of London's first low-floor single decker, Dennis Lance SLF/Wright-bodied vehicles with CentreWest branding for the then operated route 222. =Westbourne Park (X)= AEC Routemaster on route 23 on the Strand, circa 2001 Westbourne Park garage operated London bus routes 9 (Heritage), 70 and 24-hour routes 23 and 295. History Westbourne Park Garage was part of the re-construction programme undertaken by London Transport in the early 1980s. As was common practice at the time, the new garage replaced two older garages - the small and inadequate Middle Row (X), and the larger former trolley bus depot at Stonebridge (SE). The new garage, which opened in 1981 in Great Western Road, and is of unusual design in that it is built beneath the elevated A40 Westway, the roof of the garage being profiled to match the concrete flyover. Originally, the garage allocation consisted of AEC Routemasters, and a small number of Daimler Fleetlines to B20 \\"quiet\\" specification for Route 18. These were supplemented in 1983 by a number of Leyland Titan of T class for comparative trials. When privatised Westbourne Park operated two routes operated by AEC Routemasters, 7 and 23. These were replaced by Dennis Trident 2s in July 2004 and September 2003 respectively. In November 2005 Westbourne Park commenced operating 9 Heritage with Routemasters. In November 2000, First CentreWest commenced operating route 27.

In the past it has also operated in the national rail industry. In 2008 the Group experienced severe trading difficulties which led to a team of corporate finance and restructuring experts from TLT Solicitors advising the ECT Group on a three phase restructuring including the refinancing of the business, the share sale of the recycling division and the share sale of its rail business. The 24 companies in the Group turning over more than ¬£70million and employing 1,100 were reduced to just eight, focused solely on transport. The ¬£15.5 million sale of ¬£47 million turnover business 'ECT Recycling' to AIM listed maintenance services contractor May Gurney and the share sale of ECT's rail business to British American Railway Services, a subsidiary of American rail operator Iowa Pacific Holdings, LLC (for an undisclosed sum), meant that the ECT Group returned to its Community Transport roots. Recycling In early 1995 ECT started its first green box recycling service, using a carton roughly the size of a milk crate, into which paper, glass, cans, foil, textiles, shoes, household batteries and engine oil can be placed, collected once a week by ECT. Materials are sorted into compartments on the recycling vehicle at the kerbside to avoid contamination and mix-up of items. This recycle from home service is now used by 860,000 people in sixteen local authority areas, across parts of London, Avon, Somerset, Warwickshire and the West Midlands. As well as doorstep green box recycling, ECT also runs flat recycling services, whereby a block of between 25-125 households has several recycling containers between them, and depots. These depots collect all the materials collected by the doorstep recycling service as well as items such as books, electrical items, fluorescent tubes, fridges, furniture, green waste, plastic waste, scrap metal, tyres, white goods, paint and wood. ECT has developed into a company with an annual turnover of around ¬£50million pounds, with 600 staff working in its recycling, community transport, engineering and refuse collection. Bus operations Ealing Community Transport was established in the 1970s to serve the small towns on the outskirts of Ealing. Due to a lack of revenue the service was shut down in the late 1990s. During the early 2000s it decreased its frequency to 15 minutes. ECT also experienced problems with vandalism and arson attacks on its buses, and came third from last in the best contractor survey. Initial problems with window etching were quickly addressed and ECT Bus was involved in Operation Eyesore in west London, in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police and TfL, where front-page images on local papers identified local vandals, leading to a number of convictions. Performance of the route was exemplary in terms of operated mileage (before traffic causes) and, despite operating through Southall, an area renowned for its challenging traffic environment, reliability was extremely good - at April 2006, ECT Bus was in second position in TfL's league table for smaller operators. The bus fleet for the 195 contract stood at 14 vehicles. From 14 March 2009 ECT stopped trading as a bus operator and its sole route is now being run by First London on a temporary contract. =Garage= ECT operated one garage in Greenford, which used to run London Buses route 195.

The Crane flows 8.5 miles (13.6 km) through three London boroughs: Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames. The drainage basin is heavily urbanised but the immediate old flood-meadows of the Crane Valley are a main \\"river corridor\\" in London - a continuous belt of semi-natural habitat. In common with many urban rivers, the Crane's form has been greatly altered, in its case over centuries, by river engineering: widening, narrowing, straightening, dredging, supplementing, adding a discharge channel, and bank reinforcement. Location The river's source is a point south of North Hyde Road in Hayes, Hillingdon, from where its course is near semi-circular to the south then east, joining the tidal Thames in two places: on the border of St Margarets with Isleworth and by Riverside Mill and Helene House, Isleworth.Ordnance Survey map, courtesy of English HeritageOpen Street Map Passing through Cranford, the river crosses Cranford Countryside Park, skirts the eastern side of Heathrow Airport's car parks (formerly the Cranford Heath part of Hounslow Heath) and North Feltham Lyson, Daniel. 1795. Heston, The Environs of London: vol. 3: County of Middlesex, pp. 22-45. british-history.ac.ukHounslow Online hounslowtw3.net , the latter split from Hounslow West on the other bank by most of what is left of Hounslow Heath; here the (Upper) Duke of Northumberland's River joins the Crane. From this point, the Crane turns gradually east and passes through Crane Park (in Whitton, Twickenham). In Crane Park is the site of the Hounslow Powder Mills which were built in the 16th century and continued to make gunpowder until 1927. The mills have disappeared, but the Shot Tower still stands nearby.Local History Notes. The River Crane and Gunpowder Mills. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-11-01. The large millpool on an island above the mills is now a Local Nature Reserve, Crane Park Island. The river then turns to the north-east in Twickenham to join the Thames at Isleworth with a distributary splitting off (forming a second section of the Duke's River) running through Kneller Gardens ‚Äî the Crane itself flows east through Cole Park in Twickenham on the border of St Margarets, where it forms its border with Isleworth. The Duke's River is tidal for the short distance below the weir by the bridge in Church Street, Isleworth, to its confluence with the Thames. Upstream in Isleworth it has been diverted to flow through Mogden Sewage Treatment Works, where it provides coolant for the power station. Treated effluent from the works is not discharged here but is instead piped to the Thames at Isleworth Ait. The Crane as to major parts delimits the London boroughs of *Hillingdon and Hounslow. *Hounslow and \\"Richmond\\". When extending the Piccadilly line from Hounslow West to Heathrow Airport, the high water table of the ground beneath the Crane made it impractical to tunnel under the river channel, so the lines emerge from tunnels. The Shot Tower in Crane Park Etymology Its name is interwoven with Cranford and may be from crane (bird)s. Associated watercourses * Duke of Northumberland's River: this man-made river has two distinct sections, constructed at different times. The Upper DNR is a tributary of the Crane but also a distributary of the River Colne, Hertfordshire. It flows from the Colne at Longford to the Crane at Hounslow. The Lower DNR is a distributary of the River Crane, flowing from the diffluence at Whitton to the Thames at Isleworth. * The Yeading Brook is the Crane's upper reach and is 16 miles (25.8 km) long. Before the 19th century it was also referred to as the River Fishbourne. It rises in the ground between the northwest London suburbs of Pinner and Harrow and also rises (in part) from Headstone Manor moat, and follows a meandering course through North Harrow, southern parts of Ruislip then through Ickenham Marsh nature reserve, before skirting Northolt Aerodrome west of Northolt. To the south of the aerodrome the Roxbourne Brook [also seen in maps as the Yeading Brook (East Arm)] joins it from Roxeth South Harrow. From here the Yeading Brook flows ESE through parkland separating Yeading from Hayes before finally turning south to pass through Bulls Brook Business Park, Hayes, which is its final stretch before becoming the Crane directly west of the A312 \\"The Parkway\\" and of the Bull's Bridge junction of arms of the Grand Union Canal. This junction is the tripoint of Hayes/Harlington/Cranford. * The Ickenham Stream flows into the Yeading Brook directly upstream of the A40 Western Avenue roadbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon. This watercourse was originally constructed in the early 19th Century to convey water from a Grand Junction Canal feeder reservoir which in the 1930s became Ruislip Lido. * Frogs Ditch flows from south west Hayes, crossing under the M4 motorway before running along the western and southern boundaries of Cranford Countryside Park to join the River Crane immediately upstream of the Cranford Lane road bridge at the southern end of the park. * The Whitton Brook flows into the River Crane at the Cole Park Allotments site.

Retrieved on 2011-11-01. ;2013 On 4 October 2013, a major local newspaper group covered an ongoing incident: Three days later, a temporary coffer dam of sandbags spanned the river, just north of the Piccadilly Line bridge. A bulk road tanker labelled \\"non-hazardous product\\" with flexible hoses was pumping out the water above this. The Crane Valley Partnership laterhttp://cranevalley.org.uk/news/post/update-on-river-crane-pollution- incident/ noted that the EA traced the source to a fractured main (probably caused by illegal ground works) of sewage sludge between the Mogden sewage works and Iver; escaping sludge drained into the river via legitimate Surface Water drains. Catchment partnership The Crane Valley Partnership (CVP) is the relevant 'Catchment Based Approach' (CaBA) catchment partnership providing the strategic co-ordination of efforts to manage and improve the River Crane and its tributaries, including enhancing biodiversity, water quality and quantity, connectivity, public access, community cohesion, and historical and educational opportunities. The CVP's origins lie with the West London Biodiversity Practitioners Group (WLBPG), derived from the partnership that formed during the work on the Hounslow Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP). The WLBPG held its first meeting on 13 November 2002, at Heathrow's Mayfield Farm classroom. The original members included: London Borough of Hounslow, London Borough Hillingdon, Groundwork Thames Valley, Syon Park Estate, Thames Water, Heathrow Airport Ltd, Glendale/British Airways, English Nature, London Wildlife Trust (LWT), Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). The main objective of this group was to encourage practical implementation of conservation work across West London. The group met again in February and July 2003. The partnership then evolved to become the River Crane Management Forum (RCMF), which had its first meeting on 15 June 2004. Members present were: *Environment Agency (EA) *Greater London Authority (GLA) *Heathrow Airport Landside Property Services **A Rocha, WSP for the above, Penny Anderson Associates. *Glendale for Heathrow Airport Landside Property Services *London Borough of Hounslow *London Wildlife Trust *Friends of the River Crane Environment (FORCE) *London Borough of Hillingdon *London Borough of Ealing These organisations had a mutual aspiration for joined-up action along the River Crane to improve water quality and biodiversity, as well as promoting the significance of the river corridor as part of the West London Green Chain. The Forum had another meeting on 20 July 2005, at which point the Crane Valley Partnership (CVP) was established. CVP has become hosted and chaired by the educational charity Green Corridor. In April 2013, the Partnership appointed a Development Manager who is employed through the charity, principally through ¬£400,000 pledged for spending over a course of years, by Thames Water after the 2011 incident. The CVP is formed of five London boroughs and public, voluntary and private stakeholders, working towards a shared vision: for a well-managed and high quality river corridor which is accessible to all, in which wildlife can thrive and local people can take pride and ownership.

In September 1994 it was sold to the Go-Ahead Group. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the Go- Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo. Garages London Central operates five bus garages. =Bexleyheath (BX)= As at December 2019, Bexleyheath garage operated routes 51, 89, 132, 244, 321 (night service only on this 24-hour route), 486, 625, 658, B11 and B16. History Built as a trolleybus depot by the London Passenger Transport Board, Bexleyheath was the only new garage built for trolleybuses. The depot is a large and imposing building, slightly set back from the main road to enable parking on the forecourt, which was used as a terminus for route 122. Bexleyheath closed in 1986, with work transferred to Catford, Plumstead and Sidcup garages. In 1988 it re-opened under the guise of Bexleybus, a unit set up by London Buses under de- regulation, and had a large and varied allocation from Iveco/Robin Hoods and MCW Metroriders to Leyland Olympians and Daimler Fleetlines. The move to set up the new company to tender for routes backfired, and in the next round of tendering only route B16 was awarded to Bexleybus, whilst London Central won nine. London Central took control of Bexleyheath garage and routes in 1990. Lately the garage has had a good utilisation figure, up to 139 in 2001 which necessitated parking in the rear yard and the forecourt. In January 2007, the garage received its first Alexander Dennis Enviro400s for use on route 486. This garage also houses one of the companies iBus hubs, controlling routes for Bexleyheath, Morden Wharf, New Cross, and Peckham garages. =New Cross (NX)= As at December 2019, New Cross garage operated routes 21, 36, 108, 171, 172, 321 (day time service only), 343, 436, 453, N21, N89, N136, N171 and N343. History Said to be the largest of London's bus garages with space for over 300 buses, New Cross garage was originally a tram depot and opened in 1906. In 1952 with the trams withdrawn, the depot was converted into a bus garage. The garage has never been even close to its capacity due to the close proximity of other garages, but has at various times been used to store surplus vehicles. The garage allocation has fluctuated over the years, from 191 in 1966 to 132 in 2001. The garage also houses some of the private hire fleet which is painted in the style of the former London General company. New Cross was also the garage for two special services, first in 1972 when it operated en ex Tilling ST on route 100 and LPG East Lancs Myllennium bodied DAF SB220s for Millennium Dome services M1 and M2. In 2003 the garage also began operating Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses on route 436. In January 2005 route 36 ceased to be operated by AEC Routemasters with one man operated double deckers taking over. =Camberwell (Q)= As at May 2020, Camberwell garage operated routes 12, 35, 40, 42, 100, 176, 185, 188, 360, 507, 521, 624, 658 and X68. On 30 April 2016, route 345 passed to Abellio London. History Although built in 1914, Camberwell garage was not used as a bus garage until 1919 as it had been requisitioned for the war effort. Once it came into use it was one of London's largest garages and also carried out body overhauls in 1940/41. The garage was bombed during World War II in 1940 with four buses being destroyed and 13 seriously damaged. During the early 1950s the garage underwent modernisation with the welfare and operational block reconstructed and the parking area extended. The new building also incorporated a new pit and workshop layout in a separate self- contained block which also undertook heavy maintenance for the adjacent Walworth garage, 350 buses in all. The allocation at Camberwell decreased slightly over the years from 165 in 1952 until the closure of Walworth garage in 1985 increased the allocation to 142. Camberwell was also the home of three Leyland Titans fitted with electronic blinds which were used on night bus standby duties. New Routemasters were introduced on route 12 from 28 March 2015. New Routemasters were introduced on route 68 from 5 February 2016. =Peckham (PM)= As at May 2020, Peckham garage operated routes 37, 63, 363, N63, P12 and N1. History Peckham garage was converted from a local authority maintenance depot and opened in 1994 with a capacity for 75 buses. In 2000 the garage put London's first Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TL low- floor vehicles into service on 63. Peckham won bus garage of the year in 2004, although this turned out to be a poisoned chalice for the garage, losing almost half of its work in the next year's tender awards. =Morden Wharf (MG)= As of December 2019, Morden Wharf garage operated routes 1, 108, 129, 178, 180, 225, 286, 291, 386 and N1.

First Essex was criticised by passengers and members of the Southend Area Bus Users' Group for withdrawing services which it considered no longer economically viable when Southend Borough Council withdrew bus subsidies as part of budget cuts in 2005. First said it was due to low passenger numbers, even when parts of the route were profitable. Further criticism came from passengers when First Essex and Arriva Southend decided to withdraw their \\"Day Rover\\" ticket, which allowed unlimited journeys on the day of purchase on buses operated by both companies, regardless of which company issued the ticket, so that day tickets could only be used on the buses of the company that issued them. They replaced it with a more expensive \\"Octopus\\" ticket, issued by and can be used on any buses operated by companies running in the general Southend area.  Current Depots First Essex operates four bus depots in the city of Chelmsford and towns of Basildon, Colchester and Hadleigh. The outstation at Great Dunmow has closed, with services transferring to Chelmsford depot. The Harwich Depot was closed in late 2013, all of its services are now run by the Clacton and Colchester depots. The Braintree depot was closed in late 2015.

It was built in 2016 to replace the old garage on Queen Street which was on the site of the Theatre Royal, burnt down circa 1917. Buses were kept in the old Colchester Corporation tram shed at Magdalen Street after it was vacated by Network Colchester in 2006. This ceased in July 2009 when the yard next door was used instead, also previously occupied by Network Colchester. First had another Colchester site at Haven Road, which was mainly used for engineering. This has since been bought by a local company that is not transport orientated, but then in 2015 First demolished the old timber yard [its former use] and built a new bus garage. Until 1973, Eastern National had a one bus outstation at West Mersea, acquired from Primrose Bus Service in 1935. The building there survives, but in 1979 it was heavily modified, to become part of a new leisure centre. Service buses still terminate outside, and locals still refer to it as West Mersea bus station. Until 1969, Eastern National also had a one bus outstation in Victoria Place, Brightlingsea. This was acquired with the business of Berry & Sons in 1937. =Hadleigh= Hadleigh garage operates routes: 20, 21/B, 22, 25(Few Workings Sat), 26, 27/A/X, 28 and school services 820, 821, 822 and 827 History Hadleigh garage is located on London Road, just west of Hadleigh shopping centre. It is a former Westcliff on Sea Motor Services depot, controlled by Eastern National from 1955. Hadleigh took on the work of Canvey (CY) depot in April 1978. Canvey has since become a transport museum. Hadleigh further expanded its operations in 1992, after Southend (Prittlewell) (PL) depot was closed. The predecessor of Prittlewell, Southend (SD) depot on London Road, closed in 1987, and has now disappeared under a Sainsbury's store. Former Depots =Braintree= Braintree garage operated routes X32, 17, 21/A, 30, 70, 131, 132, 302, 306, 318, 347, and Yellow School Bus service 509. History The former depot, on Springwood Drive, opened in April 2005. It replaced the long-standing premises on Fairfield Road, in Braintree town centre, which was redeveloped for retail/residential use. Springwood Drive was originally an outstation of Chelmsford, consisting of a secure yard and portakabin. There were vehicle washing facilities and fuelling but heavy maintenance was done at Chelmsford. The portakabin had previously been at Maldon outstation (closed 2004). In 2009, First re-opened a full depot in Braintree, behind the secure yard in Springwood Drive. This contained washing/fuelling facilities and heavy maintenance facilities, while the Secure Yard now houses the 'reserve' fleet. Fairfield Road had originally been used by Hicks Brothers, a bus operator which Eastern National took over in 1949. A house adjacent to the old depot site survives, to remind us of a link with the Hicks era. =Clacton= Clacton depot operated routes 5/B, 7/X, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 74, 76 and Former Harwich depot Routes 3, 4, 20/A, 22A/B. History Clacton depot has been at Telford Road, on the Gorse Lane Industrial Estate since 1988, at premises previously occupied by Coastal Red, a competitor on the Tendring Peninsular bought by Eastern National. Telford Road replaced the garage at Castle Road, near Clacton town centre, which was redeveloped as flats. There was an outstation of Clacton at Walton-on-the-Naze, until May 1996. This was a small garage at Kino Road, just off the seafront, and housed 4 vehicles. Walton had the depot code of WN. Walton garage was demolished in 1998, with bungalows built on the site. However the enquiry office survives, as a gift shop. The predecessor of Walton garage was Warners Iron Foundry at Naze Park Road, a building stands to this day. This had its origins with Silver Queen. The depot closed on Saturday 28 July 2018. =Great Dunmow= This outstation operated route 33. History Dunmow was an outstation of Braintree. It reopened in 2008, having been closed in 2004, after the new Chelmsford depot opened. It is located on the premises of Dons Coaches. =Harwich= Harwich garage in February 2013 Harwich garage formerly ran routes 3, 4, 20/A, 22A/B, 103, 104 and school service 193 and C30.

In 2009, it was sold to the Go-Ahead Group. History East Thames Buses was formed in 1999 to take over the services operated by the failed Harris Bus. It was then retained as an accredited operator to operate services in the event of their contracted operator being unable to do so.

When MA (Mandela Way - West) closed on 30 April 2010 it operated the following types of buses: *Volvo B7TL 10m/Plaxton President (VP - Route 185, occasionally used on route 1) *Volvo B7TL 10.6m/Wright Eclipse Gemini (VWL - Normally route 1) *Scania N94UB 10.7m/East Lancs Myllennium (ELS - Route 42) *Dennis Dart/Plaxton Pointers (on loan from London General) Following on from Ash Grove's role, Mandela Way serviced the East Thames Buses fleet. In the last few months of East Thames Operation, route 1 moved next door to Mandela Way - East (MW) (the original London General depot) but were still maintained by the East Thames engineers. Most of the routes once operated by Mandela Way - West were reallocated to London Central's & London General's other garages. The only exception was route 393 which has put back out to tender shortly after East Thames Buses took over the running of route 201 and moved to Mandela Way. =Belvedere (BV)= Belvedere garage was leased by Harris Bus in 1998 to house its operations that moved from Crayford. Harris Bus went into receivership in December 1999, and its routes and garage were taken over by East Thames Buses. This garage has a peak vehicle requirement of 15 buses and operates routes 180 and part of 669 and N1. On 22 January 2011 route 244 transferred from London Central's Bexleyheath garage. Belvedere has always been classed as a satellite garage from an engineering point of view with very little routine maintenance ever taking place there, however limited engineering facilities existed at up until its parent garage changing to Bexleyheath.

Shortly after arriving in California in August 1850, he contracted cholera and died on August 18, 1850, in the Hangtown Gold Camp, later known as Placerville. He was buried there in an unmarked grave. Probate records show that at his death he owned six slaves and was a commercial hemp farmer. James's death left his family saddled with debts and many of his possessions, including one of the slaves, were auctioned off to pay them. His widow Zerelda married Benjamin Simms, a wealthy farmer, on September 30, 1852. This, however, did not last and they soon separated.

Nefta is a pilgrimage center to which pilgrims travel throughout the year. There is a Folk Festival in April and a Date Festival in November/December. Nefta is the religious center of the Bled el Djerid, the \\"Land of Palms\\", with more than 24 mosques and 100 marabouts. The marabouts still attract pilgrims from all over southern Tunisia and even from Algeria. This great veneration of the marabouts reflects the continuing vigor of Sufism, the movement which grew up in the 12th century around Sufi Abu Madian (d. 1197). The name of the Sufis came from the simple woolen garment (suf) they wore. They believed that the adherents of Islam, a religion of the desert, should show particular modesty of behavior and asceticism, and were much given to mysticism, the veneration of holy men, spiritual contemplation and meditation. Sufism is also marked by religious forms taken over from the pre-Islamic, animistic religions of the Berber population which orthodox Islam seeks to repress - belief in spirits, witchcraft, fortune-telling, the efficacy of amulets, etc. Regional variants of Sufism were propagated by holy men, who frequently founded their own brotherhoods, with centers for the teaching of disciples. They are credited with numerous miracles and revered for their holiness, and their tombs (marabouts) are places of pilgrimage, attracting varying numbers of pilgrims according to their reputation. In the past these holy men were also appealed to as judges in the conflicts which frequently occurred between the nomadic tribes and the settled population of the oases. Nefta is the last stronghold of this Sufism, and is sometimes called, with some justification, the \\"Kairouan of the South\\". The marabouts venerated here are scattered about throughout the old town of Nefta and the oasis. During the Roman Empire the town then known as Nefte was the seat of a Christian bishopric, which functioned till the end of the 7th century.  The town  Nefta is divided into two parts by a small oued and a depression at its northern end. To the east of the oued is the new town, with the old souk quarter at its southwestern corner; to the west, on the slopes of a hill, is the old town. The main road from Tozeur runs through the new town as Avenue Habib Bourguiba, which then crosses the oued and skirts the old town. At its western end a street branches off on the right, ascends the hill, goes round the old town and the sand-bowl, and returns to Avenue Habib Bourguiba. Nefta is a town of cube-shaped, flat-roofed houses huddled closely together, with Tozeur-style decoration. In some of the streets the upper stories of the houses, borne on round- headed arches, project over the street, forming a kind of tunnel which offers protection from the sun. It is planned to restore the old town in the very near future.  History  Nefta is believed to have been settled originally by shepherds who came from the kingdom of Napata. The Romans and later the Byzantines built forts in the oasis (Nepte) to provide protection against raids by desert nomads. In Byzantine times Nefta and Tozeur were episcopal sees. In the mid-7th century Nefta was conquered by the Arabs and, in spite of fierce resistance, converted to Islam. A Christian community was however recorded as late as 1194 In subsequent centuries Nefta prospered as an important staging-point for caravans (for a time the most important in Tunisia). Its decline began in the 15th century as a result of more frequent raids by nomadic tribes and the general falling off in the caravan trade. With the coming of the French in 1881, however, Nefta experienced a renewal. The salt-flats near Nefta were used as a filming location for the Star Wars saga in the late 20th century.

She was appointed to the Privy Council in 1949. Early life Summerskill was educated at King's College London and was admitted to medical school at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School, one of the earliest women to be admitted to medical school. She was one of the founders of the Socialist Health Association which spearheaded the National Health Service (1948). She pressed for equal rights for women in the British Home Guard. In 1938, she was involved with the Married Women's Association to promote equality in marriage. It was formed as a splinter group that was created with Juanita Frances as its first chair. She became its first president. Parliament Summerskill entered politics at 32 when she was asked to fight the Green Lanes ward in Harringay in the Middlesex County Council elections. She then served as a councillor on Middlesex County Council from 1934 until 1941. She stood for a seat in the House of Commons unsuccessfully at the Putney byelection in 1934 and Bury at the 1935 general election, before becoming Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Fulham West at a by-election in 1938 thanks to the working women's vote. She caused some disquiet by taking the seat in her maiden name. When the Fulham West constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, she was returned to the House of Commons as MP for Warrington. Summerskill was included in Clement Attlee's Labour government following the election victory in 1945. She served as a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Food, and was later promoted to the Ministry of Social and National Insurance, heading the department she was profiled as the Minister of National Insurance, however she was not a cabinet minister. As well as her service in government, Summerskill also served on the House of Commons Political Honours Scrutiny Committee from 1967 to 1976. Summerskill served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food (1945‚Äì50) and as Minister of National Insurance (1950‚Äì51). She was a member of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee from 1944 to 1958 and served as Chair of the Labour Party 1954-5). She left the House of Commons in 1961 and was created a life peer as Baroness Summerskill, of Ken Wood in the County of London on 4 February 1961. Furthermore, she was awarded an additional honour being initiated into the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1966. Summerskill appears in a specially selected list of Fabian Society members from 1942 to 1947, showing continuity and prestige. An active feminist, she was instrumental in promoting women's causes throughout that period, starting with the Clean Milk Act in 1949. Later, as the president of the Married Women's Association, she campaigned in and outside the parliament to assure the equal rights of housewives and of divorced women, which resulted in the Married Women's Properties Act in 1964 and the Matrimonial Homes Act in 1967. Letters to my daughter During the 1950s, Summerskill wrote a series of letters to her daughter Shirley, who, like her mother, was an active feminist. Shirley studied medicine in Oxford at that time and later became a doctor and a Member of Parliament and of Cabinet. Edith Summerskill's letters to Shirley were collected and published in a book Letters to My Daughter (1957). Summerskill outlines her belief that women are superior to men in almost every way. In support of such a theory Summerskill presents three \\"facts\\": firstly, that only women can enjoy two worlds of creative enterprise the biological and the intellectual. Secondly she suggests women are physically stronger, live longer are constitutionally tougher, having greater stamina. Finally she believes women have equal if not greater intellect than men. Although Summerskill's book contains only Edith's letters to her daughter, the mother's response to questions raised by the daughter creates a sense of an ongoing dialogue between the two, concerning issues of education for women, equality and achievements. In reply to Shirley's question about the part that married women are playing in the affairs of the country, her mother writes: > \\"The insistent demand of women for recognition in spheres of work outside > the home, which has quietly but unremittingly been advanced in the course of > the last hundred years, has grudgingly been conceded. As a doctor and a > Member of Parliament I am fully conscious of the fact that the doors both of > the medical schools and of the House of Commons had to be forced by furious > and frustrated women before their claims were recognized. It would be quite > inaccurate to suggest that we were welcomed into the universities or into > public life.\\"(143) Summerskill constantly struggles for and raises consciousness about women's equal rights. In response to Shirley's complaint about \\"the stock question\\" of the anti-feminists, \\"Why have not more women achieved eminence in the arts and sciences?\\" She answers: \\"Personally I am astounded that so many have distinguished themselves despite the conditions which society has imposed upon them\\" (181). Summerskill maintains that in spite of the difficulties and prejudices, women are making progress and have achievements in music, visual art, and literature as well as some advancement in science and technology (181). Yet Summerskill's conclusion in 1956 is similar to the one Virginia Woolf reached twenty-five years earlier. Woolf claims that even when all the outward obstacles are overcome, she, or any other a woman, has not solved the problem of \\"my own experiences as a body\\" (1942: 206); Edith Summeskill makes the parallel concession that for a woman, the \\"most powerful force, which takes her off the course\\" is the \\"biological urge to have a family\\" (187). Personal life Summerskill was married in 1925 to Dr Jeffrey Samuel. Their children took their mother's surname. Her daughter, Shirley Summerskill, also served as a physician, member of parliament and government minister. Her grandson Ben Summerskill became Chief Executive of the British gay equality charity Stonewall in 2003.

Among his many innovations and timekeeping improvements, Simon Willard is best known for inventing the eight-day patent timepiece that came to be known as the gallery or banjo clock. Early life Simon Willard was of the fifth Willard generation in America. The original Willard family had arrived in 1634 from Horsmonden, Kent (England), and they were among the founders of Concord, Massachusetts. Simon Willard's parents were Benjamin Willard and Sarah Brooks, who were Grafton natives. Like all of the Willard brothers, Simon was born on the family farm in Grafton, on April 3, 1753. He was the second son; his brothers were Benjamin, Aaron, and Ephraim. The farm, now operated as the Willard House and Clock Museum, had been built in 1718 by the Willards' third American generation. When Simon Willard was born, the house had just one room. The elder brother, Benjamin, who was 10 years older than Simon, learned horology and opened a workshop adjacent to the house in 1766. It is presumed that the other Willard brothers were taught horology by Benjamin. At the age of eleven Simon began to study horology, showing some inherent aptitude for it. A year later, Benjamin hired an Englishman named Morris to teach horology‚Äîparticularly to Simon. Years afterward, Simon revealed that Morris did not actually know much on the matter and that his brother Benjamin had been his actual mentor. After one more year, Simon built his first tall clock. Like some other contemporary horologists, the Willards divided their lives between farm chores and the clock business. As the latter became profitable, Benjamin set up a workshop in Lexington, Massachusetts, in 1767. Simon Willard managed his own business in Grafton; some clocks survive bearing the maker's mark \\"Simon Willard, Grafton.\\" At his workshop in Grafton, Willard studied the clocks by other makers which were brought to him to be repaired. He extensively experimented, seeking to improve the efficiency of the driving and the regulation parts of those timepieces' parts. The smallest clock of the time was the bracket clock, which influenced Simon's gallery clock, which he patented in 1802. His next creation was the shelf clock, which was based on his gallery clock. A pioneer American industry In about 1780, Simon Willard moved to 2196 Roxbury Street in Boston (later known as Washington Street), and set up a four-room workshop on his own. Soon thereafter, his brother Aaron settled in the same neighborhood, a quarter mile away. In 1784, Willard advertised: \\"Simon Willard opened a shop in Roxbury Street, nearly facing the road which turns off to Plymouth. There, Simon Willard carries on the clockmaking business, in all its branches.\\" Like Aaron, Simon was still interested in perfecting the mechanism of compact clocks. Nonetheless, from the 1790s onward, Willard's workshop also built tall clocks in great numbers while also performing general clock repair. Simon Willard Roxbury Tall Case Clock. Circa 1793.

Louisa May, 1793.‚Äù Dial signed ‚ÄúSimon Willard.‚Äù Simon and Aaron Willard both combined 18th century knowledge of horology with then-contemporary industrial methods (pre- cast parts, template usage, labor division, standardized production, efficient management). Simon and Aaron Willard each developed an industrial zone, throughout a quarter-mile radius around their shops. By 1807, twenty factories in Boston were sub-contracted to supply parts or materials to the Willard brothers' businesses. This included mahogany (from nearby mills), clock parts (amongst which 20 cabinetmakers were), gilder works, and other important artistic resources. Both Willard brothers utilized the same suppliers and often even shared the same workers. Since the early United States lacked vital raw materials‚Äîmost particularly brass‚Äîmost clockmakers either fabricated their movements from wood or other inferior materials, or they imported parts and entire movements from English suppliers and assembled them into the locally- produced mahogany clock cases. By their quality, the clocks of Boston became a status symbol. Americans were eager to buy clocks for parlors, offices, churches, or other public spaces. Simon Willard's clocks were the most famous in America. However, they were still too expensive for most people. Indeed, Simon Willard preferred to build sumptuous models that featured elaborate artistic details (especially brass trim). Simon Willard's clocks required considerable skilled handcraftsmanship, and their movements were outstandingly precise. His own skills were considerable, and he was able to file cogwheels without leaving file-marks, producing mechanisms with a margin of error of just thirty seconds over the course of a month. By about 1810, both Simon and Aaron were producing clocks which as good as those being produced in Europe. Simon's workshop produced fewer clocks than did Aaron's, and today the higher prices that Simon's clocks reach at auction reflect their superior refinement. Simon Willard personally interviewed his customers, evaluating each detail, and he ordered his technicians to extensively test each movement in the customer's own home. Into each clock, Simon included a brochure, instructions, and a written guarantee. Any necessary technical support was included with the timepiece's purchase. Although Simon knew little about advertising, he promoted his workshop through leaflets which were affixed inside the cases. He touted: \\"These clocks are made in the best manner. They run for a year and they don't wind up. We will give evidence that it is much cheaper to buy new clocks than to buy old or second hand clocks. Simon Willard warrants all his clocks.\\" Nonetheless, over the years his maker's signature has occasionally become lost or obscured from his clocks. The clocks A c. 1810 Simon Willard gallery clock in the lobby of the West Wing of the White House. =Longcase clocks= Simon Willard built longcase clocks which were quite sumptuous, being adorned with many fine details. In the most expensive tall clock units, the mahogany cases had a mid-18th century English style and, bearing exactly similar English brass mechanisms all, their case complexity determined their final price. Distinctively for Willard's workshop, above the clock's top fretwork, three pedestals were, on which two spherical finials and a large bird figure were mounted. In addition, like Aaron, Simon built a glass dial door, whose top had a half arch shape. Onto the dial, Boston painters painted different motifs. Also, with few extra mechanism, amusing wheels with animated figures were featured on the dial, enticing the customer interest effectively. During his career, Willard manufactured 1,200 tall models. However, after 1802, in which the gallery clock was finally patented, he spurned the manufacture of the tall clock, which was thereafter produced only by special commission. =Patent Timepiece, or \\"banjo\\" clocks= Simon Willard invented the Patent Timepiece, later called the \\"banjo\\" clock, at Roxbury. It was America's first commercially successful wall clock. It was an innovative design. It was the first American eight-day wall clock, the first American wallclock to have the pendulum suspended in front of the weight in the case, and the first American wallclock to have the weight attached to a pulley. The brass clock mechanism was reduced to a much smaller size, therefore saving brass which was in scarce supply in the early 19th century. Its shape was an imitation of the traditional wheel barometers. Early Patent Timepieces were built by hand, to order. By 1805 the clockworks, and standard cases, could be produced in quantity, reducing the cost of the clock. Its small size meant a much lower price of 30 dollars, although this was still a large amount of money. Nonetheless, while American consumerism was arising, Simon's Patent Timepiece revolutionized the clock industry, becoming the most popular clock in the United States, whereas Europe lacked some counterpart of it. Willard patented its creation quite late (1802) but most competitors of Simon dodged this document, reaping much money with their own versions of the Patent Timepiece. However, Simon never filed a demand against such usage. After 1802, in Simon's workshop, the smaller Banjo and shelf clocks were the bread and butter models while Simon pursued his other great projects, throughout the United States. Eventually, Willard's workshop manufactured 4,000 small timepieces (Banjo and shelf clocks). Since its patenting, the Patent Timepiece remained with the same original design. Typically, they were surrounded by glass tablets, which were reversely painted with neoclassical motifs. Additionally, Willard expanded the Banjo clock in accordance with the patent, making much larger \\"seconds beating\\" regulators. =The shelf clock= Before creating the Banjo model, Simon designed a shelf clock (1780s, Grafton). It was similar to the tall model, with its original hood and base, but lacking its middle body. The shortened shelf clocks had lower prices, too, and they were commercially successful. Shelf models were produced until approximately 1830. =The lighthouse clock= A unique Empire lighthouse clock in mahogany case, at the White House library. In 1818 he invented and patented a type of mantel clock, known as the lighthouse clock and regarded as the first alarm clock produced in America.Bob Jackman, The Lighthouse Clocks of Simon Willard (2002): in Antiques and the Arts Online Originally known as the \\"Patent Alarm Timepiece\\", they have become known as lighthouse clocks (a 20th-century term) for their obvious similarities. The design of the cases were based on the Classical art then in vogue; Neoclassicism and Empire. Some of these clocks, however, are less formal and reflect the vernacular interest in painted furniture, particularly Windsor chairs. It is worth mention, an unusual exemplary displayed in one of the bookshelves of the White House library, made by the clockmaker to commemorate the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States in 1824-25. A likeness of Lafayette appears in a medallion on its base. Renowned work =United States Senate (1801) = For the United States Capitol in Washington, the Senate requested Simon Willard to build a large gallery clock. Subsequently, he was invited both to set the clock up and to show its working. Eventually, this trip had particular importance because Simon Willard became acquainted with President Thomas Jefferson. After that they became close friends. =Thomas Jefferson (1801‚Äì1802)= Among their first correspondence, in 1801 Thomas Jefferson alerted Simon Willard that his banjo timepiece hadn't yet been patented. Subsequently, on November 25, 1801, Willard made his application to the US Patent Office. The patent was both granted and issued on February 8, 1802. It was signed by President Jefferson, Secretary of State James Madison, and Attorney General Levi Lincoln. In subsequent years, Simon Willard visited Thomas Jefferson at his home, Monticello, near Charlottesville, Virginia. There they held many conversations. On one occasion, Thomas Jefferson invited Willard to chop a young tree down. Subsequently, Jefferson transformed it into a cane. It was given a silver mount that read: \\"Thomas Jefferson to Simon Willard, Monticello.\\" Old South Meeting House's Willard gallery clock, now at Old South Church. =Old South Meeting House= Minister Joseph Eckley and the congregation of Old South Meeting House in Boston, the site of planning for the Boston Tea Party, commissioned Willard to build a carved and gilded gallery clock to hang opposite the pulpit on the balustrade of the room's south gallery. The clock was capped with a spread eagle, carved in high relief and gilded, and measures 32\\" in height. The clock was delivered c. 1805, and remained within the meeting house until 1872, when the congregation moved to Old South Church in Boston's Back Bay. A replica has since replaced the original clock within the Old South Meeting House, now a museum on Boston's Freedom Trail. =Harvard College= For 50 years, Willard was responsible for the periodic maintenance of all clocks at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Additionally, he oversaw Harvard's management of its clocks. Willard presented two clocks to Harvard. One was a tall-case clock; the other was a wall-mounted regulator clock that was installed in a room near University Hall. A particular incident relates to Harvard's Great Orrery which was malfunctioning. Many craftsmen had unsuccessfully attempted to repair it, until finally Harvard's authorities offered an important reward to Simon if he was able to fix it. For days, Willard analyzed the device. He fixed the orrery by drilling a hole and fastening a rivet. The satisfied authorities asked: \\"Now, Mr. Willard. How much do we owe you?\\" Willard simply answered: \\"Oh. About a ninepence will do, I guess.\\" =The University of Virginia (1826)= In 1826, Thomas Jefferson requested that Simon Willard build a clock for the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. The clock was to be a turret one and would be placed into the university's rotunda. Jefferson provided all of the clock's plans and specifications. According to these plans, Willard precisely assembled all the clock's pieces. The clock was installed in 1827. Jefferson, however, did not live to see the operating clock because he died in July, 1826. In 1895 a blaze destroyed both the university's building and Willard's clock. =Former President James Madison (1827) = At his home, Montpelier, in Orange, Virginia, former President Madison received Simon Willard. Madison gifted Willard with a second illustrious cane. Its mounting was silvered, and it read \\"Presented by James Madison, Ex-President of the United States, to Simon Willard, May 29, 1827.\\" Carlo Franzoni's 1819 sculptural chariot clock, the Car of History depicting Clio, muse of history, recording the proceedings of the house. Fitted with a clock mechanism by Simon Willard in 1837. =United States Capitol (1837)= After an official request, in 1837 the last two of Simon Willard's important works were again destined for the United States Capitol. Although Willard was already 84 years old, he travelled to personally install both. One clock was placed into the Old Senate Chamber but was later installed in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. The other was a bare mechanism, designed to fit into the preexisting case sculpted by Carlo Franzoni in 1819 and titled \\"Car of History\\"; it depicts Clio, the Greek muse of history in a chariot. It is located above the east entrance to the old chamber of the House of Representatives, now called National Statuary Hall. Both clocks are still operational. Inventions The gallery, or banjo, clock had been invented years before, in Grafton, but its patent was issued in 1802. The original model had been called the Grafton wall clock. Later, it was also known as the Improved Timepiece. In 1816, its patent expired. Immediately after arriving to Boston, Willard developed a movable mechanism to turn meat on a spit, the roasting jack, which was specifically designed for outdoor fireplaces. For it, he reduced the traditional English Lantern clock, simplifying its components. Willard's clock jack was patented, on July 2, 1764, and the document was inked by John Hancock. The third clock which was patented by Willard was the Patent Alarm Timepiece, which was also known as the Lighthouse and which was similar to the English Skeleton Timepiece. Marriages =Hannah Willard= Simon Willard married Hannah Willard on November 29, 1776. She was a 20 years old Grafton native. Their lone son was born in 1777, on February 6, and he was named Isaac Watts Willard. =Mary Bird= In 1787, Simon Willard married again, to Mary Bird, a 24-year-old Boston native. Of their sons, both Benjamin and Simon continued their father's craft. Succeeding Willard generations continued successfully as horologists. Beginning in 1828, Simon Willard Jr. (1795‚Äì1874) apprenticed in horology at his father's shop; he subsequently established his own workshop in Boston. Also, he specialized in both watches and chronometers, while his foremost jobs were Harvard's astronomical clock and the astronomical regulator which standardized the time for all New England's railroads. Last years In 1839, Simon Willard retired. He sold his business to Elnathan Taber, his apprentice. Furthermore, Taber received the business' name too. On August 30, 1848, Simon Willard died in Boston. He was 95 years old. Because of his commercial traits, Simon finished his life with just five hundred dollars. However, simultaneously all other competing clock manufacturers had benefitted from producing the Banjo Clock massively, although the corresponding royalties were never claimed by Willard. Legacy *Nowadays, Simon Willard's clocks are recognized as American masterpieces. As such, they are avidly sought by both antiquarians and museums. In perfect condition, a Simon Willard's clock is usually sold from $50,000 up to $250,000. *The Willard brothers revolutionized clock manufacturing by both division of labor and by using multiple previously molded parts. However, it is commonly accepted that historically their clocks weren't definitively popular. Instead, Eli Terry popularized clock ownership, among common American people. Museums =Willard House and Clock Museum= The Grafton farm which held the original Willard family's workshop is open to the public and has become a museum, the Willard House and Clock Museum, which exhibits over 90 original clocks and many Willards' heirlooms too. =Old Sturbridge Village= The J. Cheney Wells Clock Gallery is located at Old Sturbridge Village, Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The 122-clock collection ranges from 1725 up to 1825. Some pieces are valuated above hundreds of thousands of dollars. The collection features several clocks attributed to Simon Willard. =National Watch and Clock Museum= The National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania, houses several Simon Willard clocks. =Dedham Historical Society= The Dedham Historical Society in Dedham, Massachusetts, owns a Chippendale brass-mounted mahogany astronomical wall clock by Simon Willard: Engraving date 1780-81; perpetual calendar begins 1780. Simon Willard's Stamp On January 24, 2003, with its American Design Series, the US Postal Service issued a commemorative 10 cent stamp which features a Banjo clock, thus remembering Simon Willard.

Originally created as Soci√©t√© centrale pour l'√©quipement du territoire in 1955 and developing transportation activities since 1973, Transdev was a subsidiary Caisse des D√©p√¥ts et Consignations, a French stated-owned financial institution. On 3 March 2011, the group merged with Veolia Transport, one of its main competitors, into Veolia Transdev. During 2013, Veolia Transdev was renamed Transdev, recognising the planned withdrawal of Veolia Environnement from ownership of the group. As part of this merger, the RATP Group, a minority shareholder in Transdev, took direct ownership of a number of former Transdev operations in lieu of a cash payment. Transdev was also a shareholder of Transamo, a transport engineering and consultancy firm in Europe, which specialises in the project management of public transport projects in France. It was passed onto Veolia Transdev after the merger. Soci√©t√© de Transports intercommunaux de Bruxelles (STIB) is the other major shareholder of Transamo. Key figures As of the time of the merger with Veolia Transport, the group had 47,000 employees and had an annual revenue of ‚Ç¨2.5 billion. It had operations in France (representing 39% of its revenue, 18,200 employees), the Netherlands (33% of its revenue, 14,700 employees), the United Kingdom (11%), Italy (6%), Portugal (5%) and also in Germany, Australia, Canada, Spain and Morocco. Its fleet included, by its own account, 15,642 buses and water taxis, 542 subway carriages, trams and trains and 4,581 demand responsive service vehicles.

The game's influences draw heavily from the occult, with the Master Therion in the plot below a reference to Aleister Crowley. To finish the game, the player must invoke numerous demons who are based on their \\"real\\" counterparts, e.g. Belezbar is based on Beelzebub. Plot From the instruction booklet: > Axil the Able stood in three inches of stagnant water and surveyed one of > the most dismal dungeons he had ever been thrown into‚Ä¶ 30 seconds earlier, > he was sitting in front of the ox-roast in that famed haunt of the Occult, > The Golden Thurible engaged in his favourite pastime of Wizard-Baiting. What > a good story Axil was telling ‚Äî a new one about Therion, a certain moon > creature and a rather gullible Elf ‚Äî really, the sudden silence of his > audience should have warned him. The crowd parted as Therion strode across > the floor, dangerous in all his ten degrees. Therion raised a twig-like > index finger and flung Axil several hundred leagues across Graumerphy, into > the dungeons beneath the dreary castle called Collodon's Pile. In the dark > twilight, Axil tutted ‚Äî and then took stock. He was, at least, clothed: he > carried a large leather pouch, and on a nearby table, there was a book. The > title read as follows: The Net of Gugamon ‚Äî a grimoire: wherein is contained > the proper rites for the Convocation of various Demonly Princes, the > procurement of lesser spirits, together with sundry workings, conjurations, > manifestations, symbols relating to all manner of Astral Phenomena and so on > for several more pages, in the rather turgid style thought necessary for > such books. Unfortunately, apart from the title, there seemed to be little > more than a rather tattered contents page. But they didn't call him Axil the > Able for nothing. So, with a flourish, he marched for the door in search of > a way out. Gameplay The player controls the neophyte wizard Axil the Able and must help him escape from the dungeons below the castle of Colloden's Pile. This a keyboard-only game, and uses a set of commands (called \\"Merphish\\" in-game) such as the standard north, south, east and west (N,S,E,W) and some additional unique commands such as invoke (I), freeze (f), and blast (b). Conversations with certain friendly characters such as Apex the Ogre are initiated in the following syntax: \\"[character],[speech]\\" e.g. \\"Apex, thanks\\". The dungeons are full of dangerous and hostile creatures such as wyverns, goblins and vampires. Axil can defend himself using magic to stall or kill these creatures. Not everyone in the dungeon is an enemy, some inhabitants (such as Apex the Ogre) are friendly unless provoked and can be conversed with. The dungeon itself is separated into several distinct levels which Axil can travel to and from at will provided he can find the staircases up or down. The game could be finished in three different ways, each way being of varying difficulty. The game was planned to be the first part of a trilogy, but the other games were never created. Reception Reviews of the game were highly positive all round, with the only common criticism being the blocky graphics. To reduce the memory impact of the large animated graphics, the programmers blew up single graphic cells to create all the sprites and foreground scenery in the game, effectively reducing the resolution of the graphics but compressing them in memory and so increasing the amount of space available for game content.

Of the school's 60 graduating seniors in the class of 2019, students matriculated to over 30 schools, including: Stanford University, The University of Chicago, Pomona College, Northwestern University, University of California, Berkeley, Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Rice University, Georgetown University and Washington University. Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program(BEMP) Given its location in a vast environmental ecosystem, Bosque students are leaders in becoming good stewards of the land. The Black Institute for Environmental Studies at Bosque School builds connections between students, community, and the Rio Grande and its riverside forest and watershed through research, education and action. The Black Institute programs include; the Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program (BEMP), The Cebrin Goodman Youth Leadership and the Environment Project, citizen science, and wildlife conservation. These environmental projects involved over 6,000 students and teachers from Bosque School and other private, public, pueblo and home schools. Campus A view of the \\"Schoolhouse\\", taken from the west. Designed by architecture firm RMKM, this building is lauded for its modern masonry \\"projecting a bold symbol of educational excellence\\". RMKM, \\"The Bosque School Schoolhouse Building\\" The campus sits on 23 acres of land directly adjacent to the riparian forest supported by the Rio Grande. It has numerous buildings, including: Peggie Ann Findlay Performing Arts Center, Budagher Hall, Upper and Middle School Buildings, a gymnasium, the Gerald Ford Library, and the 15,500 square foot \\"Schoolhouse\\". =Archeology On Campus= During an expansion project in early 2007, an ancient Native American pueblo was found on the southern end of the campus. To preserve this archaeological discovery, the tennis courts and the Klaus Weber Championship Soccer Field were moved slightly to preserve the land. This ancient pueblo site is used as an educational resource in history classes.

This audio drama was presented on three compact discs, and was made by Big Finish as their primary release to celebrate forty years of Doctor Who.Zagreus Audio Drama\\"Doctors in Distress\\" by Benjamin Cook, Doctor Who Magazine, #337(December 2003)Feature:All Aboard The Big Finish Bus! As of February 2015, it is being sold as a download. Plot Following directly from the events of Neverland, the casket of anti-time which was destined for Gallifrey had exploded within the confines of the TARDIS. It seems that the Eighth Doctor and Charley have saved Gallifrey, and that the paradox of Charley's existence had been resolved, but the Doctor begins behaving strangely ‚Äî he has been taken over by Zagreus. The Doctor/Zagreus rages through the TARDIS and strikes Charley, but there is a loud explosion, and when they recover the Doctor/Zagreus is alone in the TARDIS. Charley finds herself in Harley Street talking to her mother Lady Louisa Pollard, who mentions amongst other out of place information that one of her sisters is called Romana. Charley is taken to see a Dr Zagreus, and her mother turns into a white rabbit from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Charley then meets someone whom she recognises as the Brigadier. The Doctor/Zagreus, unsure of his true identity, stumbles into a TARDIS library. He hears a mysterious voice in the TARDIS, that of one of his previous incarnations, the Third Doctor. The Brigadier tells Charley that everything she has seen is a holographic projection created by the TARDIS. She is then shown scenes from her own memory to provide her with insight into what has happened to the Doctor. The Doctor leaves the library through a secret passage and finds a part of the TARDIS unaffected by the anti-time infection, from where he is able to converse with Zagreus. Zagreus shows him all possible alternate time lines, including universes where the Doctor plucked out one of his own hearts, and tells the Doctor that he would destroy all of them if he was unleashed. Charley and the Brigadier find themselves in another holographic projection, this time a 1950s army barracks. Charley realises that the Brigadier is also a hologram, created by the TARDIS. The Brigadier mentions something called \\"The Divergence\\" and says that the Time Lords would not be able to intervene lest they become infected with the anti-time. In the TARDIS, the Doctor hears the Third Doctor's voice again and finds a book The Alice Compendium in which he reads Charley's name and the phrases \\"the divergence\\" and \\"Nana Saviltride\\". Charley and the Brigadier realise the projection is of Cardington, where the R101 was launched in 1930. There, a Doctor Stone is conducting an experiment, which causes a huge explosion. The Doctor hears the explosion and rushes to the TARDIS control room, but finds himself instead in a forest. There he encounters a huge talking Cat and a large metal box. The Cat tricks the Doctor into entering the box and seals him in with a cyanide bottle, which is a Schr√∂dinger's cat demonstration. The Doctor realises the meaning ‚Äî if he left the TARDIS he would become either fully himself or fully Zagreus. At Cardington, Stone argues with the base chaplain Matthew Townsend about his research. Townsend expresses reservations about possible military applications of Stone's research, and wonders about the course of human evolution. Charley overhears Stone talking about the military application of \\"Dionysus\\" ‚Äî the code name of her project. It had torn a hole in reality, which might be used as a weapon. Miss Foster, who had told Charley and the Brigadier that she was a military secret agent, tries to plant a bomb on the Dionysus project; she was in fact a spy for communist Cuba. Threatening to kill them all, Foster forces Townsend to operate the machine, creating another rift in time. All but Charley and Townsend are sucked into the rift; on the other side of the rift are creatures trying to break through. \\\\---- On ancient Gallifrey, the Great Mother, Cassandra, Provost Tepesh and Lady Ouida discuss why their groups despise Rassilon. Rassilon has destroyed followers of the Great Mother's religion, and Tepesh is of the Arcalian chapter whom Rassilon has hunted nearly to extinction. Combined, they plan to attack Rassilon's Foundry, his secret base. Charley and Brigadier are between holographic projections. They discuss what they saw at Cardington, creatures from outside of the boundaries of time and space trying to break through. Charley wonders aloud whether she could take the Doctor's place by absorbing Zagreus into her, allowing the Doctor to go free. The Doctor is beginning to unravel the mystery. The Cat is another avatar of the TARDIS. The Doctor's being in the forest was to protect him from events elsewhere. He realises \\"Saviltride\\" is an anagram of \\"evil TARDIS\\", from which he deduces that not only was his only personality split in two, so was that of the TARDIS. Tepesh and the Great Mother enter Rassilon's Foundry where they meet Charley, however they perceive her as being Rassilon. Cassandra says something which offends Tepesh, and he orders Ouida to kill her and drink her blood. She cannot regenerate as Rassilon was still in the early stages of the genetic experimentation into the Time Lord gift. When an automated system reveals some of Rassilon's secrets, Charley discovers that Rassilon, fearing for the survival of the Time Lords, created self-replicating biogenic molecules and sent them back in time. The effect of these molecules was to ensure that all life-forms in the universe evolved to something approximating the Gallifreyan norm. To prevent creatures from the Divergence entering our universe, he then sealed time into a loop. The Dionysus Project that Charley saw at Cardington had breached the loop, allowing creatures from the Divergent universe to enter ours. Tepesh reveals that the Vampires had only drunk the blood of specially bred animals, but Rassilon's purges forced them to drink the blood of intelligent species in order to survive. He refrains from attacking Charley/Rassilon until he has discovered all the Foundry's secrets. The automated recorder reveals the Foundry draws its power from the Divergent universe. When the Brigadier advises Charley to switch off the power, this allows creatures from the Divergence to break through. The Great Mother reveals that Rassilon stole the secret of regeneration from the Vampires, and that much of Time Lord technology was stolen from the Divergent universe. The Foundry's defences seal off the whole base and prepare to fire storm it to prevent the escape of the Divergent creatures. The Brigadier and Charley escape through a mirror, but Tepesh, Ouida and the Great Mother are killed. Charley finds herself within another scenario, and this time her appearance is that of a mouse in battle armour. She is in some sort of bizarre theme park where animatronic animals are battling with animatronic humans. The Doctor meanwhile is fighting against the TARDIS, destroying parts of its architecture. The Brigadier arrives, and is revealed to be an avatar of the TARDIS's Zagreus personality. To defend the TARDIS, the Brigadier summons a Jabberwock, and the Doctor flees. Charley encounters Goldilocks, the leader of the enemy humans. They are fighting to get control of the Animator, but both sides wish to release from suspended animation so they do so. The Animator, Uncle Winky, was suspended in the year 2367. To his horror, he discovers he has been in suspended animation for 60 billion years and has awoken on the dead world of Gallifrey, which the theme park was moved to. They are on what was once the Foundry, and the animatronic creatures have fallen under the influence of the Divergence creatures. They revived Winky to operate the controls of the Foundry machines, but he dies of the heart condition which he had entered suspended animation to survive. Having escaped the Jabberwock, the Doctor now plucks Charley out of the simulation. Charley is unable to trust the Doctor as he had hit her earlier, and she no longer trusts the Brigadier avatar. Rassilon himself appears and reveals that after the explosion, the Doctor and Charley had been unconscious for six months, in which time Rassilon had persuaded the TARDIS to aid him in exchange for freeing it from the Doctor/Zagreus's influence. On Gallifrey, Cardinal Braxiatel informs Romana that the Doctor's TARDIS has dematerialised of its own accord. Leela then arrives with a message from Rassilon concerning the fate of the Doctor. Charley finds herself in a bleak landscape, together with Townsend, Tepesh and Winky. Ahead of them they see a Dark Tower ‚Äî they are in the Death Zone on Gallifrey. \\\\---- Romana, Leela and K-9 transmat to Rassilon's tomb within the dark tower. Rassilon's spirit speaks through Leela, and leads them to a Matrix simulation of the Dark Tower in ancient times. Meanwhile, Charley informs Townsend, Tepesh and Winky that they are Zagreus's recreations of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, and also the only people to have ever seen the Divergence. Charley tried to persuade them to go to the Dark Tower, but Tepesh is reluctant to play the Game of Rassilon. The Jabberwock then appears, but they subdue it by reciting nonsense poetry, using it to fly them into the Dark Tower. Rassilon demands that Romana resign from the presidency in favour of Zagreus. When she refuses, Rassilon uses the possessed Leela to attack Romana and K-9, whose head gets knocked off. The Jabberwock crashes into the Dark Tower, but Charley and the recreated Doctors make their way inside. Their passage is blocked by a booby-trapped chessboard and hear a riddle from Rassilon. The Doctors think the answer is related to the number pi, but upon crossing Winkle is nearly hit by a bowspike. Instead Charley deduces that they must move across using the knight's move in chess. They find Leela attacking Romana, and Charley knocks her unconscious. Rassilon and the Brigadier avatar have chained up the Doctor and are preparing to torture him. When the Doctor asks about Charley, the avatar flies into a rage, ranting about how the TARDIS had suffered in its many adventures with the Doctor, especially its recent absorption of anti-time to save Charley. The Doctor realises the TARDIS is jealous of Charley. Rassilon summons the Doctor and the Brigadier into the Foundry, which he proudly declares to be the place where he created the Nemesis and the De-mat gun. Rassilon shows them a frozen solar system ‚Äî one which housed a species which could have threatened the Time Lords. The Brigadier avatar destroys the police box shell of the TARDIS in the Foundry's smelting works. From the Dark Tower, Romana, Charley, the Doctors and a K-9 find a secret entrance to the Foundry through the mirror. Townsend cracks a code in Old High Gallifreyan, proving they were created from the Doctor's memories and thus retain some elements of his knowledge. Pushing past the Brigadier, they find the Doctor by an anvil creating a sword from the molten TARDIS shell. Rassilon believes that he has destroyed the Doctor's sanity thus allowing Zagreus full control. The Doctor's other aspects tell him Rassilon is manipulating him as a weapon against the creatures of the Divergent universe, as the creatures of the Divergent Universe would have evolved to surpass the Time Lords before Rassilon locked them away. Rassilon seizes the anti-time sword and slays all the Doctors but the Eighth. Charley, Romana and Leela try to avoid being shot by the Brigadier and Romana transports him into the crucible. The Doctor gives the anti-time sword to Charley, and begs her to kill him before Zagreus takes over. Charley cannot kill him for she loves him, but when the Doctor tells her that he does not love her, she pierces him with the sword before breaking down in tears. The Doctor does not regenerate, however; when Rassilon killed Townsend, Tepesh and Winkle those parts of him were removed, and when Charley stabbed him they were restored saving him from death. It is Zagreus who awakens, but when Rassilon commands him to enter the Divergent universe to slay the creatures, Zagreus instead throws Rassilon into the Divergence to face his fate, refusing to be Rassilon's puppet. Zagreus prepares to attack the Doctor's companions, but the Brigadier arrives and overpowers him. In the crucible, the TARDIS had been restored. Now free from the anti-time infection, the Brigadier avatar gives Zagreus a \\"drink me\\" potion which purges the Zagreus influence from the Doctor. The Doctor tells Charley that she must leave him ‚Äî the zero matter in the \\"drink me\\" potion has stabilised him, but he is still infected by anti-time. He intends to travel to the Divergent universe to quarantine himself forever and protect the universe from the anti-time infection. Charley storms out of the TARDIS, whereupon Romana speaks to the Doctor telling him that he will never be allowed to return and the Time Lords will prevent him from doing so if he tries. Romana leaves the TARDIS and it dematerialises. Romana asks Leela where Charley is, and Leela asks Romana if she was aware that the TARDIS had a back door. Leela asks if Romana still finds her stupid and Romana says this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. The Doctor prepares for his new life in the Divergent universe, excited by the prospect of seeing new worlds and new people. He is not yet aware that Charley will be seeing them with him ...

The Sixth Doctor hummed the Zagreus sits inside your head rhyme in Project: Twilight, and in Omega, a hologram of the legendary Time Lord was featured. Death sang a paraphrased version of the rhyme in Master. Zagreus was also briefly mentioned in the BBC novel Instruments of Darkness by Gary Russell. * The delirious Doctor/Zagreus mentions John William Polidori; continuing the running joke references to a previous adventure (or adventures) at Lake Geneva, during the winter when Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. The story is finally told in the \\"Mary's Story\\" segment of The Company of Friends. *Romana and Leela's story continues in the Gallifrey series. Polidori and his friends appear in the 2020 episode The Haunting Of Villa Diodati. *Cardinal Braxiatel (Miles Richardson) had earlier appeared in several Bernice Summerfield audio dramas and would later become a regular character in the Gallifrey audio series. Notes *Jon Pertwee's surprise posthumous cameo was facilitated by the use of recordings he had made for a fan film called Devious, a finale for Season 6B *This story features nearly all of the Doctor and companion actors who had worked with Big Finish up to this point, although most of them do not play their usual roles. The characters played by Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy are eventually revealed to be projections partly based on the TARDIS's memories of the past Doctors. The three do appear briefly as the Doctor near the end of the story, when the Eighth Doctor is (temporarily) killed and meets his former selves in his mind. A similar occurrence happened when the Seventh Doctor's mind was taken over by the Timewyrm in the Virgin New Adventure Timewyrm: Revelation, and the Doctor met all his previous selves, bar the Second Doctor (whom he met in Timewyrm: Apocalypse) and the Sixth Doctor. *This was the only audio drama in which Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann all appear until the 2010 story, The Four Doctors. *There are many in- joke references in the work to incidents in the lives of the characters of the companions or of the actors who played them. For example, Goldilocks, played by Bonnie Langford, is in control of a fairy which she commands through poetic couplets. This is a reference to the fact that Bonnie was starring in a stage production of Peter Pan at the time of being cast as Mel. *Peter Davison, Paul McGann, Nicholas Courtney and India Fisher are the only actors to appear in all three segments of the story (Wonderland, Heartland and Wasteland). * The Doctor reading from Frankenstein is a partial continuation of a running joke in Eighth Doctor audio dramas about him being involved with Mary Shelley, which began in Storm Warning and ended in \\"Mary's Story\\". Footnotes * A reference to events in the Eighth Doctor Adventures. This is the first indication in the audio dramas that they take place in an alternate universe to that of the book series. Likewise, he makes reference to \\"Standing on a planet called Oblivion, facing down a race known as the Horde\\". This event took place in the comic strips published in Doctor Who Magazine. * Dionysus is also known by the name Zagreus in Greek mythology. * This is probably the same religion featured in the Old Time sequences of the New Adventure Cat's Cradle: Time's Crucible. Given the references to disguised science and youth potions, it is also almost certainly the Sisterhood of Karn. * Another reference to the Cat's Cradle trilogy.
