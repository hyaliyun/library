Surrounded by gardens and terraces, this villa has received numerous writers and celebrities. History Around 1900, the former missionary and chaplain to Leopold II, King of the Belgians, Félix Charmettant (1844-1921), purchased a parcel of land () on the newly subdivided peninsula of cap Ferrat. Here he had a villa constructed in the Moorish style by an unknown architect. In 1927, the author Somerset Maugham purchased the property and commissioned Henri Delmotte, Marcel Guilgot, and the young American architect Barry Dierks to eliminate the villa's original neo-oriental elements, to classicize the façades and patio, and to modernize the layout by creating a staircase. Villa La Mauresque became Maugham's main residence until his death in 1965. Becoming a near-obligatory stop for the literary and Riviera society, La Mauresque, from the point of Maugham's acquisition, received most of the celebrities who visited the Riviera: Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Lord Beaverbrook and the Aga Khan mingled with such literary figures as T. S. Eliot, H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Ian Fleming, Noël Coward and even Virginia Woolf. Maugham and his partner Gerald Haxton lived together at the Villa. Haxton was followed by other partners after Haxton's death in 1944. Maugham's last partner, Allan Searle, inherited Maugham's estate and the villa.Stéphane Denis, “Le style Maugham”, Valeurs actuelles, 2 December 2010 read on line (page consulted 29 April 2011) In 1967, the villa was purchased by an American, Lynn Wyatt, a prominent figure in international society. The façades and the interior layout were modified – while retaining the classic style – at this time by the French architect Marcel Guilgot. In 2005, through the Nice registered LM Holdings co-owners David Brown and Robert Shelter-Jones who purchased the Villa La Mauresque and later \\"ceded freindship\\" of the property to Firtash, Dmitry Firtash became the owner of Villa La Mauresque for 50 million euros. LM Holdings secured a loan from Austrian bank Raiffeisen Bankengruppe and a $25 million loan in 2005 from Transolve Ltd, which is registered in several places, and another $25 million loan in 2006 from Mersiford Ltd, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands. Then, the Irish firm Moraga Ltd claimed the debt by acquiring the shares of LM Holding with approval from Firtash and his Ukrainian mother Maria Grigorovna Firtash (). Description La Mauresque is arranged around a central patio, on a rectangular plan. Two superimposed galleries, including one that is arcaded and the other on the ground floor, which is glazed, surround this patio. The entry façade is marked by a columnated porte-cochere. A tower marks the southeast corner of the building. The somber façades, which lack any ornamentation, are of plaster painted white. The roof is tiled, save for the terrace, which is cement. The interior, on the ground floor, which was modified during the renovation of 1967, included a larger semi-circular foyer (formerly the dining room), living room, kitchen, and service rooms and staff quarters. The tower housed the library. On the first floor, which is served by an elevator, are seven bedrooms and four bathrooms as well as service rooms, laundry and linen room. A staircase leads to the terrace. Legal status The villa La Mauresque is a private residence located at 52 boulevard du Général- de-Gaulle, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat at “Le Sémaphore.” It has been classified with the Inventaire général du patrimoine culturel since November 2008. maison de villégiature dite Villa la Charmettant, puis Villa La Mauresque The villa's gardens were the subject of a separate classification, which occurred at the same time as that of the house. jardin d'agrément de la Villa La Mauresque  Notes and references  Category:French Riviera Category:Houses completed in 1927 Category:Houses in Alpes-Maritimes Category:Modernist architecture in France Category:Villas in France ","title":"Villa La Mauresque"},{"id":"40123433","text":"Tulian (, also Romanized as Ţūlīān, Tūleyān, Tūlīān, and Tūlīyān) is a village in Dehdasht-e Sharqi Rural District, in the Central District of Kohgiluyeh County, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province, Iran.

She was the first woman ordained as a Universalist minister in New England and the first woman to serve as chaplain to the Connecticut state legislature. Early life and education Phebe Hanaford was born on May 6, 1829 in Siasconset on Nantucket Island to Phebe Ann (Barnard) Coffin (who died a month later) and George W. Coffin, a shipowner and a merchant. Phebe's father remarried the following year, to Emmeline Cartwright; from this union, Phebe gained an older step-brother and seven younger half-siblings. The Coffins were a Quaker family descended from the early Nantucket European settlers Tristram Coffin, Peter Foulger, and Mary Morrill; further back, her ancestry traces to Degory Priest, pilot of the Mayflower. Hanaford received an advanced education both at home and in public and private schools on Nantucket, studying math and Latin at home. She left school at the age of 17 to care for her paternal grandmother. Career as writer, activist, and minister At the age of 20, Hanaford began teaching school in Siasconset. In 1849, she married Joseph H. Hanaford, a physician who was also a teacher. They had two children, Florence and Howard. In 1857, the couple moved to Massachusetts, eventually settling in Reading. During the Civil War, Hanaford become an abolitionist. She was an active suffragist as well, becoming a member of the American Equal Rights Association, which advocated for both black and female suffrage. She spoke at suffrage meetings at the state and national levels and served as vice president of the Association for the Advancement of Women in 1874. Hanaford turned to preaching and writing, producing a total of 14 books. The first of these, Lucretia the Quakeress (1853) was inspired by the life of a famous cousin, the abolitionist and women's rights activist Lucretia Coffin Mott. Another of her books, Life of Abraham Lincoln (1865), was the first biography of the president published after his assassination. It sold well, reaching 20,000 copies. She was also a member of the Revising Committee of 26 women who produced commentary for The Woman's Bible. In the same period, Hanaford joined the Universalist Church of America, which included many members who advocated equality for women. From 1866 to 1868, Hanaford edited two periodicals, one of which was The Myrtle, a Universalist Church Sunday school magazine. With the encouragement of suffragist Olympia Brown—who was America's first ordained Universalist woman minister—she studied for the ministry. In 1868, she was ordained a pastor of the Universalist Church and accepted a post at a church in Waltham. She was the first woman ordained in the church in both the state of Massachusetts and New England, and the third to be ordained in America. In 1870, she moved to a new position at a Universalist Church in New Haven, Connecticut, where her annual salary was $2000. She was also appointed chaplain to the Connecticut state legislature, the first woman ever to hold that position. In 1874, she was appointed pastor of the First Universalist Church in New Jersey, but only remained for three years due to controversies over her views on women's rights and her personal life (see below). She formed a new congregation, the Second Universalist Church of Jersey City, and preached out of a public hall for several years. During the 1870s, she also went on tours around New England as well as some Middle Atlantic and Western states, giving lectures and sermons on a range of reform issues, including temperance. She reportedly had an exceptional speaking voice, like \\"a silver bell\\". Phebe Ann Coffin Hanaford (1893) In 1884, she returned to New Haven to be pastor of a new congregation there, the Second Universalist Church. By 1891, she had moved to New York City, and from 1896 to 1898 she was a member of the New Century Study Circle and Society for Political Study. From 1901 to 1906 she was a vice president of the women's literary club Sorosis and president of the Women's Press Club, of which she was also a charter member since its founding in 1888. In 1914, Hanaford left New York City and moved to Rochester, New York, where she died on June 2, 1921, at the age of 92 despite her dream of living to 100. She left a brief unpublished memoir of her early life, Old Time School Days in Nantucket. Hanaford was friends with the self-taught sculptor Joanna Quiner, who depicted her in a portrait bust currently in the collection of the Beverly Historical Society in Beverly, Massachusetts. Hanaford in turn penned a biographical sketch of Quiner, and also composed two sonnets inspired by the sculptor and her work. Controversy over personal life The same year that she was ordained, Hanaford separated from her husband—they never officially divorced—and took her children with her. She began living with a woman named Ellen Miles, a situation that caused controversy in her first New Jersey congregation, which referred to Miles as the \\"minister's wife\\". There appears to have been some resentment over Miles assisting Hanaford in certain official duties, such as philanthropic disbursements. Church officials first tried to pressure Hanaford to leave by threatening a salary cut from $2500 to $1500. When Hanaford accepted the cut, church officials then demanded that Hanaford \\"dismiss\\" Miles. When Hanaford refused, the congregation voted not to renew Hanaford's contract. It was at this point that Hanaford left to start the Second Universalist Church, for which Ellen Miles ran the Sunday School. Although the nature of Hanaford's relationship with Miles is uncertain, their letters testify to a 'deep friendship'. They remained together for forty-four years, until Miles's death in 1914.

Initially, the troops of Kadan moved south along the Adriatic Sea into Serbian territory. Then, turning east, it crossed the centre of the country—plundering as it went—and entered Bulgaria, where it was joined by the rest of the army under Batu. The campaigning in Bulgaria probably happened mainly in the north, where archaeology yields evidence of destruction from this period. The Mongols did, however, cross Bulgaria to attack the Latin Empire to its south before withdrawing completely. Bulgaria was forced to pay tribute to the Mongols, and this continued thereafter. Background Relations between Hungary and Serbia were poor on the eve of the Mongol invasion. The Serbian king, Stefan Vladislav, had married Beloslava, daughter of Tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, in 1234 in an effort to form an anti-Hungarian alliance. By the time of the Mongol invasion, however, there were good relations between Hungary and Bulgaria. The Bulgarian tsar, the child Kaliman I, was a nephew of the Hungarian king, Béla IV, being the son of Béla's sister, Anna Maria, and Ivan Asen II. Around 1240, facing the threat of Mongol invasion, the Hungarians, Bulgarians and Cumans may have entered into an alliance, as evidenced by the presence in that year of a Bulgarian emissary at Béla IV's court. One of the reasons for the Mongol invasion of Hungary was that Béla IV had given shelter to the Cumans when they fled the Mongol conquest of their land in 1239. After the Cuman leader, Köten, was assassinated by Hungarians opposed to Béla's policy on 17 March 1241, a large number of Cumans devastated the Hungarian countryside while retreating into Bulgaria, where they were again granted shelter. A separate group of Cumans entered Bulgaria about the same time, crossing the Black Sea after the Mongol conquest of Cumania, having arranged for their settlement with Ivan Asen. This is recorded by Ibn Taghribirdi, a 15th-century writer relying on the lost work of Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad, himself a Syrian writing in exile from Egypt after the Mongol conquest of Syria. Izz al-Din's source was the eyewitness Badr al-Din Baysari, himself a Cuman whose family fled to Bulgaria. The future sultan of Egypt, Baibars, born in 1227 or 1228, was among those who fled to Bulgaria from the Mongols. According to Ibn Taghribirdi, the Bulgarians later turned on these Cumans. Baysari and Baibars were captured and sold into slavery in Rum. The Cumans of Köten, on the other hand, seem to have integrated themselves into the Bulgarian aristocracy. The decision by the Mongols to attack Bulgaria with all their forces may have had the same motive as the initial attack on Hungary: to punish the Bulgarians for giving aid to the Mongols' enemies. Bulgaria in 1242 encompassed the area north of the Balkan Mountains as far as the Lower Danube. Its population was ethnically mixed, consisting of Slavic-speaking Bulgarians and Romance-speaking Vlachs. Some contemporaries called the area Vlachia. The nomadic Cumans also settled in this region at that time. The ruling dynasty since 1185 was the Asenids. Their ethnic origins are disputed, but most likely they were Cumans who became Romanized in the 12th century and Slavicized in the 13th. In dealing with the Mongol invasions, writers also had to distinguish between Bulgaria on the Danube and the distant Bulgaria on the Volga, which they called, respectively, \\"Little (or Lesser) Bulgaria\\" (Bulgaria minor) and \\"Great (or Greater) Bulgaria\\" (Bulgaria maior or magna Bulgaria). Serbia When the Mongol commander Kadan withdrew from the invasion of Hungary, he entered Bosnia in late March or early April 1242. Although nominally under Hungarian suzerainty, part of Bosnia had been occupied by Hungarian crusaders opposed to the Bosnian Church while the remainder was under the control of Ban Matej Ninoslav. The passing-through of the Mongols forced the Hungarians to evacuate the territory and allowed Ninoslav to resume control of the whole of Bosnia. Continuing south, the Mongols entered the Serbian region of Zeta (roughly Montenegro and northern Albania). According to Archdeacon Thomas of Split, they inflicted minimal damage on independent Dubrovnik, which was too strong to take. In Zeta, however, the forces of Kadan attacked Kotor, razed to the ground Svač and Drisht and probably also destroyed Sapë, which was only rebuilt several decades later. In Thomas's words, the Mongols left behind in Zeta \\"nobody to piss against a wall\\". The city of Ulcinj may have been spared because of an agreement reached with Dubrovnik in April. There is no record that they met any resistance, and it is possible that George, the governor of Zeta, sought to use them to detach his principality from Serbian overlordship. He began to use the title of \\"king\\" at this time. According to Thomas of Split, a contemporary and partial eyewitness, the Mongols \\"overran all of Serbia and came to Bulgaria\\" (totam Serviam percurrentes in Bulgariam devenerunt). Another contemporary, the archdeacon Roger of Várad from Hungarian Transylvania, notes that \\"Kadan destroyed Bosnia and the kingdom of Rascia and then crossed into Bulgaria\\" (Cadan ... destruxit Boznam, regnum Rascie et inde in Bulgariam pertransivit). This is all that is known about the invasion of Serbia proper (Rascia) from literary sources. The raiding and looting in Serbia was over by late spring, when the tumens had moved on to Bulgaria. In the 1250s, William of Rubruck, a Flemish missionary in the Mongol Empire, reported that a French goldsmith in the Mongol capital of Karakorum had been captured in Belegrave by the forces of Bujek, a son of Tolui (and not by Kadan). This location is usually identified with Belgrade. If so, then Belgrade, which been under Hungarian control since 1235, was probably occupied by the Mongols in 1241 or 1242. If the former date is correct, it is likely that the Mongols crossed the Danube at Kovin, an important crossing, where evidence of destruction from that period has been unearthed. A large coin hoard buried in 1241 has been found at the nearby fortress of Dupljaja. If the Mongols under Bujek did not take Belgrade while crossing into Croatia in 1241, it is possible that Kadan took it—the Hungarians having evacuated—in 1242 while devastating Serbia. Although Stefan Vladislav was overthrown by his nobles in 1243, nothing suggests that this was related to his response to the Mongol invasion. His brother and successor, Stefan Uroš I (died 1276), married a Catholic noblewoman, Helen of Anjou (died 1314). It is recorded that in the predominantly Catholic region around Lake Scutari in Zeta she repaired and rebuilt many towns, churches, and monasteries damaged and destroyed by the Mongols in 1242. Bulgaria Having passed through Bosnian and Serb lands, Kadan joined up with the main army under Batu in Bulgaria, probably towards the end of spring. There is archaeological evidence of widespread destruction in central and northeastern Bulgaria around 1242. There are several narrative sources of the Mongol invasion of Bulgaria, but none is detailed and they present distinct pictures of what transpired. It is clear, though, that two forces entered Bulgaria at the same time: Kadan's from Serbia and another, led by Batu himself or Bujek, from across the Danube. A marginal notation in a Greek manuscript in the Vatican Secret Archives notes that it was purchased by a certain Theodore Grammatikos after the Mongol invasion of Bulgaria, in the year 6751 Anno Mundi in the Byzantine calendar. The year 6751 corresponds to the period from 1 September 1242 to the 31 August 1243. The destruction of Bulgaria is mentioned by the contemporary Brabantine theologian Thomas of Cantimpré. Writing a little later, the Italian missionary Ricoldo of Montecroce wrote that the Mongols had conquered the Vlachs. According to the Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, the Bulgarian capital of Tarnovo (Qirqin) and the Black Sea port of Anchialos (Qila) were sacked \\"after great battles\\", by which Rashid probably means sieges. The identification of Rashid's Qila with Anchialos is recent: it has more often been identified with Chilia on the Danube, but this place was not a city worth attacking at the time. The Andalusian writer Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, writing in his Geography in 1250, confirms the Mongol attack on Tarnovo (Arabic Tarnabu). Archaeological evidence of destruction, including coin hoards, that can be dated to 1242 has been found at Červen, Isaccea, Loveč, Nufăru, Preslav, Silistra, Šumen, Svištov, Turcoaia and Varna, as well as at Tarnovo itself and the island of Păcuiul lui Soare, which was completely destroyed. On top of the evidence of destruction, there are reports that the tsar's army dealt a defeat to the Mongol army. These accounts reached as far afield as Flanders, where the victory is mentioned in the French chronicle of Philippe Mouskes, and Palestine, where it is mentioned by the Syriac writer Bar Hebraeus. It is unlikely that the Bulgarians scored a victory over anything greater than a small raiding party. Mouskes specifies that \\"the king of the Vlach country defeated [the Tatars] in a pass\\", probably Iskar Gorge, the main pass through the Stara Planina, which the Mongols would have probably used in their attack on Constantinople. The tsar in any case was too young to participate in battle and any victory was won by his commanders and is merely being attributed him. The Bulgarian victory can likely be attributed to the mountainous terrain, to which the Mongols were not accustomed. According to Thomas of Split, before leaving Bulgaria the Mongols massacred their captives—\\"Hungarians, Slavs and other peoples\\"—as they had also done in Croatia in March or April. Aftermath By 1253, when William of Rubruck visited the Mongol capital, Bulgaria was paying tribute: \\"from the mouth of [the Don] as far as the Danube everything is theirs [the Mongols']; and even beyond the Danube in the direction of Constantinople [in Vlachia and Little Bulgaria] all pay them tribute; and over and above the tribute stipulated, in recent years they have further levied on each household one axe and all the unwrought iron that has been found.\\" William also says that the Vlach and Bulgarian envoys customarily brought gifts to the court of Sartaq, Batu's son, while on the way to Batu's court. Although no source indicates when the paying of tribute began, it had clearly been in place for years prior to 1253. Modern historians usually link it to the invasion of 1242, although, as Greg Rogers notes, \\"an explanation for why only Bulgaria, of all the areas traversed by Batu's troops in 1241 and 1242, became enmeshed in the Mongols' tribute system is still lacking in the historical literature.\\" Some historians believe that Bulgaria escaped major destruction by accepting Mongol suzerainty, while others have argued that the evidence of Mongol raiding is strong enough that there can have been no escaping. In any case, the campaign of 1242 brought the frontier of the authority of the Golden Horde (Batu's command) to the Danube, where it remained for some decades. The Venetian doge and historian Andrea Dandolo, writing a century later, says that the Mongols \\"occupied\\" the kingdom of Bulgaria during the 1241–42 campaign. A series of clashes between the Mongols and the Empire of Constantinople took place in 1242 as the invaders were passing through southern Bulgaria. Bar Hebraeus says specifically that Batu \\"prepared to attack Constantinople from the quarter of the Bulgarians\\", although he misdates the event to 1232. By the 1260s, Bulgaria had exchanged Mongol suzerainty for Hungarian. As a result, in the 1270s it was the target of \\"daily\\" raiding by the Mongols, according to the Greek historian George Pachymeres. Bulgaria as a vassal of the Mongols, provided troops to Mengu- Timur's expedition against the Byzantines in Thracia in 1267Bruce Lippard, The Mongols and Byzantium, 1243–1341, Ph.D. dissertation, Indiana University, 1984, 194-195 and again became a victim of the Golden Horde's incursions in the 1280s. In the 1280s and 1290s, the Golden Horde also established their lordship over Serbia. Bulgaria was still paying tribute into the early second half of the fourteenth century and a considerable part of the Bulgarian kingdom was under direct control of the Chingissid prince Nogai and later the Mongol governors of the Golden Horde.

A founding father of Belgium, Coghen was a merchant, financier, and politician of the Liberal Party.English translation of the French Wikipedia article, citing Jean Bartelous, Nos Premiers Ministres, de Léopold Ier à Albert Ier, 1983, Bruxelles, éd. J.M. Collet, p. 23. Translated as Our Prime Ministers from Leopold I to Albert I. He was elevated to the rank of count in 1837. Ancestry Before the family Coghen moved to Brussels, they were living from the early 14th century in the city of Diest as merchants and financial stewards. Some of them held official positions in that city such as mayor. During the Protestant Rebellion of the mid-16th century they supported the cause of William of Orange, the leader of that rebellion in the Low Countries, because the city of Diest was one of the four cities of the family of William of Orange (the other three being Breda, Duisburg and Orange). Coghen was the son of Joseph Coghen (1749-1820), an apothecary, and his wife, Isabelle Stielemans, who was a native of Brussels. His paternal grandfather, Jan Baptist Coghen (1717-1773) was born, was married, and died in Brussels. His paternal grandmother, Catharina Theresia Huwaerts (1710-1749), was also born and died in Brussels, and her parents, Marie Therese van Cutsem (1668-1726/1727) and Joose Huwaerts (d. 1742), as well as their parents, were also from old Dutch families in the Brussels area (including such families as Ghysels, Walravens, de Broijer, Haeck, de Proost, and de Leenheer). His mother was descended from several ancient Belgian families, from Brussels and Diest, whose ancestors in the sixteenth century appear to have been butchers and merchants, and who in the early seventeenth century included magistrates of the old county of Campine (Kempen in Dutch).French Wikipedia article on Jacques Coghen, citing these original sources: *Étienne Cogen, Jacques-André graaf Coghen : zijn afstamming, leven, werk en nakomelingschap = Jacques-André Comte Coghen : ses origines, sa vie, ses activités et sa descendance, Gand, 1998.

(cet auteur donne comme date d'ancienneté prouvée l'an 1483). (Translated as: List of Belgian families by seniority (Brussels, 2008). (This author gives a proven \\"seniority date\\" of the year 1483). Early life and business Coghen was born on 31 October 1791. He was married, on 17 May 1821, to Caroline Rittweger. The Rittweger family was from Altenkunstadt in Bavaria but moved to Brussels at the end of the 18th century when they were officials in the Postal Office of the Austrian Empire. François Rittweger, the father of Caroline, was a Brussels politician, director of several financial companies and financial advisor to the Belgian King Leopold I. He was freemason in the lodge \\"Les Amis Philanthropes\\". Jacques Coghen was also a freemason in the lodge \\"L'Espérance\\" in Brussels where he met other freemasons who would become leaders of the Belgian Revolution, namely Jean Barbanson (1797-1883), Eugène Defacqz (1797-1871), en Alexandre Gendebien (1789-1869). The Coghen's had five children - Isabelle (1822-1891), Barbara (1823-1883), Henriette (1825-1880), Joseph-Frantz (1827-1888) and Marie (1832-1870). Before the Belgian Revolution broke out, Coghen was a respected merchant and banker in Brussels; he was Chairman of the Commercial Court and a member of the Advisory Chamber of Commerce. In 1824, he co-founded, with Francois Rittweger, AG Life, the life insurance company, and in 1830, AG Fire, both of which later became part of the €45 billion Fortis, \\"the oldest and most important insurance company in Belgium\\", until its collapse in 2008. He helped to start a glass factory cooperative company, Verreries de Mariemont, in 1829. Also in 1829, he bought Wolvendael, a 1763 castle near Uccle, from duke Charles-Louis-Auguste de Looz- Corswarem. Public life Dutch Troops had scarcely retreated from the capital of Belgium, when the Provisional Government, on 28 September 1830, named Coghen deputy head of the new Federal Finance commission, until the first meeting of the Congress national. Between October 1830 and February 1831, Coghen served on this new Conseil des Commissaires (\\"Congress of Commissioners\\") for the new nation's banking. For a short time in the fall of 1830, the new finance commission only had two employees, Coghen and an assistant attorney. In the first elections for the municipal council in October 1830, Coghen was elected as one of the representatives; he was re- elected in 1836, and served until 1840. At this time, it was his determination not to remain a member of the board, which was caused by the opposition in the assembly regarding the project to rebuild the Palace of Justice in Brussels. The Leopold district project was sponsored by financial companies, particularly by the Civil society for the expansion and beautification of Brussels, of which Coghen was one of the founders. Coghen also served on the National Congress; he had felt obliged to accept the offer that was made to him. In 1831, he joined the House of Representatives as member from the district of Brussels, and was re-elected in 1833, in 1837, and in 1841. He was defeated in 1845, when the struggle became more intense between the two parties that divided the country, but he was sent in 1848, by the voters in the same district, to the Senate, where he remained a member until his death. He also was one of the vice-presidents of the Senate when he died. Coghen joined the cabinet of the first Muelenaere Government that was formed by king Leopold I on 24 July 1831. He held the finance portfolio until 20 October 1832. He went through a difficult period marked by the Ten Days' Campaign, a failed attempt to suppress the Belgian revolution by the Dutch king William I between 1 August and 12 August 1831. As Minister of Finance he negotiated and signed on 19 December 1831 an important loan with the London banker Nathan Rotschild that saved the newly born Belgian state from collapse. He later reorganized some utilities. On 20 October 1832, the Muelenaere Government fell, and the King called the first Rogier government; thus \\"Coghen was replaced as the minister of Finances by Auguste Duvivier.\\" Return to business and later career After 1832, he returned to private life, when he devoted himself with ardor to some major financial, industrial and commercial enterprises. He became a director and shareholder of the Verreries de Mariemont, in 1835. He was a director of the Société générale de Belgique General Society of Belgium, arguably the most important company that has ever existed in Belgium, which has since been merged into the Suez-Tractebel group. The company had owned very large estates, some of which were sold off to members of the Board. The company invested in banks, coal mining, and utilities. In 1841, he was recorded as having been first appointed an administrateur (member of the board of directors) of the General Society of Belgium, with his title as ancien ministre de finances (former finance minister).Verzameling der wetten en besluiten, Volume 23, p. 965 (1849). Found at Google Books. Accessed 31 July 2013. He was also a member of the Board of the Central School of Commerce and Industry.Almanach Royal et du Commerce de Belgique pour l’an M DCCC XXX VIII, présenté à Sa Majesté. Bruxelles, Imprimerie Balleroy, 1838. (Translated as Royal Almanac and Commerce of Belgium for the year 1838, presented to His Majesty. Brussels:Balleroy Printing, 1838.) He had purchased a castle, Wolvendael in Uccle, and land in the Sonian Forest. He made some improvements to the castle, adding three bays. In 1851, Coghen returned to public life, this time the Senate; it has not been unusual for aristocrats to be elected directly to that position. Previously a Unionist, he broke with the Liberal party and then joined the Catholic party, in the controversy over a new inheritance law. In 1855, he was re-elected to the Senate after returning to the Liberal party, and served as vice-president of the Senate at the time of his death. Honours and awards After successfully securing a loan to the Roman Court, Pope Gregory XVI granted him the title of Count. The first king of the Belgians sanctioned this distinction by giving him the rank of Count for himself and the comital title to his male descendants (Royal Decree December 30, 1837). * : ** Iron Cross. ** Order of Leopold. *** Officer, 9 June 1937.Le livre d'or de l'ordre de Léopold et de la croix de fer, Volume 1 /Ferdinand Veldekens *** Commander; 1 June 1845. * : Order of the Legion of Honour. * : Grand Officer in the Order of Christ Death and legacy Jacques Coghen died in Lembeek, on 16 May 1858. He is buried at Laeken Cemetery in Brussels. After his death, his family sold his estate at Wolvendael into lots; today, most of his estate is a city park in Uccle, and the old castle retains some improvements made by Coghen. In 2004, the city of Genk named a street after Coghen. The local history society of Uccle has a collection of papers by and about Coghen. His daughter, Isabelle Coghen (1822-1891), married Theodore Mosselman du Chenoy. Their daughter Laura Mosselman du Chenoy married Fulco Tristano Beniamino Ruffo di Calabria (1848-1901). Their son Fulco Ruffo di Calabria was the father of Queen Paola. Through them, Coghen is a great-great-great grandfather of the current King of the Belgians, Phillipe.

Production The film was Solonz's first for a major studio, after his work in film school had attracted interest and he had been offered three-picture contracts. He had wanted to title it The Young and the Hopeless and was deeply unhappy with the lack of creative control; he has called it \\"a painful demoralizing experience\\", and did not make another film for several years. Plot Solondz plays Ira Ellis, a neurotic aspiring playwright in the East Village of Manhattan, whose latest work is titled Despair. The film consists of vignettes featuring equally pretentious and as yet unsuccessful members of the arts scene including Ira's friend, Jack, a painter; his chubby girlfriend Sharon, a mime; his subsequent girlfriend, a performance artist; and Jack's cast-off girlfriend with whom he has a fling, an actress. Meanwhile, an old classmate of Ira's, Donny (played by Stanley Tucci in one of his first roles), has achieved success without apparent effort and takes up with Sharon. Critical reception A reviewer for The New York Times called Fear, Anxiety & Depression \\"an amiable, uninspired spoof of the notion that agony and art go together\\" that acknowledges its debts to other film makers (such as Woody Allen in Ira's character and mannerisms) but lacking a \\"distinctive voice or vision\\". A retrospective review for IFC called it \\"wan and obvious\\" satire.

His first job in New York was as an assistant to Baron Max von Waldeck, a designer from Austria. He worked with the Baron on some gowns and was allowed to show his own sketches to certain customers. The actress Rose Marie wrote of the Baron in her autobiography Hold the Roses: “He was adorable, with the accent and all – about forty, bald, and sort of pudgy. I loved him. I ordered three gowns . . . . I must say they were the most beautiful gowns I have ever seen or owned.”Vintage Fashion Guild, https://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/halley-grorge/ (accessed December 18, 2017); Marie Bardos, Interviews with George Halley (2011) (“Halley interviews”); Rose Marie, Hold the Roses (Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 2002), 58. Halley then started working as a porter at Lord & Taylor, but soon moved to draping the store’s windows for Christmas. He progressed to working in the backrooms of several Seventh Avenue dress firms. He never received formal training, but did work for Charles James, Jo Copeland for Pattullo, Andrew Arkin, Richard and Sidney Blauner, Jeunesse, Tzaims Luksus, and Jane Derby, as well as the photographer Richard Avedon. While Halley was working for Arkin, Diana Vreeland, the editor-in-chief of Vogue at the time, saw a dress of Halley’s that she liked. Afterwards, she often gave him space in her magazine, and once wrote him that seeing his dresses provided “the greatest possible pleasure.” Among the women he designed for were Dionne Warwick, Julie Andrews, Lauren Bacall, Julie Wilson, and Alexis Smith.Vintage Fashion Guild, https://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/halley-grorge/ (accessed December 18, 2017); Halley interviews; letter from Diana Vreeland in Halley’s collection. His first own collection consisted of \\"romantic\\" gowns in silk and satin that evoked the antebellum South. It was considered \\"too individualistic\\" by his employer, who fired him. However, it won him the backing of the husbands of two of his most devoted customers and he became a trendsetter. Halley’s first show under his own label was in 1966 in the garden at the New York restaurant Lutece, later ranked by the Zagat Survey as the best restaurant in America for six consecutive years. As a thank you, Halley painted a portrait of Andre Surmain, Lutece’s owner. Surmain was so pleased that he sent the picture to his mother in Gibraltar and kept a photo of it over Lutece’s bar.Judith Clemence, “Halley: ‘It's time for women to conform in dressing,’” The Palm Beach Post, March 14, 1971; Halley interviews; John J.

Halley’s 1968 collection won the Coty award and made him known in fashion circles throughout the U.S.Marilyn Bender, “Coty Awards Are Voted to George Halley and Luba of Elite,” The New York Times, June 21, 1968; Women's Wear Daily, June 11, 1970; The Coty American Fashion Critics' Awards were created in 1942 by the cosmetics and perfume company Coty, Inc. to promote and celebrate American fashion, and encourage design during the Second World War. Linda Welters and Patricia A. Cunningham, eds., Twentieth-century American Fashion (Oxford: Berg Publishers, 2005), 116. Prominent fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert said that one of his collections “blew a clean wind of change through this taste-minus style period.” Women's Wear Daily called him \\"a designer in a lovely world of his own.” Halley opened his fashion house on West 56th Street in Manhattan. His label lasted for about ten years.Vintage Fashion Guild, https://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/halley-grorge/ (accessed December 28, 2017); Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising Museum, http://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2015/09/george-halley.html (accessed 12/29/17); “Designer for a Divine Woman,” San Bernardino Sun, July 20, 1967.  Private life  Halley was introduced to his future wife, Claudia Morgan, by Yvonne Presser, who was later known as the highest-paid runway model. Morgan told Halley that she had heard he could find good clothes for low prices, and asked him to buy her a cocktail dress on a limited budget. She was amazed when he returned with four. Both Morgan and Presser were models for designer Norman Norell. When Halley and Morgan married in 1958, Norell gave her away, and she wore a wedding dress of antique brocade that Norell had designed.”Yvonne Presser Dies at 78,” Women’s Wear Daily, 2012, http://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/model-yvonne-presser-dead- at-78-5883368/ (accessed December 28, 2017); Halley interviews. Halley later started a new line named for his wife. Claudia served as an inspiration and a critic of his work, and had a say in the choice of fabric. He once said: “I never design anything Claudia wouldn’t wear.” They separated in 1978.Marian Christy, “Halley riding fashion world crest,” Beaver County Times, December 4, 1971; Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising Museum, http://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2015/09/george-halley.html (accessed 12/29/17); Halley interviews. Halley lives in the New York City area with his partner Yoshi Shimano. He continues to paint and to design and sew clothing for friends. He made several of the dresses his friend Julie Wilson wore in her cabaret performances, including the one pictured in her New York Times obituary.Halley interviews; Stephen Holden, “Julie Wilson, Sultry Cabaret Legend and Actress, Dies at 90,” The New York Times, April 6, 2015, https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/arts/music/julie-wilson-sultry-cabaret- legend-and-actress-dies-at-90.html?ref=topics (accessed February 12, 2018). In the 21st Century Halley’s work has continued to be recognized decades after the end of his label. A 2013 auction sold nearly 40 vintage Halley dresses.

In 2012, he and a friend published a book on the work of Norma Grauman of Brody Embroidery.

It is located in Lancaster, Lancashire in North West England and is part of the Faculty of Health and Medicine at Lancaster University. It is currently the UK's newest public medical school, with its first graduates, a cohort of 31, graduating in 2011. The current head of the medical school is Dr Rachel Isba  History  LMS admitted its first cohort of students in 2006 and, from September 2006 to July 2013, it delivered the University of Liverpool School of Medicine MBChB degree curriculum to 50 undergraduate students per year. In November 2012, the General Medical Council approved LMS's request to begin delivering its own medical degree independently from the University of Liverpool. Students beginning their studies from September 2013 are registered as Lancaster University students and are awarded a Lancaster University degree.  Curriculum  The five year MBChB degree is taught using a problem- based learning (PBL) curriculum. Whilst the University of Liverpool School of Medicine discontinued PBL as the mainstay of its curriculum in 2014,http://www.liv.ac.uk/media/livacuk/schoolofmedicine/New,MBChB,curriculum,2014,FINAL,231013.pdf LMS has retained and updated its own PBL curriculum. LMS Students sit their final examinations at the end of Year 4, which is followed, during the summer, by the Elective (medical) period. The School also offers a one-year foundation course, and in 2018 will begin teaching a new degree in sports and exercise science, described as one of the first in the UK to be delivered by a medical school.  Clinical Placements  Clinical placements for students in years 2 to 5 are arranged by the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust. As well as the time spent in hospitals (mainly the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness), students spend around a third of their clinical contact time in the community. Primary care placements are based in general practices across the Cumbria and North Lancashire region, with the North Lancashire Primary Care Trust and the Lancashire Care NHS Trust providing mental health placements. The proportion of time spent in placements ranges from 38% in year 2 to 100% in year 5 Student Admission The current number of places is 125 per year, with 4 places reserved for international (non-EU) students. There are three entry routes into the MBChB degree course; A-level or equivalent qualification, Science undergraduate degree and Access to Medicine course, such as Lancaster University's own Pre-Medical Studies course. LMS introduced the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT) for the admission of students starting in September 2016. LMS do not use the UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT).

Early life Awlia was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He studied at Dhaka Residential Model College until ninth grade. His father was an officer at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh who moved to Saudi Arabia where Awlia attended college. Awlia's passion for cars also began when he was growing up in Riyadh. At the age of 16, he visited his first motor show in Saudi Arabia, where his father bought him a Mazda. He lived in Lalmatia. Career In October 1994, at the age of 26, Awlia made the \\"Leemo-bil\\", a version of his dream car, the Lamborghini Countach. Even though he did not know how to do bodywork or paint and used a poster for the design. In the 2000s, after setting up business in Dhaka, Awlia made the \\"Leepu\\", a loose copy of another of his dream cars, a Lamborghini Diablo. For £2,500, he has turned a Daihatsu Charade into a Leepu-mobile. Awlia has also made a 22-foot-long limousine - made by welding together several cars, and powered by a 2.8 litre diesel engine. Awlia estimates that it would be worth more than $50,000. Awlia converted rusting Toyotas and Hondas into imitation Ferraris and Lamborghinis. In his converted garage, he worked with four mechanics, stripping down Japanese cars and replacing their bodywork with metal cut in the form of a sleek Italian sports car. The sheet metal they used comes from the same stock used to make the bicycle rickshaws. Awlia visited the General Motors Institute in Michigan. However, he was put off studying there by the volume of technical work therefore he decided to open his own workshop to get some practical experience. After doing this for three years, he went back to Bangladesh. He started making cars to order, based on old Daihatsus and Toyotas. In 2004, Awlia came to the attention of Intersection magazine, and received international interest. He featured in the Dhaka City Exhibition in the UK which ran from 2005-2010. In 2006, Discovery Channel requested Awlia to build two cars in eight weeks for them. Awlia completed the cars within seven weeks with the help of cockney car mechanic, Bernie Fineman. In April 2006, the first car was unveiled during a three-day show at The Dhaka Motor Show at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. It was one of Awlia's sports models, M26, it was made in four weeks using a 22-year-old Toyota Sprinter with an imported chassis. On 7 May 2006, the second car, The Peace Car, was unveiled at the Bangladesh National Museum. After the heavy modification, the 1979 Toyota Crown was difficult to trace. In June 2006, Awlia was invited to London to work on a car transformation project by the near completed Rich Mix Centre in East London as part of their opening exhibition project. He became \\"artist in residence\\" at the Rich Mix centre. For two months, he worked on handcrafting a Ford Capri into something more stylish. Called \\"Car\\", the result was on show in the summer, exhibited with a film on how the vehicle was built. In May 2007, the \\"Angel Car\\" was launched at the Boishakhi Mela Festival in Brick Lane. Awila and Fineman built the car in their workshop beneath a Whitechapel railway arch in just three weeks. Awlia worked with London-based Raw on two programs in 2007 and 2008: \\"Bangla Bangers\\", a pair of one-hour Discovery specials about his car-customizing business in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka; and \\"Chop Shop: London Garage\\", a one-season sequel series that ran on Discovery overseas. In 2007, Awlia has featured on Discovery Channel's Bangla Bangers, a car transformation project with his partner Bernie Fineman building supercars out of old models without any advanced equipment. in his back-street workshop in Dhaka. The programme was later followed by sequel-series Chop Shop: London Garage, in which designers Awlia and Fineman created a range of modified cars commissioned by celebrities. Their challenge was to produce custom-built cars on a tight budget, while matching the requirements of each client. In 2015, Awlia featured in History channel's Leepu & Pitbull, a reality show about Steve \\"Pitbull\\" Trimboli's Freeport custom-car garage. They transform \\"junk\\" cars into customized super cars via a cash-producing business venture. They completed seven cars over eight episodes, with the final car, a race car, split into two episodes. Personal life Awlia's parents did not want him to go back to Bangladesh after he moved to the United States, and requested he get married and make cars there. His marriage was arranged by his 100-year-old grandfather and he met his wife, Deepa, on the wedding day. Since 2013, Awlia has lived in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, with his wife and three children.

Lynn (November 19, 1931 – September 8, 2020) was a prize-winning poet in suburban Atlanta, Georgia, who from 1975 to 1997 was the sixth president of Southern Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana. Previously he was an administrator and interim president at his alma mater, Oklahoma Baptist University, and a journalist primarily for a Baptist press. Background Lynn graduated in 1949 from Fox High School in Fox, a small community with a considerable Native American population in Carter County in southern Oklahoma. In 1953, Lynn graduated from Oklahoma Baptist University, a Christian liberal arts college in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County in central Oklahoma. He subsequently attended the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and earned his Ph.D at the University of Oklahoma at Norman. From 1952 to 1953, while completing his undergraduate degree at OBU he was a reporter for The Shawnee News-Star. From 1953 to 1967, he was affiliated with the All Church Press in Fort Worth, including a stint as the managing editor.\\"Dr. Lynn is slated by Lions\\", Minden Press-Herald, Minden, Louisiana, September 24, 1975, p. 1 College administration From 1967 to 1972, Lynn was the assistant to the OBU president and in 1970 the OBU interim president. From 1973 until 1975, he was the vice president for administration at OBU. Lynn became the LC president on July 1, 1975, having succeeded G. Earl Guinn, who had served as president since 1951. As it turned out, Lynn was president for just two years less than his predecessor. Lynn often addressed church and civic groups around the state on the advantages of attending a small Christian liberal arts college. At LC, Lynn stressed a sense of community, honest values, and the development of the habit of lifelong learning. Lynn wrote a regular column for the state denominational newspaper, the Baptist Message published by the Louisiana Baptist Convention in Alexandria.\\"Lynn tells Louisiana College goals\\", Minden Press-Herald, September 26, 1975, p. 1 It was said that Lynn knew each student by name and some of the students's interests. At LC, Lynn served on the commission of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and maintained the accreditation of the school throughout his tenure. Lynn served too on the council of presidents of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, and the Association of Southern Baptist Colleges and Schools. He was president of the local United Way, vice-president of the Central Louisiana Chamber of Commerce, president of Alexandria Rotary International, and a member of the higher education transition team of Governor Murphy J. Foster, Jr. Under Lynn's presidency, LC received national recognition for academic quality and Christian atmosphere. The institution was recognized by U.S. News and World Report, \\"Barron's 300 Best College Buys\\", and the Templeton Foundation's Honor Roll for Character-Building Colleges. Upon Lynn's retirement, State Senator B.G. Dyess of Rapides Parish, honored him with a resolution which cites Lynn's achievement at the institution and within the community. The former Louisiana College president's home, constructed in 1956 and last occupied by the Lynns as a residence, is now the Robert L. and Bonnie Lynn Alumni and Development Center. Efforts are underway to have the two-story brick structure placed on the state list of historic places. When Lynn left LC, fundamentalists in the denomination said that he had moved the institution away from its biblical and moral roots. Lynn, however, said that the factionalism in the Louisiana Baptist Convention played no part in his decision to retire.\\"Louisiana College President retires aftger 20-olus years\\", Minden Press-Herald, March 20, 1996, p. 1 Poetry After completing twenty-two years as LC president, Lynn concentrated on his poetry in his home in Duluth, Georgia. His interest in poetry began when he was the LC president after he noticed that many students seemed to prefer verse to speeches. He kept a notebook on his bed stand to record creative bursts which came to him in the middle of the night. Hence he titled one volume of his poetry, Midnight Verse. His poems have been inspired by people who came to his mind while sleeping or events and scenes which left a particular impression. Lynn has either written or edited ten books, including his first volume of poetry entitled Service Yields Its Own Rewards. For three years, he was the editor of The Reach of Song, a collection of the Georgia Poetry Society. Lynn read his poems in such forums as the \\"Poetry in the Schools Program\\" of the Georgia Poetry Society. In 2010, for instance, he presented poems to eight hundred sixth graders in Gwinnett County, Georgia. He was affiliated with poetry societies in Oklahoma, Georgia, and Alabama. One of Lynn's best known poems is \\"Cancer Is So Limited\\", written in 2007 and published in the 2013 book Cancer Is So Limited and Other Poems of Faith. Lynn and his wife, Dr. Bonnie Moore Lynn (also born 1931), resided in Norman, in Cleveland County, Oklahoma.

She was last seen in an area of the town centre that contained several takeaway and fast-food units. Lancashire Constabulary, the police force investigating her disappearance, believe that she was murdered within hours of the last sighting. Two men were tried in May 2007—one for Downes' murder, the other for helping to dispose of her body—but the jury failed to reach a verdict. A re-trial was scheduled, but in April 2008 the accused were released because of concerns about the evidence compiled by Lancashire Constabulary.\\"IPCC concludes managed investigation into reasons behind collapse of Charlene Downes trial\\" , Independent Police Complaints Commission, 15 October 2009. The trials brought to light what Julie Bindel described in The Guardian as \\"endemic child sexual abuse\\" in the town. The police believe that, for a protracted period before her disappearance, Charlene had been the victim of child sexual abuse at the hands of one or more men. They interviewed 3,000 people and found that she and other girls in the area had been \\"swapping sex for food, cigarettes and affection\\", a form of child sexual exploitation known as localised grooming. It is thought that 60 local girls may have been targeted. On 1 August 2017, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murdering Charlene and was released two days later.\\"Charlene Downes: Murder arrest in missing Blackpool girl probe\\", BBC News, 1 August 2017.\\"Charlene Downes: Man released in 2003 missing girl murder probe\\", BBC News, 3 August 2017. A £100,000 reward remains on offer for information leading to the conviction of her killer(s) or the recovery of her body. Background Charlene lived in Buchanan Street, Blackpool, with her parents—Karen Downes and Robert Downes, a former soldier—as well as her brother and two sisters. The family had moved to Blackpool from the West Midlands in 1999. Charlene attended St George's School, Blackpool. Although described in court as \\"well and happy\\", she had experienced a \\"chaotic\\" lifestyle after being expelled from school, frequenting the area around Blackpool's Central Promenade. According to an internal police report, Downes was one of 60 girls in Blackpool, some as young as 11, who had been groomed by men to carry out sex acts. The girls would be given food and cigarettes by the male employees of fast-food outlets in exchange for sex. Last sighting Charlene's mother, Karen Downes, last spoke to Charlene early in the evening of 1 November 2003, in Blackpool town centre. Charlene was wearing black jeans with a gold-eagle design on the front, a black jumper with a white-diamond pattern, and black boots. Police say she may also have been wearing a white cardigan or top with a hood. Karen was in Church Street handing out flyers for an Indian restaurant when she saw Charlene and one of her other daughters, Rebecca, at around 6:45 pm. The three of them talked briefly. Rebecca said she was going home; Charlene said she was going to meet some female friends. She called them from a local telephone box, then waited with her mother until they arrived. Karen watched the girls walk off together toward the Winter Gardens. That was the last time she saw her daughter. The friends spent a short time together. Charlene then met another friend at around 9:30 pm and visited the Carousel Bar on the North Pier.\\"Charlene Downes Murder\\", Crimewatch, BBC, 13 December 2004, from 00:01:55. There is CCTV footage of a girl at 9 pm on the junction of Dickson Road and Talbot Road (a main thoroughfare that leads from North Pier to the town centre) that is believed to be Charlene; she is with an unidentified woman in her 30s with dyed-blonde hair wearing a three-quarter- length coat. According to Charlene's friend, she and Charlene left the Carousel Bar and returned to the town centre at around 10 pm. Her friend last saw her at around 11 pm near Talbot Road/Abingdon Street. Murder trial Following a police decision to treat Charlene's disappearance as murder, there were several arrests in the case, and two men stood trial in May 2007. The prosecution alleged at Preston Crown Court that Charlene had been murdered by Iyad Albattikhi, a 29-year-old man from Jordan and the owner of \\"Funny Boyz\\" fast-food outlet in Blackpool. Mohammed Reveshi, Albattikhi's business partner, was accused of disposing of her body. According to the prosecution, Albattikhi had sex with Charlene. The prosecution alleged that the men had discussed disposing of her body by putting it in kebabs sold from the fast food outlet. The jury failed to reach a verdict. A re-trial was ordered and scheduled for April 2008, but such serious errors in the Lancashire Constabulary's covert-surveillance evidence were identified that the Crown Prosecution Service could offer no case, and the men were released. In 2011, Albattikhi was convicted of assault after headbutting an 18-year-old woman. After a critical report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, one of the detectives involved, Det Sgt Jan Beasant, was found guilty of misconduct by Lancashire Constabulary and told to resign, but the Police Arbitration Tribunal overturned the decision. In 2014, Beasant's lawyer said she was suing the police for up to £500,000, as her transcripts were in fact entirely accurate. Subsequent publicity Blackpool Tower on the Central Promenade The trial brought to public attention what Julie Bindel described in The Guardian as \\"endemic child sexual abuse\\" in Blackpool. According to a police report, the employees of 11 takeaway shops in the town centre had been grooming dozens of white girls aged 13–15, giving them cigarettes, food and alcohol for sex. Mick Gradwell, a former detective superintendent with Lancashire Constabulary, said that the police inquiry into child grooming in Blackpool, Blackburn and Burnley had been \\"hampered by political correctness\\", according to the Daily Telegraph, because the girls were white and the perpetrators non-white. In July 2013, journalist Sean Thomas noted in The Daily Telegraph that the original Charlene Downes article on Wikipedia had been deleted, in June 2007, and argued that this might indicate editorial bias regarding \\"racialised\\" murders of white victims, which, he wrote, receive less media coverage than similar murders of black and ethnic-minority victims. Charlene's disappearance became the subject of a BBC One Panorama programme—\\"The Girl Who Vanished\\", on 10 November 2014. In December 2014, BBC Crimewatch staged a reconstruction of the last sighting of Charlene, and the police offered a £100,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer(s) or recovery of the body. In April 2008, the week after the attempt at re-trial failed, Karen Downes stabbed her husband during an argument. The wounds were minor and he declined to press charges, saying that she was maddened with worry and frustration. In March 2009, Charlene's sister, Emma, pleaded not guilty to racially aggravated assault against the brother of the man who had been charged with murdering Charlene. She maintained that her assault on the man's brother had never been racially motivated; on the first day of her trial the prosecution accepted her plea to common assault, a less serious offence. She was sentenced to community service. In 2012, Charlene's younger brother admitted in court to punching the man who had faced the charge of helping to dispose of her body. He was given a fine and a suspended sentence. 2017 arrest On 1 August 2017, police arrested a 51-year-old man from Preston, who lived in Blackpool at the time of Charlene's disappearance, on suspicion of murdering her. He was released two days later.

Subsequently other stage lines operated along the route until the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived in Yuma, Arizona. History Although it lasted only from 1857 to 1861, the Butterfield route made famous one of the most important roads in the early settlement and development of California and most of it was used in one form or another until today. The route from Fort Yuma to Warners Pass followed the Sonora Road, an old Spanish trail from Sonora to San Diego. That Sonora Road linked with the Kearny Trail was used during the Mexican American War by the U.S. Army. During the California Gold Rush the route pioneered by Kearny and Cooke with the addition of a road from Warners Pass to Los Angeles became the Southern Emigrant Trail used by American immigrants, and herds of stock from the east in 1849 and for decades thereafter. The route that was operated crossed the Colorado River from New Mexico Territory into the Second Division of the Overland Mail's route at Fort Yuma then proceeded along the river to Pilot Knob Station, where it then descended into Baja California, Mexico for 117 miles to avoid the barrier of the Algodones Dunes and to take advantage of stations with the little water available from spring flooding from the Colorado River along the course of the Alamo and New Rivers in the otherwise nearly waterless Colorado Desert. The route then reentered California to Indian Wells between the two Lagunas of the New River. The route then crossed the level, desolate, Yuha Desert to Sackett's Wells and proceeded through what is now the Carrizo Impact Area, up Carrizo Wash that cut through the Carrizo Badlands, to Carrizo Creek Station and on to the oasis of Vallicito. From there the route ascended northwest into the Peninsular Ranges, via the San Felipe Station in the San Felipe Valley crossing via Warners Pass to Warner's Ranch, then to Temecula Station and on to Los Angeles, headquarters office and terminus of the Second Division.

The museum operated until 1877 on the third floor of what became Illinois State University Old Main building (which was razed in 1958). Early history At the meeting of the Illinois State Teachers' Association in December, 1857 held at Decatur, Illinois, a paper was read by Cyrus Thomas of Carbondale, Jackson County suggesting the formation of a State Natural History Society and suggesting the State Normal School as its headquarters and the place for its Museum. In accordance with this suggestion a meeting was called at the rooms of the Normal University in Bloomington on the 30th of June following when a plan of operations was agreed upon and officers elected of whom Professor J. B. Turner was elected President. Since that time two annual meetings were held and at each succeeding meeting the evidence of increasing interest was exhibited by increased numbers. Papers were presented by President J.B. Turner on \\"Microscopic Insects\\", by Dr. Frederick Brendel of Peoria, Illinois on \\"Forests or Forest Trees\\", etc. Following the original design of Cyrus Thomas, the Normal University building was planned with a large and beautiful hall one hundred feet by thirty three feet for the Museum.

For this purpose two large halls in the University building were united by an arch affording a spacious gallery one hundred feet in length and thirty three feet wide. This hall called the Museum of Geology and Natural History was built from plans furnished by Richard H.

Arranged along the floor in front near the windows were twelve glass structures each four feet by eight feet and ten feet high furnished with shelves and bases for the department of Ornithology. In these structures of pure French glass the birds were arranged in families each with its name and habitat. At first they are chiefly occupied by the Birds of Illinois. Across an aisle four feet in width were placed twelve structures made also of plate glass corresponding with the structures for Birds. These were in the form of parallelograms each three feet by twelve feet and surmounted by a glass show case of the same dimensions and eight inches in depth. In the lower spaces were placed specimens of coal fossil flora such as Lepidodendra Sigillaria etc. which were too large for shelves.\\"Museum of the Illinois State Natural History Society\\" By C.D.

It is loosely based on the 1845 short story \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\"Kate Beckinsale in Talks for Edgar Allan Poe Adaptation ‘Eliza Graves’ by Edgar Allan Poe. The film, starring Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturgess, Michael Caine, Ben Kingsley, and David Thewlis, was released on October 24, 2014. The movie has been remade into a malayalam language movie Athiran in 2019. Plot In 1899, an Oxford University professor demonstrates a case of female hysteria, Eliza Graves, before his class. Though she protests that she is sane, the professor points out that all mental patients claim to be sane, much as all criminals claim to be innocent. The professor advises his students to believe nothing they hear and only half of what they see. Later, a young man arrives at Stonehearst Asylum, where he desires to take up residency. A group of armed men led by Mickey Finn allow him entry. Finn escorts him to the office of the superintendent, Dr. Silas Lamb, where the young doctor introduces himself as Dr. Edward Newgate from Oxford. Although Lamb was not expecting him, he welcomes the help of an Oxford-educated doctor. Newgate is surprised by Lamb's unorthodox methods. Lamb says that he does not believe in drugging or incarcerating his patients, and he encourages their delusions when he feels it will bring them greater happiness. Newgate becomes infatuated with Graves, now a resident at Stonehearst, when introduced to her. Though she brushes aside his attempts at flirtation, she is struck by his humility and respectful demeanor. A fancy feast follows, during which the staff and patients mingle. Newgate and Finn argue, and, as a truce, Finn proposes a toast. Before Newgate can drink it, Graves causes him to spill his drink. As she helps him to clean up, Graves quietly insists that he flee the asylum, but Newgate refuses to leave without her. Exploring the asylum, Newgate discovers the former staff locked in the boiler room, who explain that Lamb and Finn drugged their drinks and led a revolt. Dr. Salt and Mrs. Pike warn Newgate that Lamb is a dangerous madman – a surgeon who murdered his patients during wartime. Newgate attempts to recruit Graves, but she declines to become involved and tells him of Salt's abuses. When Newgate sneaks into Lamb's office to retrieve Salt's notes, he overhears Lamb and Finn conspire to tie up loose ends by the New Year. This takes the form of electrical shock treatment, which Lamb forces Newgate to perform on Salt. When Salt suffers amnesia, Lamb proclaims him cured of his delusion that he is the true administrator. During the New Year's celebration, Finn murders one of the young female patients, which Lamb brushes off as an accidental death. Convinced that something must be done, Newgate attempts to spike the celebratory champagne. He is caught by Finn, who then warns the others. Lamb prepares Newgate for electric shock therapy. Before it begins, Newgate reveals to Graves that he came to the asylum to rescue her once he saw her at the Oxford demonstration. Lamb grants Newgate a final request: to see a picture of Graves that he keeps in his pocket. When the picture turns out to be one of Lamb's victims, the shock causes Lamb to stagger out of the room in a daze. Finn attempts to take control, but Graves and Newgate lead a revolt against him, as the other patients have become scared of his violent nature. As Finn is electrocuted to death, a fire breaks out. Graves leads the patients out of the building, and Newgate leaves to find Lamb, who has now become near-comatose from the guilt over his actions. Flashbacks reveal that Lamb, under extreme pressure, executed his patients as form of mercy kill. After they have rescued the others, Newgate again asks Graves to leave with him, but she says that she cannot be with him because he is normal. Newgate says that he is not normal, as he is madly in love with her, and he intimates that he has a secret to tell her. Later, Graves' husband and the earlier Oxford professor arrive at the asylum. The professor asks for Mrs. Graves' release, but Mrs. Pike, who is now in charge, says that Newgate already released her. The professor reveals that he is actually Dr. Edward Newgate, and the man they knew is an escaped mental patient with pseudologia fantastica. Mrs. Graves and the imposter Newgate are shown in Tuscany, Italy, where they are known as Dr. and Mrs. Lamb. The two dance happily and embrace in the garden of what appears to be another asylum, run peacefully by nuns.

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Stonehearst Asylum offers over-the-top fun for genre aficionados; for others, however, it's likely to prove a dull disappointment.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Common criticism for the film centered upon what the reviewers felt was the film's failure to live up to its full potential, considering its atmosphere and all-A-list cast. The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"On the surface, Anderson seems to have all the necessary pieces for a surreal psycho pop. But the fear factor eludes him, leaving Stonehearst Asylum more insipid than insane.\\" Film Journal International and The A.V. Club both praised the film for its themes; the reviewer for Film Journal International wrote, \\"While the film lacks the macabre humor of the original story, it does an excellent job of conveying the creeping horror of Victorian medicine.\\" See also * Quills, a 2000 film in which Michael Caine plays a similar role * Shutter Island, a 2010 film in which Ben Kingsley plays a similar role * Athiran, 2019 Malayalam movie inspired by this movie References External links  Stonehearst Asylum at Box Office Mojo Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:American films Category:American psychological horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by John Debney Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films based on works by Edgar Allan Poe Category:Films directed by Brad Anderson Category:Films produced by Bruce Davey Category:Films produced by Mel Gibson Category:Films set in 1899 Category:Films set in psychiatric hospitals Category:Films set in Tuscany Category:Films shot in Bulgaria Category:Icon Productions films Category:University of Oxford in fiction ","title":"Stonehearst Asylum"},{"id":"40124716","title":"Emil Djuse"},{"id":"40124726","text":"Hi-VAWT is a renewable energy solutions provider headquartered in Linkou District, New Taipei City, Taiwan.

Cooper, a presbyterian pastor in Albuquerque founded the Southwest Presbyterian Sanatorium, a facility for the hundreds of tuberculosis patients coming to Albuquerque. By 1950, with tuberculosis under control, its future became in doubt. The board of directors hired a professional hospital administrator to help manage the institution.

He was known for his research into finance and corporate governance and for his contribution to raising the research profile of the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at RMIT. He was also known for the successful mentoring of a large number of students and colleagues who, as a result, climbed to the top of the academic ladder. At the core of his research was the behaviour of security prices, which was subsequently extended to cover corporate governance explanations of firm performance, the stock returns of initial public offerings and trading strategies. Much of the empirical work he did pertained to the emerging markets of Asia, particularly China. In recent times he was involved in two major projects, the first of which was to examine the impact of stock market reforms in China, whereas the second was about developing and testing a new instrument to examine behavioural biases in investor decision-making. Naughton was a fan of West Ham United football club, and had a strong dislike for Tottenham Hotspur football club, in particular their up-and-coming striker, Harry Kane.  Early life  Naughton was born in Birmingham (England) on 16 February 1952, then he moved to Ireland at the age of five. He sought independence by leaving home at the age of 16 to undertake a number of jobs, working as a kitchen assistant, a chef, a DJ and a bar tender. He then went through a bit of a hippy phase, rocking the long hair, full beard, leather jacket and flared pants. Before his death he expressed his wish to go to the Glastonbury festival in England at some point in his life. He said that seeing Jimmy Hendrix's final show was one of his most treasured memories. Naughton always had good taste in music. Naughton was a self-made person. Although he left home with nothing and dropped out of school at 16, he paid for his education by working multiple jobs and managed to become a certified accountant. Following his work as an accountant, he did an MBA at Bradford University and went on to become a lecturer at Leeds Polytechnic. At the age of 30, Naughton went to work at the University of South Pacific in Fiji, where he met his wife, Shahnaz. Soon afterwards came the proposal and they got married in 1986. They went back to Birmingham together before moving to Wollongong, Australia. It was in Wollongong where the couple had their two daughters, Sophie and Jennifer.  Qualifications and career  Naughton started his academic and professional life as an accountant. In 1975 he obtained membership of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and he was elected as a fellow in 1980. Subsequently, he earned a Master of Business Administration (with a major in Financial Management) from the Management Centre, University of Bradford in 1980. At the PhD level he concentrated on banking and finance as he obtained his doctorate from the Department of Accounting and Finance, University of Birmingham, in 1995. Prior to taking his last position as the head of the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing at RMIT, he held several academic positions in a number of institutions. From 1997 to 2003 he was a professor of international finance and the head of the School of Accounting and Finance, Griffith University. He was a senior lecturer and the head of the School of Banking and Finance, University of New South Wales, from January 1995 to January 1997. During the period July 1987 to December 1994, he was a senior lecturer in finance at the Department of Management, University of Wollongong. He also held the positions of a lecturer in development finance at the University of Birmingham, a lecturer at the School of Social and Economic Development at the University of the South Pacific (Fiji) and a senior lecturer at the School of Accounting and Applied Economics, Leeds Polytechnic. Naughton held a number of adjunct/visiting positions. He was an adjunct professor at Universitas 21, Singapore, from 2004 until his death in 2013. He was also a visiting professor at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS), Shanghai, a visiting professor at the Centre for Corporate Governance Research, University of Birmingham, an adjunct professor at the Centre for International Business Research, University of Wollongong, an adjunct senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Business, University of Sydney, a visiting fellow at the School of Banking and Finance, University of New South Wales, a visiting research fellow at Universitas Islam, Indonesia, and a visiting senior research fellow at the Department of Accounting and Finance, University of Birmingham. Naughton's professional experience was exclusively in accounting. During the period 1976-1982 he had his own auditing and accounting practice, Naughton & Co. Prior to that he had obtained auditing and accounting experience with Touche Ross and Morley & Scott Chartered accountants in Birmingham and London, specializing in the audit of banks and financial institutions.  Scholarly contributions  Naughton made contributions to several areas of finance. Starting with asset pricing, he wrote an article on the Taiwan stock market in which he developed a multifactor asset pricing model incorporating a price limit factor to explain the cross section of asset returns following closely the mimicking portfolio Fama-French methodology.Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2004) Are Price Limits Priced? Evidence from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Journal of Emerging Market Finance, 3, 249-267. The findings showed that the overall market factor, firm size and price limits capture a cross section of average stock returns in a meaningful manner. In an article on China he compared the performance of the traditional CAPM with the multifactor model of Fama and French for equities listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. He also investigated the explanatory power of idiosyncratic volatility and responded to the claim that multifactor model findings can be explained by the turn of the year effect.Naughton, A., Drew, M. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2005) Pricing of Equities in China: Evidence from the Shanghai Stock Exchange', Managerial Finance, 31, 46-57. He conducted further work on Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan to examine the proposition that the beta in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) was lacking in cross-sectional explanatory power.Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2005) A Multifactor Model Explanation of the Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns: Evidence from Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan, Finance India, 19, 135-157. By incorporating the two most commonly used additional explanatory factors (size and book to market equity) he tested for evidence of multifactor risk premia. The results showed that the overall market factor was highly significant in all of the markets and that the magnitude of significance of the other two factors (size and book to market equity) varied across countries. He rejected the claim that the multifactor model findings could be explained by the turn of the year effect. Naughton was an expert on trading strategies. In 2008 he published a paper in which he investigated the profitability of momentum investment strategies for the equities listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.Naughton, A., Truong, C. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2008) Momentum Strategies and Stock Returns: Chinese Evidence, Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 16, 476-492. He also investigated the role of trading volume to find out if it was related to stock returns. He detected substantial momentum profits during the period 1995 to 2005 and revealed that momentum was a pervasive feature of stock returns. This finding stood as a direct challenge to the validity of the efficient market hypothesis, which has been discredited by the advent of the global financial crisis. In another study of trading strategies he examined the profitability of momentum and contrarian strategies for the equities listed on the Australian Stock Exchange by taking into consideration short- selling restrictions.Ramiah, V., Mugwagwa, T. and Naughton, A. (2011) Hot and Cold Strategies: Australian Evidence, Review of Pacific Basin Financial Markets and Policies, 14, 271-295. He revealed significant contrarian profits and showed that it was a persistent feature of the underlying strategies. One area of corporate finance to which he made a contribution was initial public offerings (IPOs). In a study of IPOs in Australia he provided insights into the short and long-term performance of the IPOs for new economy companies in the period 1995 to 2000.Murgulov, Z. and Naughton, A. (2002) New Economy Initial Public Offerings in Australia, Accounting, Accountability and Performance, 8, 21-60. He found that new economy IPOs provided high average initial returns to subscribing investors although there was evidence for severe overpricing. Another area of corporate finance to which he contributed was capital structure. In a study of the determinants of the capital structure of Chinese companies he demonstrated, by using the techniques of extreme bounds analysis (EBA), that some of the firm-specific determinants reported as important in previous studies might be fragile, in the sense that the sign and/or significance of the coefficients on these variables changed, depending on model specification (the variables included in or excluded from the model).Moosa, I., Li, Q. and Naughton, A. (2011) Robust and Fragile Firm- Specific Determinants of the Capital Structure of Chinese Firms, Applied Financial Economics, 21, 1331-1343. For example, he found that although conventional cross-sectional analysis would lend support to the importance of tangibility and stock price performance, these two variables turned out to be fragile. Another area of Naughton's interest, to which he made a contribution, was corporate governance. In one study he focused on the emerging corporate governance reform in China to investigate the relationship between a range of board characteristics and IPO initial returns and long-term performance.Li, L. and Naughton, A. (2007) Going Public with Good Governance: Evidence from China', Corporate Governance, 15, 1190-1202. He found evidence indicating that board size is positively related to short-term returns, while a positive long- run relationship existed between performance and the voluntary post-listing separation of the roles of CEO and chair of the board. His results suggested that at least some Chinese listed firms were actively and voluntarily moving towards better governance structures. In another study of corporate governance in China he examined the 2005 policy decision to change the status of non- tradable state and non-state shares into tradable A shares.Li, Q., Hovey, M. and Naughton, A. (2009) A Review of Corporate Governance in China, in F.J. Lopez Iturriaga (ed.) Codes of Good Governance Around the World, New York: Nova Science Publishers, 415-436. He envisaged that over time all of these shares would be tradable and potentially transferred to foreign and domestic private sector investors and that those changes had the potential to alter the monitoring and control of the majority of listed firms that until then had been controlled by tightly held blockholders of non-tradable shares. He also studied how parties' formal contracts were underpinned by their ongoing relationship and how welfare changes as the legal system improved.Hermalin, B, Li, Q. and Naughton, A. (2013) The Relational Underpinnings of Formal Contracting and the Welfare Consequences of Legal System Improvement, Economics Letters, 119, 72-76. His work in international finance was no less impressive. In an award-winning paper he attempted to verify the exchange rate regime that China had been following since 21 July 2005 when a policy shift was implemented, presumably taking China from a dollar peg to a basket peg.Moosa, I., Naughton, A. and Li, Q. (2009) Exchange Rate Regime Verification: Has China Actually Moved from a Dollar Peg to a Basket Peg?, Economia Internazionale, 62, 41-67. He demonstrated that while a regime of simple and strict dollar peg had been abandoned, China was on a peg, as it was claimed officially. He suggested that China had shifted to some sort of a discretionary crawling peg against the U.S. dollar. This paper made a significant contribution to the literature on de facto and de jure exchange rate regimes and the problem of exchange rate regime verification. The diversity of Naughton's research is obvious in a number of other papers. In those papers he investigated the impact of ownership and ownership concentration on the performance of China's listed firms.Ma, S., Naughton, A. and Tian, G. (2010) Ownership and Ownership Concentration: Which is Important in Determining the Performance of China’s Listed Firms?', Accounting and Finance, 50, 871-897. He also attempted to find out if idiosyncratic volatility is useful in explaining the variation in expected returns and if the findings can be explained by the turn of the year effect.Drew, M., Malin, M., Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2006) Idiosyncratic volatility and Security Returns: Evidence from Germany and United Kingdom, Studies in Economics and Finance, 23, 80-93. In another paper he sought to extend the mounting evidence against the view that the beta coefficient of the capital asset pricing model is the sole measure of risk.Drew, M., Naughton, A. and Veeraraghavan, M. (2003) Firm Size, Book-to-Market Equity and Security Returns: Evidence from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Australian Journal of Management, 28, 119-139. He investigated the relationship between firm performance and corporate governance in China, where performance is measured by Tobin's Q.Hovey, M., Li, L. and Naughton, A. (2003) The Relationship between Valuation and Ownership of Listed Firms in China, Corporate Governance, 11, 112-122. He also contributed to the literature on trading strategies involving options when he examined the performance of the buy-write option strategy and attempted to find out if such an investment opportunity violated the efficient market hypothesis on the basis of its risk and returns.Mugwagwa, T., Ramiah, V., Naughton, A. and Moosa, I. (2012) The Efficiency of the Buy-Write Strategy: Evidence from Australia, Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 22, 305-328. Contrarian strategies were considered in another paper in which he investigated the profitability of these strategies for the equities listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the relationship between stock returns and past trading volume.Ramiah, V., Cheng, K., Orriols, J., Naughton, A. and Hallahan, T. (2011) Contrarian Investment Strategies Work Better for Dually- Traded Stocks: Evidence from Hong Kong, Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, 19, 140-156. Furthermore, he did some work on the link between performance and changes in the size and stability of a firm's officers and directorsHeaney, R., Naughton, A., Fry, T., Davidson, S., McKenzie, M. and Truong, T. (2007) The Link Between Performance and Changes in the Size and Stability of a Firm’s Officers and Directors, Journal of Multinational Financial Management, 17, 16-29. and surveyed enterprise reforms in China, making recommendations with respect to the way forward.Hovey, M. and Naughton, A. (2007) A Survey of Enterprise Reforms in China: The Way Forward, Economic Systems, 31, 138-156. Most of his contributions had significant practical implications.

The work represents at least four nude women (or bathers) relaxing in a highly abstract landscape with vegetation and a small body of water visible through reflections and from the woman on the left whose legs are submerged from the knees down. The central figure holds the trunk of a tree with her left arm and a woman with her right, forming a tight central mass. The two nudes at the center, treated in a light color, stand-out against a darker background. They are flanked on both sides by a standing and a sitting nude. The colors of the painting, as its dimensions and whereabouts, are unknown The Wild Men of Paris Leading up to 1910, the draftsman, illustrator and poet Gelett Burgess interviewed and wrote about artists and artworks in and around Paris. The result of Burgess' investigation was published after his visit to the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, the massive anti-establishment art exhibition in Paris, and one year before the scandalous group exhibition that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public. At the 1910 Indépendants Jean Metzinger showed his Portrait of Apollinaire (the first Cubist portrait according to Guillaume Apollinaire); Albert Gleizes showed his Portrait de René Arcos and L'Arbre (The Tree), paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms representational interests.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881–1953Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified Ploumanac'h landscapes: Le Ravin and Village dans les Montagne, along with Femme à l'éventail and Portrait of Maroussia. In the same exhibition hung the works of Henri Matisse, Maurice de Vlaminck, Raoul Dufy, Marie Laurencin, Kees van Dongen and Henri Rousseau.Kubisme.info, Salon des Indépendants Gelett Burgess writes in The Wild Men of Paris of the same exhibition: > There were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. > Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on > square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of > squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and > coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues. > > But the nudes!

They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself! Baigneuse, Deux nus dans un jardin exotique (Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape), oil on canvas, 116 x 88.8 cm, Colección Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza, Spain After the death of Paul Cézanne in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of several large exhibitions and a retrospective at the Salon d'Automne of 1907, greatly affecting the direction taken by the avant- garde artists in Paris. Prior to the advent of Cubism, Cézanne's geometric simplifications and optical phenomena inspired not just Metzinger, Matisse, Derain and Braque, but the other artists who earlier exhibited with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, also experimented with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development modern art. The Fauvism of Metzinger, Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of 1907. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h, Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, the Netherlands Burgess continues: > Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It > had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had > taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics > and the contempt of academicians.

And so, and so, a-hunting I would go! Turning his attention to Metzinger's abode, Burgess writes in The Architectural Record: > Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of > color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should > result.

Both stances are verbalized with the same abstract vocabulary. In both cases, the figures are camouflaged or blended with the background, their bodies forming part of the landscape. These works were completed at a time when Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir in Montmartre, where he may have seen Picasso's painting. There are differences, too, worth noting between the two works (aside from the size and colors which are unknown in the Metzinger case). While the dominant feature of Picasso's painting is the landscape, Metzinger chose to highlight the figures; the landscape playing only a secondary role in the overall composition. Metzinger's figures are much larger relative to the canvas. They are prominently and symmetrically displayed, and of lighter color contrast relative to Picasso's asymmetrical juxtaposition and subdued contrasting. Two of Metzinger's nudes—to the right and left of the dominant central figures—are quite inconspicuous, as in Picasso's piece. In both paintings the nudes and landscape have become unified, not presuming a representation of reality. They are the product of a reductive abstracting process, of an open, freewheeling process of synthesis—where a dialogue between components lead to the liberation from any particular classical foundation. They are combined harmoniously though pictographic imagery rendered in residuum abstractions of apparent mathematical codes. In the case of Metzinger, his prowess in mathematics is well documented. In the case of Picasso, the mathematical association with his paintings has been made through Maurice Princet. Metzinger's early interests in mathematics is well documented. He was familiar with the works of Gauss, Riemann and Jules Henri Poincaré (and perhaps Galilean relativity) prior to the development of Cubism: something that reflects in his pre-1907 works.Alex Mittelmann, 2012, Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post-Cubism The French mathematician Maurice Princet promoted the work of Poincaré, along with the concept of the fourth spatial dimension, to artists at the Bateau-Lavoir. He was a close associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Metzinger. Princet is known as \\"le mathématicien du cubisme.\\" He brought to the attention of these artists a book entitled Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions by Esprit Jouffret (1903) a popularization of Poincaré's Science and Hypothesis. In this book Jouffret described hypercubes and complex polyhedra in four dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page. Princet became estranged from the group after his wife left him for André Derain. However, Princet would remain close to Metzinger and participate in meetings of the Section d'Or in Puteaux. He gave informal lectures to the artists, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order. In 1910, Metzinger said of him, \\"[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry\\".Jean Metzinger, October–November 1910, \\"Note sur la peinture\\" Pan: 60 Picasso's Landscape with Two Figures is almost entirely Cézannian, in its color, in its reduction to simplified forms and in its loose brushwork. Picasso still shows a sense of depth perspective through shading, despite some flattening of the surface. Metzinger's painting is less influenced by Cézanne in its brushstrokes, hardly visible in this photograph. Its quasi-Nabis post-Symbolist treatment can be observed, but Metzinger vacates all depth of field. The background and foreground have become one. The only devices that indicate depth are (1) elevation in the picture plane; lower is closer and further is higher, and (2) objects in front of others obscure the object in the background, such as the central nude appears in front of the nude she holds with her right hand. In both paintings, the faces of the models have been left out, featureless, reduced to their simplest spherical form. In light of the fact that Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir since 1908 and exhibited with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill's gallery,Joann Moser, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909, p. 35, 1985, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press introduced to Picasso by Max Jacob and Guillaume Krotowsky (who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire),Russell T. Clement, 1994, Les Fauves: A sourcebook and in view of the similarities between the two works, it is probable that Metzinger's Bathers was painted the same year; 1908. The differences between the two paintings suggest that, while Metzinger may have been influenced by Picasso (unlike Albert Gleizes), his intention was certainly not to copy or even resemble the Spaniard, as would soon Braque (or visa versa). His intention was to create his own brand of art, dependent on his own lived experience. > Then the kingdom of the Fauves whose civilization had appeared so new, so > powerful, so startling, took on suddenly the aspect of a deserted village. > > It was then that Jean Metzinger, joining Picasso and Braque, founded the > Cubist City.

By 1908–09, in such studies as Baigneuses (Bathers), it is apparent that Metzinger was not following the lead of Picasso or Braque in their hermetic approach to painting—he had little interest in imitating, whether it be \\"an orb on a vertical plane\\" or anything else—Metzinger was on a path leading to abstraction and to the almost total disintegration of recognizable form.

Metzinger's Baigneuses reproduced top right New York Times, 1911 Metzinger's Baigneuses was reproduced in the 8 October 1911 issue of The New York Times. This article was published a year after The Wild Men of Paris, and two years prior to the Armory Show, which introduced astonished Americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. The 1911 New York Times article, a review of the 1911 Salon d'Automne, portrayed works by Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 Salon. The article is titled: \\"The 'Cubists' Dominate Paris' Fall Salon\\" and subtitled, \\"Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition - What Its Followers Attempt to Do.\\" :\\"Among all the paintings on exhibition at the Paris Fall Salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called \\"Cubist\\" school. In fact, dispatches from Paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...] :In spite of the crazy nature of the \\"Cubist\\" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. Georges Braque, André Derain, Picasso, Czobel, Othon Friesz, Herbin, Metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which Paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement. :What do they mean? Have those responsible for them taken leave of their senses? Is it art or madness? Who knows?\\" Proto-Cubism According to Metzinger, in his Cubism was Born, published years later, Cubism had been born out of the \\"need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity\\"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in trompe l'oeil on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. \\"Quite clearly\\" Metzinger notes, \\"nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common ...\\" Already, in 1906, \\"it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model\\".Jean Metzinger, Le Cubisme était Né: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger (Cubism was Born), Présence, Chambéry, 1972. (This text written by Jean Metzinger was supplied to the publisher Henri Viaud by Metzinger's widow Suzanne Phocas).

(Jean Metzinger, Cubism > was Born) From his Montmartre studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, \\"the attempt [prétention] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age.\\" > I wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do > with the business of creating illusions.

Beauty depends not only on geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself. It wasn't just the simple result of a reductive approach to the elements of all the parts. It wasn't either just a dialectic view of everything that led him just as simply to treat each object as opposed to the other, and therefore thoroughly distinct. The blurring of differences was against the entire tenor of the whole. The narrative of Metzinger outlined by his Bathers schematic geometric arrangements was the result of an abstracting process not solely based on \\"axiomatics\\". These axiomatic abstractions, however, by themselves contain no assertions as to the reality that can be experienced, not in a logical sense deduced from experience, but free inventions of the human mind, abstractions, construed by mathematical means. With works such as Bathers had emerged a growing accent on the power of the mind to create for itself, a growing spirit of abstraction, of invention, fabrication. As one would expect, Metzinger’s concept of painting was both more sophisticated and perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally the shape of the misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted in the experience of nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, and at the same time brought out the flatness and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of multiple perspectives and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an n-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’). > Nearly conscious in someone like Michelangelo, or Paolo Uccello, quite > intuitive in painters such as Ingres, or Corot, it works on the basis of > numbers which belong to the painting itself, not to whatever it represents. > (Metzinger) Related works File:Las bañistas, por Jean-Honoré Fragonard.JPGJean- Honoré Fragonard, 1765, The Bathers, oil on canvas, 64 x 80 cm (25.2 x 31.5 in), The Louvre, Paris File:Gustave Courbet - The Bathers - WGA05500.jpgGustave Courbet, 1853, The Bathers, oil on canvas, 227 x 193 cm (89.4 x 76 in), Musée Fabre, Montpellier File:Baigneurs, par Paul Cézanne, 1870.jpgPaul Cézanne, c. 1870, Bathers, oil on canvas, 33 x 40 cm, Private collection File:La Baignade, par Paul Cézanne, Yorck.jpgPaul Cézanne 1876–77, Bathers, oil on canvas, 15 x 19 cm, Private collection File:Émile Bernard Three Bathers 1890.jpgÉmile Bernard, 1890, Three Bathers File:Three Bathers among the Irises (c1900 - Paul Ranson).jpgPaul Ranson, 1890, Three Bathers among the Irises File:Paul Gauguin - Fatata te Miti (By the Sea) - Google Art Project.jpgPaul Gauguin, 1892, By the Sea (Fatata te miti), 67.9 × 91.5 cm (26.7 × 36 in), National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

Yatim, an 18-year-old Toronto male armed with a switchblade knife, was shot at nine times, and was hit by eight of the shots fired by 30-year-old Toronto Police Service (TPS) officer James Forcillo. After being shot, while laying on the floor of the streetcar he was tasered. He later died from the injuries. The incident occurred after Yatim, brandishing a switchblade knife in a Toronto streetcar, advanced on a passenger, threatened other passengers, and exposed himself. The confrontation between Yatim and the police was recorded and footage of it was released publicly, prompting strong reactions across Canada. On August 19, 2013, Forcillo was charged with second-degree murder. On July 30, 2014, he was also charged with attempted murder. On January 25, 2016, he was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter, but guilty of attempted murder. On July 28, he was sentenced to six years in prison. The next day, he was granted bail pending an appeal of the court's sentence. His appeal was denied and he was granted parole after serving 2 years in prison. This incident was the only time an on-duty Ontario officer was charged and convicted in the death of a person since the inception of the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in 1990. Shooting At 10:30 pm on July 26, Sammy Yatim boarded a Toronto subway trainAlamenciak, Tim. For Sammy Yatim’s father, ‘horrible nightmare’ continues, The Hamilton Spectator, July 31, 2014. and transferred to a streetcar on route 505 Dundas around 11:45 pm.Mehta, Diana. Sammy Yatim shooting death on Toronto streetcar shown in court, CTV News, October 21, 2015 Sometime afterwards, he drew his switchblade knife, approached a passenger, and told other passengers to remain on the streetcar, reportedly acting aggressively towards other passengers. Frightened, the passengers promptly tried to escape. Yatim then revised his demands, ordering everyone off the streetcar. He began to approach the driver of the vehicle but stopped to shout obscenities at the crowd gathering outside. The driver of the streetcar remained at the controls until shortly before police arrived. A passenger and witness said that upon boarding the streetcar he initially noticed Yatim sitting at the back, across from a group of teenage girls. He later heard giggling from the back of the streetcar followed by a scream, then saw Yatim brandishing a knife as the girls ran past him toward the front doors. According to two other witnesses, Yatim seemed irate, mentally unstable, and oblivious to others' presence, holding his exposed genitals in one hand and a knife in the other. Police arrived at the scene. At the front of the vehicle, Constable James Forcillo of the Toronto Police Service called for a Taser, believing the situation \\"could be contained\\". According to videos of the incident, police ordered Yatim to drop the knife several times and warned him not to \\"take one step in this direction\\". After Yatim started advancing towards the police armed with a knife, Forcillo fired three shots, forcing Yatim to the ground. When Yatim started to get up, several seconds later, Forcillo fired six more shots. Approximately 30 seconds later, Forcillo's Sergeant, Dan Pravica Tasered Yatim. It was later determined that eight of the nine shots fired hit Yatim, and the initial salvo of three shots had killed Yatim almost instantly. Surveillance video indicates that Yatim was lying on the deck when the last six shots were fired.New video appears to show Sammy Yatim already on ground during last six shots, MetroNews.ca, July 30, 2013. Yatim was transported and later pronounced dead at St. Michael's Hospital. Backgrounds =James Forcillo= James Forcillo was born December 30, 1982, in Montreal, Quebec. He is a second-generation Italian Canadian.\\"A look at the life of James Forcillo, the officer charged in Toronto's streetcar shooting\\", by Kathryn Blaze Carlson, The Globe and Mail He was a constable with six years on the force at the time of the shooting. He graduated from a justice program at East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park, California, United States, and received a psychology degree from York University in Toronto. He worked as a security guard in Toronto, and then was employed as a court services officer for three years. Up until Yatim's death, he worked as a patrol officer for three years. =Sammy Yatim= Sammy Adib Yatim was an ethnic Aramean born on November 5, 1994, in Aleppo, Syria. He emigrated to Toronto from Aleppo, Syria, with his family in 2008. He had recently graduated from Brebeuf College School in North York, Toronto and had told a friend he intended to focus on his education. It is unclear what provoked Yatim's behaviour the night he was shot. His family said that he had no history of mental illness or violence. He had \\"moderate to moderately high levels of ecstasy in his system at the time of his death, as well as marijuana and a trace amount of cocaine\\" according to the autopsy report.The Toronto Star, October 20, 2015, Murder trial begins for Const. James Forcillo in Sammy Yatim shooting  Aftermath  In July 2014, an $8-million lawsuit was filed against Toronto Police Service by Yatim's family. The shooting and subsequent investigation and trial raised questions about police accountability in Toronto. SIU response and criminal trial As the event was recorded on cellphone camera and posted on YouTube by Markus Grupp and Martin Baron, it received international coverage and attention as a potential use of excessive force by the Toronto Police. It also triggered protests, with one temporarily blocking traffic on Dundas street downtown.\\"Renewed protests planned in Toronto over Sammy Yatim shooting\\", by Vidya Kauri, The Globe and Mail On August 8, the Ontario Ombudsman, André Marin, launched a review of police tactics for defusing heated situations, in the wake of public outcry over Yatim's death. The decision was criticized by the Toronto Police Association as a grandstanding political move, and the review as too vague in its goals. = Internal review = On August 12, former Toronto police chief Bill Blair announced he had enlisted former Associate Chief Justice of Ontario, Dennis O'Connor, to conduct an internal review of the use of force by police, and recommend ways police can better respond to situations involving the mentally unstable. On August 28, however, O'Connor withdrew from the police probe due to a potential conflict of interest. There is no known investigation into the use of the Taser in the incident or into videos which allegedly show a police officer kicking shell casings inside the yellow police tape at the scene of the shooting. = Arrest = On August 19, the Ontario Special Investigations Unit (SIU) announced that an arrest warrant had been issued for Forcillo. He was charged with second-degree murder. Forcillo surrendered on August 20. If convicted, the minimum sentence is life imprisonment without parole eligibility for at least ten years.Criminal Code Free on $510,000 bail, Forcillo was not required to appear at the next stage of his preliminary hearing on December 11. Toronto police stayed a disciplinary charge of discreditable conduct under the Police Services Act of Ontario until the criminal trial has finished. Despite this, Forcillo returned to work, but he did not have a firearm nor did he wear a TPS uniform. Michael McCormack responded by saying \\"the situation is not unusual for officers who have been suspended.\\" On June 17, 2014, the preliminary inquiry ended with judge Richard LeDressay ordering Forcillo to stand trial in 2015. Evidence presented in the inquiry is under a publication ban. Forcillo continued to serve as a Toronto Crime Stoppers administrator.\\"Toronto cop James Forcillo to go on trial for second-degree murder in streetcar shooting of Sammy Yatim\\", by The Canadian Press, via The National Post On July 30, 2014, Crown prosecutors added the charge of attempted murder \\"by shooting [Yatim] with a firearm and thereby wounding him.\\"\\"Toronto officer faces extra charge in Sammy Yatim shooting case\\", by The Canadian Press, via The Globe and Mail Legal experts said the second charge was a highly unusual strategy. = Trial = Lawyers on both sides of Forcillo's trial began making pre-trial motions in the Toronto Courthouse on September 14, 2015. Jury selection began on September 30, 2015.  Prosecution  During the trial, presided over by Justice Edward Then, the prosecution put forward the theory that Forcillo had over-reacted and \\"lost his cool\\" in his decision to fire at Yatim. A former police chief testifying as a use of force expert said he believed Yatim provided no imminent threat requiring the use of deadly force by Forcillo. In cross examination, the prosecution asked Forcillo why he had not put more effort into de-escalating the situation to avoid violence. Forcillo responded that pulling out his firearm in response to Yatim's knife was \\"a form of de- escalation\\".  Defence  Forcillo argued that he was acting in self- defence both times he fired his weapon. In testifying in his own defense, Forcillo explained that he followed standard police procedure, and believed Yatim to be a threat when he repeatedly ignored his orders to \\"drop the knife\\" and instead proceeded to advance towards him. In support of the defense, a police college instructor testified that Forcillo was out of options the night he shot Yatim. Passengers on the streetcar also testified their experiences of fear, terror and chaos when Yatim threatened them with his knife.  Verdict and sentence  On January 25, 2016, the jury found Forcillo not guilty of second degree murder and manslaughter, but guilty of attempted murder. The jury accepted the defence's argument that Forcillo was justified in firing the first three shots, but found him not justified in the second round of shots, thus guilty of attempted murder. The verdict meant Forcillo faces a four-year minimum sentence. Forcillo challenged the minimum sentence law and his conviction, in arguments heard in May 2016. After the defence was granted a postponement to prepare on May 16, the legal challenge began May 18, expected to last two or three days, followed by the sentencing hearing over another two. The defence sought house arrest, and the Crown sought eight to ten years in prison.\\"Sentencing hearing postponed for Const. James Forcillo, convicted in streetcar shooting\\", by Canadian Press, via CBC At the conclusion of the hearing on May 26, judge Ed Then said he would announce Forcillo's sentence on July 29.\\"Forcillo to learn sentence July 29\\", by Sam Pazzano, Toronto Sun On July 28, 2016, Forcillo was sentenced to six years in prison. The TPS also suspended him without pay. = Appeal and bail = After one night in jail, Forcillo was granted bail pending an appeal of the court's decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. His lawyers were ordered to provide the court with an update on this process by November 9. Forcillo's bail conditions required him to stay at the home of his then-wife and her parents. Because Forcillo was deemed unlikely to commit further offences, his bail was extended in November 2016. In early November 2017, Forcillo applied for his bail to be modified so he could live with his new fiancée instead of at the home of his now ex-wife, and have his new fiancée added as a surety. Two days before the hearing for the bail modification was to be heard, provincial investigators found Forcillo at the residence of his fiancée in violation of his bail conditions. Forcillo was arrested the next day and charged with failing to comply with his recognizance, which has a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment. The attorney general filed an application with the Court of Appeal to revoke Forcillo's bail. Forcillo's bail hearing for the charge of failing to comply with his bail conditions was delayed pending the result of the application to revoke his bail, which was scheduled to be heard in court on November 30. In the meantime, Forcillo was remanded in custody and was in protective custody because he is a police officer. The Court of Appeal for Ontario subsequently dismissed Forcillo's appeal on April 30, 2018, and upheld the original trial-imposed six-year sentence. On December 6 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada denied Forcillo's application for leave to appeal his conviction. = New charges = In November 2017, Forcillo was charged with breaching his bail conditions and then in December 2017, also faced one additional obstruction of justice charge related to allegedly committing perjury when signing an affidavit under oath. The affidavit had been filed in court when Forcillo was seeking a variance in his bail terms and was awaiting a hearing to address the variance request when he was found to be living in violation of his current bail terms by police investigators in November. According to documents filed with the court, Forcillo is alleged to have made \\"false statements under oath\\" when he stated in the affidavit that he was in full compliance with the terms of his bail and related house arrest. Forcillo was scheduled to appear in court on December 29.\\"Const. James Forcillo faces new charges including perjury\\", by Alina Bykova and Betsy Powell, via The Toronto Star.

The culture who built it and the time it was built remains unknown. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Contemporary archaeologists have described it as \\"one of the many enigmatic effigy mounds in Southern Ohio.\\" Location The site is located in Cross Mound Park, near a tributary of the Scioto River. The site totals 29-acres. To access the site, visitors must pass over a suspension bridge that was built in 1936. Survey history =Squier and Davis: 1848= Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis visited the site in the mid 1840s. They would discuss their survey in their 1848 publication Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. They describe the location of the work as occupying a \\"narrow spur of land,\\". They describe the design of the work as a Greek cross. The work was three feet high and 90 feet apart on each end and closely matches the cardinal directions. A small ditch surrounded it, following the design of the cross. In the middle of the cross was a circle shaped depression. The depression was noted as being 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet deep. Towards what they describe as the \\"back\\" of the cross was \\"a small circular elevation of stone and earth.\\" (Later to be described by contemporary surveyors as a \\"small stone mound\\".) They believed it to be an altar. Squier and Davis believed that this installation represented a connection with the Alligator Effigy Mound in nearby Granville, Ohio. Near the main site, they noted a collection of smaller mounds. A larger hill near the cross was described as having \\"several large mounds,\\". Brief History \\"Cross Mound is located, near a tributary of the Scioto River (Cross Mound, 2015). The site totals 29-acres and to access the site, visitors must pass over a suspension bridge that was built in 1936 (Cross Mound, 2015). This site used to be within Tarlton’s limits until recently, in fact, it is known as called Tarlton Cross Mound (Cross Mound, 2015). Today, the site is maintained and owned by the Fairfield County Historical Parks Commission (Cross Mound,2015).\\" =Today= Today, the site is maintained and owned by the Fairfield County Historical Parks Commission. The Ohio Historical Society reports that the 20 foot depression in the middle of the cross is 12 inches deep, not 20 inches deep in the middle of it. Dr. Greg Little also suggests that the cross itself is four feet high not three feet high as surveyed by Squier and Davis. Three small mounds also exist at the site, today. The exact age of the site is undetermined. They theorize that the site may represent the sun, as crosses were utilized by the Mississippian culture frequently as a sun symbol. They also theorize that it was built by the Fort Ancient peoples, but the National Park Service and others suggest that it was built by the Hopewell culture. Despite the suggestion of that the Hopewells designed the work, Dr. Jarrod Burks of Ohio Valley Archaeology states \\"not enough evidence exists to support this claim.\\" Burks does believe that the site was probably built during the Middle Woodland period. Other effigy mounds in the area, Alligator Effigy Mound and Serpent Mound, are both dated after 1,000 AD.

NCAA is an antitrust class action lawsuit filed against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The lawsuit, which former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon filed on behalf of the NCAA's Division I football and men's basketball players, challenges the organization's use of the images of its former student athletes for commercial purposes. The suit argues that upon graduation, a former student athlete should become entitled to financial compensation for NCAA's commercial uses of his or her image. The NCAA maintains that paying its athletes would be a violation of its concept of amateurism in sports. At stake are \\"billions of dollars in television revenues and licensing fees.\\" On August 8, 2014, District Judge Claudia Wilken found for O'Bannon, holding that the NCAA's rules and bylaws operate as an unreasonable restraint of trade, in violation of antitrust law.\\"[T]he Court finds that this restraint does violate antitrust law.\\" p.98, O'Bannon v. NCAA, N.D. Cal., Aug. 8, 2014. The Court said it would separately enter an injunction regarding the specific violations found. In September, 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, the District Court's ruling.O'Bannon v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, 802 F. 3d 1049, (9th Cir., 2015) March 2016, O'Bannon's lawyers appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on October 3, 2016.  History  In July 2009, Ed O'Bannon, a former basketball player for UCLA who was a starter on the UCLA's 1995 national championship team, and the NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player of that year, filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and the Collegiate Licensing Company, alleging violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act and of actions that deprived him of his right of publicity. He agreed to be the lead plaintiff after seeing his likeness from the 1995 championship team used in the EA Sports title NCAA Basketball 09 without his permission. The game featured an unnamed UCLA player who played O'Bannon's power forward position, while also matching his height, weight, bald head, skin tone, No. 31 jersey, and left-handed shot. In January 2011, Oscar Robertson joined O'Bannon in the class action suit. Bill Russell is also among the 20 former college athletes who are plaintiffs. Electronic Arts and the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC), both original co-defendants with the NCAA, departed from the case and finalized a $40 million settlement that could net as much as $4,000 to as many as 100,000 current and former athletes who had appeared in EA Sports' NCAA Basketball and NCAA Football series of video games since 2003. Trial and verdict The trial against the NCAA lasted from June 9 to June 27, 2014. Final written closing statements were submitted on July 10.. On August 8, 2014, Wilken ruled that the NCAA's long-held practice of barring payments to athletes violated antitrust laws. She ordered that schools should be allowed to offer full cost-of-attendance scholarships to athletes, covering cost-of-living expenses that were not currently part of NCAA scholarships. Wilken also ruled that college be permitted to place as much as $5,000 into a trust for each athlete per year of eligibility. The NCAA subsequently appealed the ruling, arguing that Wilken did not properly consider NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma. In that case, the NCAA was denied control of college football television rights. The Supreme Court denied the NCAA's appeal. The NCAA was also ordered to pay the plaintiffs $42.2 million in fees and costs.

He backed Matthew Webb to swim the channel and later managed his family members' swimming careers. Life Lambeth Baths in 1854 Beckwith was a swimming instructor (a \\"Professor\\") at Lambeth Baths. He was an early proponent of sidestroke which was a technique first seen in Australia with what was called an overarm recovery. This remained the best stroke for longer distances for some time even after front crawl became popular. Beckwith used the technique successfully to win the English championship. His daughter Agnes and son Willie were also accomplished swimmers. Beckwith was a showman and he had assumed the title \\"Champion of the World\\" in 1851. Beckwith lost the first defence of this claim because he was said to be only an average swimmer. In 1874 Beckwith backed Matthew Webb to be the first person to swim the channel. He trained Webb and organised early publicity by exhibiting Webb as he swam up the River Thames the following year. However the number of spectators was few and Beckwith lost money after hiring a steamer for onlookers. As a result Webb changed his allegiance and Beckwith later organised for his daughter, Agnes, to swim further than Webb.

Non-existent in Namibia before the 19th century, Jews played an important if minor role in the history of Namibia since that point in time, despite their continuous small population. The most famous Namibian Jew was \\"businessman, philanthropist and Jewish communal leader\\" Harold Pupkewitz (1915-2012). History (19th century-1965) capital of and largest city in Namibia, and where some Namibian Jews live today. In the mid-19th century, Jewish merchants from Cape Town named the De Pass brothers became the first Jews in what is now Namibia when they established a trading post on the Nawaqualand Coast. The De Pass brothers began the Pomona Copper Company in Pomona, Namibia in 1861. After Namibia became a German colony in the late 19th century, more Jews established connections (such as business ventures) in Namibia. However, under German rule, only about 100 Jews lived in Namibia, most of whom lived in Swakopmund. After the German defeat in World War I, the newly created League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate over Namibia. The Jewish population of Namibia (which had close relations with the Jews in South Africa) began increasing after this point, and there were 400 to 500 Jews living in Namibia (mostly in Windhoek) in 1965 (Jews were still less than one percent of the total White population in Namibia during this time, though). History (1965–present) Because the League of Nations mandate for Namibia was cancelled by the United Nations and the fact that Namibia became independent, the Jewish population in Namibia dramatically declined since 1965, with only 60 to 100 Jews living in Namibia today. Despite this extremely low number of Jews, Windhoek \\"has a Hebrew congregation dating from 1917, a synagogue built in 1925, a Talmud Torah, a communal hall, an active Zionist movement supported by generous contributions, and the only Jewish minister in the territory.\\" Other than at Windhoek, the only other place in Namibia today where Jews live in is Keetmanshoop, where about twelve Jewish families currently live.

She becomes frustrated that she is the only person who knows about his plans. As she goes through the items on the list, Lily makes Ted realize that his list is actually just proof of how much he loves New York. She notes that the only item on Ted's list that he has not accomplished is having one last scotch with Barney and forces Ted to admit that he has been avoiding Barney and Robin since the day he tried to help Robin find her locket at the carousel. Lily convinces Ted to say goodbye to all the bad things since the good things will always be waiting for him. At some point during their conversation, Lily and Robin reveal that they broke a 30-year-old Glen McKenna Ted reserved for his drink with Barney during a sword fight and tried faking whatever is left. When Lily discovers that an earlier sword fight by Ted and Marshall destroyed a special dress she was planning to wear at the rehearsal dinner, she punishes them, especially Marshall as his road trip with Daphne brings them to Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Robin and Barney realize they have very little time together before their elderly relatives arrive for their wedding. Worried that the drive and passion in their relationship will fade away after they are married, they look for a place to have sex one last time.

It's revealed that Marshall called Ted to delete the text on Lily's cellphone using a \\"No questions asked\\" favor that Ted owes him. Ted had been trapped inside a public mail collection box, and had asked Marshall to free him while not allowing him to ask any questions as to why he had ended up there in the first place. Despite having been told the lock was broken, Ted insisted on climbing the drainpipe and entered Lily's room from the window. He manages to soothe Lily back to sleep by singing Marvin's lullaby, but his search is interrupted by Barney, who is in the air ducts leading to the room, just like the 'bad guy in Die Hard. As with Ted, Marshall had also asked Barney to delete the text message using another \\"No questions asked\\" Barney owes him from when he was trapped in a Macy's utility room with soiled pants and when Marshall had to discharge him from the hospital for swallowing lucky charms. Their subsequent arguing wakes Lily up, but they are interrupted by the arrival of food from room service. Because she did not request the food, Lily goes to confront the receptionist downstairs. When Robin appears from under the food service cart, she reveals that Marshall also called her to delete the text on Lily's phone with a \\"No questions asked\\" she owed him when he helped her escape from a mysterious group who knew her as \\"Nightfalcon\\". When they try to find the phone, they realize that Lily has taken it with her downstairs. Barney and Robin manage to develop an overcomplicated plan to take the phone while working together, resolving their issue with working alone. However, they are stunned to learn that Ted has already deleted the text by getting Lily to destroy her phone using a \\"No questions asked\\" she owed him when she had been tied up by her kindergarten class. Ted calls Marshall and asks why he didn't use a \\"No questions asked\\" on Lily. Marshall explains that he never used one on Lily as he is always open and honest with her, making him realize he shouldn't be keeping his news from her. Using Ted's phone, Marshall tells Lily the truth about his new job. Lily is furious and makes it clear a huge argument will ensue once they finally reunite. The final scene reveals how Ted got trapped in the mailbox: he had sent a sappy letter to a woman, then changed his mind almost immediately and tried to retrieve it. He saw the mailbox was unlocked and climbed in when the mailman passed, who ended up locking it with Ted still inside. Critical reception Donna Bowman of the A.V. Club graded the episode a B due to its \\"pleasant character moments\\", the flashbacks, and the manager's ghost stories. She stated that the quest to prevent Lily reading the text message may have been in the creative team's minds in planning the season. However, she added that the episode can divide the show's viewers because of lingering plot issues. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a 7.7/10 rating saying it \\"was a solid effort in weaving together a clever Halloween-esque story, especially considering the time-constricted circumstances. Despite a kinda lame ghost story and the routine Barney/Robin fare, this was definitely one of the stronger episodes we've seen this season.\\" References External links * Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 9) episodes Category:2013 American television episodes ","title":"No Questions Asked (How I Met Your Mother)"},{"id":"40125516","text":"\\"Knight Vision\\" is the sixth episode of the ninth season of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, and the 190th episode overall.  Plot  On Friday at 9:00 PM, 45 hours before the wedding, the gang (minus Marshall) begin the wedding weekend officially with drinks as Barney and Robin remind Ted that he has the chance to hook up with one of the single women who'll be attending that evening. Barney compares the choice with the one made at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when Indy had to choose which of the cups was the Holy Grail and the wrong choice could mean Ted will have a miserable weekend. Barney and Robin present Ted with three choices: Sophia, Cassie, and Grace (who won't arrive until later). Although Barney suggests Sophia, Ted goes for Cassie when she arrives and mentions the two will probably have 'fun' that weekend. When Lily meets the wedding's officiant, Reverend Lowell, she tells him the story of how she met Marshall, which causes him to angrily leave. Barney and Robin admit to Lily that they had stolen Lily and Marshall's story when they learned that Lowell would disapprove of the story of how they actually met and turn down the request for him to marry them. Though they manage to deceive Lowell again when they discover that Lowell believes that Lily is lying, Lowell realizes they are lying when they become indignant at Lily's insulting descriptions when Lily uses the story of how Barney and Robin really met as the basis of the \\"real\\" story of how she met Marshall. Robin and Barney beg him to marry them anyway, but he steadfastly refuses and tells them to leave the church. Barney admits they shouldn't have lied as he loves the story of how he and Robin got together and briefly touch on their sordid histories, only to find out a couple of minutes later that Lowell has died in his chair. This leaves them free to marry in the church, but without a minister. Though Ted and Cassie seem to hit it off well, Ted's weekend plans quickly begin to derail with each choice he makes (emphasized by the appearance of the Knight from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade each time). Cassie becomes despondent and dependent on Ted when she learns that she has lost her job, where she was hated by everyone, her ex-boyfriend is also a guest at the wedding and has hooked up with Sophia, and her parents unsympathetically leave Ted to comfort Cassie after he meets them. When their attempts to become intimate become increasingly unlikely, Cassie graciously allows Ted to leave her so he can still enjoy his weekend. However, everyone already believes that he and Cassie are a couple; when Grace finally arrives, Ted's last attempt to find another date is ruined when he proposes a toast in memory of Reverend Lowell, only to discover that he was Cassie's uncle. Ted excuses himself and says goodbye to Grace as he is forced to spend the rest of the night comforting Cassie. Future Ted notes that all he did that night was choose poorly, so he didn't hook up with anyone that weekend. However, he now knows that if he had, he probably would never have met his wife and remarks that perhaps he had chosen wisely in the long-run. During their long drive to Farhampton, Marshall tells Daphne of how he needs to be tough and convince Lily to give up her dream job in Italy so he can remain in New York and be a judge. Daphne tries to coach Marshall through the conversation and ensuing argument he is bound to have with Lily, but keeps forcing him to start over. When Daphne learns that Marshall has already taken the job, she chews him out for not considering his wife's wishes or her dream, telling him that her husband was the same in regards to her career. When Marshall asks what her job is, he is furious to learn that she is a lobbyist for a big oil company and believes that Daphne wants him to refuse the job because he is an environmentalist. Marshall later apologizes for yelling at Daphne and agrees that he needs to be fair with Lily and not tough. Daphne accepts and apologizes, as she was so angry with Marshall, she sent Lily a text message telling her about Marshall's new job and how he's already taken it. Marshall is horrified, as his phone begins to ring. Critical reception The A.V. Clubs Donna Bowman graded the episode an A−. She states that the Indiana Jones elements and Ted's reaction to the Knight's appearances were enough for the episode, but the Barney–Robin story is another good example of the actors' chemistry. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a 6.4/10 rating saying it \\"found a few funny moments in a sea of predictable narrative.\\" HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed Nicholson's thoughts, adding that the episode was not that much of a departure from the eighth season premiere \\"Farhampton\\". The Huffington Post's Jessica Goodman stated the episode \\"solidified\\" the waiting game that the season may have embodied with the previous episode.

Jews were always a small community with a notable role in Zambian history. Summary Stanley Fischer was born into a Jewish family in what is now Zambia. Many Jews came to Zambia (previously called Northern Rhodesia) in order to achieve economic prosperity, first settling in Livingstone and Broken Hill. Some of the first Jews in Zambia were prominent in the cattle production and copper mining businesses. Livingstone already had a permanent Jewish congregation of 38 members by 1905, with the first Jewish wedding in Zambia taking place in 1910. Later on, many Zambian Jews achieved great success in the ranching industry and in the iron foundries. 110 Jews lived in Zambia (with a majority of them living in Livingstone and Lusaka) in 1921, and this population increased over the next couple of decades. Some Jewish refugees came to Zambia before and after the Holocaust, with the Jewish population of Zambia peaking at 1,000 to 1,200 in the mid-1950s (by which point \\"the center of Jewish life had shifted to Lusaka, the copperbelt center of the country\\"). Many Jews left Zambia and immigrated to other countries in the 1960s, with only 600 Jews remaining in Zambia in 1968. Jews were active and prominent in Zambian politics before Zambia [became independent in 1964. The Council for Zambia Jewry was created in Lusaka in 1978 \\"to oversee Jewish communal activities.\\" Previously, Zambian Jewry had come under the aegis of the Jewish Communities of the World, Anthony Lerman, Springer, 1989, page 197 This council also \\"provides assistance to political refugees and the poverty- stricken with medical and financial aid.\\" Only about thirty-five Jews currently live in Zambia, with almost all of them living in Lusaka. The Zambian Jewish community did not have a rabbi for several years by this point in time. One of the more notable Zambian Jews is Simon Zukas, \\"who played a key role in Zambia's struggle for independence from Britain in the 1950s, and went on to be a government minister after independence.\\" References Jews Zambia Zambia History ","title":"History of the Jews in Zambia"},{"id":"40125599","title":"Ctrl (Derek Webb album)"},{"id":"40125605","text":"Georg Patermann (c.1580 – after 1628) was a German composer and organist at St. Jakobi in Rostock and the Schloßkirche Güstrow.

The community initially consisted of 1,400-square-foot (130 m²) townhouses which sold on average for $250,000, but had values below $100,000 by February 2012 due in large part to the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Biography Zorzi was brought up in Pretoria with a strong Italian influence at home, due to his father’s origins. From an early age he started swimming and training with Olympic gold medallist and Elite Team member Cameron van der Burgh, who has become a close friend. After steady progress in 2011-12 international competition, 2013 emerged as Zorzi’s breakthrough year as he won 50m breaststroke gold at the 2013 Summer Universiade in Kazan, Russia, before going on to the 2013 FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Spain, two weeks later. Having finished sixth in the heats, he had a difficult semi-final, but nonetheless qualified in the eighth spot for the final. Zorzi surprised everyone by finishing third from lane 8, one-hundredth of a second ahead of fourth place. The result delighted Van Der Burgh, who called Zorzi up alongside him on the podium to sing the South African anthem arm-in-arm. Along with Van Der Burgh, Zorzi is coached by German Dirk Lange, who is based in Austria and only sees his protégés a few times a year.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Pelatiah Leete House is located in a rural-residential setting west of Guilford center, on the north side of Leet's Island Road (Connecticut Route 146) a short way east of Moose Hill Road. The house is set well back from the road, near the railroad right-of-way that runs roughly parallel to the roadway. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows arranged around a center entrance. The entrance is framed by a Greek Revival surround with fluted pilasters and a gabled pediment. The rear of the house has an extended leanto section, giving the house a classic New England colonial saltbox appearance. The interior retains original fireplaces and other elements of interior finish.

Spanning twenty years, the extensive history behind OrangeFS is summarized in the time line below. A development branch is a new direction in development. The OrangeFS branch was begun in 2007, when leaders in the PVFS2 user community determined that: * Many were satisfied with the design goals of PVFS2 and needed it to remain relatively unchanged for future stability * Others envisioned PVFS2 as a foundation on which to build an entirely new set of design objectives for more advanced applications of the future. This is why OrangeFS is often described as the next generation of PVFS2. ;1993 :Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS) was developed by Walt Ligon and Eric Blumer under a NASA grant to study I/O patterns of parallel programs. PVFS version 0 was based on the Vesta parallel file system developed at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and its name was derived from its development to work on Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM). ;1994 :Rob Ross rewrote PVFS to use TCP/IP, departing significantly from the original Vesta design. PVFS version 1 was targeted to a cluster of DEC Alpha workstations on FDDI, a predecessor to Fast Ethernet networking. PVFS made significant gains over Vesta in the area of scheduling disk I/O while multiple clients access a common file. ;Late 1994''' :The Goddard Space Flight Center chose PVFS as the file system for the first Beowulf (early implementations of Linux-based commodity computers running in parallel). Ligon and Ross worked with key GSFC developers, including Thomas Sterling, Donald Becker, Dan Ridge, and Eric Hendricks over the next several years. ;1997 :PVFS released as an open-source package ;1999 :Ligon proposed the development of a new PVFS version. Initially developed at Clemson University, the design was completed in a joint effort among contributors from Clemson, Argonne National Laboratory and the Ohio Supercomputer Center, including major contributions by Phil Carns, a PhD student at Clemson. ;2003 :PVFS2 released, featuring object servers, distributed metadata, accommodation of multiple metadata servers, file views based on MPI (Message Passing Interface, a protocol optimized for high performance computing) for multiple network types, and a flexible architecture for easy experimentation and extensibility. PVFS2 becomes an “Open Community” project, with contributions from many universities and companies around the world. ;2005 :PVFS version 1 was retired. PVFS2 is still supported by Clemson and Argonne. In recent years, various contributors (many of them charter designers and developers) continued to improve PVFS performance. ;2007 :Argonne National Laboratories chose PVFS2 for its IBM Blue Gene/P, a super computer sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. ;2008 :Ligon and others at Clemson began exploring possibilities for the next generation of PVFS in a roadmap that included the growing needs of mainstream cluster computing in the business sector. As they began developing extensions for supporting large directories of small files, security enhancements, and redundancy capabilities, many of these goals conflicted with development for Blue Gene. With diverging priorities, the PVFS source code was divided into two branches. The branch for the new roadmap became \\"Orange\\" in honor of Clemson school colors, and the branch for legacy systems was dubbed \\"Blue\\" for its pioneering customer installation at Argonne. OrangeFS became the new open systems brand to represent this next-generation virtual file system, with an emphasis on security, redundancy and a broader range of applications. ;Fall 2010 :OrangeFS became the main branch of PVFS, and Omnibond began offering commercial support for OrangeFS/PVFS, with new feature requests from paid support customers receiving highest development priority.

Commonly known as warrior wasps or drumming wasps, they are known for their aggressive behavior, a threat display consisting of multiple insects guarding a nest beating their wings in a synchronized fashion, and an extremely painful sting. The sting is barbed and if used often kills the wasp, which may be the reason why such a striking defensive display is used. This display escalates from drumming inside the nest to hundreds of wasps moving on to the envelope of the nest and of continuing to drum and only if this does not deter the threat do the wasps begin to sting. Distribution and habitat The genus has a wide range within the Americas, with specimens being found in the tropical and subtropical portions thereof. S. septentrionalis is generally found in the northern part of the range, having been observed as far north as Mexico, throughout Central America and northern South America. A very similar species, S. ilheensis, extends into Brazil and, until 2017, was reported as a southern population of S. septentrionalis. The other species in the genus are predominantly found in South America, as far south as Argentina. Synoeca thrives in tropical rainforests, building arboreal nests in trees, typically on the underside of major branches. A single comb is built directly on the tree trunk; and the nests have a characteristic shape which resembles an armadillo, leading to common vernacular names such as marimbondo-tatu or armadillo wasp. These wasps swarm to form new colonies, a single queen leaves the nest accompanied by some workers to a new nest site. The queen uses pheromones to suppress the reproductive behaviour of the workers. When one queen dies she is replaced by another; colonies may last up to 16 years.

DARE will use the precisely redshifted 21-cm transition line from neutral hydrogen (1420.00 MHz emissions) to view and pinpoint the formation of the first illuminations of the universe. Also, this is the period ending the Dark Ages of the universe. The orbiter will explore the universe as it was from around 80 million years to 420 million years after the Big Bang. The mission will deliver data pertaining to the formation of the first stars, the initial black hole accretions, and the reionization of the universe. Computer models of galaxy formation will also be tested. Burns, Jack O., J. Lazio, J. Bowman, R. Bradley, C. Carilli, S. Furlanetto, G. Harker, A. Loeb, and J. Pritchard. \\"The Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE).\\" in the Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society, vol. 43, p. 10709. 2011. This mission might also add to research on dark matter decay. The DARE program will also provide insight for developing and deploying lunar surface telescopes that add to refined exoplanet exploration of nearby stars. It is expected to launch in either 2021 or 2022. Background The period after recombination occurred but before stars and galaxies formed is known as the \\"dark ages\\". During this time, the majority of matter in the universe is neutral hydrogen. This hydrogen has yet to be observed, but there are experiments underway to detect the hydrogen line produced during this era. The hydrogen line is produced when an electron in a neutral hydrogen atom is excited to a state where the electron and proton have aligned spins, or de- excited as the electron and proton spins go from being aligned to anti- aligned. The energy difference between these two hyperfine states is 5.9 \\\\times 10^{-6} electron volts, with a wavelength of 21 centimeters. At times when neutral hydrogen is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the photons in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the neutral hydrogen and CMB are said to be \\"coupled\\", and the hydrogen line is not observable. It is only when the two temperatures differ, or decoupled, that the hydrogen line can be observed. Theoretical motivation The Big Bang produced a hot, dense, nearly homogeneous universe. As the universe expanded and cooled, particles, then nuclei, and finally atoms formed. At a redshift of about 1100, equivalent to about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, when the primordial plasma filling the universe cooled sufficiently for protons and electrons to combine into neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became optically thin whereby photons from this early era no longer interacted with matter. We detect these photons today as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The CMB shows that the universe was still remarkably smooth and uniform. After the protons and electrons combined to produce the first hydrogen atoms, the universe consisted of a nearly uniform, almost completely neutral, intergalactic medium (IGM) for which the dominant matter component was hydrogen gas. With no luminous sources present, these are known as the Dark Ages. Theoretical models predict that, over the next few hundred million years, gravity slowly condensed the gas into denser and denser regions, within which the first stars eventually appeared, marking Cosmic Dawn. As more stars formed, and the first galaxies assembled, they flooded the universe with ultraviolet photons capable of ionizing hydrogen gas. A few hundred million years after Cosmic Dawn, the first stars produced enough ultraviolet photons to reionize essentially all the universe's hydrogen atoms. This Reionization era is the hallmark event of this early generation of galaxies, marking the phase transition of the IGM back to a nearly completely ionized state. The beginning of structural complexity in the universe constituted a remarkable transformation, but one that we have not yet investigated observationally. By pushing even farther back than the Hubble telescope can see, the truly first structures in the universe can be studied. Theoretical models suggest that existing measurements are beginning to probe the tail end of Reionization, but the first stars and galaxies, in the Dark Ages and the Cosmic Dawn, currently lie beyond our reach. DARE will make the first measurements of the birth of the first stars and black holes and will measure the properties of the otherwise invisible stellar populations. Such observations are essential for placing existing measurements in a proper context, and to understand how the first galaxies grew from earlier generations of structures. Mission DARE's approach is to measure the spectral shape of the sky-averaged, redshifted 21-cm signal over a radio bandpass of 40–120 MHz, observing the redshift range 11–35, which correlates to 80–420 million years after the Big Bang. DARE orbits the Moon for 3 years and takes data above the lunar farside, the only location in the inner Solar System proven to be free of human-generated radio frequency interference and any significant ionosphere. The science instrument is mounted to a RF quiet spacecraft bus and is composed of a three-element radiometer, including electrically-short, tapered, biconical dipole antennas, a receiver, and a digital spectrometer. The smooth frequency response of the antennas and the differential spectral calibration approach used for DARE are effective in removing the intense cosmic foregrounds so that the weak cosmic 21-cm signal can be detected. Similar projects Besides DARE, are other similar projects are proposed to also study this area such as the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), and the Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA).

History Built around 1350, the church is rather younger than many country churches in the area which are typically from the 12th and 13th centuries. Until 1687, it had its own parish priest but it was then annexed to Vesterborg until 1914. After the Reformation it came under the ownership of the Crown but in 1686 was transferred to Pedr Brandt of Pederstrup. The church became independent in 1914.Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, \\"Birket Kirke\\", Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8, 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 634-649. Retrieved 14 July 2013. Architecture Wooden bell tower (c. 1350) The church, built of brick on a fieldstone base, consists of a chancel, a nave and a porch. The chancel with its three-sided eastern gable is all that remains of the original brick building from c. 1350. Around 1500, the original nave was replaced by the nave in the Late Gothic style which stands today. The vaulted ceilings of the nave and chancel were added at the same time. The church's exterior is now plastered over and painted yellow. Bell Tower The wooden bell tower which stands apart from the church near the main entrance to the churchyard is the best preserved example of its kind in Denmark's country churches and one of the finest Medieval timber structures still standing in Denmark and possibly the oldest. Built on the top of an ancient burial mound, it consists of a heavy framework of oak on a fieldstone foundation. The exterior covering of tarred planks has been replaced several times over the years, most recently in 1974.\\"Birket kirke\\", Historisk Atlas. Retrieved 1 August 2013. It was one of the bell towers studied when the open-air museum Middelaldercentret on western Lolland build a bell tower in 2009. Interior The church's former altarpiece, a triptych carved by Benedict Dreyer of Lübeck in the early 16th century, is now in the National Museum. It has been replaced by a painting from c. 1800 of Christ's burial attributed to Johan Georg Wahl. The pulpit from the second half of the 18th century has been put together from pieces of various origins, some perhaps from an earlier pulpit. The polygonal Gothic font, as old as the church itself, is in Gotland limestone. Its reliefs depict two birds, an eagle, a cock and a fanciful combination of a lion's body, a horse's head and a human face. Frescos Frescos in the chancel In 1900, frescos depicting a Gethsemane scene were discovered in the chancel by Jacob Kornerup who restored them in 1910. Jesus is depicted before an altar bearing a chalice containing rice, corn and a whip. The three apostles are shown reading as soldiers in armor typical of the 16th century arrive.

The game is the eighth Angry Birds game and the second where players can play as pigs (the first is the original game in King Pig Mode), developed by Rovio Entertainment. The game is a prequel to Angry Birds Star Wars and is based on the Star Wars prequel trilogy, as well as the television show Star Wars Rebels. Gameplay In Angry Birds Star Wars II, players must destroy targets fortified in or out of their created fortresses including various bosses, depending on the side they are in (Bird or Pork side). Players also earn up to 3 stars, as of other games in the series. The game features over 56 playable characters. The game differs from the other Angry Birds games because the player can summon a specific bird/pig instead of the pre-determined selection. This summoning can be done to replace each bird/pig. =Telepods= The game is compatible with Hasbro Telepod technology, which is similar in concept to the \\"Portal of Power\\" from the Skylanders video game series, allowing the player to summon a specific character into the game via its QR code; this summon is once per level, but the player can use multiple Telepod summons per level. Each Telepod can be used on up to 15 separate devices and one must rescan the Telepod to get access to the particular bird/pig if the game is fully closed. As of December 2013, Hasbro has sold over 1 million Angry Birds Star Wars II Telepods, like Darth Vader, Yoda, General Grievous, C-3PO, and more. =Shop= The player can via in-app purchase or through achievement rewards, have the use of certain birds or pigs during gameplay. With the Rise of the Clones following up with the Revenge of the Pork and the TV show Rebels update, the former Watto's shop, which was a separate area of the game to buy usable birds/pigs, was removed and was merged within the character swap menu. Characters In Angry Birds Star Wars II, birds and pigs play the roles of characters from the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Characters from the original trilogy and the television show Star Wars Rebels also make appearances in bird/pig form. In official books and annuals, characters' names are changed to fit whether they are portrayed by bird or pig. (e.g. Boba Fett becomes Boba Fatt). Release The game was released on September 18, 2013. PC and Mac OS X versions of the game were announced and the Windows PC version was released on October 24. The Mac version's release plan was discontinued, and on November 13, 2014, the Windows PC version was no longer available for purchase or download and will not be updated.PC Versions of Angry Birds Apps Officially Discontinued Reception The game has received generally favorable reviews with a Metacritic score of 77/100 based on 24 reviews. While the game continues the gameplay of its predecessor with fun new ideas, some reviewers have noted that the increase in the number of playable characters may make the levels unbalanced due to characters having different powers. Some reviewers did not like the numerous microtransactions but found the game fun.

The company was established by Ronald Stanton in 1965, and is currently headquartered in New York City. The company operates using five subsidiaries. The company has offices in the continents of Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and Africa. In 2011, based upon annual sales, the company was ranked by Forbes magazine as 34th in a list of the top 500 private U.S. companies. Transammonia is the world's largest private company in fertilizer trading and merchandising. History The Company changed its name from Transammonia, Inc. to Trammo, Inc. on October 29, 2013. The Trammo trademark has long been associated with the company and had been the name of several subsidiaries. The name change reflected the current broad range of products and markets in which the company trades, in addition to ammonia. The company began operations in the transportation and manufacture of ammonia, raw materials and fertilizer products. In the fiscal year that ended on May 1, 1990, Transammonia posted sales of US$1.1 billion. In 2006, the company ventured into natural gas gathering in the United States. In 2007, the company was ranked by Forbes magazine as among the top 50 private companies in the United States. In 2012, the company was ranked as #24 by Forbes magazine in its list of the largest private companies in the United States. Subsidiaries Transammonia, Inc. operates five subsidiaries: Transammonia, Trammo gas, Trammo petroleum, Trammochem, Sea-3, and Trammo Gas International, Inc. Trammochem is based in Darien, Connecticut and is involved in the manufacture and international commerce of various petrochemicals. In 2000, Trammochem began engagement in the trading of olefins. Trammo petroleum, founded in 2002, is based in Houston, Texas and engages in sales of products, such as diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas, and jet fuel, on the West Coast of the U.S. Trammo Gas is based in Houston, Texas and is involved in the commerce of gases, such as liquefied petroleum gas, propane, and natural gas. Sea-3 operates in northeastern U.S. states and in areas of Florida in the commerce of liquefied propane, and is also involved in gas marketing in other areas of the U.S. Controversy In 2010, Transammonia ended the dealings of its Swiss subsidiary, Trammo Trading, with Iranian companies, in part as a response to an investigation by [CNBC] regarding the company's involvement with entities within Iran. The United States has prohibitions against commerce in Iran, in part to persuade that country to disengage in nuclear development. Transammonia maintained that its foreign subsidiary's Iranian dealings were allowed under U.S. law, but decided to end them anyway. The company stated, \\"the small amount of business done there does not justify the reputational risk currently associated with doing business with entities located in Iran, due to the growing international concern over the policies of the current regime there.\\" References Further reading  * * External links * * Transammonia on the Forbes America's Largest Private Companies list (as of November 2012) Category:Companies based in New York City Category:Chemical companies established in 1965 Category:Chemical companies of the United States Category:Fertilizer companies of the United States ","title":"Trammo"},{"id":"40126190","text":"Anna Montgomerie Martin (8 November 1841 – 9 August 1918), always known as \\"Annie\\", but often signing her name \\"A. Montgomerie Martin\\", was a teacher and headmistress of Adelaide, South Australia. History Annie was born in Birmingham, England, the third child and second daughter of Ann (1809–1901), née Thornton, and Edward (1807–1894) Martin, distantly related to Charles Darwin. She first attended school at Highgate, Birmingham, then in 1850 migrated to Adelaide with her parents on the Anglia, arriving at Port Adelaide on 5 March 1851. The Martins soon met up with Francis Clark and his family, fellow-Unitarians. The Clarks and the Martins were to have a remarkably close relationship, culminating in four Clarks marrying four Martins. Annie's education continued with Emily Clark as tutor at \\"Hazelwood\\", the Clark family home, and Annie in turn acted as tutor to her younger brothers. Older sister Lucy married the literate Howard Clark, and Annie might have wed Henry Septimus Clark, but she took a long break \\"home\\" in England, accompanied by Mrs Susan Woods (wife of J. Crawford Woods) from 1859 to 1861. There she got to know many of her and the Clarks' relatives, including Rowland Hill, Emily Clark's uncle. She visited a workhouse, a lunatic asylum, a boarding school and a jail, as well as taking drawing lessons and other \\"improving\\" activities. She probably spent time at Bruce Castle school, run by the Hills; a school where achievement was rewarded but punishment was rare. Almost immediately after returning to Adelaide, she and Henry Septimus Clark, one of the founders of Stonyfell vineyards and winery, were engaged to be married. The date was set for 18 February 1864, but it turned out to be the day Henry died of tuberculosis, a disease that killed several others of the Clark family. Annie, who may have determined never to marry, had to find herself a source of income, and like many other cultured women such as Caroline Carleton who found themselves without a partner, she set herself up as a tutor for the children of the better-off citizens of Adelaide. Subsequently, around 1870, she opened a morning school on the upper floor of a house in Pulteney Street. At first the clients of Miss Martin's School were mostly members of the Adelaide Unitarian Christian Church, but word spread that she was providing a well-rounded education free from dogma (comparable perhaps to John L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution but co-educational and teaching humanities rather than science, accounting and surveying). In 1874 the University of Adelaide opened, and from its inception allowed female students, and Miss Martin's School moved its focus to preparation of girls for higher education. The school closed in 1874 (perhaps from a dearth of suitable teachers) and Annie reverted to tutoring in a private residence on Strangways Terrace, North Adelaide, then worked at Mme. Marval's school in Ramsay Building at the corner of North Terrace and Rundle Place (now Gawler Place), tutoring in English and Mathematics. She may then have taught at Miss Senner's school in Barnard Street, North Adelaide. She took another two years off in England 1883–1884, then reopened her school at her home in Osmond Terrace, Norwood, teaching French, German, Italian and Greek. In 1893 she set up school at the corner of Pulteney and Rundle Streets, then on Victoria Square in 1897. Many of Annie's students did well academically: Edith Cook was, in 1877, the first woman to pass the University's entrance examination. She became a noted educator in her own right, and after the death of her husband supported herself and her family by conducting Mrs Hübbe's School for forty years. Laura Fowler was the first, in 1891, to graduate in medicine. Caroline Clark, a niece, was one of the first women to graduate M.A. from Adelaide University. These, and to a greater extent, graduates of the Advanced School for Girls, were crucial in public acceptance of women's suffrage. Annie played a part in the campaign for the movement, addressing meetings with Mary Lee Last years Annie had always been considered a little eccentric – she was little bothered with fashion, and neglected such household chores as cleaning and cooking, but would not, or could not, employ a maid. She was suspicious of modern plumbing, and when sewerage was introduced to the west side of Osmond Terrace, Norwood, where she lived, she moved over the road to No. 12. She was 60 years old when her mother died, and the small inheritance enabled her to indulge in European travel. She left the school in the capable hands of her niece Caroline \\"Cara\\" (pronounced \\"carer\\") Clark. She settled in Viterbo where, increasingly feeble and with failing eyesight, she lived her last days. Obituary :\\"The late Miss Anna Montgomerie Martin, who died in Rome on 9 August, will be remembered by many old pupils, as she founded and carried on for many years one of the leading schools in Adelaide. Her methods of instruction, although successful, were quite unconventional. Miss Martin was of English birth, and arrived in Australia in the early fifties. She was young at the time, but was already imbued with English ideas and sympathies, having been nurtured among those liberal thinkers who took an active part in repealing the corn laws and introducing that freedom of trade which placed a check on the gains of the profiteer, destroyed the unhallowed joys of the smuggler, and has contributed to an accumulation of wealth which is now freely used in the worldwide struggle against despotism. Miss Martin was a student of languages from an early age, and loved to acquire knowledge, as she loved to impart it to others. In the early eighties of last century she helped to build up a prosperous and influential school on North Terrace, Adelaide, then conducted by Mr. Marval and his accomplished wife. In vain did the Education Department tempt her with a high salary and a fine position. Mortified and impoverished by Government competition, Miss Martin returned to her native land, where she made a study of new methods of teaching. Some developments of educational methods met with her strong disfavour. She was always opposed to cramming, forcing, and pushing of the youthful intelligence. Miss Martin returned to Australia in 1884, and established a new school in the very teeth of governmental opposition. She retired finally from the profession about 17 years ago, and since that time she has lived mostly in Italy, the land she loved. So far as she was able, she helped the Italians in their time of trial by supplying poor homeless refugees and others with food and necessaries. She came from a long-lived family. It was probable that the constant demand on her keen sympathy and active help shortened a life that was useful and valuable, even in old age.\\" This letter, published anonymously, may have been written by Lucy Spence.

His mother, Magdalena Łuczak (27), and her partner, Mariusz Krężołek (33), were found guilty of the murder on 31 July 2013. Daniel's death made headlines for months as it was evident that a number of opportunities had been missed to identify him as suffering severe abuse. On 2 August 2013, both Łuczak and Krężołek were jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 30 years each. However, both died in prison within three years of being sentenced.  Family history  Eryk Pełka, Daniel's biological father, brought his family, and his partner Magdalena Łuczak and her child, to the UK from their native Poland at the end of 2005. Daniel was born in Coventry, England on 15 July 2007. Eryk remained with the family until the end of 2008. In 2010, Mariusz Krężołek moved in with Łuczak and he became the father to her children. He was residing in the household at the time of Daniel's death.  Prior evidence of abuse  A health visitor noticed a bruise to the side of Daniel's head in 2010, but was told he had fallen over and bruised. In January 2011, he was taken to A&E; with a broken arm, and was also seen to have multiple bruises. This was assessed by social services, but the doctor who saw Daniel admitted the fracture could have been caused by an accident. In November of the same year, Daniel's school was concerned about him stealing food from other pupils and eating an unusual amount of the free fruit available. Łuczak had previously told medical professionals that Daniel would raid the fridge at night and punch his stepfather when not given food. A social worker had recommended that Daniel be given a snack on the way to school. By the end of 2011, his school attendance was only 63%. Despite this low rate of school attendance, between November 2011 and February 2012, various injuries to Daniel's head and neck were noted on five separate occasions by three different adults. None of these instances were reported to the police or social services. By the start of 2012, the school was raising concerns that Daniel was obsessed with food and would eat out of bins. On one occasion, he ate half of a teacher's birthday cake which was intended for the whole class. After the school holidays, Daniel showed visible signs of weight loss. One teacher saw fingerprint bruising around Daniel's neck, and staff had also noticed multiple facial bruises. On 10 February 2012, he was seen by a Dr. Chakraborthy after having lost weight. The doctor issued a prescription for worms and said he appeared thin but not wasting away. On 28 February, he was observed as being \\"pasty\\" with \\"sunken eyes\\" and not interacting with other children. People continued to notice him eating out of bins, including on 1 March, the day he would receive the beating that caused his death. In addition to direct concerns about Daniel, social services had been visiting the family since 2008 due to serious domestic violence against Łuczak by Krężołek. However, she said she could protect her children, and Daniel was never interviewed directly.  Death  Daniel Pełka died on 3 March 2012. Two days earlier, as a punishment for wetting himself, Daniel had been beaten severely. His mother did a Google search for \\"care – patient in a coma\\" as well as salt poisoning on the morning of 2 March. On 2 March, Krężołek also dissuaded Łuczak from calling an ambulance, stating that Daniel would \\"get over it\\" and that calling for help would \\"cause proper problems.\\" At 03.07 GMT on the morning of 3 March, a 999 call was made in which she stated that her son was not breathing. Paramedics arrived and took him to hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 03.50. The autopsy revealed 22 different injuries, ten of which were to the head. A diagram detailing these injuries was released by West Midlands Police and shown widely in the media. The cause of death was ruled to be a brain injury. Daniel was also severely underweight, weighing just . He was noted as emaciated by hospital staff and a child protection specialist shortly after his death. Witnesses described him as looking like \\"a concentration camp victim\\" and \\"a seriously ill cancer patient\\". After the investigation, Daniel's body was returned to his biological father, Eryk Pełka. Initially, Eryk could not afford the cost of flying the body over to Poland from the UK. However, a Polish funeral firm in London donated the money for the cause. On 3 September 2013, Daniel's body was finally buried.  Murder trial  Both Krężołek and Łuczak denied causing Daniel's death, but admitted the offence of child cruelty. During the court trial, Łuczak claimed that Krężołek would attempt to strangle her if she tried to protect Daniel, and that he would not let her feed him. One of Daniel's siblings gave evidence that Krężołek had tried to drown Daniel in a bath of cold water, and that he was locked in a room and forbidden to use the toilet. Text message evidence also showed Łuczak admitting to nearly drowning Daniel, and that they removed the handle to his bedroom door so that his siblings could not let him out. The jury also heard that he was force-fed salt and made to perform squats as a punishment. The judge's closing remarks described the cruelty to Daniel as \\"truly horrific\\" and his starvation as \\"unprecedented in this country\\". She also stated that the culprits \\"carried out a deliberate and cynical deception of teaching, welfare, and medical personnel, which was designed to conceal what was happening, to prevent any help being provided for Daniel\\". Legacy Daniel Pełka's murder and the missed opportunities to prevent it generated a \\"huge sense of public outrage\\". Members of the public donated over £10,000 to the NSPCC in Pelka's memory. Coventry has hosted many gatherings to remember Daniel Pełka, with the most recent one held on the six year anniversary of his death. The case inspired a petition to make it mandatory to report evidence of child abuse. After extensive consultation, the UK government decided not to introduce mandatory reporting, fearing it could create a \\"needle in a haystack\\" situation where reports of extensive evidence of serious abuse would be lost among less credible or serious reports that had been made due to fear of legal repercussion. They also noted that countries with mandatory reporting laws did not have a higher rate of child abuse reports. In 2014, the indie rock band Little Comets released a song called \\"Salt\\", accompanied by a YouTube video, dedicated to the memory of Daniel Pełka. Death of perpetrators On 14 July 2015, Łuczak was found unresponsive in her cell at about 07:15 BST and was pronounced dead. An inquest held three days later revealed that Łuczak had hanged herself the day before what would have been Daniel's eighth birthday.Daniel Pelka's 'cruel and brutal' mother 'hanged herself' BBC News. 17 July 2015.

Programs The Ruth Ellis Center operates three programs. =Ruth’s House= Residential housing program for LGBT youth ages 12–17 who are in the foster care or juvenile justice system. The youth are referred from the Michigan Department of Human Services, Wayne County Child and Family Services, other Michigan agencies statewide, and youth supervising programs in other states. The program includes the following services: =Second Stories Drop-In Center= Provides basic services and safe space for youth and young adults ages 14 to 24. Services and resources include full meals, gender identity support groups, laundry facility and clothing, a cyber-center, and recreation. =Second Stories Outpatient Mental Health Services= Provides mental health outpatient services to LGBT youth. History A group of community activists - including John Allen and Kofi Adoma \\\\- founded Ruth Ellis Center in 1999, the same year Ruth Ellis was celebrating her 100th birthday. The founders chose to call the program the Ruth Ellis Center in recognition of all the youth Ellis had helped. In September 2000, a 101-year-old Ellis attended the grand opening of the center's first phase, a drop-in center for at-risk youth.

Distribution This crab is found from the Namibian border and around the South African coast to Sodwana Bay subtidally and to at least 18 m underwater. It is also found in the Indian Ocean. Ecology This crab cuts a piece of sponge or ascidian from a colony and holds it on its back using its fifth pair of legs which are specially bent upwards for this purpose. The crab gains protection in the form of camouflage and the deterrent provided by the toxins of the animals it carries. The covering grows to almost completely cover the crab.

Before its completion, the critic and curator Lawrence Alloway recognized its potential to be \\"a notable contribution to the long- awaited legible iconography of women in political terms.\\" The Sister Chapel is on permanent display at the Center for Art and Social Engagement, an initiative of the Rowan University Art Gallery in Glassboro, New Jersey. Origin and name In 1973, the abstract painter Ilise Greenstein moved from Great Neck, New York, to Miami, Florida, where she experienced \\"frustration, anxiety and isolation\\" at being separated from the art scene in New York. This led to an \\"intense period of self-exploration\\" that resulted in the concept for The Sister Chapel. Originally planned as a hall of fame for women, The Sister Chapel evolved from a written concept in early 1974 to become a celebration of female \\"role models\\" who were chosen by women and portrayed by women. The nominal pun regarding the Sistine Chapel ceiling was intentional. As the Sistine Chapel represented an apex of global and western culture, and a realization of the patriarchal conceptualization of history, The Sister Chapel comprised an invitation for people to re-imagine familiar, often unconscious presumptions about gender roles, recognition and relations from a female perspective. Greenstein explained that she was questioning the \\"version of creation\\" in the Sistine Chapel by asking, \\"where was woman in man's relation to God?\\" As Gloria Feman Orenstein explained in 1977, \\"This chapel, then, is not about the creation of man, but the birth of woman.\\" Component works of art The Sister Chapel features eleven panels that represent contemporary and historically significant women, deities and mythological figures, and conceptual heroic women. Each \\"role model\\" was selected and painted by a different artist, which allowed the participants to retain their individual styles: *Bella Abzug—the Candidate (1976) by Alice Neel *Betty Friedan as the Prophet (1976) by June Blum *Marianne Moore (1977) by Betty Holliday *Joan of Arc (1976) by Elsa M. Goldsmith *Artemisia Gentileschi (1976) by May Stevens *Frida Kahlo (1976) by Shirley Gorelick *God (1977) by Cynthia Mailman *Durga (1977) by Diana Kurz *Lilith (1976) by Sylvia Sleigh *Womanhero (1977) by Martha Edelheit *Self-Portrait as Superwoman (Woman as Culture Hero) (1977–78) by Sharon Wybrants Each of the monumental figures occupies a nine-by-five-foot canvas, arranged in a circle, into which viewers are invited to enter. Above the eleven panels hangs the circular abstract painted ceiling by Ilise Greenstein (1976). Its mirrored center invites viewers to see themselves in the company of the heroic figures of this \\"sisters universe,\\" and to develop a new way of looking at history, culture, and themselves. A tent-like fabric enclosure, designed by Maureen Connor in 1976, was meant to create an intimate space approximately 25 feet in diameter. For financial reasons, the structure was not executed in the 1970s but a model was constructed and shown at the premiere exhibition. Exhibitions The installation premiered in January 1978 at P.S.1 in Long Island City, New York. It was positively reviewed in The New York Times and Newsday After its premiere at P.S.1, The Sister Chapel was exhibited at SUNY–Stony Brook (November–December 1978), Cayuga County Community College (November–December 1979), and the Associated Artists Gallery in Fayetteville, New York (March–April 1980). At the last two venues, Greenstein's Ceiling for the Sister Chapel, Wybrants's Self-Portrait as Superwoman, and Connor's model for the Chapel structure were not exhibited. After 1980, The Sister Chapel fell into obscurity, although it continued to be mentioned in publications about women artists. The Sister Chapel was eventually revived by Andrew Hottle, a professor of art history at Rowan University, whose research for a book about the installation led him to reunite the component works. In 2016, for the first time in 37 years, The Sister Chapel was exhibited in its entirety at the Rowan University Art Gallery in Glassboro, New Jersey. The new exhibition included Sharon Wybrants's recreation of her Self-Portrait as Superwoman because the original is lost. This was the first installation of The Sister Chapel to present the works inside the fabric enclosure designed by Maureen Connor. In The Philadelphia Inquirer, the art critic Edith Newhall wrote that \\"Hottle has produced something of an art-world miracle\\" by finding and reuniting the paintings. In March 2019, the installation went on permanent display in the Center for Art and Social Engagement at Rowan University. Recognition When The Sister Chapel was reunited in 2016, its historical importance was recognized by The Huffington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and Artnet. In March 2018, Travel + Leisure grouped The Sister Chapel with the Rothko Chapel, Matisse Chapel, Le Corbusier's Notre Dame du Haut, and other chapels that \\"combine artistry with worship.\\" The Sister Chapel was featured in a fashion photography spread in the August 2019 issue of Harper's Bazaar, serving as an environment for two pairs of sisters who wear Christian Dior clothing designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri; an interview with Chiuri by Robin Morgan accompanies the photographs.

Tarabin previously competed for Moldova and remains the country's national record holder. He took part in javelin competitions from a relatively early age and progressed through the age categories, taking bronze medals at the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics and the 2011 European Athletics U23 Championships. He represented Russia at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, coming tenth, but missed the 2012 Summer Olympics as he was affected by an injury. He is married to 2011 World champion Mariya Abakumova, who is also a javelin thrower for Russia. Early life Born in Berlin, Germany, Tarabin's physical education was stressed from a young age by his father, who was a Moldovan military officer. Around 1997 his family moved back to Transnistria in Moldova. He took part in a variety of sports while at school, including boxing and tennis. It was baseball that he first got heavily involved in – his ability to throw the ball far (albeit inaccurately) led to his inclusion in the national squad for the European Youth Baseball Championship. This talent translated well to javelin throwing and he began training in the sport with his local athletics club.Natalia Maryanchik (2013-07-31). Focus on Athletes – Dmitri Tarabin . IAAF.

It is a river that flows eastward across northern Italy starting from the Cottian Alps. The Po flows either or – considering the length of the Maira, a right bank tributary. The headwaters of the Po are a spring seeping from a stony hillside at Pian del Re, a flat place at the head of the Val Po under the northwest face of Monviso. The Po then extends along the 45th parallel north before ending at a delta projecting into the Adriatic Sea near Venice. It is characterized by its large discharge (several rivers over 1,000 km have a discharge inferior or equal to the Po). As a result of its characteristics, the river is subject to heavy flooding. Consequently, over half its length is controlled with , levees. The river flows through many important Italian cities, including Turin, Piacenza and Ferrara. It is connected to Milan through a net of channels called navigli, which Leonardo da Vinci helped design. Near the end of its course, it creates a wide delta (with hundreds of small channels and five main ones, called Po di Maestra, Po della Pila, Po delle Tolle, Po di Gnocca and Po di Goro) at the southern part of which is Comacchio, an area famous for eels. The Po valley was the territory of Roman Cisalpine Gaul, divided into Cispadane Gaul (south of the Po) and Transpadane Gaul (north of the Po). Geography The Po has a drainage area of 74,000 km2 in all, 70,000 of those being in Italy, of which 41,000 is in montane environments and 29,000 on the plain. The slope of the Po's river valley decreases from 0.35% in the west to 0.14% in the east, a low gradient. Along its path lie 450 standing lakes.Almost all of the rest of the non-Italy basin is in the Italian speaking Ticino (Tessin) canton in Switzerland, and the outlying extreme south western section (again, Italian speaking) of Grigioni (Graubunden) canton lying to the south of the San Bernardino pass which forms the Po's watershed with the Posterior Rhine. The major tributary in question is the northern source half of the eponymous Ticino river (fed by its Moesa tributary in Grigioni) and the top third of the Alpine lake, Maggiore, formed by it. (The southern two thirds of Lake Maggiore and the southern half of the continuing Ticino River tributary are in Italian territory). A minute section of the Po basin belongs to France in the Valle Etroite (literally, the Narrow Valley) running from Mont Thabor to the Italian ski resort of Bardonecchia. Valle Etroite is so remote it is essentially administered by Italy (telephone network, rubbish collections etc.). Further minuscule parts of the Po's basin (measurable in the hundreds of metres of linear distance) within France are found in the form of small streamheads forced into France by the 1947 post war Peace Treaty of Paris as a punitive measure against Italy. These can be found on the Mont Cenis and Mongenevre passes. The former contains a reservoir dammed at the Po end and so technically constitutes part of its basin, although it contributes little to the water flow as the water is, by definition, retained by the dam. The Po is the longest river in Italy; at its widest point its width is . =Po Valley= The vast valley around the Po is called the Po Basin or Po Valley (Italian Pianura Padana or Val Padana); in time it became the main industrial area of the country. In 2002, more than 16 million people lived there, at the time nearly ⅓ of the population of Italy. The two main economic uses of the valley are for industry and for agriculture, both major uses. The industrial centres, such as Turin and Milan, are located on higher terrain, away from the river. They rely for power on the numerous hydroelectric stations in or on the flanks of the Alps, and on the coal/oil power stations which use the water of the Po basin as coolant. Drainage from the north is mediated through several large, scenic lakes. The streams are now controlled by so many dams as to slow the river's sedimentation rate, causing geologic problems. The expansive, moist and fertile flood plain is reserved mainly for agriculture and is subject to flash floods, even though the overall quantity of water is lower than in the past and lower than demand. The main products of the farms around the river are cereals including – unusually for Europe – rice, which requires heavy irrigation. The latter method is the chief consumer of surface water, while industrial and human consumption use underground water. =Tributaries= The Po has 141 tributaries. They include (R on the right bank, L on the left, looking downstream): * Pellice (L) * Varaita (R) * Maira (R) * Chisola (L) * Sangone (L) * Dora Riparia (L) * Stura di Lanzo (L) * Malone (L) * Orco (L) * Dora Baltea (L) * Stura del Monferrato (R) * Sesia (L) * Rotaldo (R) * Grana del Monferrato (R) * Tanaro (R) * Scrivia (R) * Agogna (L) * Curone (R) * Staffora (R) * Ticino (L) * Versa (R) * Tidone (R) * Lambro (L) * Trebbia (R) * Nure (R) * Adda (L) * Arda (R) * Taro (R) * Parma (R) * Enza (R) * Crostolo (R) * Oglio (L) * Mincio (L) * Secchia (R) * Panaro (R) The Reno (R) was a tributary of the Po until the middle of the eighteenth century when the course was diverted to lessen the risk of devastating floods. The Tanaro is about 50 km (31 mi) longer than the upper Po at their confluence near Alessandria. Po Delta = Protected areas = The Po along the city of Turin. Horse riding along the Po Delta. The Po Delta wetlands have been protected by the institution of two regional parks in the regions in which it is situated: Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. The Po Delta Regional Park in Emilia-Romagna, the largest, consists of four parcels of land on the right bank of the Po and to the south. Created by law in 1988, it is managed by a consortium, the Consorzio per la gestione de Parco, to which Ferrara and Ravenna provinces belong as well as nine comuni: Comacchio, Argenta, Ostellato, Goro, Mesola, Codigoro, Ravenna, Alfonsine, and Cervia. Executive authority resides in an assembly of the presidents of the provinces, the mayors of the comuni and the board of directors. They employ a Technical-Scientific Committee and a Park Council to carry out directives. In 1999 the park was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and was added to \\"Ferrara, City of the Renaissance, and its Po Delta.\\" The of the park contain wetlands, forest, dunes and salt pans. It has a high biodiversity, with 1000–1100 plant species and 374 vertebrate species, of which 300 are birds. = The active delta = The most recent part of the delta, which projects into the Adriatic between Chioggia and Comacchio, contains channels that actually connect to the Adriatic and on that account is called the active delta by the park authorities, as opposed to the fossil delta, which contains channels that no longer connect the Po to the Adriatic (but once did). The active delta was created in 1604 when the city of Venice diverted the main stream, the Po grande or Po di Venezia, from its channel north of Porto Viro to the south of Porto Viro in a channel then called the Taglio di Porto Viro, \\"Porto Viro cut-off\\". Their intent was to stop the gradual migration of the Po toward the lagoon of Venice, which would have filled up with sediment had contact been made. The subsequent town of Taglio di Po grew around the diversionary works. The lock of Volta Grimana blocked the old channel, now the Po di Levante, which flows to the Adriatic through Porto Levante. Below Taglio di Po the Parco Regionale Veneto, one of the tracts under the authority of the Parco Delta del Po, contains the latest branches of the Po. The Po di Gnocca branches to the south followed by the Po di Maestra to the north at Porto Tolle. At Tolle downstream the Po di Venezia divides into the Po delle Tolle to the south and the Po della Pila to the north. The former exits at Bonelli. The latter divides again at Pila into the Busa di Tramontana to the north and the Busa di Scirocco to the south, while the mainstream, the Busa Dritta, enters Punta Maistra and exits finally past Pila lighthouse. Despite the park administration's definition of the active delta as beginning at Porto Viro, there is another active channel upstream from it at Santa Maria in Punta, where the Fiume Po divides into the Po di Goro and the Po di Venezia. = The fossil delta = The fossil Po is the region of no longer active channels from the Po to the sea. It begins upstream from Ferrara. The Fiume Po currently flowing to the north of Ferrara is actually the result of a diversion at Ficarolo in 1152 made in the hope of relieving flooding in the vicinity of Ravenna. The diversion channel was at first called the Po di Ficarolo. The Fiume Po before then followed the Po di Volano, no longer connected to the Po, which ran to the south of Ferrara and exited near Volano. In Roman times it did not exit there but ran to the south as the Padus Vetus (\\"old Po\\") exiting near Comacchio, from which split the Po di Primaro exiting close to Ravenna. Before 1152 the seaward extension of today's delta, about , did not exist. The entire region from Ravenna to Chioggia was dense swamps, explaining why the Via Aemilia was constructed between Rimini and Piacenza and did not begin further north.  Geologic history  The Mediterranean Basin is a depression in the Earth's crust caused by the African Plate slipping under the Eurasian Plate. Typically in geologic history the depression is filled with sea water under various geologic names such as Tethys Sea. In the last period of the Miocene Epoch, the Messinian (7–5 mya), the Messinian salinity crisis, a near drying of the Mediterranean, was caused by the sea level dropping below the sill at the Strait of Gibraltar and the equilibrium between evaporation and replenishment shifting in favor of evaporation. At that time the Po Valley and the Adriatic depression were a single canyon system thousands of feet deep. On the southwest the Apennine Mountains bordered a land mass termed Tyrrhenis geologically. Their orogeny was just being completed in the Miocene. On the north the Alpine Orogeny had already created the Alps. At the end of the Messinian the ocean broke through the sill and the Mediterranean refilled. The Adriatic transgressed into all of northern Italy. In the subsequent Pliocene sedimentary outwash primarily from the Apennines filled the valley and the central Adriatic generally to a depth of to but from to off the current mouth of the Po, with pockets as deep as . At the start of the Pleistocene the valley was full. Cycles of transgression and regression are detectable in the valley and the Adriatic as far as its centre and in the southern Adriatic. From the Pleistocene alternation of maritime and alluvial sediments occur as far west as Piacenza. The exact sequences at various locations have been studied extensively. Apparently the sea advanced and receded over the valley in conformance to an equilibrium between sedimentation and glacial advance or recession at 100,000-year intervals and to fluctuation of sea level. An advance began after the Last Glacial Maximum around 20,000 years ago, which brought the Adriatic to a high point at about 5500 years ago. Since then the Po delta had been prograding. The rate of coastal zone progradation between 1000 BC and 1200 AD was 4 m/yr. Human factors, however, brought about a change in the equilibrium in the mid-20th century with the result that the entire coastline of the northern Adriatic is now degrading. Venice, which was originally built on islands off the coast, is most at risk due to subsidence, but the effect is realized in the Po delta as well. The causes are first a decrease in the sedimentation rate due to the locking of sediment behind hydroelectric dams and the deliberate excavation of sand from rivers for industrial purposes. Second, agricultural use of the river is heavy; during peak consumption the flow in places nearly dries up, causing local contention. As a result of decreased flow salt water is intruding into the aquifers and coastal ground water. Eutrophication in standing waters and streams of low flow is on the increase. The valley is subsiding due to the removal of ground water. Human aspects =Pollution= Always prone to fog, the valley is subject to heavy smog due to industrial atmospheric emissions, especially from Turin. The city of Milan had no sewage treatment plant(s). Sewage went through channels directly into the Po, for which the European Environment Agency cited the city. Since 2005, all sewage from Milan is treated in plants at Nosedo, San Rocco and Peschiera Borromeo. These treat the sewage from over 2.5 million inhabitants. In 2005, water from the Po was found to contain much benzoylecgonine, passed by cocaine users in urine. Based on these figures, cocaine consumption was estimated to be about 4 kg daily, or 27 doses per day per thousand young adults in the drainage basin - nearly three times higher than estimated. On February 24, 2010 the Po was contaminated by an oil spill coming from a refinery in Villasanta through the Lambro, the Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata news agency has estimated it to be about 600,000 liters. =Water resource management= The Po in San Mauro Torinese in July 2012. Until 1989 water resources were administered regionally or locally. The major authority on the lower Po was the Magistrato alle Acque di Venezia, first formed in the 16th- century Republic of Venice. It made all the decisions concerning the diversion of the lower river. Most part of the delta is still in Veneto. In 1907 under the Kingdom of Italy the agency became the Magistrato alle Acque and took responsibility for all the water resources in northeastern Italy. Currently it is a decentralized institution of the Ministry of Public Works, headed by a chairman appointed by the Head of State and the Council of Ministers. Its headquarters are in Venice. Its domain is the management and protection of the water system in Veneto, Mantua, Trento, Bolzano and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. In 1989 in response to the major geologic problems that were developing along the river Law no. 183/89 was passed authorizing The Po Basin Water Board (Autorità di bacino del fiume Po), which would direct operations concerning all the water resources in the Po basin (see under Po Valley). Its headquarters have been in Parma since its inception in 1990. It considers itself a synergy among all the institutions concerned with the preservation and development of the Po basin. It is administered by officials chosen from the administrations of the constituent regions and provinces. In 2009 the water board began its Integrated River Basin Management Plan to meet the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive, 2000/60/EC. This takes in water management and flood risk plans antecedent. Between 2009 and 2015 the Po Valley Project (the implementation of the plan) took more than 60 measures, notably to: heighten and strengthen levees, increase flood-meadows, resume natural sediment transport and deposition points, enlarge wetlands, afforest, re-nature, promote biodiversity and recreational use. =Dams= At the village of Isola Serafini in the comune of Monticelli d'Ongina, Piacenza Province, downstream from Piacenza, a long, high gate dam featuring eleven openings gated by vertical lift gates, crosses the Po. Nine gates are high and two are high for sediment-scouring purposes. A spillway to the right passes through a hydroelectric station of 4 generators of 76 MW each operated by a head of water. The spillway connects to a diversionary canal subtending a loop of the Po. A ship lock long and wide next to the station passes some traffic through the canal, but above the dam traffic is mainly barges. The average flow at the dam is 854 m3/s, with a 12,800 m3/s maximum. Cultural history The Po is first certainly identified in the Graeco-Roman historians and geographers of the late Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire, long after the valley had been occupied successively by prehistoric and historic peoples: Ligures, Etruscans, Celts, Veneti, Umbri, and Romans. At that late date the ancient authors were attempting to explain the provenance of the name. Perhaps the earliest of these, PolybiusHistories, II.16. (2nd century BC), uses Pados (in Greek) and says that it was to be identified with the Eridanos of the poets. Moreover, the country people call it Bodencus. This implies that a \\"country\\" population either remained from prehistoric times or adopted the name in use by that substrate. The name has been segmented as Bod-encus or Bod-incus, the suffix being characteristic of the ancient Ligurian language of northern Italy, southern France, Corsica and elsewhere. Pliny the Elder has the most to say about the Padus of his times. Herodotus had expressed doubt concerning the existence of a river in Europe, Eridanos, which flowed into the northern sea, he said, from which amber came.Histories, III.115. He believed it was a Greek name (there are other Eridanos rivers in Greece), \\"invented by some poet,\\" but makes no conjectures as to where it might be. Pliny points out that in his own time the Eridanos had become wrongly identified with the Padus. He does not know when or how, but like Herodotus he blames the poets.Historia Naturalis, Book 37, Chapter 11. Amber is supposed to have come from there. Phaëthon, son of the sun, struck by lightning changed into poplars and exuded tears every year, which is the source of amber (a myth of Pausanias). Expressing surprise at the ignorance of the poets, Pliny says \\"There can be no doubt that amber is the product of the islands of the northern ocean (Baltic Sea)\\" and attributes its introduction into the Po valley to the Veneti, the last link in a trade route to the north through Pannonia and Germany. Pliny (Hist. Nat., iii. 122) also gives the Ligurian name of the Po as Bodincus, which he translates as \\"bottomless\\". The root bod- has been generally analyzed as containing the PIE base *bhu(n)d(h)- seen in Sanskrit budhnah and Avestan buna- \\"bottom\\", Greek pythmen \\"foundation\\", Latin fundus \\"bottom\\", Old Irish bond \\"sole of the foot\\". The word Bodincus appears in the place name Bodincomagus, a Ligurian town on the right bank of the Po downstream from today's Turin. The Po, along with other rivers in northern Italy, was the scene of numerous military episodes throughout the Middle Ages and all the major cities and coastal lordships were equipped with real river fleets. =Mythology= The Po is often identified with the Eridanos or Eridanus river of Greek mythology. This mythical river is the namesake of the constellation Eridanus.

The film stars Katie Cassidy, Garret Dillahunt, Eliza Dushku, Kunal Nayyar, Michelle Trachtenberg and Sasha Grey. Plot Suki, a young woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder, moves into Juniper Tower, a strange, darkly gothic apartment building, that serves as a halfway house for mental patients who don't need to be institutionalized any longer, but are not completely cured yet. Suki has been given an experimental device that lets her perform a procedure known as The Siamese Burn on herself. The machine is supposed to \\"burn\\" all her extra personalities until she only has one left. At Juniper Tower, Suki reconnects with her friend with benefits Hogan, a man who may fake depression so that he can stay there as the \\"rooster of the henhouse\\". She also meets several female tenants and learns that Hogan has slept with most of them. One by one, the girls are found dead from apparent suicide. Suki soon realizes that the girls have actually been murdered, and is worried that one of her multiple personalities is responsible. She keeps using the \\"Siamese Burn\\" to delete them, but the machine has been heavily modified, which leads Suki to believe that one of her personas, the one that committed the crimes, is trying to keep Suki from getting rid of her. She suspects the mysterious \\"Scribbler\\", a super-powered being who communicates with her by scribbling messages backwards. Suki finally understands that the Scribbler has really been trying to help her solve the murders, and embraces her alter ego in order to fight the real killer, Alice, an escaped mental patient who's been hiding at Juniper Tower. Alice turns out to be the evil personality of Veronica, a young woman who unsuccessfully used the \\"Siamese Burn\\" to remove her. After the Scribbler overpowers Alice, Veronica commits suicide. Later that night, Suki is interrogated by Detective Moss, who believes she committed all the murders, and Doctor Silk, who's hoping to figure out what really happened. During the interrogation, Hogan creates a distraction, and Suki uses the Scribbler's supernatural abilities to escape.

Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Although ultimately far too muddled in its concept and execution to be anything more than a curiosity, The Scribbler does manage the dubious feat of being one of the strangest films you're likely to see this year.\\" Film Journal International wrote, \\"With its endless edginess and unhealthy obsession with madness at its most flamboyant, The Scribbler strains to be a cult film, but even the most diehard lovers of cinema strangeness may find it ultimately too nonsensical and needlessly overwrought.\\" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Director John Suits seems more concerned with plying eyeballs with creepy atmospherics, showy visual effects and sexy interludes than with propulsive pacing or roiling tension.\\" Mark Rabinowitz of Paste wrote, \\"The Scribbler is overwrought, absurd, occasionally exploitative, completely lacking in subplot, takes a good 20–25 minutes to really get going and has acting that varies from excellent to, well, less-than-excellent. It’s also hugely fun!\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"While The Scribbler isn't exactly in contention with the best that the comic book genre has to offer, Katie Cassidy utilizes the numerous voices in her head to create a unique hero for a bit of stylized freshness.\\" Jess Hicks of Bloody Disgusting rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Scribbler is a great example of how you don’t need a few million dollars to make an entertaining superhero movie.\\" Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Scribbler is entertaining and has plenty of action to keep viewers interested.

The Department of Public Works, Railway Branch awarded a contract for construction of engines based on a pattern engine and design drawings supplied by the Railway Branch. At that time it was the largest single manufacturing order in Australia. Trials of the first locomotive produced at Atlas Engineering Co commenced on 11 January 1882.

The operation lasted from 19 to 24 October and was carried out by troops from the Harel and Etzioni Brigades. The villages were defended by units from the Egyptian army and local militias. By the end of the campaign over a dozen villages had been captured.Khalidi, Walid (Ed.) (1992) All That Remains. The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948. IoPS, Washington. . p.266.Morris, Benny (1987) The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947-1949. Cambridge University Press. . p.220. It coincided with Operation Yoav which attacked Egyptian positions further south. Villages captured during Operation Ha-Har, October 1948. Background The objectives of the military campaign known as Operation El Ha-Har have been described by the former commander of the Har’el Brigade, Joseph (\\"Yosefle\\") Tabenkin of Ein Harod, as follows: \\"The military campaign, which later became known as 'Operation El Ha-Har', was intended originally to make the road accessible. In the first stage, [it required] the occupation of the south bank of Nahal Sorek, clearing the way for the capture of Bayt Jala (Bethlehem), and from there, on one-side southward, the liberation of Gush Etzion, and the conquest of the entire mountain, while northward, the occupation of Arab Jerusalem on its south side.\\" Before the second truce went into effect, the Har’el Brigade had succeeded in securing the north bank of Nahal Sorek, as far as Kibbutz Ramat Rachel. On 17 July 1948, one day before the second truce of the conflict went into effect, a unit from the Har’el Brigade captured a hill to the south of Nahal Sorek, near Dayr Aban, some 60 meters away from where the Egyptian army had taken-up position. In mid-October 1948, the Har’el Brigade published a combat ordinance, which read: \\"The enemy is planning to cut-off the well-springs of immigration and [Jewish] settlement, to build a nest of war conspiracies against us and against all those who love peace in the world, to cut-off from Israel the Negev; to inflict harm to the capital, the center of yearnings of the generations of Israel; to subjugate the Hebrew element of Jerusalem; to dismantle Jewish industry; to block-off the sea; to deny the independence of Haifa and its port. These schemes will be eradicated on the battlefield.\\"Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem, Zvi Dror (ed. Nathan Shoḥam), Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, p. 267 (Hebrew) Up until that time, the Brigade had been active in capturing infiltrators who sought to carry out attacks against Jews and their property, as also in securing the public transportation to Jerusalem. The Regimental Operations Department initiated patrols south of the Jerusalem Corridor. They assumed that when fighting resumed, the task of the Brigade would be to expand the corridor southward. Thus, before Operation El Ha-Har (Unto the Mountaintop) was approved, \\"Raanana\\" (Eliyahu Sela), the Officer in charge of Regimental Operations, had informed the Fourth and the Fifth battalions about the plan to take military action in the area of Beit Jimal and Dayr al-Hawa, and gave orders unto them to carry out reconnaissance missions with a view of watching enemy movement in that territory and to prepare an operational plan for the conquering of those villages if and when the fighting should be renewed. In a written dispatch, \\"Raanana\\" had informed Palmach-Harel headquarters responsible for the central front: \\"In all these last few days, the enemy has not ceased from his own operations in this sector [of the country]. There has been an exchange of unrelenting gun-fire. The strategic location itself is not easy to hold-on to, since it is much lower than the other positions. Our suggestion would be, 1) consolidating and expanding the position by occupying other positions, with additional operations conducted by small raiding parties; the addition of 120 mm. mortar for this area; 2) In the event that operations should be halted, a call to the United-Nations for a cease-fire.\\" \\"Raanana\\" waited impatiently for a prompt answer, but his request to \\"occupy other positions\\" was denied him. Nevertheless, in spite of being denied, these positions were still taken by force when operations began, the Har’el Brigade continuously moving and extending the border of Jewish hegemony as far as Wādi Surar (Nahal Sorek), where it was also deemed necessary to establish a military outpost beyond its south bank. Eliyahu \\"Raanana\\" Sela, Officer of Regimental Operations =Preparations for war= In the meantime, Palmach- Harel headquarters continued to make suggestions to the higher military echelon on ways in which the Jerusalem Corridor could be better secured by extending its control over other vital areas. \\"Having prevailed upon their officers, the Officer of Special Operations, unto whom was made available a vast quantity of weapons for the prosecution of that war, was given the liberty to make preparations for war and was tasked with drawing-up a series of military plans, which he did in consultation with the brigade commander and the battalion commanders.\\"Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem, Zvi Dror (ed. Nathan Shoḥam), Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, pp. 267 - 268 (Hebrew) The plan of military action which they devised called out for an integrated unit consisting of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth battalions, the 10th Armored Brigade (), Intelligence unit, logistics officers, transportation, medical services, saboteurs, corps of engineers, artillery officer, quartermaster and personnel administration. \\"Raanana\\", at this time, felt confident that he now had everything that he needed to plan and execute military operations that would result in widening Israel's control over the Jerusalem Corridor southward, as far as the Elah Valley, including that road that branched off between the Shaar HaGai - Bayt Jibrin highway, and ascended eastward through the Elah Valley as far as al-Khader (today, regional highway 375).Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem, Zvi Dror (ed. Nathan Shoḥam), Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, p. 268 (Hebrew) The Brigade was initially supposed to take-up a position on a mountain in the vicinity of the Arab village, Ḥousan, and what was then known as \\"the Fork\\" (now, Tzur Hadassa), and to be on stand-by for further movement, if called for, in the direction of Gush-Etzion, Hebron, Bayt Jala and Bethlehem. =Renewed fighting= Hostilities began on 15 October 1948, when Israeli troops assigned to Operation Yoav took the offensive to the south, opposite Egyptian army positions in the northern Negev. The Har’el Brigade, stationed further north, remained inactive for four days, a decision taken by the IDF's General Staff and which, for political reasons, wanted to see first whether or not the Jordanian Arab Legion would react. On 19 October, when the \\"junction\\" in the south was captured and there was once again an unobstructed land-link with settlements in the Negev, the Brigade was given leave to commence military operations in its sector of the country. Among the considerations for permitting the Brigade to start its offensive was the fact that the Arab Legion had not intervened in Israeli military operations in the northern Negev, while there was also some concern that the United Nations Security Council might call for a cease-fire on 19 October. If that were to happen, the Brigade would have lost its opportunity to expand the Jerusalem Corridor by ridding it of hostile elements. =Fall of Dayr Aban= The Jordanian Arab Legion had decided to concentrate its forces in Bethlehem and in Hebron in order to save that district for its Arab inhabitants, and to prevent territorial gains for Israel.Sir John Bagot Glubb, A Soldier with the Arabs, London 1957, p. 200 With the war raging in the south between Israeli soldiers assigned to Operation Yoav and Egyptian forces, the Har’el Brigade set out in its mission with two objectives in mind, namely, extension of Jewish control over the Jerusalem Corridor by cutting-off pockets of resistance, viz. Egyptian forces that were operating in the immediate region, while simultaneously making an effort not to inadvertently draw the Arab Legion into armed conflict with Israeli forces. On the moon-lit night of 19 October, the troops of the Har'el Brigade commenced operations which were later coined \\"El Ha-Har\\", moving to capture Dayr Aban (to the south of MahseyaYalqut Teiman, Yosef Tobi and Shalom Seri (editors), Tel-Aviv 2000, p. 158, s.v. מחסיה (Hebrew) ) where there was located the 'Joint' military outpost in which, both, Egyptian forces joined by local militias from Dayr Aban lay on the one side, and Israeli troops on the other, had taken-up positions at a distance of sixty metres from each other. Egyptian forces lay to the east, while Israeli forces to the west. The attack was spearheaded by a company of men conscripted from abroad (), accompanied with artillery fire and \\"Davidka\\" mortars. They also made use of a stratagem whereby, in the night, they played on a phonograph the sound of rapid machine-gun fire, which blared loudly over the loudspeakers.Avi Shemmi (Schmidt), Friends Speak About Jimmy (5th edition), HaKibbutz HaMeuhad: Tel Aviv 1958, p. 200 [Hebrew title: חברים מספרים על ג'ימי] (Yad Tabenkin Archives, Testimony of Danny Agmon, 16-12/52/194) The sudden onslaught and bombardment, along with the noise, had its desired effect, causing a retreat of all Egyptian forces from the Arab village.Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem, Zvi Dror (ed. Nathan Shoḥam), Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, p. 269 (Hebrew) During this battle, Israeli forces suffered only one casualty, the deputy battalion commander of operations belonging to the Fifth Battalion, who had stepped momentarily out of his bunker to view the surgical attack.Avi Shemmi (Schmidt), Friends Speak About Jimmy (5th edition), HaKibbutz HaMeuhad: Tel Aviv 1958, p. 206 (Hebrew title: חברים מספרים על ג'ימי) Harel 4th Battalion west of the \\"Joint\\" military outpost, at commencement of operation =Fall of Dayr al-Hawa= From there, the Brigade proceeded to climb higher ground until it reached the crest of the mountain range where it received orders to arrange for the military occupation and capture of Dayr al-Hawa (today, Nes Harim), a village perched at an elevation of some 637 meters above sea-level. This was done with the intent of making it a springboard for further military operations while advancing toward the mountains overlooking al-Khader, Bethlehem and Hebron. The Brigade began sending out armed patrol-parties of two to three men in order to acquaint themselves with the terrain, and to learn about the feasibility of sending out greater forces to infiltrate enemy lines. The plan was to cross-over the railroad line that connected Jerusalem with Hartuv. Scouts succeeded in crossing over the railway without being detected, and reached a position southwest of Dayr al-Hawa. When a second detail was sent out to ascertain whether or not the route could be traversed, they were ambushed by gunfire, which caused the party to retreat. A third detail sent out was also fired upon, which actions taken together gave the Brigade a correct assessment of the enemy's preparedness for battle. Given these circumstances, plans were drawn-up for the attack on Dayr al-Hawa. Two companies attacked Dayr al-Hawa. In addition to the massive firepower from their personal weapons, they were also aided by a 120 mm. mortar battery. When they had come within 200 meters of the village, the firing of auxiliary weapons used to assist them in the initial onslaught was brought to a halt. Another force assaulted the village from a different side. The villagers, being attacked from in front and from behind, soon capitulated. By midnight, units of the Fourth Battalion had taken full command of the village Dayr al-Hawa where they found the villagers had fled with their animals. At this success, they began making preparations for further action. In the process of taking the village, three companies with support weapons, accompanied by armored vehicles, had ascended the mountain. In the coordinated attacks, the Har’el Brigade had captured three military outposts: the 'House' outpost, the 'Cannon' outpost and the 'Joint' military outpost.Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem, Zvi Dror (ed. Nathan Shoḥam), Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, p. 270 (Hebrew) In each of them, the Brigade initially met-up with some resistance. Tabenkin recalls: \\"When the 'Joint' outpost and Dayr al-Hawa had been captured, there was created for us the preeminence of decisive force, and we then decided to move also by day... When dawn broke [the following morning], it was decided that the soldiers of the Fifth Battalion would proceed unto Bayt Nattif with the intent, that after the capture of the village, it would be possible to proceed onward [unhindered] over the Bayt Ha-Elah road northward (sic).\\" =Fall of Allar= The people of the neighboring Arab village, Allar (now, Moshav Mata), upon hearing the sound of gunfire from the direction of Dayr al-Hawa, were gripped with fear and trepidation. When they were told that some of the residents in Dayr al-Hawa had been killed, out of concern for their own safety, the villagers took flight, taking with them provisions and bedding material for their needs, and the last of that summer's harvest from their fields (wheat and lentils), fleeing by lorry to al-Khader, whence they found temporary shelter in caves around Bayt Jala, before eventually settling in Dheisheh Camp. Harel position near ruin, southeast of Beit Jimal =Fall of Beit Jimal= Afterwards, on 20 October, a much smaller force from the Fifth Battalion broke-away and travelled with a battle corps of the 10th Armored Brigade on the Bayt Jibrin highway and captured Beit Jimal. Having taken that strategic location and having silenced the Egyptian cannon fire that dominated the Bayt Jibrin highway, this enabled troops from the Givati infantry brigade, known as Shu'alei Shimshon , to proceed unhindered unto Bayt Jibrin. =Fall of Bayt Nattif and Zakariyya= The following day (21 October), Moshe (\\"Morris\\") Ben-Dror, the commander of the Fifth Battalion, put together a battle corps consisting of two companies of riflemen, a support company and saboteurs, who were instructed to take Bayt Nattif and to destroy its houses, whose inhabitants had fought against the Convoy of thirty-five fallen soldiers who were sent to aid their beleaguered comrades in Gush Etzion. Many of the town's inhabitants had taken up refuge in nearby Umm al-Ra'us, but were prevented from returning. At night, a unit from the Fifth Battalion raided the village of Zakariyya (today, Zekharia), which action then opened the Elah Valley road to al-Khader (today, regional highway 375). Many of the villagers in Zakariyya had fled to the hills, but returned to live in their village and were allowed to stay there, until they were eventually resettled in 1950, with compensation, some in Ramlah, while others choosing to move to Jordan. Demolition of houses in Bayt Nattif, the Har'el Brigade, 1948 =Fall of Jarash and Bayt 'Itab= With war approaching, by the 21st of October, the residents of Jarash had fled their hilltop village. An integrated force of armored vehicles and infantry proceeded on the road (now route 386) in the direction of Bayt 'Itab (near the present site of Bar Giora). Before the break of dawn (22nd of October), it became evident to the fighting force that the town's inhabitants had all deserted the village. The houses of the villages were demolished, and when the land mines along the route had been dismantled and cleared for safe passage, the entire force continued to move until it reached the intersection near the Arab village of Ḥousan. There, a firefight broke-out between Jordanian infantry accompanied with armored cars carrying cannons and the advance guard of the Har’el. At length, the Jordanian forces retreated, and by dusk, the Har’el Brigade entered the village Ḥousan. Zvi Ayalon (right) and Joseph Avidar On 22 October, at 15:30 hours, at the request of the United Nations Security Council, a cease-fire took effect, in which both sides agreed.Sir John Bagot Glubb, A Soldier with the Arabs, London 1957, p. 200 (although, in his account, the cease fire was to take effect from three o'clock in the afternoon). One hour later, the Har’el Brigade received instructions to withdraw from the village, which news caught them by surprise, and to return to the intersection, and there to wait for further orders. The troops were then withdrawn and were positioned along the valley of Wadi Fukin, in accordance with the cease-fire agreement. Even so, the fighters of the Fifth Battalion made themselves ready for continued action. The general feeling among the troops was that they were fully capable of taking the entire area between Bethlehem and Hebron, based on military intelligence of enemy troops in the region. However, by midnight, Prime-Minister David Ben-Gurion had instructed the Har’el Brigade to withdraw all forces, meaning, Israeli forces were to relinquish their grip on Ḥousan. OC Central Command, General Zvi Ayalon, passed these instructions to Joseph Tabenkin, demanding that all hostilities end immediately, and that they return to the \\"Forked Junction\\" (today, Tzur Hadassah), 4-6 kilometers from Bayt Jala and from Bethlehem. Tabenkin, the Brigade commander, being startled by the order, went urgently that night to Har’el HQ in Abu-Ghosh and tried to convince his commanders to reexamine their decision and to continue with the prosecution of the war, but to no avail.Har’el: Palmach brigade in Jerusalem, Zvi Dror (ed. Nathan Shoḥam), Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishers: Benei Barak 2005, p. 273 (Hebrew) The result of the campaign to expand the Jerusalem Corridor as far as the western foothills of the Judean mountains, freeing it from pockets of resistance, helped, in the final analysis, to determine the border of Israel with Jordan during the 1949 Armistice Agreement.

Set in Ancient Rome beginning in June AD 89, two months after the events of The Ides of April (2013), the novel stars Flavia Albia, the British- born adopted daughter of Marcus Didius Falco (the hero of the author's 20-volume Marcus Didius Falco Mysteries series, published from 1989 to 2010). Albia, a widow, works as a \\"delatrix\\" (a detective or private informer) in ancient Rome, like Falco. The book's cover bears an image of two silver cups, one toppled, and a broken rope. It carries the strapline: \\"A Flavia Albia Novel\\". Connections to the Falco series Falco is not mentioned in \\"The Cast\\", but his past history and his habits are discussed throughout conversations between Albia, her client the aedile Faustus, his slave Dromo and Albia's two uncles (revealed to be Falco's associates/brothers-in-law Quintus and Aulus, who now work as barristers and senators). Besides, the list includes his partner Helena Justina (\\"a force to be reckoned with\\"), her two brothers and their wives and ex-wives, and the \\"very old waiter\\" Apollonius. Lucius Petronius Longus, Falco's friend is revealed to have continued his search for Florius, only to have given up and retired from work with the vigiles, while Albia's maternal grandparents (Helena's parents) are absent, implying that they are deceased. The fate of some of Albia's adopted relatives, the Camilii and the Didii, following the events of Nemesis, and how Falco's family was affected by the Vesuvius eruption of 79 AD and the Saepta Julia fire of 80 AD, are also recalled by Albia. Albia also reveals that her late husband Lentullus met his untimely end in \\"an accident\\". Plot summary It is June in the year 89 AD, the 9th year of the reign of Domitian, and Rome is in an uproar when a newly married couple living in an apartment on the Esquiline -- Valerius Aviola and Mucia Lucilia -- are found strangled in bed. One of their slave porters has been brutally bludgeoned and the family silver is missing. The remaining slaves of the Aviola household (including the injured porter, Nicostratus) are naturally suspected of being complicit in the seemingly apparent murder of their masters and the theft of the silverware, and (with the exception of Myla, a slave and Polycarpus, the family steward) manage to flee to the sanctuary of the Temple of Ceres. The 2nd Vigiles Cohort is charged with investigating, but the cohort tribune Titianus gives up, and the temple's authorities are unenthusiastic about harbouring potential murderers (especially slaves who have murdered their owners) so an aedile, Tiberius Manlius Faustus, is called in to investigate. Faustus persuades Flavia Albia, the adopted daughter of Marcus Didius Falco and a delatrix in her own right, to help, with the hope that she could clear the names of the slaves. Flavia, having fled her family at Ostia out of outright boredom whilst on holiday, agrees to Faustus' request. At the Esquiline, Albia talks to Fauna, a neighbour, and learns that the entire household had been in a tumult for many nights, including the night of the murder itself. The former steward Polycarpus and the Aviola slaves who managed to flee to the Temple of Ceres tell Albia that it was a botched robbery gone wrong, but Albia doubts their statements -- why was Nicostratus bludgeoned, but not strangled like his owners? and if the slaves were within earshot of the murdered couple's bedroom, why did they not rush out to help them? With the help of Faustus and her uncle Quintus, Albia soon discovers a tangled web of dark secrets, vengeance, lust and rivalry not just amongst the Aviola slaves, but within the family itself: Valerius Aviola's first wife, Galla, seems belligerent enough to want him dead after having lost him to her best friend, the late Mucia Lucilia. Albia discovers that some of the slaves were originally Mucia's own staff, and both Aviola and Lucilia were planning to sell some of them off as part of a redundancy exercise, beginning with Myla, with whom Valerius used to sleep with prior to marrying Lucilia. Albia also discovers sexual tensions over Amaranta, a female slave, between three male slaves: Onesimus, a steward of Lucilia's who had been sent away; Phaedrus, another porter; and Daphnus, a server. Phaedrus also had a feud with Nicostratus, who by now has died of his injuries. Equally, Galla's cousin, the executor of Valerius' will, disliked Lucilia (because Aviola was divorced from Galla) and planned to replace his slave steward Gratus with Polycarpus. Gratus tells Albia that Myla may have given birth to many children after Aviola and Polycarpus forced themselves on her. With so many conflicts within the Aviola household, Albia first suspects that someone either wanted to steal the silver or that Aviola's ex-wife put out a contract on him and Lucilia, so she investigates the local racketeers in the vicinity, the Rabirii. Titianus, Albia and Faustus track down a nephew of the Rabirii crime lord named Roscius, who admits that he was in the Aviola apartment but while he could not find the silver, he did see the bodies of the murdered couple. He also mentions that when he was there, the house was unusually quiet and dark, in contrast to Fauna's deposition. Crises soon mar the investigations -- Quintus is brutally assaulted, apparently by the Rabirii in the Aventine, but the 4th Vigiles Cohort apprehend one of the attackers. When the Rabirii fail to save the man, this sparks off a deadly gang war on the Esquiline, but Albia and the rest of her contacts survive. However, Polycarpus is soon found strangled in the same manner as his former owners in his own apartment above the former Aviola residence -- ruling out Polycarpus and the fugitive slaves as the killer or killers. Albia attends Polycarpus' wake, and discovers that Polycarpus was loyal to his late master (and former mistress Galla), which was reciprocated by the Aviola family. Galla did not bear much of a grudge against Lucilia or Aviola either, nor do her children, so neither Polycarpus, Galla nor her children would have had a motive for Aviola's death. But when Polycarpus' widow, Graecina attempts to send Myla to the slave market, Myla scalds her with hot water, screams that she killed Aviola and Lucilia, and then drowns herself in the Tiber. Albia, Fauna and Galla rush back the apartment to tend to Graecina, where over drinks the three women tell Albia of the existence of an old well in the courtyard. Graecina reveals clues implicating Cosmus, a slave owned by her, in the murders of the Aviola couple and Polycarpus. Albia also discovers that Cosmus had a violent streak, marking him as a potential killer. Albia realises that the Aviola silverware is hidden in the well, and discovers that the old well has been freshly sealed with a wooden cover, using a plank covered with dried blood. She dredges up the Aviola silverware from the well and to celebrate her discovery with Faustus and his slave Dromo even drinks wine poured into one of the chalices from the well. For her efforts, the grateful Aviola family give a small pouch of coins to Albia. Albia interrogates the slaves one last time and eventually discovers the truth: Cosmus was Myla's son and tried to compel Aviola to keep Myla and the other slaves on. When Aviola refused, Cosmus strangled him along with Lucilia, but was found out by Polycarpus, who had him detained alone in the kitchen, probably just before Roscius broke in. Polycarpus decided to fake a robbery to protect Cosmus and the other slaves, just as Roscius and his men attempted to rob the apartment. To make it more convincing, Nicostratus was roughed up by the other slaves, but Phaedrus went too far, eventually resulting in Nicostratus' death. Phaedrus used a plank to beat up Nicostratus, which was then used to seal the well with the silverware inside it. Despite Polycarpus' best attempts to cover up his involvement in the double murder, Cosmus may have argued over the silver with Polycarpus, and eventually strangled him too in a fit of rage. Being Cosmus' mother, Myla may well have tried to shield him through her suicide. For their confessions, Albia decides to commend Amaranta, Daphnus and his witless brother Melander for exoneration, but she implies that the rest would not be so lucky, least of all the now fugitive Cosmus, since they all were negligent in their duty to protect their owners. Albia writes a report for Faustus, advises the long- suffering Titianus to send out a warrant for Cosmus' arrest, and then returns home to Fountain Court, but it is not the end yet. Halfway up, Albia suddenly falls violently ill, sickened from having drunk wine mixed with tainted water from the well, but is saved and nursed back to health by Faustus. The book ends with Helena, Albia's adopted mother, taking Albia back to Ostia for treatment, and Albia herself meditating on Faustus' motives for tending to her, and she admits that she longs to see him again.

Retrieved 1 August 2013. Biography Born into a well- to-do Roskilde family, he matriculated from high school in Roskilde before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1847 to 1853, winning the Grand Silver Medal. He first painted portraits and landscapes but soon concentrated on architectural painting, influenced by study tours to Gotland (1981) with Johan Daniel Herholdt and to Germany, Dalmatia and Italy (1854–55) with Ferdinand Meldahl. Painting was not however enough to satisfy him. As a child, he had shown interest in his home town, Roskilde. His acquaintance with the archeologist Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae encouraged him to become involved in the restoration of historical buildings in collaboration with the National Museum, leading to hundreds of drawings and watercolors which are now in the museum's archives. His drawings of Jellinghøjene (the burial mounds of Jelling) which he drew while working with Worsaae and Christian Herbst can be seen in his Kongehøiene i Jellinge (1875). Church frescos and historical monuments Kornerup's watercolor of frescos in St Ibs Church, Roskilde (1900) One of his foremost interests was in the preservation of Denmark's medieval church frescos in which he pioneered restoration work from 1862 to 1904, becoming one of the Denmark's central figures in the field. He uncovered murals in 80 churches across the land that had been whitewashed over after the Reformation.\\"Kornerups billedverden – Roskilde, rejser & restaureringer\\" , Roskilde Museum.

He also became an adviser in connection with the restoration of Roskilde Cathedral when work started in the 1850s. Settling in Roskilde in 1855, he also took an active interest in the preservation of the city's other historic monuments.

Despite competition from global competitors such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Elephant Soft Drinks remains the market leader in Sri Lanka. History Ceylon Cold Stores was established in 1866 as the Colombo Ice Company, which in 1863 imported the country's first ice-making machine. With an initial capital of £1,900, two steam engines of 8 and 9 horse power, and a total of 22 employees, the company started producing ice on a commercial scale. The company's first premises were located on Glennie Street, Slave Island and its popular name 'Ice Kompaniya' was used locally to identify the area, Kompaniveediya. German engineer Arthur Kurt Von Possner (1833–1900), who was the first manager of the company, introduced aerated water with the distinctive \\"Elephant\\" trademark on the bottles, which later became \\"Elephant House\\" and since that time has remained as the household name for the brand. The company initially produced two types of carbonated drinks: soda and lemonade, both of which compared favorably at the time in international fairs in Melbourne and Calcutta, where they won awards. In 1880 the Colombo Ice Company acquired the business and goodwill of J. Maitland, who owned a medical hall which sold a variety of medicated wine. The company, however, went into liquidation. Tom Walker headed a syndicate that bought Colombo Ice Company, forming a new company under the name New Colombo Ice Company on 8 May 1894. In 1910 the New Colombo Ice Company bought the business and plant of one of its main competitors, the Galle Face Ice Company, from J. P. Motten for Rs. 45,000. In 1919, the company acquired Von Possners British Aerated and Mineral Water Company for Rs. 175,000. In 1923, the company purchased a new ice manufacturing plant which was driven by an internal combustion engine replacing its old ten-ton steam-driven plant. By 1925, the company moved on to build cold storage for frozen products of all kinds, opening new cold stores in Colombo on 1 December 1928, the same year the company purchased another smaller rival, the Pure Ice and Aerated Waters Manufactory. In 1932, Ceylon Creameries Limited was acquired to produce and distribute reconstituted fresh milk and ice cream. In 1934 the New Colombo Ice Company purchased Ceylon Ice and Cold Storage Company for Rs 850,000. A carbonic acid gas plant was installed in 1935 to make carbon dioxide and dry ice. With the purchase of a bread-making machine and a modern oven, bread was baked and sold by the company. In 1941, New Colombo Ice Company changed its name to Ceylon Cold Stores Limited. In 1964 Mallory Wijesinghe became its first Ceylonese chairman. In January 1970 the company was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Ceylon Cold Stores came under the umbrella of John Keells Holdings Limited with the acquisition of the Whittalls Group in 1991 (John Keells Holdings has a 54% majority shareholding in the company). In 1998 the company enhanced its production capacity considerably by installing a modern bottling plant at the Kaduwela factory. In 2007 John Keells Holdings reinvested close to one billion rupees in the installation of a state of the art factory line.

History The Friendship Tree was planted as a scientific experiment to create a new hybrid of mandarin orange, by FM Zorin in Sochi Agricultural and garden Experiment Station. The tree's experiments became a collection of 45 different types of citrus fruit grafted on it, with more planted in the botanical gardens. In 1940 the arctic explorer and Soviet scientist Otto Yulyevich Schmidt visited the tree and botanical garden. As a token of his love for the nature of his Soviet Union homeland, he grafted a new citrus bud on the crown of the tree. People from various countries, nationalities, professions, and religions later continued the example, creating a tradition. The experimental citrus tree was named the Friendship Tree in 1957, upon the suggestion of Vietnamese doctors. Commemorative grafts have been added onto the Tree of Friendship by many heads of state; prominent public figures and politicians; representatives from the sciences, arts, and culture; as well as astronauts, athletes, military, and religious figures. Among these are the Soviet figure skating Olympic Gold Medalist Irina Rodnina in 1976, and Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon in 2013.

Opened in 1907, today it is used for retail and residential space. History The building was constructed in 1906-1907. It was built by Harvey H. and Jacob L. Farr Jr., whose father, Jacob Farr Sr., had opened a shoe business in Allentown at the same location in June 1862. Jacob Farr had learned the shoe trade in Philadelphia in 1852 when he was 14 years old. He operated the business at the site during the industrial revolution years of the late 19th Century, passing the business down to his family upon his death in April 1889 at the age of 51. Former Allentown shoe store's history goes back Farr to 1862, The Morning Call article, 16 March 2005 The family brought in a business partner, Nathan Hass, and the business was named Farr, Hass & Company. In 1898, the business was expanded to large-scale manufacturing of shoes, with the organization of the Leigh Valley Shoe Company, located at Chestnut and Howard streets in Allentown. Farr manufactured 1,000 shoes a day, and sold them both at the store on 8th and Hamilton as well as distributing them to other stores in the area. When describing the business, the owners stated that \\"There is nothing in the line of ladies' men's and children's shoes that cannot be supplied to their large trade from their establishment.\\" 1900 Farr, Haas & Company Trade Card In 1900 Nathan Hass and Harvey Farr dissolved the partnership by mutual consent after Hass purchased the Cross Keys Hotel on the northwest corner of Eighth and Hamilton streets (801 Hamilton) from the Hagenbuch family, who had operated a tavern and later the hotel at the site since about 1800. Hass tore down the hotel and erected a five-story building in 1901 and opened N.A. Hass & Son, a competitive shoe business that he operated until 1912 when Hass sold the property and retired from the shoe business. In 1900 when Hass left the Farr company, Edgar Wenner was brought in by the family to replace him , and the company was renamed Farr Brothers' and Co. By this time the business had expanded beyond its existing building, and a new, larger five-story building was constructed that exists on the site today. It was designed by Allentown architects Rhue & Lange. The Farr company occupied the first floor with a retail store, the basement held the stockroom and company offices were on the fifth floor. The second, third and fourth floors were rented space for business offices. The company opened a store in Bethlehem in 1919; Easton in 1910; Reading in 1913 and Harrisburg in 1953. The company's slogan was \\"Better Shoes By Farr\\". The building was remodeled in 1932, and again in 1965. The company thrived until the 1970s, as with most downtown Allentown businesses, the central shopping district along Hamilton street suffered from the suburbanization and the building of shopping malls, which drew shoppers away from the downtown. In December 1985, the company announced that the store at 8th and Hamilton streets would end full retail service and become a self-service store. Also, the company was sold to a New York firm, the Farr family leaving the shoe business. In 1988, the building was taken over by a speculator. A family member, Harvey Farr, re- acquired the property when the property speculator sold it. In August 1992, Farr sold the property to D.E. Jones Company, a \\"poor man's Kmart\\" and used the store for selling discounted merchandise. By this time, the upper four floors were abandoned. Current use In 2004, the building was sold to Metropolis Management LLC, a development firm from New York City with a history of preserving historic structures. The property was completely renovated and was retrofitted into luxury loft-style apartments. On December 1, 2005, the Farr Lofts were inaugurated with a public showing of a finished 2-bedroom model unit. An additional 19 units began occupancy in early 2006.Farr Lofts history The ground floor is used as \\"The Villa\\" urban clothing store. In 2011, when demolition began for the PPL Center, an entire block along the north side of Hamilton Street between 7th and 8th streets was demolished except for The Farr Building and Dime Savings and Trust Company. It was noted that \\"... Because of the improvements that have been made, it is probably the most valuable property on the block\\".Two buildings being spared hockey's hit, The Morning Call article, 17 June 2011.

Scott Murray, Australia on the Small Screen 1970-1995, Oxford Uni Press, 1996 p161 Plot A tight-knit group of high school students studies karate with Steve Beck (Vince Martin), a former soldier in an unnamed war. They begin working at 5:00 a.m., which makes them sleepy in Sonia Spane's (Joanne Samuel) class. Spane is Beck's former lover, and she complains to him about the relentless schedule of his classes. Beck's students also engage in a mock war game at night, which is held in a factory. The losers get tagged with a fluorescent dye on their faces. When Spane sees the dye on a student's face, she interrogates them about the game, which they call \\"kuma\\". In addition to playing kuma at night, the students all hang out at a local bar. One of their fellow students, Guy Duncan (Craig Pearce), is a drugdealer who lurks on the periphery of their classes with Beck and at the bar. Robby Mason (Tom Jennings) is Beck's prize pupil, and the two are training intensively for a televised kickboxing tournament. During the course of his training, Robby grows closer to his classmate Amy Raphael (Nicole Kidman). Because Spane was previously involved with Beck, she knows his intensity could be overwhelming for their young students. Beck is the only surviving member of his platoon, and he believes that he has stayed alive through the traits of discipline and determination that he is passing on to his students. One day, Amy overhears Beck purchasing drugs from Duncan. Just before the kickboxing tournament, Robby spies on Duncan and Beck. Duncan tries to blackmail Beck into paying a higher price for his drugs. Beck kills Duncan with one blow to the face. A short time later, when they face each other in the kickboxing ring, Robby confronts Beck about killing Duncan. After the tournament, Beck tries to run Robby over with his car. The two later confront each other in the factory during a kuma. The other students realize the truth about Beck, and they team up to keep him from killing Robby.

The site is adjacent to the A483 road and close to the Montgomery Canal. It is about south of Oswestry on the English side of the border, and about north of the Powys town of Welshpool.  History and significance  This is a nationally significant industrial heritage area, containing one of only three remaining Hoffmann kilns in the country. It provides key insights into industrial archaeology, as it was a major centre of the lime industry until the early 20th century. It is not known when the lime industry started here, but it may date back to medieval times or possibly earlier. The first reference to the site is on a map from 1753. Evidence of early settlement locally includes a prehistoric hill fort on Llanmynech HIll, while Offa's Dyke runs close to the site on the western perimeter. The area also has a long history of industrial activity, including copper and lead mining dating back to at least the Roman period.  Description of the site  Prior to the opening of the Montgomery Canal (then known as the Ellesmere Canal) in 1796, limestone quarrying was undertaken on the site on a relatively small scale, although lime kilns for lime burning appear to have been within the quarry from at least 1753. In 1806 a tramway and incline was constructed to transport limestone from the quarry to a new wharf on the canal. A second tramway was constructed to the east of the site sometime between 1807–1837 and this became the main transport route, remaining in use until the closure of the quarry in 1914. The 1863 opening of the Llanfyllin branch line, part of Cambrian Railways, had a major impact on the quarry, enabling much faster transportation of limestone and opening up new potential markets. Additional track and sidings were built along with two draw kilns – located to the west of the Hoffman kiln. Designed for continuous operation and built after 1874, these two kilns were abandoned by 1900. The Hoffman kiln was the last major development on the site and is believed to have been built around 1900, along with additional tramways and rail track. The kiln, which is exceptionally well preserved, measures around and has two tunnel vaults entered through 14 round-headed arches. The chimney, a local landmark, stands on a plinth and is around high.  Restoration and community project  A restoration project ran from 2006–2009, with funding from both the Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage. Additional financial support also came from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and project partners, with the aim to conserve the site for visitors and educational purposes. As part of the project, an archaeological investigation was carried out.Discovering Shropshire's History \\"Archaeological investigations at the Llanymynech Limeworks Heritage Site in 2006-7\\" Date retrieved: 1 August 2013 Its main aim was to gather information about key features of the site – particularly the location of former tramways, ground surfaces and turntable track-beds. A local community project also received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, highlighting the importance of the area through initiatives including: * Commissioning a sculpture, information boards, signage and leaflets * Providing picnic benches and seating * Volunteer research visit, wharf clearance, tours and opening of the canalside stable block. * Creating a website and producing a social history archive.Llanymynech Community Project \\"Community Project\\". Date retrieved: 1 August 2013  Artefacts from the site  Some artefacts discovered at the site in recent years are on display at Oswestry Town Museum. These range from tools and a quarryman's boot to a tramway sleeper, couplings and a pulley wheel.  Walking activities  This area contains a variety of short or long walks with routes leading passed lime kilns, woodland, canals, old railways, and grazed pastures. Along these routes are various information panels and sculptures to inform you about the area, some of these pathways are rough and so suitable footwear is recommended.

The current members are Svetlana \\"Sevi\\" Bliznakova (lead vocals), Delyan Ketipov (lead guitar), Rally Velinov (bass guitar) and Pavlin Ivanov (drums, percussion). The band describe their music genre as heart rock,[1] a name given to their style due to the emotional, heartfelt content and message of their songs. Their debut album, What Lies Beyond, was released on June 14, 2012 in Bulgaria.[2] There were four singles to the album, along with music videos, as the first two (\\"Can't Stand the Pain\\" and \\"Limited Edition\\") were released before the album, and the other two, \\"Victim\\" and \\"Speed Up\\" came few months after the studio album. On April 23, 2014, Sevi released \\"On My Own\\", the first single to their second studio album The Battle Never Ends. The band went on a national tour on June 27, 2012[3] in support of their debut album. The What Lies Beyond Tour ended on September 27, 2012. Soon after, the band started working on acoustic arrangements of their original songs, inspired in part by a performance they gave during a live session at Z-Rock Radio[4]. This led to an acoustic concert that the band performed on November 30, 2012[5], in addition to the video debut for the third single from What Lies Beyond. The acoustic show was recorded on February 13, 2013 at the Sofia club “Backstage” and released as a full-length DVD/CD package called The Other Side of Sevi. SEVI performs at a huge number of Motorcycle Events and Festivals in Bulgaria throughout 2013. They launch the opening of the bike riding season in Sofia, with a performance on a moving flatbed truck platform, while being followed by a motorcade of avid riders. The event was captured on video, footage of which became the single \\"Speed Up\\".[7] History =2005–2010: Sevi solo career= In 2005 Svetlana \\"Sevi\\" Bliznakova is invited by Italian record producer Rocco Milano to take part in a CD compilation with the song “On My Own, which she had co- written with Pino Biaggioli. The song is recorded with the Italian rock band \\"Eldritch\\" and in the beginning of 2014 it is re-arranged and re-recorded by Svetlana Bliznakova's band SEVI. Svetlana is (as of 2016) the only Bulgarian singer to have performed in the show of Sky Italia in \\"Club Lost\\" during the Sanremo Music Festival in 2007. She co-writes many new songs with Rally Velinov, himself a musician and songwriter, who arranges many of Svetlana compositions. The same Mr. Velinov later goes on to become the bass player, and a key figure in the band SEVI. In the summer of 2008 Svetlana, records 11 new songs in collaboration with Rally Velinov and guitarist Peter Bratanov. In January 2010 with the idea to create a wider platform and develop her career, claiming a stake in the music business, together with Rally Velinov, Svetlana starts a band, which she names after her own nickname, SEVI – making the band, in essence, an extension of Svetlana herself. =2010–2012: Formation, Sevi band and What Lies Beyond= The band SEVI is formed in January 2010 by Svetlana Bliznakova on vocals with Valentin Nikolov – drums, Tania Apostolova – keyboards, Rally Velinov – bass guitar, Todor Todorov – guitar and Vladimir Donkov – guitar. In August 2010 the two guitar players leave to be replaced by the former guitarist of Bulgarian alternative rock band \\"Awake\\" – Peter Bratanov. By the end 2010, the band has already recorded their first single – \\"Can't Stand the Pain.\\" In February 2011 they also shoot a video for it, but the single is released several months later, by which time Peter Bratanov has already left the band. In March 2011 SEVI brings in Ivan Angelov to fill the position of lead guitarist. The original rock style of the band impresses local audiences and many media outlets and in very short time SEVI are played and invited to many radio and TV shows: the late show \\"Denis & Friends\\" on BNT 1,[8] SKAT TV,[9] Z-Rock Radio, Bulgarian National Radio,[10] \\"Radio ORV\\",[11] etc... As of January 10, 2010 some of SEVI's songs enter in the permanent \\"Golden Archive\\" of the Bulgarian National Radio.[12] On November 13, 2010 SEVI win first place award for original composition with the song \\"Fighter For Happiness\\" at the \\"Sonic B.A.N.G competition Bulgaria\\".[13] The next year, on June 24, 2011 Sevi releases their first official single and video \\"Can't Stand The Pain\\". It is the first video by a Bulgarian artists to be shown at movie theaters, between ads and upcoming movie trailers. [14] \\"Can't Stand the Pain\\" and SEVI are named \\"Band of the week\\" by Rock Symphony Radio in Lima (Peru).[15] The summer of 2011 is very successful for SEVI. The band tours extensively in Bulgaria, playing festivals and other open stages. At the \\"International Festival – Belozem 2011\\" they win the \\"Special award\\".[16] Later the in same year, on the precise date of November 11, 2011 (11 / 11 / 11), SEVI release their second single and accompanying video to their song \\"Limited Edition\\".[17] In January 2012 the band decides to organize a festival, dedicated to the emerging Bulgarian rock scene, and original rock music. This becomes the \\"23 & 1/2h Rock IT Marathon,\\" with the event taking place at the Sofia club and bar Rock IT on March 17 and 18 of 2012.[18] The event features 30 bands that take the stage over the course of two days. In the middle of 2012, guitarist Ivan Angelov leaves the band and is soon after replaced by Bobby Zasheff. Two weeks later, on June 14, 2012 Sevi release their first official album \\"What Lies Beyond\\".[19] Later that June, the band embarks a national summer tour in support of their debut release.[20] November 30 of 2012, SEVI releases their third music video \\"Victim\\" as a prelude to their first all-acoustic live set.[21] Nine days later, on December 9, Svetlana debuts her collaboration with Sugar Djs. The tracks is billed as \\"Sevi feat. Sugar Dj's\\" presented their new track \\"Shocked\\". On March 23, 2013, SEVI opens the bike riding season in Sofia, with a performance on a moving flatbed truck platform, while being followed by a motorcade of avid riders. The event was captured on video, footage of which later becomes the single \\"Speed Up\\".[7] “Speed Up” quickly zooms to the top of the Kamenitza Rock 40 chart on Z-Rock Radio and maintains a position in its top 10 for 30 weeks.[23] During 2013, Sevi does a lot of performances on motorcycle meetings and festivals, including performing one of their most notable concerts so far – The \\"Last Call for 2013\\"[24]. That show is also a heartfelt goodbye with guitarist Bobby Zasheff, who leaves the band as his family is to relocate abroad. Bobby is replaced with Temelko Temelkov (guitarist for LieVeiL))[25]. The beginning of 2014 signals yet another lineup change where keyboard player Tania Apostolova is replaced by Dessy Markova – experienced keyboardist, who has worked mainly with cover bands, cruise musicians, and is a rockin' music pedagogue. In June 2014 SEVI are chosen to take part in Kavarna Rock Fest 2014,where an international jury chooses SEVI to be the opening act for the night of the festival that will feature the bands: Europe, Krokus, Gus G, Pretty Maids.[27] In July 2014 SEVI start their first European tour[28], which features dates in Italy and Serbia. =2012–present: The Other Side Of Sevi and The New Albums= The promo of the single \\"Victim\\" gives SEVI yet another opportunity to present themselves in a more imaginative light. After a performance at “Hijack Acoustic” for Z-Rock Radio, Sevi decides to create a full repertoire of acoustic arrangements from the songs that featured on their debut album What Lies Beyond. The acoustic live show becomes the third original concept of SEVI's themed shows. The first one is created for the \\"What Lies Beyond Tour 2012\\" and it presents the band as pirates (in full regalia, replete with functioning cannon), scouring the world's stages gathering new fans by the thousands. After the \\"Pirate Show,\\" and later the same year SEVI present their second themed show – the \\"Route 66 Show\\". The stage is set with an old-style gas pumping station, like one would see while crossing the border between New Mexico and Nevada; guitarist lighting a cigarette dangerously close to the pump; the keyboard player in dirty overalls as a mechanic who's ready to take a quick peek under the hood; and the rest – a small team of desperados, ready to set up camp anywhere and entertain the locals. Along they way, while developing these shows and promotions, SEVI start to compile ideas for their second studio album, teasing audiences with the occasional live preview of a new track. SEVI second full-length release is entitled The Battle Never Ends. The album is presented at Sofia's club Rock IT on Friday (May) 13th, 2016. Living up to their reputation, the band had prepared a special show for the evening. The stage set to look like the aftermath of a battlefield, the musicians (including two guest backing vocalists) dressed in black, covered in a cloud of haze. The show starts with a soundscape of brutal winds, clinging swords (courtesy of Rally Velinov) and it features the vocal talents of prominent Bulgarian actor, Asen Blatechki, who reads out lines from the album's eponymous track: \\"It nevers ends...so stand... and prepare yourselves...'cause the battle...never...ever...ends\\" cueing the band to blast into the opening riff of the song! After the performance, SEVI welcomed guests and excited fans into their Fan/VIP area backstage for drinks and selfies. SEVI third full-length release is entitled me/ Follow Me. The album features names like Thomas Vikström and Jen Majura from Evanescence The release date was March 09th with a big show in Sofia Live Club. In June 2019 SEVI released the featuring song with Jen Majura “To Hell and Back” as a single. Fast cars, fire, passion and strong guitar riffs. The song was very well accepted by fans and media. During the summer of 2019 the band was part of the line-up of some of the biggest festivals in Bulgaria, such as ''Hills of Rock'', Varna Rock and many others along with names like Disturbed, Avantasia and W.A.S.P SEVI played also on festivals in Greece, Serbia and Romania. On 11th of September SEVI opened the show of Evanescence in Arena Armeec and performed their single \\"To Hell and Back\\" along with Jen Majura. 2020 started with a new single \\"Shattered\\" and a special 10 years anniversary show which was held in Music Jam Club - Sofia on march 6th. Performances Over the years, SEVI has become notable for their theatrical and original approach to their stage shows. The stage is also decorated to match the theme of the evening; sound designs, scenery, costumes are always integral to the show. SEVI's first such concept, the so-called Pirate Show, was developed in order to enhance the audience's experience for the promotional release of What Lies Beyond, the band's debut. Apart from the stylized costumes, the band members had tucked daggers and pistols into their britches, laid down chains, hanged cobwebs, and scattered skulls around the stage, with the beginning of the show being signaled by cannon fire, courtesy of their own, non-deadly but quite LOUD prop cannon. This theme was taken on the road for the “What Lies Beyond Tour 2012”. A month after the first Pirate Show performance SEVI returns to the local stage with their second stage design “Route 66.” The stage being made to look like a small gas station on a US highway going nowhere, the musicians themselves were in full character; dusty and road-weary, looking for a place to lay down their hats and strike a chord or two. Following this order, SEVI comes up with the idea to rearrange their songs into a multi-genre acoustic performance. Coupled with the video presentation of the song “ Victim\\", SEVI set an intimate stage/scene inviting folks to hear and enjoy the band's softer side. The stage is decorated like a cozy and familiar room, hats and umbrellas hanging on hooks, candles shining a soft light on Svetlana's silouette, and a chandelier similar to the one used on the video for \\"Victim.\\" One of SEVI's most notable shows – \\"Last Call for 2013\\" – finds Svetlana in a Steampunk top hat with goggles, leather gloves and chains, with large metal plate fashioned into the band's logo which adorns her microphone stand.

Retrieved August 1, 2013. William married Ida Belle Clary Wilcox in Northfield, Minnesota, where she was born. They were to have eight children together. They were sent to South Africa as missionaries by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and they arrived in Inanda, north of Durban, in 1881. This was a substantial mission known as the American Zulu Mission or AZM. Ida Wilcox taught girls including the future Nokutela Dube and Ida wrote a regular contribution for Rice County Journal in Northfield, Minnesota to publicize their work.Coan, Stephen, \\"It's Nokutela's Turn\\", The Witness, via News24, November 2, 2011. Retrieved June 15, 2014. William was asked to talk to John Dube about his poor behavior at the Adams School in Amanzimtoti. John was the son of the Reverend James Dube who was the Congregational minister at the AZM in Inanda. left In 1887, they were returning to the United States, and Dube and his mother persuaded the missionary couple to take John Dube to the United States where he could further his education. The Wilcoxes agreed on the condition that the child was to maintain himself financially. In 1888, Wilcox was pastor in Keene Valley Congregational church in New York and he asked Dube to visit him where Wilcox could use Dube's printing skills to create a pamphlet called \\"Self Support among the Kaffirs\\" which argued for native South Africans to use self-help to better themselves. Wilcox went on a lecture tour and took the seventeen-year- old Dube with him. Dube gave a number of lectures while his wife, Mama Nokutela Dube, sang for those who came. right With the Wilcox's help, Dube was able to attend Oberlin College although he also had to find time to work. Dube never graduated but he gathered a basic higher education. Dube returned to Africa to found what became the Ohlange High School in 1901. (Dube founded a newspaper and he was a founder and the first President of the organisation that became the African National Congress.) In 1909, the Wilcoxes created a company called the Zululand Industrial Improvement Company, which was owned by 300 black South Africans and themselves. The company led to acquiring land for thousands of black natives in Natal Province, which was met with disapproval by the local government. The Wilcoxes objected to the Natives Land Act of 1913, which restricted the right of people to buy land based on their race. They organised blacks to oppose this law which not only denied them new land but also denied the use of the land to those who already owned it or who were renting it. As a result of their opposition, the couple were driven to bankruptcy in 1918 by the administration and white colonial South Africans who were afraid of what might happen if the native population was allowed to own land. They returned to the United States where their situation was described as destitute. William and Ida Wilcox died in poverty in Glendale, California in 1928 and 1940, respectively. They were buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale,. Legacy The Wilcoxes contribution to South Africa's history was recognised when the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr Zweli Mkhize, visited Los Angeles to honour them in 2009.

Mkhize said \\"William and Ida Belle Wilcox sacrificed all that they had in solidarity with the South African people.\\" Their work was awarded the Order of the Companions of O. R.

History In 2007 Cape Town began its work on the MyCiTi Integrated Rapid Transit (IRT) system to improve public transport in the city. The plan enforces an integration between modes of public transportation since both rail and bus routes are used by thousands on their daily commute. The work includes improvements in infrastructure, business development, and operations. In October 2010 the IRT project began to seek artists and designers to create artworks on thirteen of the new MyCiTi bus stations. The plan called for artwork to be presented on the glass panels at the entrance of the stations. Six of the thirteen stations were commissioned to an artist collective called Black hat and Nimbus. Black hat and Nimbus are a collaborative group composed of Mark Henning and Hannah Williams, two graphic designers who have worked together on both public and private creative projects. Other artists involved in the project included Julia Anastasopoulos for Civic Centre mural, Hannes Bernard (Paarden Island), Arlene Amaler-Raviv (Neptune street), David Hlongwane (Section street), Sanjin Muftic (Brooklyn), Tony Coetzee (Zoarvlei) and Alan Munro (Bayside). A ZAR1-million competition for public artwork was held in Long Street in 2014 by the Western Cape Government Public Art Competition which was followed by Creative Week's public art walking tour. Part of this tour included vinyl artwork by Julia Anastasopoulos on the MyCiti bus station in Thibault Square. =Artist's statement= \\"In our increasingly complex world, design has become an indispensable interface between us, our environment and our technology. Visual symbols and information systems govern things as simple as choosing the right size trousers, to as complex as finding your way around an unfamiliar city. Public visual information systems influence the way people interact with their environment and bridge the gaps between conceptual and physical spaces. Although most public visual information exists as part of discreet formal systems with a very practical purpose (such as traffic signals, maps or signage), as a medium it has the potential to be used within a broader conceptual context and provide multiple layers of 'meta data' to any space, and this is where the boundaries between design and art begin to become less distinct.\\" Woodbridge Island The artwork at the Woodbridge Island MyCiTi station, entitled Shared Celebrations, consists of vinyl panels covered in colorful circles that graphically represent how many people in the area were born on each day of the year. The size and color of the circle determine how many people were born that day as well as the probable conceptions. The idea behind this design was to connect commuters to the community, through something shared such as birthdays, a personal day of celebration most people acknowledge. One could look that day to see how many local people are celebrating their birthday, or see how many share their birthday. The inspiration behind the design was influenced by party favors once received as children at birthday parties, that often had similar cheerful and colorful patterns. Racecourse Road  When My Ship Comes In, the artwork found at the Milnerton MyCiTi station, plays on the ideas of luck and superstition. The graphic design is meant to depicts the number of lotto winnings relative to the number of ships coming in to Cape Town harbour. The idea comes from the English saying. The artists thought a topic related to gambling would be appropriate because of the bus station's close location to the old Milnerton racecourse. The graph shows a wave-like pattern, representing ships entering the harbour, that collides with bright yellow circles, that vary in size to show the number of lottery wins. The data covers monthly lotto wins and ships entering the harbour from 2007 to 2010. The data was taken from the National Lottery and Transnet. While researching for this art piece, Henning and Williams faced some problems using certain information. Finding and obtaining the data was simple, however the Western Cape Gamling and Racing Board found the public display of gambling statistics to be a form advertising, and therefore it could not be used. Another idea was to display the number of black cats that have been lost in the area but the SPCA lacked the information and feared it would discourage people from adopting black cats.

In early inventories, the painting was called The Garden Party.Films Media Group, \\"Peter Paul Rubens the Garden of Love,\\" 1. It is the apotheosis of the outdoor courtly Merry Company genre painting. The subject of this piece is common in Baroque paintings, which used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, and grandeur. Rubens uses multi-layer allegory and symbolism to his paintings. Description In this 6.5 ft x 9.4 ft piece, a large group of well-dressed persons in the style of the 17th century lounge about, picnicking in an idyllic garden. Everyone is finely dressed, exercising their wealth and high class status. This demonstrates the depth of a full court scene in a recessional manner.Russell, \\"The Problem of Style in Costume Design,\\" 559. Cupids interact with the individuals, bringing mythological figures into a realistic garden scene to produce a fantastical painting.Films Media Group, \\"Peter Paul Rubens the Garden of Love,\\" 2. Rubens with Hélène Fourment and their son Peter Paul, 1639, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art All around the group, symbols of matrimonial love can be found including: the cupids, a pair of doves, flower crowns, music making, and Juno’s peacock. The dogs represent loyalty and fealty. The garden represents Paradise, but also fertility. This painting is an allegory and exaltation of love and marriage, as well as the merry company. In the far-left corner, a male gentleman escorts a woman in all-black towards the entourage. The man is believed to be Rubens, which led to the early identification of this painting to be a self-portrait with friends. The Garden of Love is believed to be celebration of his marriage to Rubens’ wife: Hélène Fourment. Helena Fourment was the second wife of Rubens. She was the subject of a few portraits by Rubens, and modeled for other religious and mythological paintings. The Fountains The fountains of the Three Graces and the Venus represent marital happiness. The Three Graces fountains are three Rubenesque nude females—soft bodied, voluptuous, and highly sexualized beings. These forms emphasize fertility and physical beauty, mirroring the beautiful garden scene. Directly below the Graces, an unsuspecting group of individuals getting sprayed by the fountain.Films Media Group, \\"Peter Paul Rubens the Garden of Love,\\" 4. The second fountain also depicts a nude female—this time having the nude Venus sitting on the back of a fish and producing a stream of water from her breasts. This is known as the Nursing Venus and is meant to symbolize child bearing and rearing. Rubens' home in AntwerpThis full-figured woman is identified by the peacock to be the goddess Juno, who is the goddess of marriage. Rubens plays on recognizable themes that his contemporary audience would recognize. Rubens uses motifs from Renaissance sculptures, but sets the scene in the mannerist portico of his own house in Antwerp . Influence Rubens’ merry company was influenced by Adriaen Brouwer, a Baroque Flemish artist, who painted intensely naturalistic merry company genre scenes. While only 60 works of his are known, Brouwer’s work influenced the next generation of Flemish and Dutch genre painters. Brouwer painted atmospheric landscapes, painted with loose brushstrokes—the influence of this style can be seen in Rubens' piece.

Life  Varadaraja Perumal was born in Sri Lanka. His father, Annamalai was an Indian Tamil. He graduated from University of Jaffna in economics. After graduation, he worked in the same University as a lecturer. He was a student activist in Tamil United Liberation Front. In 1979, he co-founded Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF). Initially EPRLF was a radical outfit that had the People's Liberation Army as its military wing, and was headed by Douglas Devananda. He was arrested for his association with the outfit but he escaped from jail during 1983 Batticaloa Jailbreak, along with other inmates. In an attempt to end Sri Lankan civil war, the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed. Therefore, Northern and the Eastern provinces merged into the North Eastern Province. EPRLF and some other radical groups entered into mainstream politics and the elections were conducted for the newly created provincial council. EPRLF and its allies won the election with the help of Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). Perumal became chief minister on 10 December 1988. As the Chief Minister, Perumal created the Citizen Volunteer Force (CVF) which later known as Tamil National Army to enforce law and order in the province. CVF consisted of ex cadres of PLOTE and TELO, trained by Indian government. Perumal said that the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) would not be needed in the province. On 1 March 1990, when India was ready to withdraw their forces, Perumal put forward a 19 point demand list to resolve the conflict and threatened to pass a resolution in the council to declare independence for Eelam if the demands were not met. After his demand, Sri Lankan government dissolved the provincial council and imposed the direct rule on it. After the failed attempt, Perumal self-exiled to India. Perumal opposed LTTE and its leader V. Prabhakaran. LTTE called him as a traitor and tried to kill him.

It is a fanciful depiction of the Roman festival Veneralia celebrated in honor of Venus Verticordia. Influences Rubens. The Worship of Venus (after Titian). c. 1630s. Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. =Titian and Philostratus= Rubens thought highly of Titian and made a copy of the Venetian master's The Worship of Venus which remained in Rubens' private collection until his death. Titian's work, in turn, was based on the Imagines of the sophist Philostratus of Lemnos. The Imagines consisted of a series of descriptions of ancient paintings presumably decorating a third-century villa near Naples. In the description entitled Cupids (Erotes), Philostratus portrays a \\"swarm\\" of cupids in a fragrant garden gathering apples, kissing the apples and throwing them back and forth, engaging in archery using themselves as targets since the arrows are arrows of love, wrestling, and chasing a hare (a symbol of fertility). While the cupids are cavorting, nymphs are attending to a statue of Venus that is garnished with a silver mirror, gilded sandals, and golden brooches. Both Titian and Rubens in his copy depict most of this activity in great detail. =Ovid= The fourth book (April) of Ovid's Fasti also served as inspiration for Rubens' The Feast of Venus. A portion of the poem describes a women's festival held on April 1 to honor both Venus Verticordia and Fortuna Virilis. Per Ovid, the festival includes the washing and decoration of a statue of Venus, ritual bathing under boughs of myrtle, and offerings of incense to Fortuna Virilis so that the goddess may hide physical blemishes from the eyes of men. The work, not always corroborated by other sources, portrays a somewhat conflicted account of the festival that blurs distinctions between class and the rite's purpose. Primarily, the cult was intended to turn a woman's heart from lust (libidine) to chastity (pudicitia) so that she may retain her \\"beauty, virtue and good repute.\\" However, in addition to brides and mothers, Ovid includes \\"you who must not wear the headbands and long robes\\". This is a euphemistic reference to prostitutes (meretrices) who were not allowed to wear the hairstyle and clothes of a respectable matron. Instead, they wore a short tunic and toga. Prostitutes were not being asked to embrace chastity, so their participation must have served other purposes. Composition Detail of dancing nymphs and satyrs. The nymph on the far left was modeled by Rubens' wife Helena. Rubens combined key elements of Imagines and Fasti along with details of his own invention to create a spirited allegory of conjugal bliss where \\"voluptuous sensuality is joined and enhanced by the propriety of marriage.\\" A statue of Venus Verticordia in a pudica pose is the focal point of the work. She is surrounded by attendants who, in turn, are encircled by dancing and cavorting cupids, satyrs, nymphs, and maenads. Rubens includes all three of Ovid's classes of women in his work. The well-clothed matrons are shown performing rites. One washes the statue while the other, in an attitude of prayer, offers incense from a flaming tripod to Fortuna Virilis. The sea of dancing cupids has momentarily parted to allow two eager brides bearing dolls as offerings to rush to the goddess. The prostitutes are also present. Naked except for fluttering draperies, they stand at the foot of Venus. One clutches a comb while holding up a mirror so that the goddess can view herself. The temple of Venus is shown in the background behind a grotto in which a stream of water cascades into an overflowing basin. Rubens does not depict any of the celebrants ritually bathing as described by Ovid, but the basin in the grotto alludes to that practice. Rubens, like Titian, filled his canvas with a swarm of frisky cupids. Rubens applied his own distinct details to the amoretti, however. Some of them are depicted as females without wings. Art historian Philipp Fehl has postulated the amorous couple in the right foreground accompanied by two pairs of doves represents Cupid and Psyche, highlighting how marriage enriches love. Another winged cupid lowers a wreath of roses over the head of Venus in accordance with Ovid: \\"Now she’s given fresh flowers, and new-sprung roses.\\" The remainder of the cupids who are not dancing are collecting the apples of Venus as described by Philostratus as well as sheaves of wheat and clusters of grapes. The wheat and grapes are attributes of Ceres and Bacchus respectively and the gods they represent are shown as seated statues over the grotto. This detail adds to the lustful nature of Rubens' portrayal since a well-known adage immortalized in a play by Terence states: sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus (without food and wine, love grows cold). The frolicking nymphs and satyrs in front of the grotto are a bacchanalian representation of pure erotic desire. Rubens used his young wife Helena Fourment as the model for the nymph on the far left. She is being held aloft by a leering satyr as she lewdly clutches his horns and stares out of the canvas with a knowing look.

Mordvin Neopaganism, or the Mordvin native religion or Erzyan native religion, is the modern revival of the ethnic religion of the Mordvins (Erzya and Moksha), peoples of Volga Finnic ethnic stock dwelling in the republic of Mordovia within Russia, or in bordering lands of Russia. The religion is often called Mastorava (Mordvin for: \\"Mother Earth\\"), from the homonymous epic poem or the mother goddess of the Mordvin pantheon. The name of the originating god according to the Mordvin tradition is Ineshkipaz. The Mordvins have been almost fully Christianised since the times of Kievan Rus', although Pagan customs were preserved in the folklore and a few villages completely preserved the native faith at least until further missionary activities of the Russian Orthodox Church in the 17th century and in the early 20th century.Filatov, Sergei; Shchipkov, Aleksandr. \\"Religious Developments among the Volga Nations as a Model for the Russian Federation\\".

History The revival of the Mordvin native religion has grown alongside, and with the support, of Mordvin nationalism which started in the last years of the Soviet regime.Filatov, Shchipkov. p. 236. The revival of the national consciousness of the Mordvins was difficult at first, since they were a minority in their country and the press, which was very influential, took a tough communist line. The Russian democrats and communists were hostile towards Mordvin nationalists. At the start of the perestroika the Mordvin national intelligentsia waged a vigorous and successful campaign against Russian Orthodoxy, called \\"the religion of occupation\\", \\"the Russifying ideological force\\". Later the Saransk Ministry of Culture endorsed the revival of Mordvin culture and Paganism, arousing outcry from local Orthodox bishops. This was the circle that produced the first Neopagans, the Mastorava organisation led by the local poet Raisa Kemaikina, a group within the Saransk intelligentsia whose aim was the complete reconstruction of a Pagan worldview and religious services reworking folkloric, ethnographic and linguistic study. =Mastorava - Mordovian Society for National Rebirth= The Mastorava organisation was established in 1990 with the aim of \\"restoring the Moksha and Erzya ethnic communities\\", also fostering a revival of Paganism.

The Erzyan Mastor (Erzya for: \\"Erzyan Land\\") is a more recent organisation splintering from the Mastorava association. At first it was headed by Raisa Kemaikina. The group is focused on the Erzya (excluding the Moksha people), has political aims for the spread of Mordvin-Erzya Paganism, and is militant against Christianity.Erzyan Mastor website: Christianisation. In 1992 Kemaikina released the following declarations to the Chuvash newspaper Atlas, answering to a question about her attitude towards Christianity: In 1992 Kemaikina organised the first Pagan national ritual after decades or even centuries, sponsored by Mordovian businessmen.Filatov, Shchipkov. p. 237. Neighbouring villages learned long-forgotten Pagan prayers and Kemaikina was proclaimed the first priestess of the Erzya people. Television reports of that and following national worship ceremonies caused enthusiasm throughout the republic, and now the \\"Pagan question\\" is discussed from the remotest villages to university auditoria.

It is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., part of the Samuel H. Kress Collection. It was commissioned by Marchese Giacomo Massimiliano Doria of Genoa and shows his wife (and cousin) shortly after their wedding in 1605; she came from the equally prominent Spinola family. He died in 1613 and she remarried another Doria. It has been trimmed several times on each side, removing the garden shown in the background and the lower part of the figure. Description The overall dimensions of the painting are now after the original was reduced in size during the 19th century. Rubens completed a pen and brown ink study for the painting, which is held in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, enabling identification of sections eliminated. Details removed include the bottom of the Marchesa's floor-length wedding gown as the painting has been cut just below her knees and the architecture that formed the backdrop. Writing in The Burlington Magazine in 1951, Christopher Norris indicated the sketch portrayed a woman older than the 22-year-old Marchesa. In the painting the Marchesa is placed in an opulent setting to convey luxury; adorned with jewels, she wears a satin and lace dress, with a broad ruff round her neck. Light is used to emphasise the draping of her bulky wedding gown, while she looks down on the viewer, establishing the necessity to hang the finished portrait above the height of viewers. Provenance and exhibitions Marquess Giacomo Massimiliano Doria commissioned the portrait of his bride – they married on 9 July 1605 – and the painting remained in his ownership until his death in 1613 when it passed to his brother, Giovanni Carlo Doria (1576–1625). It subsequently became the property of Marchessa Brigida Spinola-Doria's second husband, probably in 1625, passing back to the Marchesa until her death in 1661. It remained in the family until given to relatives of Rati Opizzone. By 1848 it was held in Paris by Simon Horsín-Déon. Four years later, in 1854, the portrait was in London and sold several times before being purchased by the Samuel H. Kress foundation in 1957 who donated it to the National Gallery of Art in 1961. First exhibited in 1952 at the Minneapolis Institute of Art when it was likely in the ownership of the Duveen Brothers, it was also displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1953. Since 1961 it has regularly been featured in exhibitions.

Bra. Career =Juventus= Born in Turin, Piedmont, Corticchia started his career at Serie A and hometown club Juventus F.C.. He was a member of the under-17 team in 2009–10 season. That season he was cautioned four times, thus suspended once; In the play-off round he was sent off once for the runner-up. Corticchia was the member of under-20 reserve from 2010 to 2012. Corticchia also received first team call-up in 2010–11 season from head coach Luigi Delneri. Corticchia played once for Juve in friendly in 2011–12 season, under coach Antonio Conte. Since 2012 Lega Serie A changed the age limit of the reserve to under-19, co-currently Corticchia moved to Italian third division club Carrarese along with Francesco Margiotta and Raffaele Alcibiade. Corticchia played 10 times in 2012–13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione, half of them were included in starting eleven. =Vicenza= On 31 January 2013, Juventus sold Corticchia (for €0.6M) and Salvatore D'Elia (for €0.4M) to Serie B struggler Vicenza Calcio in definitive deal, co-currently Juve also signed youngster Michele Cavion from Vicenza for €1 million. D'Elia was remained in Venezia, while Corticchia was immediately left for Vicenza. Carrarese also sent Alcibiade back to Juve (who went to Hungary soon after) and signed Cavion in temporary deal in return. The deal made Juventus had a selling profit of €877,000 for 2012–13 season, which would counter-weight by the amortization expense of Cavion's accounting value of €984,000 equally divided from 31 January 2013 to 30 June 2017 (€222,800 per season and €92,800 in 2012–13 season), as well as speculative resold value of Cavion in the future. On Vicenza side, the club also had a short-term revenue of €1M to improve its worse financial condition but further damaged in the future by the additional amortization expense created by the signing of Corticchia and D'Elia as well as speculative player performance for the club. Corticchia was awarded no.16 shirt for the first team. Corticchia played once for Vicenza in 2012–13 Serie B, on 13 April 2013 against Novara Calcio. He replaced Nicola Rigoni in the last minute, which Novara already secured the win by 3–1. Vicenza relegated at the end of season and almost failed to register for 2013–14 Lega Pro Prima Divisione due to financial reason. After Vicenza submitted the supplementary documents, Corticchia and D'Elia received call-up to the pre-season camp. Corticchia played few times in friendlies. However, Corticchia was on the bench in the opening match of the season, the first round of 2013–14 Coppa Italia. Due to the injury of Giovanni Sbrissa, Corticchia made his competitive debut of the season against Varese in the second round of the cup. On 28 August 2014 he was signed by Como in a temporary deal. On 20 September 2015 Corticchia was signed by Savona F.B.C. On 1 February 2016 Corticchia was signed by Paganese in a temporary deal. On 11 August 2016 Corticchia was released by Vicenza. His contract with Vicenza was due to expire on 30 June 2017.

Influenced by the Greek play, Prometheus:The Friend of Man, Peter Paul Rubens completed this painting in his studio with collaboration from Frans Snyders, who rendered the eagle. It remained in his possession from 1612 to 1618, when it was traded in a group of paintings completed by Rubens, to Englishmen Sir Dudley Carleton in exchange for his collection of classical statues. This work is currently in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Pennsylvania.  History  In 1582, Peter Paul Rubens first apprenticed with a distant relative, Tobias Verhaecht, a landscape painter. Rubens spent a short time in his studio, learning the basics of composing a landscape. These lessons would influence his work, including Prometheus Bound, as the backgrounds of many of his paintings play an important role in the composition. Rubens then apprenticed for four years with Adam van Noort, a portrait painter, known for painting mythological scenes with plentiful nudes and unrestrained images of Flemish life. Before starting his own studio, Rubens worked with Otto van Veen, from 1594 to 1598. Here, Rubens learned composition and the iconography of history painting, demonstrated in Prometheus Bound with the foreshortened figure positioned close to the viewer and the use of iconography derived from an ancient Greek play. In 1610, Rubens opened a studio of his own in Antwerp, while also serving as court painter to the Archduke and Archduchess in Brussels. In the same period as Prometheus Bound, Rubens was also painting The Descent from the Cross, a commissioned altarpiece.alt= = Collaboration with Frans Snyders = After setting up his own studio, Peter Paul Rubens had many important commissions. He collaborated with artists that were regarded as masters in their field of study. For Prometheus Bound, Rubens collaborated with Frans Snyders, a master of animal and hunting scenes, for the eagle.  Source Material  Prometheus Bound, a Greek play attributed to Aeschylus, but thought to have been completed by another after Aeschylus' death in 456 B.C. It is possible that Prometheus Bound is the second play written by Aeschylus in a connected trilogy, followed by Prometheus lyomenos (Prometheus Unbound), of which only a few fragments have survived. In the play, Prometheus, the Titan, had assisted Zeus in establishing rule over Cronus and the other Titans, but infuriated Zeus by becoming the champion of mortals and giving them fire and the arts. In the opening of the play, Zeus ordered Hephaestus, Kratos (Power) and Bia (Force) to nail Prometheus to a high rock in Caucasus, to suffer torment as long as Zeus wishes. Prometheus's punishment is for stealing fire from Mount Olympus to give to humanity. Zeus, the King of Olympians, ordered Prometheus to be chained to a rock and suffer torment, by having an eagle devour Prometheus's perpetually regenerating liver everyday. Peter Paul Rubens would have used these Greek influences to carry out his own interpretation of the story. When he painted a classic or mythological subject, he was glorifying human creation, expressing his own joy at the beauty of the world. In Prometheus Bound, he depicts a suffering victim, Prometheus, but also the beauty of the Eagle causing the torment.  Interpretation  In Rubens's interpretation, the enormous eagle's beak rips open Prometheus's torso, exposing bloody entrails. The eagle's talons gouge into Prometheus's right eye, while his left eye is focused on the predator, indicating that he is aware of his torture. Agony is conveyed in his clenched fists, writhing legs, and tousled hair. The liver was chosen as the source for torture, as Greeks regarded the liver as intelligence, soul, and the seat of life. The art of Rubens is related to the attitudes expressed by his brother Philip and his teacher Justus Lipsius regarding the Counter Reformation. They studied Greek and Roman writing and ideas, but saw pagan mythology as an indirect tribute to the power of the Christians' one God. A poem written by Lipsius, a professor and friend of Rubens's brother Philip, describes the intended response of the viewer: > Here, with hooked beak, a monstrous vulture digs about in the liver of > Prometheus, who is given no peace from his torments as ever and again the > savage bird draws near his self-renewing breast and attacks it punishingly. > He is not content with his inhuman sacrificial feast, but with his claws > lacerates, here the agonized face, there the man's thigh. He would fly > murderously on the spectators, did not his chained prey detain him. He can > do no more that terrify the frightened onlookers by turning his flaming eyes > from one to the other. Blood flows from the chest and every part where his > claws leave their mark, and his piercing eyes dart savage flames. You might > think that he moves, that his feathers tremble. Horror grips the onlookers.  Rubens's Influences  = Rome = Peter Paul Rubens - The Entombment (after Caravaggio) Rome was in the height of the Catholic Revival, as Rubens spent countless hours making studies from figures painted by Michelangelo, in the Sistine Chapel. Rubens's Prometheus Bound was influenced by the dense musculature and broad frame by Michelangelo. Also in Rome at this time was Caravaggio, at the height of his career. Although, it was unlikely that the two painters never met, Rubens was impressed by his paintings, even copying some of them. Even though he had a turbulent life, Caravaggio mastered the used of tenebrism, the dramatic balance of light and dark, often used to highlight the figures. = Venice = When he arrived in Venice in June 1600, the city's art scene was flourishing. Titian, regarded as one of the greatest painters, had died in 1576, one year before Rubens was born. Titian's popularity survived in Venice and Rubens studied his mastery of form, intense coloring, strong and fluid lines, and his power of imagination. Rubens also visited the Doges' Palace in Venice, which contained ceilings and walls enhanced by paintings of Christian visions and pagan allegories. = Florence = Rubens was given the opportunity to travel to Florence in October 1600 for the wedding of Marie de' Medici, bride to the Henry IV of France. During this time, Rubens visited sites containing important Renaissance works, including the Church of San Lorenzo, which held the Medici tombs by Michelangelo. He also studied the work of Ludovico Cigoli, a painter who digressed from the contorted affectation of Mannerist art.  Provenance  Known for its strong emotional response, Prometheus Bound stayed in Rubens's possession from its completion in 1612. The first recorded sale of Prometheus Bound was to the English collector Sir Dudley Carleton, in 1618. Carleton offered to trade Rubens his collection of classical statues, for a large group of paintings from Rubens's workshop, which had been overseen, or at least, finished by Rubens himself. To prove he worked on Prometheus Bound by his own hand, Rubens wrote in a letter to Carleton: > A Prometheus bound on Mount Caucasus, with an eagle which packs his liver. > Original by my own hand, and the eagle done by Snyders. 500 florins.

Wardship and marriage Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, the King's brother-in-law. detail of a double wedding portrait attributed to Jan Gossaert, c. 1516. Brandon was granted the wardship of Roger Corbet after the death of Sir Robert. Roger Corbet was about twelve when his father died and his wardship became a commodity to be sold by the Crown. The History of Parliament avers that his wardship was bought by Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, a close friend of Henry VIII, and that it was probably he who arranged Roger's marriage to Anne Windsor, the daughter of Andrew Windsor, 1st Baron Windsor. The family historian Augusta Corbet documents the Brandon wardship.Corbet, Augusta Elizabeth Brickdale: The family of Corbet; its life and times, Volume 2, p. 263 at Open Library, Internet Archive, accessed July 2013. There is also a record of Brandon appointing George Onslow as steward of the Shropshire estates in February 1514. However, Brandon cannot have held the wardship for long. It is known that Andrew Windsor himself bought the wardship from the executors of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, probably in 1514, because a legal wrangle arose 42 years later between Windsor's executors and Robert Wingfield, son of Oxford's executor, Humphrey Wingfield.Bill of complaint of Lord Windsor et al, dated 1556–58 from the National Archives, C 1/1485/58, available at The Oxford Authorship Site, accessed July 2013. The issue is clouded by the fact that Oxford died a month before Sir Robert Corbet, so can never have been Roger's guardian. The connection seems to be Humphry Wingfield himself, who was Brandon's cousin, and a lawyer for both him and the de Veres.S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509–1558 – WINGFIELD, Humphrey (Author: John Pound), accessed August 2013 The details are obscure but he appears to have engineered the transfer of the wardship to Windsor via the estate of the earl of Oxford. His son claimed that the payment of 950 marks was never completed, to his own detriment, and Windsor's executors could not produce a receipt. However, they denounced Robert Wingfield's claims as merely vexatious, \\"contrary to all right, equity & good conscience\\", in a complaint to Nicholas Heath, the Lord Chancellor. Both sides, however, accepted that the purchase agreement was between Andrew Windsor and the earl's executors. Having acquired the wardship and marriage of Roger Corbet, Andrew Windsor arranged his marriage to his own daughter, Anne, by 1522. Windsor was very rich because he was deeply embedded in the mechanisms of power at Court. As Keeper of the Great Wardrobe to Henry VII of England, he had responsibility for an annual budget running into thousands of poundsPenn, Thomas (2011): Winter King: the Dawn of Tudor England, Penguin Books, p. 169, and was an important part of the network of his cousin, the notorious Edmund Dudley. He had survived Dudley's fall to continue in office under Henry VIII. He therefore had influence he could use on his son-in-law's behalf. Landowner Corbet obtained livery, i.e. took full possession, of his inheritance on 22 October 1522. Corbet's seat was Moreton Corbet Castle, Shropshire. The Corbets buried their dead in the parish church of St Bartholomew, just to the north of the castle. In Buckinghamshire he had the manors of Cublington and Linslade (now in Bedfordshire. Half of Cublington had been inherited by Roger's grandmother, Elizabeth Lucy.Page, William (editor) (1925): Victoria County History: Buckinghamshire, Volume 3, Cublington at British History Online, accessed July 2013 The Corbets seem to have acquired the other half as a result of its successive owners being attainted during the Wars of the Roses and saw off a legal attempt to regain it by Nicholas Vaux, 1st Baron Vaux of Harrowden in 1500. Roger was able to settle it on himself and his wife in 1525. Linslade was another former Lucy property that descended with Cublington.Page, William (editor) (1925): Victoria County History: Buckinghamshire, Volume 3, Linslade at British History Online, accessed July 2013 Roger also inherited land from the Arcedekne family in Cornwall, including an estate near Truro. In Warwickshire Corbet held the manor of Harborough Magna,Salzman, L.F. (editor) (1951): Victoria County History: Warwickshire, Volume 6, Harborough Magna at British History Online, accessed August 2013 acquired by his great-grandfather, also called Roger. In Hertfordshire he held Wigginton, part of the Lucy inheritance.Page, William (editor) (1908): Victoria County History: Hertfordshire, Volume 2, Wigginton at British History Online, accessed August 2013 Corbet became prominent both in Shropshire, his family's traditional focus, and in Buckinghamshire, where Windsor was particularly influential. He occupied the customary offices of county gentry. He was pricked to be High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1529. In 1532 he was made a justice of the Peace in Buckinghamshire and in 1535 High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. In 1537 he was one of the three nominated for Sheriff but he was not selected. In November 1538 he was selected to be High Sheriff of Shropshire for the second time, but he died the following month. The three sons of Sir Robert Corbet are all shown armed on his tomb. The History of Parliament points out that Roger seems not to have gone to war: at least there is no indication that he took part in Suffolk's French campaign of 1523, part of the Italian War of 1521–26 – a campaign in which he might have been expected to participate. It appears that in 1536 he was summoned to take part in the suppression of the Lincolnshire Rebellion, but a countermanding letter arrived before he could respond, as the rebels had already been defeated.Corbet, Augusta Elizabeth Brickdale: The family of Corbet; its life and times, Volume 2, p. 267 at Open Library, Internet Archive, accessed July 2013. Lacking military experience and dying young, Corbet never achieved a knighthood. Member of Parliament It is possible that Corbet sat in the House of Commons of England in the parliament of 1523, the first called after the end of his wardship. However, the records of the membership of this parliament are largely lost. In 1529 he was elected as first member for Truro, the borough nearest his main Cornish estate. His colleague was John Thomas, a Yeoman of the Guard who was prominent at Court.S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509–1558 – THOMAS, John I (Author: J. J. Goring), accessed August 2013 Truro was a small town, although election returns of the period seem to indicate a wide electorate.S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509–1558 – Truro (Author: J. J. Goring), accessed August 2013 In 1533 Thomas Cromwell noted a vacancy at Truro, but this is thought to be a mistake for Lostwithiel, the next constituency on his list. The English Reformation Parliament elected in 1529 was unusually long-lived. It dealt with Henry VIII's marriage and succession problems and all their consequences: the Statute in Restraint of Appeals, which broke with Rome, the Acts of Supremacy, the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535. At the Parliament's dissolution in 1536, the king asked electors to return the same members, wherever possible, to continue the work. So Corbet probably sat again for Truro in the parliament of 1536, which lasted for less than six weeks. Death When Corbet made his will on 27 November 1538, he declared that he was already \\"sick of body but whole of mind.\\"Will of Roger Corbet, dated 27 November 1538 and proved 1 February 1539 from the National Archives, PROB 11/27, f. 194, available at The Oxford Authorship Site, accessed July 2013. He provided for his wife, Anne, whom he made his sole executrix, and each of his children, as well as confirming the 100 marks for his sister Mary, as she was still unmarried. He provided for funeral garb for 13 poor men and 13 poor women, as well as for thirty gold rings, marked RC, to be given as mementoes to his friends. He asked that his \\"evidences\\" or personal effects from Linslade and from his room on the Strand to be brought to Moreton Corbet. He directed that his servants should receive their full year's wages or be compensated with his horses in lieu. Andrew, his eldest son, was still only 16, and he feared he too would endure a long wardship. :\\"I require and humbly beseech my supervisors and my executrix, tenderly lamenting the captive bondage of wardship, to consult together, pondering the readiest ways how to redeem my heir out of the thraldom and bondage of wardship, for whose marriage I was offered one thousand marks\\" Assuming the thousand marks materialised, he urged them to set aside the very large sum of three hundred marks each for his daughter's marriages. It was not to be: Andrew was forced into wardship, as his mother's will attests.Will of Anne Corbet, dated 22 September 1550 and proved 8 November 1551 from the National Archives, PROB 11/34, ff. 241-2, available at The Oxford Authorship Site, accessed July 2013. Roger Corbet died on 20 December 1538. Marriage and family Roger Corbet married by 1522 Anne Windsor, daughter of Sir Andrew Windsor, later 1st Lord Windsor, and of Elizabeth Blount.

The contract was expected to run until 2022. The former Westminster Council’s head of housing, the controversial councillor Jonathan Glanz said the organisation’s performance was the main reason for supporting the renewal of the contract. However, since renewal of the contract, CityWest Homes has not been without controversy, particularly over its management of the Hallfield Estate refurbishment. CityWest Homes also came in for criticism from its tenants regarding poor maintenance and failure to tackle antisocial behaviour. This was highlighted in a 2017 independent review of CityWest Homes by Campbell Tickell for Westminster City Council \\"that residents are being failed by CityWest Homes\\". CityWest Homes management of services and estates was progressively rolled back and returned to Westminster City Council management, this unwinding of the ALMO was given impetus when poor housing management of various council ALMO’s came into the media spotlight following the 2017 Grenfell tower block fire. In September 2018 The decision was taken to terminate CityWest Homes.

He was executed on April 24, 1650. Life Fleming was born into a family of potato farmers at Athlone. His mother and father leased the land at a rate of 15 shillings a year. They lived in a one-room house with Patrick and his eight siblings. At age 13, he went into service with Elizabeth Nugent, Countess of Kildare. He reportedly neglected his studies and displayed insolence, being discharged from her service. He was soon taken into household service by the Earl of Antrim. Fleming eventually fell out of favour after discovering the household priest sleeping in an obscene pose and bringing in other household staff as witnesses. The Earl, however, chose to believe the priest and discharged Patrick in disgrace. Before leaving, Patrick was alleged to have stolen money and items worth 200 pounds. He then fled to Athenrea, in the province of Connaught, hiding out for under two weeks until he felt safe enough to continue to Dublin. Fleming joined a house robbing gang and was reputed to have robbed more houses in the six years of operation than had ever been robbed in Dublin at the time. When his notoriety made it dangerous for him to remain in Dublin, he set out for the Bog of Allen, becoming a highwayman. He attacked both rich and poor alike, threatening his victims with death should they not cooperate. It is reported that he not only threatened death but killed or maimed some of those he had robbed. He also formed a gang in the Barnsmoor Mountain area near the Colorockedie woods, with them robbing over 125 men and women. Some of his gang members were captured and hanged. He was reputed to have robbed notable people of the time such as the Archbishop of Armagh and the Bishop of Raphoe as they traveled together in one coach. He also robbed the Archbishop of Tuam, reportedly taking 1,000 pounds from him. Fleming set upon Lady Baltimore who was traveling with her four-year-old son, who he kidnapped and demanded a ransom stating to her that if the ransom was not paid in 24 hours he would \\"cut the young puppy's throat and make a pie of him\\". Fleming was apprehended in Munster after robbing a nobleman of 250 pounds and transported to prison in Cork. He was able to escape from a chimney in the jail and avoided being hanged there. He continued for some years with some notably vicious robberies, reportedly murdering five men, two women and a boy of 14 years. He also maimed and injured others including Sir Donagh O'Brien, who resisted the robbery attempt and had his nose, lips and ears cut off by Fleming. Fleming was turned in to the authorities by the landlord of a house he and his accomplices frequented. The landlord soaked the gang's firearms with water prior to the sheriff arriving with his men to arrest Fleming and his cohorts. Fleming and fourteen of his men were taken to Dublin and hanged on April 24, 1650. His body was hanged in chains inside the city of Dublin. Legend Poems have been written about his exploits named The Ballad of Patrick Flemming or Patrick Flemmen he was a Valiant Soldier. These poems are said to be the foundation for the Irish ballad and much covered song Whiskey in the Jar.

These squalls develop most often between April and November and are steered east towards the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore by the southwesterly winds of the monsoons. The squall usually arrives during the pre dawn and early morning with strong wind gusts and thundery showers.Sumatras - National Environment AgencyAnalysis and prediction of Sumatra squall linesSquall Line - Malaysian Meteorological Department Theory  During the southwest monsoon, southwesterly winds pass over the mountains of Sumatra and creates mountain waves on the leeward side of the mountain thus creating an unstable atmosphere. As the atmosphere becomes highly unstable, the thunderstorms begin to merge into each other forming a squall line. This squall line is then steered by the southwesterly winds causing the storm to move northeastwards and moving into the Straits of Malacca. When this squall line moves offshore to the Straits of Malacca, it is usually night and thus, warmer air rising over the Straits of Malacca would cause the squall line to intensify. As the abundance of moisture over the Straits of Malacca condenses, it releases huge amounts of latent heat of condensation and this helps the squall line maintain its strength and intensify even more. This squall line then moves towards the coast of Peninsular Malaysia or Singapore. As this squall line moves inland, it is deprived of latent heat of condensation and hence, dissipates rapidly.

Instead of pursuing further studies abroad, Wong Pow Nee went to work as a clerk at the Bukit Mertajam Catholic Benevolent Society. In 1935, he took up a clerical position with the Sin Ban Guan Bus Company, but the company folded not long after and Wong Pow Nee embarked on a very different career. Between 1937 and 1941 he taught English at St. Mary's Mission School at Permatang Tinggi. In 1945 he taught English at Kim Sen Primary School in Bukit Mertajam. At the same time he enrolled in a Teachers Training Course from which he graduated in 1947.

He was a relatively unremarkable prince who was primarily known to be a crony of his older brother Yunsi. Life Born in the Aisin Gioro clan, Yin'e was the tenth son of the Kangxi Emperor. His mother was Noble Consort Wenxi (溫僖貴妃) from the Niohuru clan. Apart from the Crown Prince Yinreng, Yin'e had the most prestigious maternal family background among the Kangxi Emperor's sons. His maternal grandfather, Ebilun, served as one of the Four Regents to the Kangxi Emperor when the emperor was still underage. Besides, Yin'e's maternal aunt, Empress Xiaozhaoren, was the second empress consort of the Kangxi Emperor. Despite his background, Yin'e was not one of the most outstanding among the Kangxi Emperor's sons. In 1709, Yin'e was made a junwang (second-rank prince) under the title \\"Prince Dun of the Second Rank\\" (多羅敦郡王). In 1722, the Kangxi Emperor died and was succeeded by his fourth son, Yinzhen, who became historically known as the Yongzheng Emperor. To avoid naming taboo, the emperor's brothers had to change the character Yin (胤) in their names to Yun (允). Yin'e was thus renamed \\"Yun'e\\". In 1724, the Yongzheng Emperor accused Yun'e of siding with his eighth brother, Yunsi, who was one of the emperor's rivals in the power struggle over the succession to their father's throne. Yun'e was stripped of his princely title and placed under house arrest. Yun'e was released after the Qianlong Emperor came to the throne in 1735. The emperor rehabilitated Yun'e and restored him as a fuguo gong. Yun'e died of illness in 1741 and was given a funeral befitting a beizi. Former residence Yun'e's former residence, known as the \\"Prince Dun Mansion\\" (敦郡王府) or \\"Tenth Prince Mansion\\" (十王府), is located near the west entrance of Nanguanfang Hutong in the Shichahai area of Xicheng District, Beijing. It is located immediately due east of the Prince Gong Mansion. It is not clear if the buildings from the era still exist. It seems that the vicinity consists of commercial properties and a noodle shop.

A chronology proposed by Edwin Thiele suggests the battle would have taken place in around 913 BC.  Background  The friction all began when the late king Rehoboam increased the royal taxes throughout the Kingdom of Israel after Solomon died in about 931 BCE.http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings%2012:17-12:22&version;=NIV This created discontent among all the Israelite tribes of the kingdom, excepting Judah and Benjamin, and the people's discontent soon became a rebellion when the king, against the advice of the elders, refused to lessen the burdens of royal taxation., The ten northern tribes of Israel eventually broke up from the kingdom and made a new Kingdom of Israel with the former fugitive and exile Jeroboam as king, provoking a civil war. Rehoboam then went to war against the new kingdom with a force of 180,000 soldiers,, but was advised against fighting his brethren, so he returned to Jerusalem.,  Prelude  Ever since the unified kingdom was divided, there had been constant border issues between the two parties, and both attempted to settle them. Abijah succeeded to the throne after the death of his father Rehoboam, and attempted to reunite all of Israel, including Judah, under his rule. According to Biblical sources, Abijah had an army of 400,000, all of them handpicked or conscripted, and Jeroboam had 800,000 warriors.  Battle  Before the battle, Abijah addressed the armies of Israel, urging them to submit and to let the Kingdom of Israel be whole again. As written in the biblical narrative (2 Chronicles 13:4-12), Abijah then rallied his own troops with an address to all the people of Israel: Abijah's phrase \\"God is with us as our head (or leader)\\" became famous since that event. However, his plea to Jeroboam was not heeded. Jeroboam had set up an ambush to come from the rear of Abijah's army, so that the latter's army would be fighting on his army's front and rear, executing a giant pincer movement. All of the soldiers of Judah pleaded to God for help, and then the priests blew the trumpets. Abijah was quick in countering this move made by Jeroboam; he ordered his warriors to fight bravely and countered the pincer movement executed by Jeroboam to his warriors, almost utterly crushing the latter's huge army. The king Abijah and the warriors of Judah who were under his command had won the day, killing 500,000 Israelite warriors in the process. The rest of the Israelite army fled from the battlefield heading back north, and the forces of Judah then staged a relentless pursuit against them, taking the cities of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron during the ensuing pursuit. The factor for Judah's success in the battle is mainly attributed to Abijah and his troops' devotion to their God.  Aftermath  Jeroboam was crippled by this severe defeat to Abijah and thus posed little threat to the Kingdom of Judah for the rest of his reign; however, despite being victorious, Abijah also failed to reunify Israel and Judah. To conclude, despite the battle being decisive for both sides, this only deepened their division of each other, and these two kingdoms would be engaged in severe border wars for almost two centuries until the Kingdom of Israel's conquest and destruction by Assyria in 720 BC.

It offers a program of university level studies in the liberal arts. There is an option to earn a Bachelor of Arts in affiliation with Bishop's University.  History  TMI was founded in Montreal in 1945 by a group of people, most of them in their twenties, including Charlotte Tansey, Martin O'Hara, Stan Machnik, and Veronica Smyth.\\"Spirit of Girl in Twenties Spells Success for Adult Education Inst.\\", Manitoba Ensign, February 4, 1950.Lisa Fitterman, \\"Dedicated to the pursuit of lifelong learning: Founder of Thomas More Institute for Adult Education had fierce vision and passion for knowledge\\", The Globe and Mail, September 6, 2010. The aim was to provide opportunities for lifelong learning and liberal arts education for adults. In 1950, TMI established the Workers' School, which offered evening classes in \\"Human Rights and Labour Unions,\\" \\"The Rise of Labour Movements,\\" and \\"Talking at Meetings,\\" training workers to become union members. The Institute received a federal charter in 1959.\\"Thomas More Institute Gets Federal Charter\\", Montreal Gazette, May 20, 1959. Today, annually, the Institute has more than 400 registrations and 35-40 new courses. The adult students are of all ages, from those in their early 20s to several over 90 years of age.  Discussion Method  TMI’s teaching is inspired by the Socratic method as well as the Shared Inquiry approach developed by the Great Books Foundation, in which the leader uses primarily open-ended questions to guide discussion. Instead of conventional lectures, TMI for the most part offers discussion-based seminars that are guided by trained leaders and based upon carefully chosen and sequenced texts representing different perspectives on the questions each group has come together to explore. Although they may have special knowledge in a particular field, the leaders do not lecture or explain. Using the text as a basis, the discussion team asks questions to channel the conversation. Participants learn to listen to one another, so that each meeting allows people of varied ages and backgrounds to exchange their views on the week's readings. TMI’s approach requires critical thinking, clear references to common terms, and respect for alternate views. The challenge in TMI courses is not for students to agree, or come to a consensus, but to embrace new ways of thinking that go beyond individual bias.  Seniors' Outreach Program  In 1977, TMI launched an outreach program to take courses to seniors’ residences and centres in response to some of the Institute’s original discussion leaders and students no longer having the mobility to come to courses downtown. The program continues to organize discussion groups on history, literature, science, and other liberal arts topics in residences and meeting places of older adults throughout the Montreal area.  Lonergan  Bernard Lonergan, the Canadian philosopher, theologian, and economist, lectured at TMI, significantly shaping the learning and questioning experience offered by the Institute. According to Lonergan himself, the 1945 lecture series that he delivered at TMI, entitled \\"Thought and Reality,\\" served as the seed for his seminal book, Insight: A Study of Human Understanding (1957).\\"Thomas More Institute is 40 Years Old\\", Montreal Gazette, August 18, 1984.Frederick E. Crowe, Developing the Lonergan Legacy: Historical, Theoretical, and Existential Themes (University of Toronto Press, 2004), , p.44 & passim. Excerpts available at Google Books. TMI is also home to a large collection of Lonergan documents, including lecture notes and audio tapes, which are being digitized with the help of the Lonergan Research Institute. For many years, TMI organized a \\"Listening to Lonergan\\" lecture series during the autumn semester, co-sponsored by Concordia University and the Thomas More Research Institute.

Valerie Hobson played Anna in the original London West End production, and Marni Nixon (who sang the songs while Deborah Kerr lip-synced) in the 1956 film of The King and I. The song comes about after Anna and the King disagree about love's meaning; the King believes that love is a \\"silly complication of a pleasant simplicity\\" and a \\"fairy tale\\" while Anna believes that love is real and natural. They sing \\"The Song of the King\\" first. Anna then tries to explain the idea of romance in a simple way to the King and becomes caught up in her own experience of love at first sight at an English dance.

Wearing socks and sandals together is a controversial fashion combination and social phenomenon that is discussed in various countries and cultures. In some places it is considered a fashion faux pas.  History  The earliest known surviving pair of socks, created by naalbinding. The split toes were designed for use with sandals. Dating from 300–500, they were excavated from Oxyrhynchus on the Nile in Egypt. The earliest evidence of wearing socks and sandals is documented at the archaeological site between Dishforth and Leeming in North Yorkshire, England. The discovery suggests that old Romans wore socks with sandals at least 2,000 years ago.  Reception  Saurabh Bhatia, the author of the book Indian Corporate Etiquette, advises readers: \\"If, for some reason, you are not wearing socks with sandals, ensure your toes are clean and your toe-nails are closely clipped\\". Joshua Belter, the author of The Book of Rules: The Right Way to Do Everything, points out that wearing socks with sandals reduces the amount of cooling feet experience. However, energy design handbooks include light socks and sandals as part of a high-thermal flux tropical attire. =Regional phenomenon= According to Brian Shea of The Evening Sun, wearing socks and sandals is popular among the older generation and Germans. The Britons are, according to The China Post, \\"famed for fashion blunders like wearing socks with sandals\\". Wearing socks and sandals is considered rather unaesthetic in the Czech Republic; however, some people prefer socks and sandals, and a part of the population prefers both the options (sandals with and without socks). Socks and sandals is a regular Pacific Northwest phenomenon. Seattle based insurance company PEMCO used the \\"Sandals & Socks Guy\\" character as part of a 2007 advertising campaign that portrayed this as a typically Pacific Northwest fashion. The Daily Dot highlighted \\"sandals and socks\\" as a term entered into a web search engine more often by Washingtonians than residents of any other state. =Subculture phenomenon= Xbox Live avatar with socks and sandals Kyle Gass performing with Tenacious D while wearing socks and sandals Wearing socks and sandals is associated by some with geek culture. Socks and sandals were noted as a \\"high crime of fashion\\" when introduced as Xbox Live avatar accessory downloadable content in 2009. =2010s fashion trend= In 2010, the newspaper Daily Telegraph reported that wearing socks and sandals was a hit for spring/summer of that year. Starting in 2010, and again in 2014, several sources reported that socks and sandals had become a fashion trend in the United States and the United Kingdom, appearing in several runway shows, including those of Miu Miu (2010) and fashion designers Vivienne Tam and Mary- Kate and Ashley Olsen (2014), and picked up by celebrities.

Gustavus A. Palmer House is a historic residence in Crystal Lake, Illinois. History Gustavus A. Palmer was born in Nunda, New York in 1805. He was commissioned a colonel in the 205th New York Infantry for the Patriot War. In exchange for his service, the US government granted Palmer of land in McHenry County McHenry County, Illinois in 1845. Palmer purchased surrounding lands, bringing his total claim to . Because of his large claim, the area became known as Palmer's Corners. The ensuing county subdivision of Nunda Township was named after his hometown. Palmer was elected Judge of Elections for the township on June 5, 1850. He incorporated his holdings with the nearby Village of Crystal Lake to form the City of Crystal Lake. Palmer co-founded the Nunda Masonic Lodge on October 2, 1855. His house was built in 1858, designed by local architect Andrew Jackson Simon. When the lodge was destroyed in a fire in 1868, his house was used as a temporary lodge. Palmer's son John H. Palmer would become a major figure in the lodge, serving six stints as the lodge Master. Col. Palmer died of typhoid fever on December 19, 1884; his wife Henrietta had died from the same cause three days earlier. The building is now the home and museum of the Crystal Lake Historical Society. Architecture The Col. Gustavus A. Palmer House was built c. 1858 by local stonemason and architect Andrew Jackson Simon. Like Palmer, Simon had come to McHenry County from New York. The house is an eclectic blend of popular styles, dominated by Neoclassicism. The house is built with brick with a two-story front section and a one-and-a-half-story rear. Typical of the Federal Style, the house features broken pediment and a low-pitch gable. The gable features a dentilated cornice. Also typical of the style, the house features an off- center main entrance and large windows. Greek Revival influences are found in the heavy sills and limestone lintels surrounding doors, windows, and the water table. The foundation is a typical New England cobblestone masonry. The west elevation has an open air porch. The house has thirty windows—five on the south, ten on the west, one on the north, four on the east, and ten basement windows. The interior features plaster walls and southern yellow pine floors. There are no fireplaces. The first floor interior is a standardize style known as a sidehall. The floor is split into two large rooms that each feature a smaller room. The south side was the main entrance and featured the staircase. The rear featured access to the attic and basement. The second floor is not standardized, featuring five rooms and a closet.

The film stars Hayden Christensen, Jordana Brewster, Adrien Brody and Akon. It had its world premiere in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2014, and was released theatrically in Canada on July 24, 2015, by Mongrel Media. Plot James (Hayden Christensen), a man with nothing to lose, owes his life to his older brother Frankie (Adrien Brody), who took the rap for a crime they did together. While Frankie served time, James worked to turn his life around, he manages to get a job as a mechanic, and begins courting his girlfriend Emily (Jordana Brewster), a police dispatcher. Now, Frankie is released and back on the streets and pulls his brother into a heist to serve as wheel man. Initially James refuses. The heist is planned by Frankie's associates Sugar and Ray whose anti-banking rhetoric, violent streak, and elaborate planning have James unwilling to participate. He instead suggests the brothers break ties and flee. Frankie is unable to do this because he is indebted to his associates from his time in prison. During the beginning of his incarceration Frankie admits that he suffered sexual abuse and humiliation until he fell under the protection of Ray and Sugar, and alludes that he would likely not have survived without them. Frankie also informs James that he had mentioned Emily to them as their friendship developed, and alludes she may be in danger if James does not participate in the heist. The brothers spend the next few days bonding, and James tearfully ends his relationship with Emily, hoping to put distance between them. On the morning of the robbery, the crew is met by a fifth member, Spoonie, who helps initiate several distractions around the city. They then enter the bank planning to gain access to the vault with access codes obtained earlier. The heist proceeds as planned until an eyewitness walking towards the bank sees Frankie through a window and then notices James parked in a car. She flees to a nearby store to call the authorities. As sirens close in, James enters the bank to inform the group that they have less time than planned. As they begin to move Spoonie is nowhere to be found and it becomes apparent that he had taken the getaway vehicle and fled, stranding them in the bank as police take positions around it. As the group struggles to come up with a new plan, Frankie initiates a shootout with police, saving James' life and taking a bullet to the abdomen. As Sugar and Ray lay down suppressing fire, James breaks into a nearby car and hot wires it. The group takes a hostage and makes it to the car, but James returns to the bank when he realizes Frankie is being left behind. He discovers his brother contemplating suicide, and Frankie makes it clear he has no intention of going back to prison. The brothers stall for time as their associates are gunned down one by one as they flee the police. Seeing no other way out, Frankie attacks James, renders him unconscious, and proceeds to dress him in the clothes of a hostage. James regains consciousness just as Frankie exits the bank with him disguised as a hostage. Emily, working from the police dispatch center, looks on in disbelief as she recognizes a bloody James and unmasked Frankie. A police sniper kills Frankie on live news and James is ushered into an ambulance, where he attacks the paramedic and discretely makes an escape in the rain. As the paramedic regains consciousness and calls it in over the radio, the call is routed to Emily, who gets up and leaves her work station. James takes a moment to relax while he sits down on a trolley as the film ends.  Cast  * Hayden Christensen as James/Jimmy Kelly * Adrien Brody as Frankie Kelly * Jordana Brewster as Emily * Akon as Sugar * Tory Kittles as Ray * Luis Da Silva Jr. as Spoonie * Rachel Bilson as eyewitness Production Glacier Films produced the film within $10 million range.

Keithville came into existence when two railroads met on Keith properties in the early 1880s, the Texas and Pacific (T&P;) and the Houston-Shreveport, later part of the Southern Pacific.Perry Polk Keith: Caddo Pioneer, former Member of Legislature, Noted for Strong Qualities, Shreveport Times, February 7, 1935, p. 1 Background Keith was born near Macon, Georgia but settled in virgin territory in Caddo Parish when he was three months old with his parents, Henry David Keith and the former Mary Jones. On February 23, 1871, he married the former Narcissa Miller (died 1910) of Caddo Parish, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. I. W. Miller. Their children were William Henry Keith (1875-1951), Daniel Wesley Keith (1875-1929), Perry P. Keith, Jr. (1877-1941), David Keith (Perry's twin who died in infancy), Mary Slaughter Keith (1880-1931, never married), James Hardy Keith (born and died in 1883), Anna Beulah Keith Darby Cranfield (1885-1966, remarried after death of first husband) of Plaquemine, Louisiana, and Ray Cleveland Keith (died soon after birth in 1889). A Keith kinsman, Perry Roy Keith, Jr. (1924-1998), was a journalist who worked for both the defunct Shreveport Journal and The Shreveport Times. This Perry Keith, a son of Perry Keith, Sr. (1893-1932), and the former Rhoda Hunt (1899-1962), was the 1977-1978 commander of the Shreveport post of the American Legion. Political career A Democrat, Keith served in the state house from 1912 to 1928. In his first term from 1912 to 1916, he served alongside David B. Samuel, later a long-term Shreveport city judge, and Lee Emmett Thomas, the Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives from Caddo Parish and later from 1922 to 1930 the mayor of Shreveport. As a legislator, the taciturn Keith is believed to have made no speeches on the House floor during his entire tenure. Instead he became a \\"cue giver\\" whose judgment affected the votes of many of his colleagues on controversial issues. As chairman of the House Finance Committee during the administration of Governor John M. Parker from 1920 to 1924, Keith worked to maintain state finances on a sound footing and to treat all state agencies and commissions with fairness in regard to budgetary constraints. Prior to his legislative years, Keith served eight years each on the Caddo Parish School Board and the parish governing body called the \\"police jury,\\" since revamped as the Caddo Parish Commission. Personal life The Methodist Keith donated the land for construction of what is now the Keithville United Methodist Church at 11145 Old Mansfield Road. Construction was begun in 1904 by Tom Hudnall, and the first service was held on October 4 of that year. The dedication took place in December 1905. The church installed a brass bell in its steeple. Originally used on a locomotive, the bell came from a plantation in Coushatta in Red River Parish. Keith was also active in the Masonic lodge, the Shriners, and Woodmen of the World. Keith died at the age of eighty-seven after an illness of more than three months. Death came in the same modest house in which he had lived since 1854, when he was seven years of age. Services were held at the Keith residence, with ministers from Shreveport and Grand Cane officiating. Interment was at Keithville Cemetery.

The vessel is operated by the Bristol Packet Boat Trips company on pleasure and educational trips in the City Docks, on the River Avon to the Chequers Inn at Hanham Lock and Beese's Tea Gardens at Conham. Tower Belle was built in 1920 in Newcastle upon Tyne by Armstrong Whitworth, originally known as Wincomblee. In the 1950s and 1960s she worked in London, finally coming to Bristol in 1976. History Originally known as Wincomblee after a place in the Walker district of Newcastle, details of her early history are not known. She was operated by the Armstrong Whitworth company that built her, either as an executive launch or a company ferry for shipyard workers. In 1939 she was transferred to Newcastle City Council and was likely used as a ferry on the River Tyne during the Second World War. In 1946 she was moved to London and then commenced passenger services on the River Thames from Westminster Pier, downriver to Greenwich and up to Hampton Court. A single screw powered by diesel engine replaced the original steam powered twin screw arrangement. Her operators on the Thames were H G Hastings (1947–45), Thames Launches (1955–59) and, renamed Tower Belle, W R Witham (1960–76). In 1976 she was abandoned, no longer considered river-worthy, at Eel Pie Island in Twickenham. There she was found by the owner of the Bristol Packet Boat Trips company, which operated narrowboat harbour tours in Bristol City Docks. Tower Belle was brought by lorry to Bristol, sustaining further damage en route. After repairs she was re-launched into the docks in late 1976. Trips down the Avon Gorge, to Avonmouth and back were offered, in addition to journeys upriver to the Chequers Inn at Hanham and Beese's Tea Gardens. Private parties, sometimes with an on-board jazz band were also offered. In subsequent years, improvements to the vessel included the replacement of the wooden flooring with a more durable steel deck, and the addition of an electrical generator, enabling power for DJ parties and refrigeration for refreshments. In 2010, the 90th birthday of Tower Belle was celebrated with a special commemorative cruise which included the attendance of Lord Mayor Colin Smith, who cut a cake and said, \\"It is remarkable that this boat can still be around after 90 years and, with the renaissance in the city docks, that boats such as this have come back into huge popularity and add to the city's culture.\\" Technical information Tower Belle is powered by a diesel engine which drives a single propeller.

The first performance of the work was on February 1, 1724 in Naples, Italy, at Teatro San Bartolomeo. The first composer to set this libretto to music was Domenico Sarro, also known by the name Sarri, who also revised the work in 1730.Don Neville, Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \\"Impresario delle Canarie, L'\\" (The Impresario from the Canary Islands). The role of Dorina was first sung by the contralto Santa Marchesini, and Nibbio by the basso buffo singer Gioacchino Corrado.C. E. Troy, The Comic Intermezzo: a Study in the History of Eighteenth-Century Italian Opera, (Ann Arbor, 1979) Stefano Capone, L'opera comica Napoletana, Liguori editore, 2007, Later versions of this libretto appear with the titles L'impresario, L'impresario e la cantante and others.  Plot  The following is the plot as in the 1724 libretto. Later versions are different but all maintain the basic comic situation. Persons: Dorina, an opera singer; Nibbio, an impresario from the Canary Islands; maids, wardrobe assistants Part I (Dorina's House) to be performed between the first and second act of the opera Didone abbandonata. Dorina waits impatiently for the visit of a foreign impresario. She vents her frustration at her maid at not finding the appropriate audition piece which is modern enough and embellishes every word with ornamentation. Nibbio enters, and proves to be interested more in a conquest than in art. He tries to convince the reluctant Dorina to sing for him. Nibbio forces Dorina to listen to a self-composed Cantata, proving Nibbio to be a dilettante. Dorina, feigning another appointment, escapes. Sarro's Dorina e Nibbio at the Semperoper in Dresden with Pavol Kuban (Nibbio) and Gala El Hadidi (Dorina), Felice Venanzoni (conductor) Part II (A dressing room of a theatre) to be performed between the second and third act of the opera Didone abbandonata. Dorina is trying on a costume and upbraids her sloppy wardrobe assistants. Nibbio arrives. Dorina laments the hardships of performing before a harsh audience. Nibbio convinces Dorina to sing an excerpt from Cleopatra. While he applauds her performance, Nibbio is disappointed that the dramatic recitative sung by Dorina is not followed by an 'exit aria', such as the typically flashy 'butterfly' or 'ship' arias of the time. He promptly provides a live example of such an aria. Dorina hopes to get rid of Nibbio by listing preposterous demands for her contract (always leading roles of Prima Donna, librettos written by friends, a permanent supply of ice cream, coffee, chocolate and at least two presents weekly). She is even more suspicious of Nibbio's intentions when he accepts all her demands readily. The intermezzo ends without Nibbio having achieved his goal.  Reception  Sarro – Il sagrifizio di Jefte – title page L'impresario is Metastasio's single venture in this comic genre. Inspired possibly by Girolamo Gigli's La Dirindina (1715) and certainly by the composer Benedetto Marcello's tirade against the failing standards of operatic art in his Teatro alla Moda (1720),Gordana Lazarevich, Das neapolitanische Intermezzo, original essay, for programme book for the Stuttgart opera performances, pp. 12–40Franco Vazzoler, Metastasio \\"alla moda\\": L'impresario delle Canarie Metastasio takes the theme of opera performance one step further. In his letters he always complained of the sloppy and unartistic habits of singers, musicians, theatre-impresarios and others involved with opera production.Roger Savage, Staging an Opera: Letters from the Cesarian Poet, Early Music, Vol. 26, No. 4, Nov. 1998, pp. 583–595 In his intermezzo, Metastasio gives Dorina (representing the art as it should be) most of his biting criticism, while Nibbio gets to utter most of the foolish text (art as it is). Dorina complains about awful 'modern' composers that are only interested in ornamentation; Nibbio utters his belief that texts are not important, because an audience 'has lots to catch up on' during the performance, and could not care less about meaning.Kurt Ringger, Die Italienische Oper als Gegenstand von Parodie und Satire, in: Maehder, Stenzl, Perspektiven der Opernforschung, Bd. 1, Zwischen Operra buffa und melodrama Metastasio's text became wildly popular and was also composed by Tomaso Albinoni in 1725,Don Neville, \\"Metastasio, Pietro.\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.

Carlo Goldoni quotes many instances of this intermezzo in his Impresario from Smyrna as well as his La bella Veritá (1762).

While superficially the work is of the usual stock love and conquest genre, close inspection reveal it to be a profound look at the meaning of theater and especially musical theater of the time.\\"Semperoper Dresden, Domenico Sarro, Dorina e Nibbio, ed.

Around 120 people were killed, mainly due to landslides and mudslides.  Details and relief  The West Papua earthquake struck at 9:17 local time and measured 5.7 and 6.0 on the moment magnitude scale. Its epicenter was located south of Jayapura; the earthquake reached as far as Wamena. There were multiple aftershocks. The earthquake killed 120 people and left 120 injured; all of the dead were recovered from the villages of Holuon, Pasema, and Soba. Many of these deaths and injuries derived from landslides that covered two villages and disrupted sections of the Baliem River, practically flooding three villages and depositing tons of mud. One of these landslides was tall; there were eleven in total. A large portion of the dead consisted of Dhani tribesmen. Local authorities distributed food, blankets, clothing, and money to survivors. Helicopters supplied food and other relief supplies, but they were slowed by cracks in the local airstrips. More than 25 survivors were treated for severe injuries and another 100 for less grave maladies. Between two hundred and three-hundred people were evacuated in the aftermath of the tremor, and 3,500 Hupla people were resettled at a lower altitude, thus moving them from their traditional settlements.Tapol, pg. 22.  Geology  The focal mechanism for the earthquake demonstrated reverse faulting. The region around the epicenter has a history of powerful earthquakes.

They were from rural North Carolina and were the first female graduates of the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences (later Duke University) in 1878, well before the school formally admitted women. In 1885 they founded the Greenwood Female College in Greenwood, South Carolina.  Early life and family  The Giles sisters were born in Jones County, North Carolina to E.S.F. and Nancy White Giles. E.S.F. had been a minister of the Church of Christ, and a farmer.Gwynn, Zae Hargett. Records of Jones County, North Carolina, 1779-1868. Kingsport, TN: Kingsport Press, 1963. P. 478.

Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Duke University. and were working in Onslow County, when the rest of the family moved to Trinity. They joined the family in Trinity when their contracts expired.  Life in Trinity  Trinity College of Arts and Sciences (later Duke University) was located in Trinity, North Carolina, in rural Randolph County until 1892 when it moved to Durham (where it is located now). When the Giles sisters arrived, there was little to the community apart from the college. Trinity was an all- male college and remained so until 1892. In Trinity, Theresa, Mary, and Persis at first continued to teach in the local schools. Meanwhile, their younger brother, E.S.F., Jr. attended Trinity College. The sisters attempted to enroll when they arrived in town, but were not allowed. Mary later reflected on this moment, saying \\"Trinity was a male school and we were barred.\\"Wright, Margaret. \\"Misses Persis, Mary, and Theresa Giles Were First Women Graduates of Trinity College for Men—They Took a Diploma From a Man’s College When Such a Thing Just Simply Wasn’t Done.\\" Newspaper clipping in the Mary Zilpha Giles papers, Duke University Archives. Undated, unlabeled. Initially, the sisters had their younger brother tutor them in the evenings when he returned home. It soon became evident, however, that he would not be able to answer all of their questions, having just learned the material himself. Insistent on learning what their brother was, they contacted a neighbor and professor at Trinity, Lemuel Johnson, who agreed to tutor them after-hours. In turn, other professors at Trinity did the same, and taught them exactly the same lessons that the men at Trinity learned. They did attend one class with the men, metaphysics, taught by then-President Braxton Craven. When the sisters lost all of their savings following the collapse of a bank in Greensboro, they were forced to go back to teaching in order to raise the money to pay tuition for their tutors (they paid the same amount in tuition as the male students at Trinity paid). They each taught in surrounding communities four or five months, and took classes the remainder of the year. Mary Giles taught in Tarboro, North Carolina. By 1878, Theresa, Mary, and Persis had completed all of the requisite coursework at Trinity College. As such, they were allowed to stand for the comprehensive exams taken by all students wishing to graduate. They passed, and President Craven went on to submit their names—along with those of the male students who passed—to the Board of Trustees for consideration. On June 12, 1878, the Board of Trustees \\"recommended for full and regular graduation to the degree of Bachelor of Arts.\\"Minutes of the Board of Trustees, Trinity College, June 12, 1878. Duke University Archives, Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Duke University. As a result of this extraordinary measure, Theresa, Mary, and Persis Giles are considered the first female graduates of Duke University, despite never having been officially admitted or enrolled at Trinity.  Greenwood Female College  Together with their younger sister Sue, Persis, Mary, and Theresa Giles founded the Greenwood Female College in Greenwood, South Carolina in 1885, along with the Misses' Giles School for younger girls. Greenwood was chosen for two reasons: first, their brother, E.S.F., had set up a law practice in town. Second, Greenwood was, at the time, lacking any higher education facility. Over the next several decades, Mary, Theresa, and Persis Giles, along with the staff at the schools, educated hundreds of young women in the area. For the first time, the young ladies received an education that was as good as or better than that offered to the area's young men.  Travels and later life  The Giles sisters evidently considered travel an important part of their education, though they did not always enjoy it. They made several major trips abroad, including a trip made by Mary and Persis to Europe in 1889. They also eventually traveled to India with a Christian teacher’s organization. While traveling, the sisters wrote columns for newspapers in the Carolinas, including the Abbeville Press and Banner and the local Greenwood paper.  Legacy  A women’s dormitory was built in their honor at the Woman’s College at Duke University in 1927. It is now a dormitory housing 115 first-year students.

Duke Divinity School After serving as a Lutheran pastor for nine years, Lischer joined the faculty of Duke Divinity School. He has been interviewed on topics ranging from church liturgy to death, commenting frequently in the New York Times. He has participated in multiple NPR interviews, and in 2010 was a part of the PBS documentary \\"God in America,\\" where he provides background for the episode on the leadership of Martin Luther King, Jr. during the civil rights movement. He has also explored the interactions of preaching, politics, and literature, notably at Yale Divinity School in his Lyman Beecher Lectures on preaching and reconciliation, as well as in a prize-winning study of Martin Luther King, Jr., The Preacher King: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Word that Moved America, for which he was interviewed by Duke News in 2011. He was one of two keynote speakers at the first international symposium on homiletics held at Heidelberg University. In the classroom, he draws both on the church’s long tradition as well as the experience of contemporary preachers as resources for parish ministry. In 2000, he inaugurated Duke Divinity School’s first chair in preaching. Lischer has preached all over the world, most notably at the Washington National Cathedral, and regularly at Duke University Chapel. He is a former president of the Academy of Homiletics and the recipient of the Academy’s Lifetime Achievement Award. Memoir Although both a pastor and an academic, it is Lischer's recent memoir work that has received the most public attention. His first memoir is the story of his early ministry, Open Secrets: A Memoir of Faith and Discovery, and is set in middle-America in the early 1970s. It evokes the hidden dramas in a small country church and traces the painful learning curve of its inexperienced minister. Following the book’s publication in 2001, Lischer began a program of research and teaching in spiritual autobiography that has increasingly occupied the latter phases of his career. A second memoir, Stations of the Heart: Parting with a Son, commemorates his son, Adam, who died of cancer in 2005, for which Lischer received attention in national and regional press. Personal life Lischer graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 1967. He is currently married to Tracy Kenyon Lischer, a lawyer in Durham, North Carolina. They have a daughter, Sarah, who teaches political science at Wake Forest University, and three grandchildren. Publications Lischer has published more than a dozen books, including The Company of Preachers: Wisdom on Preaching from Augustine to the Present, which was awarded \\"Best Book in Ministry/Leadership\\" by Christianity Today. He is also regularly published in The Christian Century and his essays and opinion pieces have appeared in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Atlanta Journal Constitution, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Raleigh News and Observer, and the Durham (NC) Herald.

Description Odd Bodkins was highly philosophical in tone, and the book contains the strip's most idiosyncratic storylines. As an example of Odd Bodkins' content, a large part of the collection is an extended sequence in which the protagonists Fred and Hugh discover that the world is being terraformed by the brass horseman General Injuns in preparation for a Martian invasion. After revealing their knowledge, they are pursued by the General and various other characters symbolizing The Establishment, fleeing on Hugh's intelligent Norton motorcycle. They then encounter the ghost of Abraham Lincoln, referred to in the strip as Five Dollar Bill O'Brady, who reveals that Martians orchestrated his assassination. The group gives Norton the motorcycle a 'magic cookie' (an occasional plot device in the strip, probably symbolizing LSD) which allows the vehicle to leave Earth's orbit. After crash-landing on Mars, Fred, Hugh and Bill are hypnotized and lectured on political theory by the Martians, which Fred eventually rejects.

Restrepo was killed in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan, of neck wounds suffered when insurgents attacked his unit using small-arms fire. He was honored in Restrepo, nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 83rd Academy Awards. Early life and family Restrepo was born in Neiva, Huila, Colombia. His mother, Marcela Pardo, a physical therapist, named him after the composer Johann Sebastian Bach. He rarely saw his father Gerardo Restrepo Ramirez, a pediatric neurologist, after his parents separated when he was 2. He had an older brother named Ivan, and a younger brother, Pablo. In 1993, Pardo and her sons immigrated to the United States, first living in Miami Gardens, Florida. Two years later they moved to Pembroke Pines. Juan was very active in sports, boxing, playing soccer and skateboarding. He attended Charles W. Flanagan High School, graduating in 2004. He planned to be a doctor, like his father and grandfather. Unable to afford to go to college, Restrepo returned to Colombia, where he studied classical violin at the Luis A. Calvo Academy, District University of Bogotá. After getting a girl pregnant, he returned to the United States and enlisted in the military. He returned to Colombia for the birth of his daughter, Ariana. Military service In February 2006, Restrepo attended basic training at Fort Sill (Bravo Battery 1st Battalion 79th Field Artillery Regiment). In May 2006, he attended advanced individual training at Fort Sam Houston (Bravo/Charlie Company, 232nd Medical Battalion) before attending airborne school at Fort Benning. He went to Italy and Germany, where he did specialized medical training, before being deployed to the Korengal Valley in May 2007. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment (Airborne), 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team. A few months after he arrived, Restrepo's patrol was ambushed in the village of Aliabad. He lifted his head to see if anyone was injured, and took two bullets to the face and neck. He stayed semi-conscious, trying to instruct his fellow soldiers what to do for him. He was stable when he boarded the medevac helicopter, but died of wounds before arriving at the hospital. He was buried in Colombia. Restrepo His life and death, and the lives of his fellow soldiers as they carry on at OP Restrepo, are chronicled in the award-winning documentary Restrepo, by Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetherington, and its sequel, Korengal. The first documentary begins on a train in Italy with an enthusiastic Restrepo excited to go to Afghanistan; he dies shortly after the documentary begins. Restrepo's death hit his fellow soldiers hard. He was highly respected \\"because he was brave under fire and absolutely committed to the men. If you got sick he'd take your guard shift. If you were depressed he'd come to your hooch and play guitar. He took care of his men in every possible way,\\" Junger wrote. Two months after his death, his platoon built a new combat outpost near where he had died and named it OP Restrepo. OP Restrepo housed anywhere from 15 to 20 soldiers at a time during its two years of existence. It had no running water or electricity, but was essentially a shantytown constructed from tarp and plywood, and protected by giant bags of rocks. \\"When the boys built that base, the Taliban or the AAF forces in the valley, they were completely in shock. It was like a middle finger sticking out. And they realized once they could not knock off OP Restrepo, we had the upper hand. They started becoming afraid,\\" Capt. Dan Kearney says in Restrepo. Awards Restrepo was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Basic Parachutist Badge and the Combat Medical Badge.

Background The village of Alikianos () is located on a fertile plain near the north coast of Crete, approximately 12 km (7.5 mi) southwest of the city of Chania. During the Battle of Crete, Richard Heidrich's 3rd Fallschirmjäger Regiment (FJR 3) was ordered to land on the plain and advance northwest towards the Maleme airstrip,Kurowski, Franz. Jump into Hell: German Paratroopers in World War II, Stackpole Books, 2010, . one of the island's most strategic targets. Covering the rear of the 3rd Regiment was the 7th Engineer Battalion, dropped in the vicinity of Alikianos between the road to Chania and the bed of Keritis (, ancient Ιάρδανος, Iardanus) river and charged with the mission to conduct reconnaissance. The Engineer Battalion were confronted by the ill-armed and poorly trained 8th Greek Regiment, who were assisted by local irregulars. Despite being armed with primitive weapons, the locals attacked the Parachute Engineer Battalion inflicting on them significant losses.Antill, P. Crete 1941: Germany's lightning airborne assault. Campaign series. Oxford; New York: Osprey Publishing. 2005, . The area in and around Alikianos was the theater of a fierce battle that started on 21 May and lasted for seven days. The battle zone became known as Prison Valley owing to the presence of a prison farm that was its prominent building. The gallant defence of the 8th Greek Regiment and the local population is today credited with protecting the Allied line of retreat, making possible their safe withdrawal and subsequent evacuation from Sfakia.Stewart, I.

Penguin Books, 1992. The executions Infuriated by the involvement of the local population in resisting the invasion by German paratroopers and the heavy losses inflicted on them, Göring ordered General Student to launch collective punishment operations against the locals soon after the end of the Battle. Among other punitive measures, these operations prescribed summary executions.Stroud, R. Kidnap in Crete: The True Story of the Abduction of a Nazi General, Bloomsbury USA, 2015, p.48, =24 May 1941= On 24 May 1941, while the Battle of Crete was still being fought, a German patrol arrested 6 male civilians in Alikianos. Upon discovering the dead body of a paratrooper officer, the Germans killed the hostages by firing squad. One of the hostages, Vassilis Drakakis (Βασίλης Δρακακάκης), survived the execution and the following coup de grâce but was later arrested again and shot in the third execution on 1 August 1941. =2 June 1941= On 2 June 1941, Alikianos was surrounded by German forces. 42 male civilians were marched to the churchyard and shot in groups of ten in front of their relatives.Κανελλοπούλου, Ευγενία.

General Alexander Andrae, who succeeded Student as the Commander-in-Chief of Fortress Crete, continued Student's campaign of retaliations. Two months after the first execution, the Germans gathered 118 civilians at a bridge over the Keritis river near Alikianos and shot them after forcing them to dig their own graves. Twelve of those killed were from Alikianos whereas the rest came from the nearby villages Fournes (), Skines (Σκηνές), Vatolakos (Βατόλακκος), Koufo (Κουφό), Prases (Πρασές), Karanou (Καράνου), Lakkoi (Λάκκοι), Orthouni (Ορθούνι), Nea Roumata (Νέα Ρούματα) and Hosti (Χωστή).Kiriakopoulos, G.C.

In May 1947, he came before a military tribunal to answer charges of mistreatment and murder of prisoners of war by his forces in Crete. Greece's demand to have Student extradited was declined. Student was found guilty of three out of eight charges and sentenced to five years in prison. However, he was given a medical discharge and was released in 1948. Student was never tried for crimes against civilians. Andrae was captured by the British and then extradited to Greece to be tried for war crimes he was responsible for during his time in Crete. In 1947, he was condemned to four life sentences, but after spending four years in prison, he was released in January 1952.

The storms developed from the combination of a strong El Niño episode, a powerful jet stream, and an atmospheric river that opened from the West Pacific Ocean into the Western Seaboard. The storms shattered multiple records across the Western United States, with the sixth storm breaking records for the lowest recorded air pressure in multiple parts of California, which was also the most powerful winter storm to strike the Southwestern United States in 140 years. The fourth, fifth, and sixth storms spawned several tornadoes across California and Arizona, with at least 6 tornadoes reported in California (including one EF-1 tornado) and another tornado reported in Arizona; the storms also spawned multiple waterspouts off the coast of California. The storms dumped record amounts of rain and snow in the Western United States, and also brought hurricane-force winds to the U.S. West Coast, causing flooding and wind damage, as well as triggering blackouts across California that cut the power to more than 1.3 million customers. The storms killed at least 10 people, and caused more than $3 million (2010 USD) in damages. Meteorological History From January 14 to 15, 2010, six extratropical disturbances developed over the north Pacific, within a large trough of low pressure, from the waters south of the Aleutian Islands to the east coast of Japan. Strengthened by an atmospheric river, a powerful jet stream with winds reaching , and the most powerful El Niño event (the fourth- strongest one on record) since 1997–98, the storms quickly developed while accelerating eastward. On the afternoon of January 16, the first storm reached the Pacific Northwest. On the same day, a seventh, small cyclone developed to the northwest of the first storm, which looped northwestward into the Gulf of Alaska for a few days, before dissipating on January 19. The first storm moved ashore British Columbia on the afternoon of January 17, impacting the Pacific Northwest, before dissipating early on the next day, ending the first wave of storms. Satellite image of the third storm (the second storm to affect California) near peak intensity, on January 18 On the afternoon of January 17, the second storm, the first of five powerful storms to impact California, reached the West Coast of the United States, beginning a week of heavy rainfall and powerful gale-force winds. The storm was steered northeastward by a blocking ridge of high pressure over the Central United States, and made landfall on British Columbia on January 18, before dissipating late that day. As the second storm moved inland, the third storm arrived at the U.S. West Coast on January 18, bombing out and reaching a peak intensity of at 18:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. PST) that day. Afterward, the third storm weakened and stalled of the coast of the Pacific Northwest while the fourth storm approached, which reached the U.S. West Coast on January 19. The fourth storm began a small tornado outbreak in California on January 19, which would last until January 21, and the fourth storm also spawned four waterspouts off the coast of Southern California. On the afternoon of January 19, the National Weather Service issued two tornado warnings for San Diego County within hours of each other. The third storm absorbed the fourth storm on January 20, restrengthening somewhat in the process. The third storm then moved into the Gulf of Alaska for another few days, before dissipating on January 23. On January 20, the fifth storm, the fourth storm to affect California, reached the West Coast of the U.S., beginning the third and final wave of storms. The storm intensified as it neared the coast of Oregon, reaching a peak intensity of as it approached the coast of Northern California. The fifth storm then moved northward and weakened, stalling over the northeast Pacific for another several days, before being absorbed into another approaching extratropical cyclone late on January 24. Satellite image of the sixth storm (the fifth storm to affect California) at peak intensity on January 21, shortly before landfall On January 21, the sixth storm (the fifth and final storm to affect California) reached the West Coast of the U.S. The storm rapidly intensified as it approached California, reaching a peak intensity of that afternoon, just prior to making landfall on California near San Francisco. This made the storm the most powerful winter storm to strike the Southwestern United States in 140 years. The storm also tapped into the Pineapple Express, boosting the amount of moisture in the storm. The storm broke low pressure records across California and Oregon as it moved inland, with a minimum pressure of recorded in Eureka, California, and a minimum pressure of recorded in San Diego County. The storm also produced an EF-0 tornado in Ventura, California, as well as numerous waterspouts across Southern California. The powerful winter storm weakened as it moved inland, but continued to affect California until January 23. The ridge of high pressure previously stationed over the Central U.S. had broken down by then, allowing the powerful storm to move eastward across the mainland United States, with the storm expanding in size as it moved eastward. The sixth storm reached the Eastern United States on January 24, bringing rain and snow to the region. Over the next couple of days, the storm moved northeastward into Eastern Canada, becoming elongated during that time, with the southern part of the storm splitting off into a new winter storm. On January 27, the storm moved into the northern Hudson Bay and stalled, while gradually weakening. On January 28, the sixth storm was absorbed into another frontal storm approaching from the southwest. Impact From Sunday, January 17 to Saturday, January 23, 2010, a series of five very powerful winter storms bore down on Southern California, before moving eastward on January 22. On January 18, 23,000 customers in Southern California lost power for a short time, due to the flooding caused by one of the storms. On January 19, a woman was killed by a tree that fell on her home. On January 19, the fourth storm impacted Southern California, bringing flooding and powerful winds to Santee in San Diego County. On the afternoon of January 19, the National Weather Service issued two tornado warnings for San Diego County within hours of each other, as potentially tornadic thunderstorms crossed the area. As the fifth and second-strongest of the week's storms (impact-wise) slammed into California on January 20, officials predicted as much as four feet (1.2 meters) of snow would fall in Northern California. On the morning of January 20, more than 500 homes were evacuated as floods struck multiple regions in California, as up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in the storms that had impacted the state by that point. Rescue and flood prevention services soon brought the situation under control, but one man was killed when a tree fell onto his house. By then, flooding up to a feet deep had occurred in multiple areas, with Flash Flood Warnings remaining in effect for much of California. A sinkhole also opened up at an intersection in Ventura, which was expected to take days to fill in. Two horses also died after being hit by lighting in a Santa Barbara field. Rare tornado warnings were issued in parts of Southern California, including southern Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego County, and Anaheim. Flash flood watches covered Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. On January 20, an EF-0 tornado was reported in Southeastern San Diego County, which lasted for 1 minute, 30 seconds. On the same day, residents in Siskiyou County in Northern California lost power for 30 hours, due to wet, heavy snow taking down power lines. Jim Rouiller, the senior energy meteorologist at Planalytics Inc., said that the storms (particularly the sixth storm) were the worst series of storms the state had experienced since 1997 (when a series of powerful storms caused the New Year's Day 1997 Northern California Flood). On January 21, the sixth storm broke the record of the lowest pressure recorded in parts of California, as the sixth storm registered a minimum barometric pressure of in Eureka, California, breaking the previous record set in 1891; the storm also registered a reading of in San Diego County (the storm had a minimum central pressure of while it was in the Pacific, at about this time). Rouiller expected that evening's storm to bring from 4 to 12 inches of rain, severe mudslides, a few tornadoes, and heavy mountain snow ranging from 6 to 15 feet across the Sierra Nevada mountain range. California state water officials warned on January 21 that one week of heavy rain and snow was not enough to end the drought,Storms bring badly-needed rain which was entering its fourth year by 2010, though the precipitation from the storms had significantly reduced the severity of the drought. According to measurements on Thursday, January 21, the average water content of state's mountain ranges' snowpacks, considered the state's biggest de facto 'reservoir', was at 107% percent of normal capacity. On January 22, the sixth storm caused heavy rainfall in parts of Los Angeles, leading to additional flooding. 500 people were evacuated from a small village in La Paz County, Arizona due to a flash flood. Freshly-fallen snow blanketed the north side of the San Gabriel Mountains on the morning of January 23, 2010, northwest of Wrightwood, California, after the sixth storm had left. Snow was also reported in many parts of California. During that week, the storms dropped to of rain in Los Angeles. By the end of that week, the storms had cut the power to more than 1.3 million customers in Southern California, due to the powerful winds downing power lines. The storms also left a mess of trash and debris on the beaches of Southern California. On January 25, Mayor Liz Harris of the City of Big Bear Lake issued a state of emergency, due to the damage caused by the storm. In California, the storms dropped a maximum total of of rain in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, while a maximum total of of snow was recorded at Mammoth Lakes. The sixth storm brought sustained winds of to the Western U.S., equivalent to a low-end Category 1 hurricane, with wind gusts up to recorded in Ajo, Arizona. In Arizona, the storms dropped a maximum total of of snow at Flagstaff. In Yavapai County, floodwaters swept a child to his death. Near Wikieup, the Big Sandy River crested at , breaking the previous record of previously set in Match 1978. The sixth storm brought snow across the Great Plains, and even as far east as parts of both Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Overall, the storms killed at least 10 people across the United States and caused more than $3 million in damages. =Tornadoes= The storm systems triggered an outbreak of weak tornadoes between Santa Barbara and San Diego Counties in Southern California on January 19, which continued into January 21. EF1 damage was reported to the Huntington Beach harbor area in Orange County, and in Santa Barbara County, a local radio station reported that a sheriff's deputy had sighted a possible tornado, with roof damage near the Ocean Meadow Golf Course. A third tornado was reported by the public in Orange County, with cars overturned on the Pacific Coast Highway and roof damage in the area. Additional tornadoes and waterspouts were reported from another storm system on January 21, with damage reported in Blythe, California and Santa Barbara, California. The storms spawned a total of 7 tornadoes, including one EF-1 tornado.

Gameplay Deep Down is a single-player or (up to four player) co-op multiplayer dungeon crawl. Gameplay has been described as similar to both Capcom's own Dragon's Dogma; as well as the Dark Souls series, though with a lesser difficulty. The historical sections of the game take place in a medieval/fantasy setting in procedurally generated dungeons, with the player equipped with suits of armor, swords, pikes, shields etc. Creatures encountered are from the fantasy trope, including ogres, shapeshifters similar to mimics (D&D;), and dragons. Plot The player perspective for Deep Down begins in New York City in the year 2094. The story focuses on a member of a group known as the \\"Ravens\\" who has the ability to recover historical memories by touching ancient objects. This 'Raven' is brought into contact with excavated objects from a mysterious civilization in Bohemia (Czech Republic) dating from the 15th century and are asked to use their abilities to explore the city and discover its secrets. Development At the February 20, 2013 PlayStation Meeting where Sony debuted the PlayStation 4, Capcom's Yoshinori Ono, best known for his work on the Street Fighter series, revealed Deep Down alongside their new \\"Panta Rhei\\" game engine, designed specifically for the PlayStation 4. Deep Down was the working title, and Panta Rhei was announced to replace MT Framework as Capcom's game engine of choice. The reveal trailer showed an armored warrior battling a medieval fire-breathing dragon. They chose to make a new brand for freedom to explore next-gen video game console architecture, and so as to avoid limitations from consumer expectations. The game did not have a presence at the E3 2013. During Tokyo Game Show 2013, Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono announced that Deep Down was to be a free-to-play title; the initial expected release date was to be in 2014 after a public beta coincided with the Japanese release of the PS4. In early 2015, Kazunori Sugiura stated in an interview with 4gamer that the vision for the game had expanded since its initial 2013 reveal, to better appeal in the long term to players, and so the development timescale had been extended.

He was previously one of eleven Croatian members of the European Parliament, serving from Croatia's accession to the European Union in 2013 until his resignation as MEP when he took office as Prime Minister.Profile European Parliament Following his graduation from the Zagreb Faculty of Law in 1993, Plenković held various bureaucratic positions in the Croatian Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. After completing a postgraduate degree in 2002 (research master in International law), he served as deputy chief of Croatia's mission to the EU. Between 2005 and 2010, he was Croatia's deputy ambassador to France, before leaving the post to become State Secretary for European Integration. He was subsequently elected to the Croatian Parliament in 2011. He was elected President of the HDZ in 2016, following Tomislav Karamarko's resignation. Plenković campaigned on a pro- European and moderate agenda and led his party to a plurality of seats in the 2016 parliamentary election. He was designated as Prime Minister of Croatia by President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović on 10 October 2016 after presenting 91 signatures of support by Members of Parliament to her. His cabinet was confirmed by a vote of Parliament on 19 October with a majority of 91 of 151 MPs. His first cabinet had 20 ministers, while the second cabinet has 16 ministers. Early life and education Plenković was born on 8 April 1970 in Zagreb to university professor Mario Plenković of Svirče, a village on Hvar, and cardiologist Vjekoslava Raos. He attended elementary and the XVI. Grammar School in Zagreb. As his GPA was below A range, Plenkovic had to write and submit a thesis to obtain his Matura. His thesis \\"The Means of Mass Communication\\" was published in 1989 by the office of printing and publishing companies in Yugoslavia. He was exempted from a then-mandatory conscription for a one-year active duty with the Yugoslav People's Army due to his diagnosis of thalasemia minor, a mild form of anemia, and he was deemed unfit for military service. This fact has been often put at issue later on by his political oponnents during electoral campaigns, especially due to the fact that his mother worked as a doctor in a military hospital in Zagreb. He enrolled in the Zagreb Faculty of Law in 1988, graduating in 1993 with dissertation \\"Institution of European Community and the decision-making process\\" at the Department of International Public Law under Professor Nina Vajić, former Judge of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  Early career  During university, Plenković worked as a volunteer translator in the observing mission of the European Community in Croatia from 1991 to 1992. At the beginning of the 1990s, he became interested in Europe and actively participated in European Law Students Association (ELSA) of which he was President of ELSA Zagreb in 1991, the first President of ELSA Croatia in 1992 and President of the International ELSA committee, situated in Brussels. During that time Plenković participated in numerous conferences throughout Europe and the US as well as organising numerous symposiums in Croatia. As a student, he interned in the London law firm Stephenson Harwood in 1992 and following this, an internship in the European People's Party in the European Parliament (as a part of Robert Schuman Foundation program). He also worked in the Croatian mission for the European Community in 1993 and 1994 which was then chaired by Ambassador Ante Čičin-Šain. In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Plenković completed a programme to become a diplomat and in 1992, passed the consultation exam at the diplomatic academy. Plenković passed the Bar in 2002. At the Law Faculty in the University of Zagreb, he finished his Masters in International Public and Private Law and got the title of Master of Science in 2002 by defending his Masters thesis by the title of \\"Subjectivity of EU and development of the common foreign and security policy\\" under the tutorage of professor Budislav Vukas, judge of International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg. Besides his native Croatian, Plenković speaks English, French and Italian fluently and is conversant in German.  Diplomatic career  From 1994 to 2002 Plenković worked at different positions within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Among other things as a Chief of the Department of European integration, Adviser of Minister for European Affairs, Member of the negotiation team on the Treaty on Stabilisation and Accession. From 2002 to 2005, Plenković was a deputy chief of Croatian Mission for the EU in Brussels. He was in charge of the coordination of political activities of the Mission and he worked on networking with the officials of the European Commission, Council, European Parliament and other permanent representations of various Member States. He was working on Croatian application for membership in the European Union in 2002 and in 2003, making pressure for the status of candidate country in 2004 and for the opening of the accession negotiations in 2005. From 2005 to 2010, Plenković was serving as the deputy ambassador in France where he was in charge of political and organizational issues. During his diplomatic career, Plenković participated in numerous symposiums, seminars and programs on international and European law, international, foreign relations and foreign policy and management. = State Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2010–2011 = Appointed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Gordan Jandrokovic, Plenković worked as a State Secretary for European Integration during the Government of Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor. He had a prominent role in the campaign for a referendum on EU membership. Together With numerous media appearances, Plenković held dozens of lectures on joining the European Union in all Croatian counties. As a State Secretary, Plenković also performed the duties of the political director for EU Affairs, co-chair of the Stabilisation and Association Croatia-EU, national coordinator for the Danube Strategy of the European Union and co-chairman of the duties of the international commissions (Bavaria-Croatia, Croatia-Baden- Württemberg, Croatia-Flanders). He was on a board member of the Foundation for Civil Society Development, President of the Organizing Committee of the Croatia Summit in 2010 and 2011 and Secretary of the Organizing Committee of the pastoral visit of the Pope Benedict XVI in 2011.  Political engagement  = Member of the Croatian Parliament, 2011–2013 = In 2011, after seventeen years of professional work in diplomacy, Plenković joined the Croatian Democratic Union. From December 2011 to July 2013 he was a Croatian Democratic Union member in the Croatian Parliament. He was elected in the 7th electoral district. Plenković was also a deputy member of delegation of the Croatian Parliament, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean (PAM), and a member of a group of friendship with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, France, Malta and Morocco. Prior to the referendum, Plenković held series of lectures on the European union at the party rallies across Croatia and participated in numerous public debates, TV and radio shows. He is a member of the HDZ Central committee, City committee Zagreb, Regional committee Črnomerec, basic branch Jelenovac and the Committee for Foreign and European affairs. = Member of the European Parliament, 2013–2016= By decision of the Croatian Parliament from April 2012 until July 2013 Plenković was one of the 12 Croatian observers in the European Parliament. In his capacity as an observer member in the European Parliament, he supported the completion of the ratification process of the Treaty on Croatian accession to the European Union, the positive reports and resolutions on Croatia and the appropriate allocation of EU funds to Croatia in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020. Andrej Plenković at EPP Summit, Brussels, December 2016 As a HDZ candidate on the joint list for the first Croatian elections to the European Parliament, which were held on 14 April 2013, he actively participated in the election campaign. He participated in the drafting of the HDZ programme for the European elections, “a Croatian voice in Europe”, adopted by the presidency of the party led by President Tomislav Karamarko. The program was based on the main principles of the Platform of the European People's Party and its program documents, as well as the priorities of Croatia in the European Union from the perspective of the HDZ. He was elected to the winning coalition list, where he received the highest number of preferential votes among the HDZ candidates. Between 2013 and 2014, Plenković was a member of the Committee on Budgets. From 2014, he served as vice-chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs and a member of the parliament's delegation to the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. He led the parliament's monitoring mission during the Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2014.Jeanette Minns (October 9, 2014), Parliament’s mission to Ukrainian elections European Voice.

In the 2016 parliamentary elections, he led his party to an unexpected victory.Andrew Byrne (September 12, 2016), Conservative HDZ wins Croatia vote Financial Times. The opposition SDP-led People's Coalition conceded defeat after winning only 54 seats in Parliament. Its leader, former Prime Minister Zoran Milanović, ruled out running for reelection to his party's chairmanship, effectively also ruling out any possible attempts to form a governing majority, thus allowing the HDZ to begin talks with the Bridge of Independent Lists (Most), its junior partner in the outgoing government led by the non- partisan Prime Minister Tihomir Orešković. Most set out seven conditions for entering into a government with any party and Plenković began discussions lasting several weeks with Most representatives. Plenković also held talks with the 8 representatives of national minorities, as HDZ and Most would not have a majority without their support. Over the next few weeks several other parties, including the HSS proceeded to give their support to a government led by Plenković. However, it is widely viewed that HSS chairman Krešo Beljak agreed to give Plenković the support of his 5 party's MPs and \\"100 days of peace before turning into the sharpest opposition\\" in order to calm tensions resulting from a dispute between him and HSS MEP Marijana Petir, who had called for HSS to enter the center-right government to be formed by HDZ and Most instead of remaining a part of the People's Coalition as an opposition party. The dispute escalated and Beljak proceeded to suspend over 100 members of the party, including Petir. Plenković further received the support of the Milan Bandić 365 party, one out of two HSU MPs and one former member of Human Blockade. He formally received 91 signatures of support from MPs on 10 October 2016, far more than the necessary 76, and presented them to President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, who named him Prime Minister-designate and gave him 30 days time until 9 November to form a government. Prime Minister (2016–present) Prime Minister Andrej Plenković (top row second from right) with rest of the European chief executives during a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome in Rome on 25 March 2017. Andrej Plenković was confirmed as the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia along with his cabinet of 20 ministers by a vote of 91 in favor, 45 against and 3 abstentions among 151 Members of Parliament on 19 October 2016. His government received the support of MPs belonging to the HDZ-HSLS-HDS coalition, Bridge of Independent Lists, Milan Bandić 365, HSS, HDSSB, SDSS and 5 representatives of other national minorities. Plenković presented his cabinet as \\"the government that knows how to bring about changes\\", and stressed out social dialogue, economic growth stimulation, and a tax reform as the government's priorities. = Government crisis and cabinet reshuffle = On 27 April 2017, Plenković dismissed three of his government ministers representing the Bridge of Independent Lists (Most), the junior partner in the governing coalition, over their reluctance to support a vote of confidence in Finance Minister Zdravko Marić, whom Most accuses of withholding certain information relating to an ongoing crisis involving one of Croatia's largest firms, Agrokor, where Marić had worked a few years back. Namely, Most consider that Marić had knowledge of irregularities occurring in the way Agrokor paid its suppliers and had chosen to not reveal that information to protect the firm he formerly worked for. On 28 April 2017 the last remaining government minister from Most, Public Administration minister Ivan Kovačić, resigned his post and Most announced its withdrawal from the ruling coalition. HDZ started to gather signatures from Members of Parliament to push through a vote of no confidence in the Speaker of Parliament Božo Petrov, who is also the chairman of Most. At the same time, HDZ announced that it would seek to form a new governing majority in Parliament, bypassing Most. With MOST deciding to withdraw its parliamentary support for the Plenković cabinet, Božo Petrov resigned as speaker on 5 May 2017 and was succeeded by Gordan Jandroković of the HDZ. Now without the support of MOST, the HDZ-dominated cabinet was left without a clear parliamentary majority and the possibility of yet another early parliamentary election, the third in 18 months, taking place was extremely heightened. However, the government crisis was ultimately resolved on 9 June 2017 when 5 out of 9 Members of Parliament representing the Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats (HNS) agreed to enter a coalition with the HDZ, while the other four MPs (among them Vesna Pusić and Anka Mrak Taritaš) decided to leave HNS and form a new political party called the Civic Liberal Alliance (Glas). The Plenković cabinet underwent a reshuffle, with HNS being given the portfolios of Science and Education and Construction and Spatial Planning. PM Plenković with Jüri Ratas, Prime Minister of Estonia and Donald Tusk President of the European Council, Tallinn Digital Summit 2017 Since May 2017, Plenković has been constantly named the most negative politician in Croatia by monthly polls conducted by the Promocija plus and IPSOS PULS agencies. However, by December 2017, he was also named the third most popular politician, while his party enjoyed considerable rating advantage over all other political parties in Croatia. =Domestic policy= Following a deal with the HNS, the government introduced an education reform starting with a pilot program in the 2018/2019 school year. The renewable energy tariff was raised in August 2017 to stimulate the production of renewable energy, which is the source of 28% of the country's energy demand. The move also resulted in increased electricity bills. The Croatian Parliament ratified the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, known as the Istanbul Convention, in April 2018. Though there was a split within the HDZ over ratifying the convention, the Plenković Cabinet unanimously supported it. In October 2018, the government introduced a pension reform bill that would penalise early retirement and set the retirement age to 67 starting from 2033, instead of 2038 as defined by a 2014 law. The move sparked large protests from trade unions. They launched a referendum initiative against the law and collected more than 700,000 signatures. Instead of calling a referendum, the government backed down and lowered the retirement age back to 65. Prime Minister Andrej Plenković during his bilateral meeting with British PM Boris Johnson at number 10 Downing Street in London, United Kingdom, 24 February 2020. A nationwide strike of teachers in primary and secondary schools started on 10 October 2019, following the government’s refusal to increase their wages by 6%. The strike halted all classes in schools. The strike lasted until 2 December, when teachers’ unions and the government agreed to a gradual increase in wages of 6% by 2021. Economy The new government introduced a tax reform starting from January 2017 and set the reduction of the budget deficit as the main goal of the 2017 budget. The initial tax reform proposal from Zdravko Marić, the Finance minister who retained his position from the previous cabinet, caused some disagreements between the two member-parties of the ruling coalition, the HDZ and the Most. The modified proposal included a reduction in corporate income tax from 20% to 18% for large companies and 12% for small and mid-level companies. Personal income tax rates were changed from 12%, 25% and 40% into tax rates of 24% and 36%. Discontent over the tax reform was voiced by trade unions, as well as in the tourism sector because the VAT for their services was raised from 13% to 25%. On 30 October 2017, Plenković declared that Croatia plans to join the euro zone within seven to eight years. In December 2017, the government increased the minimum wage by 5% for 2018 and adopted several new laws, including the allocation of the income tax revenue entirely to local administrative units and lower payments to the state when purchasing used cars. The introduction of a property tax, which received a negative public reaction, was postponed indefinitely. Croatia's general government recorded a surplus of €424.5 million in 2017 or 0.9% of GDP, attributed to an increase in income from taxes related to manufacturing and imports, and a reduction in interest payments. The debt-to-GDP ratio decreased by 2.7 percentage points from 2016, to 77.5%, and GDP growth was 2.9%. Negative migration and population trends continued in 2017, with a record high number of emigrants since joining the EU. The Croatian Employers' Association said that reforms stalled following the income tax cuts in early 2017, causing a slower economic growth. A March 2018 report by the European Commission also stressed out the lack of structural reforms, particularly in fiscal policy, the social benefits system, and the pension system. All three major credit rating agencies improved Croatia's rating in 2018. The International Monetary Fund commended the government for positive macroeconomic indicators and called for a \\"sizable restructuring of public administration\\". The minimum monthly net wage was raised from €370 to €404 in 2019. =Foreign policy= PM Andrej Plenković with German chancellor Angela Merkel After attending his first European Council summit on 20 October 2016, in an address to the Croatian Parliament, Plenković said that \\"there is no need for Croatia to build border fences\\". Plenković's first official foreign visit was to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina on 28 October 2016. Plenković said that his government will support Bosnia and Herzegovina on its path towards membership in the European Union. Discussions were held regarding the political rights of Bosnian Croats, mostly in terms of bringing their political rights to the level enjoyed by Bosniaks and Bosnian Serbs. In November, he visited Ukraine where he met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. Plenković expressed support for a peaceful reintegration of the areas of Ukraine under the control of pro- Russian rebels. The two governments established a working group to share Croatia's experience with the reintegration of eastern Slavonia in 1998. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented that the visit \\"raised serious concerns in Russia\\". Andrej Plenković, EPP Malta Congress 2017, 30 March On 29 June 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal on the border dispute between Slovenia and Croatia ruled in favour of Slovenia regarding its access to international waters. The decision was welcomed by the Slovenian Government, and dismissed by the Croatian Government as not legally binding. Croatia withdrew from the arbitration process in 2015, during the premiership of Zoran Milanović, after a leaked tape showed the Slovenian judge in the case exchanging confidential information with Slovenian officials. Plenković called for bilateral talks to resolve the issue, while Slovenia insists on the implementation of the arbitral decision. The European Commission announced that it will remain neutral in the border dispute. After the final verdict in the war crimes trial against former high-ranking officials of Herzeg-Bosnia, followed by the suicide of Slobodan Praljak, Plenković stated that Praljak's suicide illustrated the \\"deep moral injustice towards the six Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian people\\". The ICTY prosecutors and its president criticized the statements from Croatian officials and called on them to accept the court's findings. Plenković later said that his country accepted the verdict and expressed \\"regrets and condolences very clearly for all the victims of the crimes mentioned in this verdict\\". PM Plenković with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban Plenković endorsed the incumbent Dragan Čović in the 2018 election for the Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the election of Željko Komšić as the Croat member of the Presidency, largely due to votes in majority Bosniak areas, Plenković criticized Komšić's victory: \\"We are again in a situation where members of one constituent people ... are electing a representative of another, the Croat people\\". Komšić responded that the Croatian Government is undermining Bosnia and Herzegovina and its sovereignty. Komšić also announced that Bosnia and Herzegovina might sue Croatia over the construction of the Pelješac Bridge. The construction of the bridge, paid largery with EU funding, began on 30 July 2018 to connect Croatia's territory and was supported by Komšić's main election opponent Dragan Čović. Plenković affirmed the government's support for the Global Compact for Migration. Interior Minister Davor Božinović represented Croatia at the adoption of the agreement, after President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović announced she would not participate at the conference. Along with Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš of Latvia, Plenković represented the governments ruled by the center-right European People's Party (EPP) in the negotiations on new appointments to top posts in the European Union following the 2019 European elections, including the European Council, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.Alastair Macdonald (June 6, 2019), EU mini-summit set to discuss top jobs succession Reuters. Political positions Commentators mostly described Plenković's political positions as pro-European and moderate, and his election as an exception in a eurosceptic trend in Europe. Some observers described his positions as moderate conservative, or simply as conservative. Plenković described his policy as \\"devoid of extremes and populism\\", and his political views as centre-right. Personal life Plenković is married to lawyer Ana Maslać Plenković with whom he has a son Mario. In early November 2016 it was reported that the couple are expecting their second child, a daughter Mila. His father Mario Plenković lives in Slovenia. He is a university professor at University of Maribor and at Alma Mater Europaea, where he is the head of Strategic Communication Management doctoral study program.

In August 2014, Uruguay legalized growing up to six plants at home, as well as the formation of growing clubs, a state- controlled marijuana dispensary regime, and the creation of a Cannabis regulatory institute (Instituto de Regulación y Control del Cannabis or IRCCA). In October 2014 the Government began registering growers' clubs, allowed in turn to grow a maximum of 99 cannabis plants annually; as of August 2015, there were 2,743 registered personal growers. After a long delay in implementing the retail component of the law, in 2017 sixteen pharmacies were authorized to sell cannabis commercially.Uruguay pharmacies start selling cannabis straight to consumers  World news  The Guardian History Uruguay has never criminalized personal possession of drugs, and a 1974 law allowed judges to determine whether a given case of possession was personal or commercial. This law was later updated in 1998. Proposal for legalization In June 2012, the Uruguayan government, under President Mujica, announced plans to legalise state-fix sales of cannabis in order to fight drug-related crimes and health issues. The government stated that they would ask global leaders to do the same. Nobel prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa praised the decision as \\"courageous\\". The law intends to reduce the profit that drug trafficking creates for organized crime, as well as reducing the drug-related violence and the social problems associated with it. Uruguay has one of the lowest murder rates in the region (though by some estimates, crime was slightly increasing in 2013). Mujica's plan would allow users to cultivate the plant for non-commercial uses and grant licenses to professional farmers for larger scale production. The plan includes a system of; user registry, taxation, and quality control; all coordinated through the existing agency that monitors tobacco, alcohol, and pharmaceuticals. He estimated that with 70,000 users, the country will have to produce more than 5,000 pounds each month. He also stated: \\"Uruguay wants to make a 'contribution to humanity' by legalising marijuana but will backtrack if the 'experiment' goes awry\\". On 31 July 2013, the Chamber of Deputies passed the bill to legalize and regulate the production and sale of cannabis and sent it to the country's Senate. The bill was approved by 50 affirmative votes (the minimum required) with all Deputies from the ruling Broad Front voting in favor and all the other Deputies voting against it. The bill was passed by the Senate's Health Commission on 26 November and was expected to be voted by the full Senate since November 2013. El País.

He attended the Luzerne Presbyterian Institute and later the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He did business in Pennsylvania and several other states. His business was mostly related to coal, land, and natural gas. He worked in the Glendon Iron Company in his youth. He was later the treasurer of numerous companies in Pennsylvania. These were mostly electric companies.  Early life and education  Pardee was born on July 17, 1841. He was the son of the industrial tycoon Ario Pardee. In 1851, Pardee, along with one of his brothers, was sent to Wyoming's Luzerne Presbyterian Institute. However, following an argument with the headmaster of the Institute, Pardee was withdrawn from the Institute in 1854. He was instead sent to the West Jersey Collegiate Institute. In 1857, Pardee joined the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and in 1860, he graduated from the institute, where he was in the fraternity Theta Delta Chi.  Coal-related work  Pardee joined the Glendon Iron Company after he graduated. This company primarily belonged to his father and was based in Easton, Pennsylvania. For 22 years, he worked as the superintendent of mines in his fathers company and was based in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. In 1884, he left his fathers company to pursue his own work in several enterprises, including the coal business and the natural gas business. He was the founder of the Pardee Brothers Company, which was his most significant source of wealth. In 1903, his children inherited the company. The Pardee Brothers Company was primarily developed to exploit coal mines near Lattimer. After Pardee's sons joined his business, he began to build businesses for coal and land, among other things, in Kentucky, Louisiana, Virginia, and West Virginia. Pardee was the treasurer of several companies. These included the Beaver Meadow Electric Railway, the Butler Township Power Company, the Coal Township Electric Company, the Conyngham Township Electric Company, the East Union Township Electric Company, the Fairview Township Electric Company, the Mahanoy Township Electric Company, the Mount Carmel Township Electric Company, the Union Township Power Company, the Wright Township Power Company, the Wilkes-Barre Township Power Company, and the West Mahanoy Township Power Company. He also became an officer of the Hazleton Gas Company in 1879. Pardee owned several collieries in the Coal Region. Pardee owned the mines worked by the miners who were massacred in the Lattimer massacre. However, he was in Germantown at the time. He returned to Hazleton on September 15, after the massacre. He was eager to restart his mines and was \\"disgusted\\" that his superintendents were unable to get his collieries to resume their running. He was also strongly opposed to increasing his miners' wages shortly before the Lattimer Massacre.  Other work  In April 1861, Pardee joined the Union Army in the American Civil War. He participated in the Battle of Antietam and several minor battles. He was a captain in the army. He retired on October 30, 1862 after getting typhoid fever. He also funded the construction of the Pardee Dormitory at Rensselaer. It was completed in 1925.  Personal life  On June 4, 1867, Pardee married Mary Byrne Day. The couple had nine children: Estelle, Alice, Calvin, Alfred, Ario, Ellie,Died as a child Olive, Howard and Helen. Pardee and his family moved to Philadelphia. He bought a summer farm in Whitemarsh in 1889. Near the end of his life, he enjoyed traveling to distant places including the Far East, Russia, Egypt, and Europe. He also regularly hosted family members at his summer home. Pardee's health started failing during the spring of 1922. He died on March 18, 1923. Pardee was friends with John R. Fell. In 1889, he purchased 69 acres of land near Fell's estate.

Located in Antibes and built in 1938, the villa Aujourd’hui is one of the most distinctive of Dierks’ Riviera homes and was one of the last expressions of the Modernist style to have been built on the Riviera prior to the outbreak of World War II. Background Starting in 1923, the Riviera started to become a summer resort, but it was the American multimillionaire, Frank Jay Gould, who was responsible for turning the Riviera into a summer resort by encouraging hoteliers to open their hotels at the beginning of spring rather than in winter as was the tradition in the 19th century. With his wife, Florence, the two attracted friends, family, artists, and the wealthy for not only sporting activities and stylish pursuits under the sun, but also for social and cultural pursuits. Through the couple’s financial backing, Juan-les-Pins became a center for summer activities on the Riviera; this was quickly followed in 1926 with their backing of the hotel Palais de la Méditerranée in Nice. The Gould’s efforts were continued by Gerald and Sara Murphy, who had moved to cap d’Antibes. Their home, Villa America, was a center of Riviera social life receiving the likes of Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Serge Diaghilev and Pablo Picasso. François Fray, conservateur du patrimoine, “La Villa Ajourd'hui,” in Parimoine XXe, September 2000, read on line (page consulted 01 August, 2013) History Mrs. Audrey Chadwick was an active member of the Riviera’s expatriate social set that espoused the seductive lifestyle of the South of France. Due to her association with Riviera society, she was introduced to the American expatriate architect, Barry Dierks, who was capable of building a villa in the Modernist, Art Deco style that was then popular in Miami. She named this villa, Today, after her home in Palm Beach, Florida. Around 1950, Jack L. Warner purchased the villa and Aujourd’hui received the royalty of Hollywood, notably, Charlie Chaplin and Ava Gardner.Jean Marx, \\"Villa Aujourd'hui,\\" in Label Patrimoine du XXe siècle en Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, February 2008,read on line (page consulted 01 August, 2013) Description The villa, which was built on a plot of land that Dierks liked to describe as being the size of a grand piano, replaced an earlier modest structure named the Bungalow. He exploited the narrowness of the site and designed a traditional two-story plan with a basement-level garage. Combining monumentality with symmetry and in response to the undulating topography of the site, Dierks designed a Modernist entry with a bold undulating façade and semi-circular drive that is unique on the Riviera.Base Mérimée : read on line (page consulted 01 August, 2013) The main part of the building houses an enfilade of receptions rooms. On the ground floor, the cross-vestibule, which features a free-standing spiral staircase with a white-enameled banister supported by Venetian glass balusters, opens onto the dining room, which is directly across from the entrance. The stairwell is lit by an arched skylight that is decorated with an abstract design and signed “V. L.”. To the west, a series of terraces line the shore. To one side of the dining room is the salon, which opens on a panoramic view of the Golfe-Juan and Juan-les-Pins; and on the other side is the pantry, kitchen and service areas including the garage. The salon is further noted by the large carpet designed by Roger-Henri Expert and Pierre Patout (woven in Cogolin) for the French Pavilion at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York. The rooms are painted white and appointed with black marble fireplaces. Upstairs there are five bedrooms with en suite bathrooms; staff quarters that include four bedrooms and one bathroom are also located on this level.

Among the Udmurts, as in other Finno-Ugric republics in the Volga region, the revival of Paganism is inextricably intertwined with the revival of national-ethnic culture and awareness.Filatov- Shchipkov, 1997, p. 177 The Udmurtian Pagan revival circles sprang out of the Demen (Udmurt for \\"Society\\") movement which was established in December 1989 for the protection and restoration of the Udmurt ethnic culture.Victor Schnirelmann. “Christians! Go home”: A Revival of Neo-Paganism between the Baltic Sea and Transcaucasia . Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2002. p. 206 Udmurt Vos as an institution was founded in 1994.Taagepera p. 279 According to 2012 statistics, 2% of the population of Udmurtia adheres to forms of Paganism. Victor Schnirelmann reported an adherence of 4% for the Udmurts alone. Etymology The Udmurt word vös’ means \\"prayer\\", \\"sacrifice\\", \\"religion\\", \\"faith\\" and as a root derives many other words in the Udmurt language, among which vös’as’kon meaning \\"prayer\\", \\"sacrifice\\", vös’as’ meaning \\"priest\\", and the verbs vös’any meaning \\"to pray\\", \\"to sacrifice\\", \\"to hallow\\", vös’as’kyny that means \\"to pray\\", \\"to beg\\", and vös’atyny meaning \\"to sacrifice\\".Aado Lintrop. The Spring Prayer Feasts in the Udmurt Village of Varklet-Bodya in Tatarstan. Cosmos 18 (2002), 43-55. History The first date in the history of Christianisation of the Udmurts is 1557, when Ivan the Terrible conferred privileges on baptised Udmurt families by imperial deed. However, tough attempts to convert all the Udmurts were undertaken only in the middle of the 18th century, when the government began to implement measures to Christianise the population, sending missionaries who built churches and schools. Pagans were repressed, and sacred groves, prayer sites and pagan burial grounds were destroyed. Various attempts to restore the Udmurt native religion emerged, for example the movement of the \\"Lime-Tree Worshippers\\" in 1849.Filatov-Shchipkov, 1997, p. 178 However, in contrast to the Mari, the Udmurt Pagans did not display any tendency to centralise or formalise their religion. After 1917 began a short period of national reawakening, the Udmurt Republic was created an active national intelligentsia took shape. This helped a revival of the Udmurt Vos. However, with the 1930s' rise of the Soviet Union the Udmurt intelligentsia was almost entirely destroyed, the high priests were declared enemies of the people and subjected to cruel repression, worship was forbidden, rural holy places, temples and family shrines were destroyed, and sacred groves were uprooted. By the perestroika period, the Udmurts had very high levels of alcoholism and suicide, and low birth rates. Moreover, Russification proceeded steadily. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s ethno- national and cultural identity reawakened, and despite the significant Christianisation the Udmurt national movement was entirely outside the framework of Eastern Orthodoxy, and even hostile to it. The Udmurt native religion became the basis of the national movement, and in 1994 a group of Izhevsk intellectuals, artists, writers, scholars and entrepreneurs founded the Udmurt Vos as an institution and mass association.Filatov-Shchipkov, 1997, p. 179 Genuine high priests were sought, and Vasili Maksimov, a simple peasant from an Udmurt village in Tatarstan, became the head of the new church.Filatov-Shchipkov, 1997, p. 180 National worship services were organised (a thing that had never happened before), and since that time these have been held yearly in different regions of the republic. Theory According to the theologians of the Udmurt Vos, the whole of nature is determined by the numinous presence of divinity, gods and spirits. Existence has three basic levels: the cosmic, in which the central divinity Inmar takes first place; that of the aerial elements, the heavens, in which Kvaz' is dominant; and the earthly creation, the world of creatures, in which Kelchin' is dominant. Alongside the hierarchy of Inmar, Kvaz' and Kelchin', there is Lud (the world tree), the genius (breeder) of all spirits, which is neither good nor evil. The dead actually live in another world which is a perfect mirror of our own. According to another source (Taagepera), traditional Udmurt Vos theory follows patterns similar to the Mari one, but in contrast to the Mari, female deities dominate. In-Mumy (Mother of the Heavens), Shundy-Mumy (Sun Mother) and (Gudyry-Mumy) are the chief deities. Male deities of the aerial sphere are Inmar (god of the sky and air), Töl-Peri (wind) and Kwaz (weather). Earthly and chthonic gods are mostly male; they include Nulesmurt (forest man), Kyldysin (fertility and procreation), Invu (waters), and Vorshud (genius of the kins and genius loci).Taagepera p. 278 According to the movement's leaders, peoples who have renounced their own gods have no future, because their spiritual betrayal has led to deep injury of the people's soul. They point to the Japanese people, who have preserved their popular faith, as a model of better prospects. Only peoples who find in themselves the strength to take the step of returning to their roots have any prospect for the future. It is a notable fact that it was in Izhevsk in 1994 that one of the first Slavic Rodnover communities, the Tur, first appeared. It is difficult to say whether or not the propaganda of Udmurt Vos played any role in its origin, but the leaders of the Udmurt Vos welcomed its appearance. Practices Some villages of followers of Udmurt Vos are organised to have sacrificial groves called lud in UdmurtLintrop, 2002, p. 44 where often are located the \\"large temples\\" (byd’z’ym kuala, \\"large prayer house\\"), special buildings for worship dedicated to the spirit breeder-generator of the kin, whose worship comprises both the ideas of genius generis and genius loci. Both of them are connected in the Udmurt notion vorshud (formed by vordyny, meaning \\"to hold\\", \\"to contain\\" plus shud meaning \\"happiness\\", \\"luck\\").Lintrop, 2002, 44 The \\"little temple\\" (pichi/pokchi kuala) is a kind of worship building located in the yard of each family that maintains the large prayer house. The clergy is made up of priests (vös’as’, vösias), local religious authorities elected amongst the males of the community for organising and performing prayers and sacrifices. They must be married and healthy, both mentally and physically. Some of these priests may become high-priests (tuno). Prayers are called kuriskon. Udmurt Vos in Tataria and Bashkiria Northern Tatarstan and Bashkortostan were in ancient times areas of settlement of the Udmurt people. Many Udmurt villages are divided in these two republics. Over the centuries Udmurts there were subjected to enforced Islamisation by the dominating Tatars and Bashkirs, but they preserved strong national consciousness and Pagan faith.Filatov- Shchipkov, 1997, p. 181 In recent times pan-Udmurt worship services have taken place annually in Bashkortostan, and they have been subject of repression by Muslim authorities.

He was born at Tortworth, Gloucestershire and died at Leicester. Diment was a right-handed middle-order batsman who was recruited by Leicestershire in 1955 as assistant secretary to the secretary/captain, Charles Palmer, and was therefore allowed to play as an amateur. He played in 59 first-class games for the county over the next four seasons, being a fairly regular member of the side in both 1957 and 1958. But although he passed 50 in six innings, his career batting average was only 16 and his highest first- class score was just 71, made in his first match for Leicestershire, against Derbyshire in 1955. He had earlier played a single match for his native Gloucestershire in 1952, without success. Palmer retired as both player and secretary at the end of the 1957 season. Diment succeeded him as secretary, but Leicestershire recruited Willie Watson, the Yorkshire and England professional player, as captain from 1958. When Watson regained his Test place that season and also missed a few matches through injury, Diment captained the Leicestershire team in five games: they included the last game he played in first-class cricket. Diment remained as the secretary of Leicestershire until after the 1959 season, but played only for the second eleven that year. In a Minor Counties Championship match against Shropshire in July 1959 he made an unbeaten 200 at more than a run a ball, astonishingly fast for an era of stodgy batsmanship. But at the end of that season he left Leicestershire to take a job in the leather industry.

The film covers the Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons tests in 1998, as well as the nationalist rhetoric that accompanied these tests. It also explores the ill-effects of the Indian test on the surrounding population and the reactions to the test among the government and the public. The latter part of the film also covers the perception of nuclear weapons in Japan and the United States. Upon the film's completion, the Indian censor board demanded that Patwardhan make 21 cuts before it could be released, including cutting all speeches by politicians. Patwardhan refused and took the matter to court; the Bombay high court ruled in his favor a year later, and the film was released without any cuts.  Synopsis  The documentary begins with the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by the religious extremist Nathuram Godse in 1948. The film then describes the years after Indian independence. In a voice-over, Patwardhan describes several events, including the United States' use of the nuclear bomb, the nuclear arms race during the cold war, and India's first nuclear test in 1974. Patwardhan summarizes them in the following manner: \\"The collapse of socialism saw a revival of bigotry. America had now become our role model.\\" The film then examines the growing nuclear nationalism in India. It covers the Hindu-nationalist rhetoric of the Bharatiya Janata Party that surrounded Indian nuclear weapons tests in 1998. The film covers the \\"Global Peace March\\" that occurred following the nuclear tests at Pokhran, and the opposition it faced from activists of the Sangh Parivar. It also covers the rise of religious extremism in both India and Pakistan. Patwardhan travels to Pakistan, where he interviews several people, including school-girls participating in a debate on the use of the bomb. In the second half of the documentary, Patwardhan travels to Japan to interview the hibakusha, survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The film then moves to the United States, where Patwardhan interviews curators of the Smithsonian Institution. The curators describe how the United States Congress blocked an attempt to create an exhibition on the American use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and the effects of nuclear weapons. A postscript to the film shows the September 11 attacks, and the response of the US. Production director, producer and cameraman Anand Patwardhan The documentary was shot for three years following Indian nuclear weapons tests in 1998. It sought to explore the Hindu-nationalist rhetoric that accompanied the test. It included footage shot in India, Pakistan, Japan, and the United States. The documentary was produced and directed by Patwardhan himself, who was also responsible for the camera work. Release and censorship The Central Board of Film Certification, often referred to as the Indian Censor Board, asked Patwardhan to make 21 cuts before the documentary could be released. Among the scenes that were ordered to be cut were the killing of Mahatma Gandhi by the Hindu-nationalist assassin Nathuram Godse in 1948, as well as scenes critical of leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which held the central government at that point. The board also asked Patwardhan to cut scenes depicting an exposé of corruption in the defence department of the NDA government by Tehelka magazine, as well as all speeches by politicians and the prime minister. Patwardhan refused to cut the scenes, stating that this was because the scenes were of politically sensitive issues. As a result, the film was banned for over a year. However, after a court battle, the film was screened without a single cut. As with his previous films, Patwardhan also successfully petitioned the court to force the national broadcaster, Doordarshan, to show this film on its national network. It was commercially released in June 2005. Reception and analysis Tehelka magazine called the film a \\"monumental event for Indian cinema.\\" A review in the magazine Variety stated that the three-hour length of the documentary was a problem, and that it was \\"long-winded and discursive.\\" However, it said the content of the film was of \\"immense interest and importance in reminding the viewer of the threat to world peace posed by continuing posturing on the subcontinent.\\" In a review, scholar Linda Hess stated that the film was too long, but that the importance of the content and the skill of the producer made it worth watching. Hess states that the themes of the film included the rise of religious bigotry and militarism in Indian politics, the nuclear arms race triggered by the United States, and at the largest scale, violence and non-violence. The film repeatedly uses images of Mahatma Gandhi juxtaposed with footage that depicts militant ideologies in both India and Pakistan, such as footage of an Islamist rally in Pakistan calling for Islamic world domination, followed by a rally of the Shiv Sena, which calls for a world dominated by Hindutva. Hess goes on to say that the Patwardhan's depiction of the film's complex content has a sense of irony and humor, and that \\"his eye and voice are unsentimental, his intellect acute.\\"  Awards  * Grand Prize, 2002 Earth Vision Film Festival (Tokyo) * Best Film and International Jury Prize, 2002 Mumbai International Film Festival * International Film Critics' Award (FIPRESCI), 2002 Sydney Film Festival * Best Documentary, 2003 Karachi International Film Festival * Gold Award by Indian Documentary Producer's Association in 2002 * Best Documentary, 2003 International Video Festival, Kerala * Silver Dhow, 2003 Zanzibar International Film Festival * 2004 National Film Award for Best Non-Feature Film, India  References   External links  * *'War and Peace' (Jang Aur Aman) Category:Indian documentary films Category:2002 films Category:Indian films Category:Anand Patwardhan ","title":"War and Peace (2002 film)"},{"id":"40130360","text":"An astronomical day refers to a length of day of exactly or nearly 24 hours beginning at noon instead of at midnight. The exact length has been variously defined as either that of a solar day or of a sidereal day.

It includes the boroughs of Darlington, Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees but not those former northeastern parts of the county which are now in the county of Tyne and Wear. The geology of County Durham in northeast England consists of a basement of Lower Palaeozoic rocks overlain by a varying thickness of Carboniferous and Permo-Triassic sedimentary rocks which dip generally eastwards towards the North Sea. These have been intruded by a pluton, sills and dykes at various times from the Devonian Period to the Palaeogene. The whole is overlain by a suite of unconsolidated deposits of Quaternary age arising from glaciation and from other processes operating during the post- glacial period to the present.British Geological Survey 1:625,000 scale geological map Bedrock Geology UK North 5th Edn. NERC 2007 The geological interest of the west of the county was recognised by the designation in 2003 of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty as a European Geopark. The word 'geology' may be traced back to a coinage of Richard de Bury who was a Bishop of Durham in the 14th century. He introduced the term geologia in his work The Philobiblon which he explained as 'the earthly science'.Lawrence, D.J.D. et al 2004 Durham Geodiversity Audit. Durham: Durham County Council, p8 Ordovician The oldest rocks at or near the surface within County Durham are Ordovician age (485 - 443 Ma) Skiddaw Group rocks found in a small inlier near Cronkley Fell in upper Teesdale. They are recorded as the Skiddaw Slates, better known from the Lake District 50 km to the west. A small quarry in these phyllites was worked at one time to make slate pencils.DGA p23 Overlying these are pyroclastic rocks thought to belong to the Borrowdale Volcanic Group.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) p18 No rocks from the succeeding Silurian Period (443 - 419 Ma) are seen at outcrop in the county. Devonian No rocks of Devonian age (419 - 359 Ma) are seen at outcrop in the county though a pluton, the Weardale Granite forming the North Pennine Batholith was intruded into Lower Palaeozoic rocks around 410 million years ago during the Devonian Period.Lawrence, D.J.D. et al 2004Durham Geodiversity Audit, Durham County Council p19 It forms a part of the larger 'North of England Plutonic Suite', whose members (which include the granites at Shap and Skiddaw) were emplaced during the Caledonian Orogeny.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=NEDP The buoyancy of this batholith (it is less dense than the rock into which it was intruded) is considered to be responsible for the existence of the Alston Block which coincides with the North Pennines and which is essentially an eastward dipping horst bounded to the west (outside of County Durham) by the Pennine Fault System, to the north by the Stublick and Ninety Fathom faults (in Northumberland) and by the Butterknowle Fault and Stainmore Trough to the south.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) p152  Carboniferous  There is a thick succession of rocks in County Durham which originated during the Carboniferous Period (359 - 299 Ma). The detail of the rock succession varies from one part of the county to another and in no one location is the entire sequence detailed below in place. The sequence over the Alston Block is generally thinner than elsewhere. The western half of the county forms a part of the Pennine range of hills which are formed largely by the sandstones and limestones of the Great Scar Limestone and overlying Yoredale groups. Further east it is the younger Coal Measures rocks which are found at the surface. Further east again the Carboniferous succession is overlain by younger rocks but they are present at increasing depth to the North Sea coast and beyond. Note that the subdivision of the British Carboniferous rock sequence has undergone considerable revision in recent years and many traditional sequence names are now obsolete in formal use, though of course they remain widespread in the literature. What is now referred to as the Pennine Coal Measures Group would once have been referred to simply as the 'Productive Coal Measures' and the Yoredale Group was the 'Yoredale Series'. The 'Millstone Grit' of County Durham (minus the 'Great Limestone Member') has been renamed as the 'Stainmore Formation', having also been referred to somewhat confusingly as the Stainmore Group at one time.DGA p26 A feature of much of the Carboniferous succession in northern England is its cyclicity which has involved regular changes between marine deposition and sedimentation from rivers. The phenomenon is manifest as cyclothems and is especially prominent in the Yoredale Group sequence. =Great Scar Limestone Group= A part of the Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup, the Great Scar Limestone Group consists of a number of different formations except over the Alston Block where a 107m thickness of largely Asbian age limestones and sandstones occurs and is known as the Melmerby Scar Limestone Formation.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) pp124-125 *Great Scar Limestone Group **Knipe Scar Limestone Formation **Potts Beck Formation **Ashfell Limestone Formation **Ashfell Sandstone Formation **Breakyneck Scar Limestone Formation **Brownber Formation **Scandal Beck Limestone Formation **Coldbeck Limestone Formation Limestone was widely quarried for the production of lime for agriculture and lime mortar for building. Industrial scale quarrying accompanied the growth of the iron and steel industries but has since declined. The Frosterley Marble, a bituminous coraliferous limestone once worked at Harehope Quarry in Weardale is used as a decorative stone and can be found in many churches in the region. Concentrations of such corals as Dibunophyllum bipartitum and of brachiopod remains contribute to its attractiveness when sections are polished.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) pp238-254Lawrence, D.J.D et al 2004 Durham Geodiversity Audit, Durham: Durham County Council p40 =Yoredale Group= Rocks assigned to the Yoredale Group overlie the Carboniferous Limestone succession. The Group is subdivided into a lower/older Alston Formation and a higher/younger Stainmore Formation. The former is largely of Brigantian age whilst the latter is of Asbian/Brigantian to Yeadonian age. The latter is broadly equivalent to the Millstone Grit of the central and southern Pennines. Note that in northeast England some hard rock units are traditionally described as 'sills', a local term for a hard band of rock of whatever origin. Nowadays geologists reserve the term for flat-lying igneous intrusions such as the Whin Sill which is described below. *Yoredale Group **Stainmore Formation (formerly Millstone Grit) ***various un-named sandstones and mudstones ***Grindstone Sandstone (formerly Grindstone Sill) ***various un-named sandstones and mudstones ***Firestone Sandstone (formerly Firestone Sill) ***various sandstones and mudstones **Alston Formation (formerly Alston Group) ***Great Limestone Member (formerly part of Stainmore Group of Millstone Grit - Pendleian) ***Four Fathom Limestone Member ***various sandstones and limestones ***Three Yard Limestone Member ***various sandstones and limestones ***Five Yard Limestone Member ***various sandstones and limestones ***Scar Limestone Member ***various sandstones and limestones ***Tynebottom Limestone Member ***various sandstones and limestones =Coal Measures= Overlying the Yoredale Group rocks is a thick sequence of Coal Measures across which the Durham Coalfield developed. The sequence in County Durham is divided into Lower, Middle and Upper formations. Each of the three are dominated by mudstones but contain abundant sandstones and coal seams. Ironstone bands occur in the lower part of the sequence. At least eleven marine bands (shelly mudstones in general) occur within the Coal Measures. Of these, the 'Quarterburn' marine band defines the base of the Lower Coal Measures Formation, the 'Harvey' marine band defines its junction with the overlying Middle Coal Measures Formation and the 'Down Hill' marine band defines the latter's junction with the Upper Coal Measures Formation. The Quarterburn, Harvey and Down Hill marine bands correlate with the standard Subcrenatum, Vanderbeckei and Cambriense marine bands of elsewhere. The top of the entire Coal Measures sequence is an erosion surface.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) p *Pennine Coal Measures Group **Pennine Upper Coal Measures Formation **Pennine Middle Coal Measures Formation (Duckmantian) **Pennine Lower Coal Measures Formation (Langsettian) Over the Alston Block the middle and upper Coal Measures are missing. Similarly in the Stainmore Trough on the Yorkshire border, both the upper part of the Middle and the entire Upper Coal Measures are absent. The rank of coal increases in the west, a result of the heating of these strata by the Weardale Granite. Some such seams are semi-anthracites. Workings for coal date back centuries though the height of the industry was the nineteenth century. There are no deep pits remaining in the county though opencasting continues. Various of the county's Coal Measures sandstones have been quarried for building stone, for example the Low Main Post sandstone in Durham which was used in the construction of the city's cathedral. =Late Carboniferous intrusive rocks= The 'Hett Subswarm' of tholeiitic quartz-dolerite dykes run WSW-ENE across country to the south of Durham. The subswarm includes the Hett Dyke and Ludworth Dyke amongst others which cut Coal Measures rocks in a WSW- ENE alignment but do not pass into the overlying Permian succession.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) p162  Permian and Triassic  As with the Carboniferous sequence, the subdivision of the British Permian (299 - 252 Ma) and Triassic (252 - 201 Ma) has been considerably revised in recent years. Traditional sequence names have been replaced in formal use by new names, though the older names are frequently encountered in books and on maps. The full sequence of Permian and Triassic rocks forming the New Red Sandstone Supergroup locally is this (uppermost/youngest first): *Mercia Mudstone Group (formerly Keuper Marl) (Triassic) *Sherwood Sandstone Group (formerly Bunter Sandstone) (Triassic) *Zechstein Group (Permian) **Roxby Formation (calcareous mudstone, formerly Upper Anyhdrite and Marl) **Sherburn Anhydrite Formation (in Stockton area only) **Rotten Marl Formation (formerly Rotten or Carnallitic Marl) **Boulby Halite Formation (formerly Middle Halite in Durham area) **Seaham Formation (formerly Upper Magnesian Limestone - calcareous mudstone) **Seaham Residue & Fordon Evaporite Formation (Edlington Formation in Stockton area (formerly Permian Middle Marls)) **Roker Formation (formerly Hartlepool Anydrite & Roker Dolomite) **Ford Formation (formerly Middle Magnesian Limestone) **Raisby Formation (formerly Lower Magnesian Limestone) **Marl Slate Formation (formerly Marl Slate) *Rotliegendes Group (Permian) **Yellow Sands Formation (formerly Basal Permian (Sands &) Breccia) The Yellow Sands Formation comprises aeolian dune-bedded sandstones. The Yellow Sands Formation continues to be worked for building sand. These are overlain by the thin bituminous limestones of the 'Marl Slate' representing the start of a series of inundations of the area by rising sea levels. It contains abundant fish remains.Lawrence, D.J.D et al 2004 Durham Geodiversity Audit, Durham; Durham County Council p20 The sequence from the Marl Slate up to and including the Seaham Formation was formerly known as the Magnesian Limestone. The 'Zechstein Group' replaced the former Don, Aislaby, Teesside, Staintondale and Eskdale groups. Several of these units have proved economically valuable. Anhydrite was sourced beneath Hartlepool and gypsum near Darlington. The Magnesian Limestone forms a broken west-facing scarp running from the western edge of Sunderland southwards through Houghton-le-Spring and Hetton-le-Hole to Coxhoe where its outcrop is offset to the west by the Butterknowle Fault. English Nature has defined this part of the county east of the scarp where the sequence is exposed at or near the surface, as the 'Durham Magnesian Limestone Plateau' in its assessment of 'character areas'.http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/publications/nca/default.aspx The occurrence of gypsum and anhydrite reflects the extreme nature of the evaporation of the shallow Zechstein Sea on occasion though such evaporites are economically valuable. They also present constraints on development as ongoing subterranean solution of these deposits causes occasional catastrophic ground collapse. Similar solution in Palaeogene times has created 'collapse breccias' of overlying strata. Dolomite from the Roker Formation has been quarried for building construction along the Durham coast. It has sometimes been referred to as 'Cannonball Rock' due to the appearance of calcitic concretions in certain beds. St Oswald's Church in Hartlepool is constructed from this stone.King, A. 2012 Strategic Stone Study: a building stone study of County Durham, Tyne and Wear & Cleveland English Heritage =Permian intrusive rocks= The Whin Sill and associated igneous dykes were intruded into the existing sedimentary sequence during the early Permian around 295 Ma.Lawrence, D.J.D. et al 2004 Durham Geodiversity Audit Durham, Durham County Council The thickness of the quartz-dolerite sill averages about 30m. The sill underlies the larger part of the county at depth and appears to extend beneath the North Sea to the east. Thermal metamorphism has altered the surrounding strata, the 'country rocks', to a distance of tens of metres or more. One such is the Sugar Limestone of upper Teesdale which weathers in characteristic fashion and hosts a rare assemblage of plants. Mudstones in contact with the sill have been altered into hornfels, known locally as 'whetstone'.Lawrence, D.J.D et al 2004 Durham Geodiversity Audit Durham; Durham County Council p20 The presence of the Whin Sill gives rise to High Force where the River Tees drops in spectacular fashion over this erosion-resistant rock. The Little Whin Sill is a thinner, more geographically restricted intrusion of dolerite of similar age outcropping in upper Weardale. A quarry near High Force in upper Teesdale works the dolerite (or 'whinstone') of the Whin Sill for roadstone, aggregate and as larger blocks for coastal protection purposes. =Northern Pennine Orefield= The Northern Pennine Orefield comprises an extended network of veins and 'flats' developed within the Carboniferous sedimentary sequence and is considered one of the finest examples of Mississippi Valley type orefields. Epigenetic mineralisation (i.e. mineralisation at a shallow level) of veins and faults took place shortly after emplacement of the Whin Sill at the start of the Permian Period.Lawrence, D.J.D. et al 2004 Durham Geodiversity Audit, Durham; Durham County Council p20 Mining for lead, copper and zinc has taken place over several centuries across these uplands.http://www.northpennines.org.uk/Lists/DocumentLibrary/Attachments/175//GeodiversityAudit.pdf North Pennines AONB geodiversity audit PDFStone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) pp200-205 Palaeogene Volcanism centred on western Scotland took place during the Palaeogene Period and resulted in the intrusion of innumerable dykes, one of which is the Cleveland Dyke which extends from Galloway through County Durham to the North York Moors. This intrusion of basaltic andesite which is up to 30m wide in places has been dated to 55.8+/- 0.9MaBGS p184  Structure  The broad structure of the Alston Block has been described in the Devonian section above. The block is itself cut north to south a by a complex structure known as the 'Burtreeford Disturbance' which comprises both faults and folds.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) p154 To the east of the block the cover of late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic rocks dip into the North Sea Basin.  Quaternary  =Glacial legacy= Much of the county is mantled with a layer of glacial till though this thinner on the higher ground in the west. There are also spreads of glacially derived sand and gravel, especially across part of the lower ground in the east. Alluvium deposited by rivers occupies the floors of valleys such as that of the Wear whilst river terraces are frequent in the Tees valley. Lacustrine clays and silts occur in parts of the east where for example, towards the end of the last ice age, Glacial Lake Wear and Glacial Lake Edderacres formed as drainage eastwards was blocked by an icesheet occupying the North Sea.Stone et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey) pp226-227 =Post- glacial= Peat has developed extensively across the higher ground of the North Pennines. A variety of coastal deposits are found around the Tees estuary and up the coast to Hartlepool and beyond.

In any case, more often than not, the biological interest is dependent upon the geological interest as at Wingate Quarry LNR north of Trimdon Grange village where 'Magnesian Limestone grassland' may be found =Sites of Special Scientific Interest= Numerous SSSIs include citations referring to their geological interest. The extensive Moorhouse and Cross Fell SSSI (shared with Cumbria) is one of the most important for a range of subjects. Natural England and other conservation bodies own and manage these locations. The Durham Coast is one such which is designated in part for its coastal geomorphology. Bodies such as the North Pennines AONB Partnership and Durham County Council have published local geodiversity action plans (or 'LGAPs') which summarise an area's geological interests and propose various measures to conserve what is perceived to be valuable.http://www.northpennines.org.uk/Lists/DocumentLibrary/Attachments/66//GAP_Final_PDF.pdf =North Pennines AONB Geopark= The North Pennines AONB was designated as Britain's first European Geopark in 2003 partly in acknowledgement of its geological and geomorphological interest.

It was located in Mission Hills, California, adjacent to Mission San Fernando Rey de España. The Vincentian Fathers were primarily responsible for staffing the school until 1973 when it was staffed by priests of the Los Angeles Archdiocese. Following closure, the western school campus became the home of Bishop Alemany High School, whose campus was severely damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  History  = Early years (1953-1963) = The campus was opened in 1953 as the successor to Los Angeles College (see Daniel Murphy High School). The school, which operated as a boarding school, offered 6 years of study, (four years of high school, two years of college) at which point graduates matriculated to St. John’s Seminary. In 1961, with the opening of the four-year St. John’s Seminary College in Camarillo, California, OLQA became a four-year high school institution. = Expansion and contraction (1963–1972) = Following a steady increase in students in the late 1950s and the resulting overcrowding, OLQA engaged in an ambitious expansion program, opening a second, adjacent campus in 1964 that effectively doubled the size of the school. The new campus contained eight dormitories; six class rooms, a separate chapel and a recreation room. With this addition, the original campus became known as the West Side, the new campus as the East Side. Although the overcrowding problem was solved, the school soon suffered a steep decline in the number of students, a reflection of national seminary trends following the Second Vatican Council. As a result, the East Side was last used as a separate campus in the 1967-1968 school year. Its use as classroom space continued until the 1970-1971 school year when it was closed. At the present time, the former East Side campus is used as the Administrative Office of the San Fernando pastoral region of the Los Angeles Archdiocese and as a preschool. = 1973 to closure = With the departure of the Vincentian Fathers, OLQA entered a new era under the administration of diocesan priests appointed by the Cardinal Archbishop. During these years, Spanish replaced Latin in the curriculum by the late 1970s, and there were increased opportunities for off-campus community service. The athletics program was expanded with intramural competition for the first time in the school’s history. This era also saw a dramatic increase in minority enrollment that truly reflected the multicultural diversity of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. After the establishment of the Diocese of Orange in 1976, the school served students from that diocese. By the 1994-1995 class, enrollment was down to 150 students and the campus was being shared with nearby Alemany High School, whose campus had been damaged in the Northridge earthquake. Due to the decline in enrollment, the lack of students advancing to the priesthood, and the increasing financial pressure on the archdiocese, the decision was made to close the campus, effective July 1, 1995.

The Art of Prehistoric Textile Making.. Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, 2016-03-01 (Reviewed by Raylene McCalman) (page number needed)  History of excavation  In 1993, initial stages of new road development revealed traces of several graves throughout the land slated for construction.Mannering, U. and Ræder Knudsen, L. The Hammerum Woman. NESAT XI conference proceeding. Seven graves were discovered upon further excavation. Four of these showed little historical significance; the three remaining graves, contained organic materials that would prompt further analysis. These graves were transferred to Herning Museum in complete blocks of earth to preserve any hidden materials for further study, and were fully excavated and analysed after 2008, when further funding was available.  Graves 8 and 100  Of the three graves brought to Herning Museum, Grave 8 was the only one excavated upon arrival; archaeologists discovered within an isolated but well-preserved wooden coffin.http://www.museummidtjylland.dk/index.php/hammerum-pigen.html Several samples were taken from the coffin for study. These wood samples have so far yielded two very different ranges for the date of the grave: 3355-3103 BCE and 375-203 BCE. This notable discrepancy has been attributed to either a mistake made during conservation treatment or a related issue during excavation and has yet to be fully resolved. Grave 100, excavated in 2008, contained several subjects of interest: an as yet indeterminable organic substance, remains of human hair arranged in such a design as to indicate a female wearer, and sparse remains of animal hide. While the bones of the deceased had already decomposed, their shadow remained imprinted in the grave and thus revealed the position of its lost occupant; the body had been lying on its left side with its legs bent before its chest. The significance of this pose has not yet been researched.  The Hammerum Girl  In Grave 83, similarly to Grave 100, the only remains of the deceased is a preserved complex coiffure; this, combined with the size of the grave, indicates that the deceased was either a large girl or a young woman. The grave has thus been labelled the Hammerum Girl. The grave contains unusually well-preserved clothing. Twelve threads of its wool fibers have been analyzed to determine the date and to discover information about the Hammerum Girl and her society. The threads have been dated to 78-313 CE, closely matching the date of the coffin lid, which has been identified as between 73-313 CE; the dating of the Hammerum Girl’s hair has returned with a range of 1-130 CE; the discrepancies between this date and that of the clothing and coffin lid have been attributed to possible contamination of the hair sample during analysis. The dating of Grave 8 has proven close to that of the Hammerum Girl. The condition of the Hammerum Girl’s textiles\\"Life and Identity in Scandinavia in the 1st and 2nd Century AD. - The Lønne Hede project\\". Centre for Textile Research\\" , Danish National Research Foundation. is in contrast to that from previous grave sites from the Roman Iron Age which have lacked well-preserved samples. Three pieces of clothing have been identified; one is a dress and another as a scarf. The dress material indicates several details about the style of the time period; it is colored, including red, and is covered with decorative scales. However, analyses of the fabric have provided no evidence of dyed threads, so the source of the coloration is unknown. The quality of the wool clothing varies among the pieces. The dress and scarf contain the largest amount of fine fibers, although coarser fibers were sorted from each item before spinning, demonstrating a relative care for their construction. Studies of the wool have traced the material to sheep who would have pastured in Denmark; the sparse remains of animal hide also located in the grave that appear to originate in Norway or Bornholm. Studies of the cereal pollen in the wool show a percentage of about 12%; one explanation for its presence is that the Hammerum Girl might have worn these clothes while preparing grain. These clothes may then represent everyday wear and illustrate common fashion for women of the settlement.\\"Roman style in Iron Age Jutland\\". Danish Roman Re-enactment Group. Alternate theories include the possibility of a cereal offering placed by mourners atop the Hammerum Girl’s body upon her burial, or a threshing ritual at the funeral.Enevold, Renée. \\"Pollen studies of textile material from an Iron Age grave at Hammerum, Denmark.\\" Journal of Archaeological Science 40.4 (2013): 1838–1844. Print. These proposals have been shown to be less likely because similar pollen has not been found in the surrounding earth. The burial contained none of the metal objects that often act as grave goods; besides the wool clothing, three ceramic shards and one bone pin were discovered. The bone pin is believed to be baleen due to analyses of its bromine content. In 2014 the Hammerum Girl is located at Herning Museum, where her clothing has been kept in its original position in the grave for display to the museum’s visitors.  The surrounding landscape  The organic materials located in each of the graves at Hammerum, combined with further study of the area itself, have shed light on the surrounding landscape during the late Roman Iron Age. Analyses of the pollen found in the soil layer around the Hammerum Girl’s clothing have revealed that hazel trees were prominent in certain dry zones; red alder would have appeared around a nearby stream. Heaths and meadows dominated the open areas that remained free from trees. The pollen found on the Hammerum Girl’s clothing indicates that fields reserved specifically for agriculture would have had their place in the landscape.  Further reading  * Kjerulff, A.-K. og L. R.

Flint Taylor (born April 16, 1946) is an American human rights and civil rights attorney based in Chicago, Illinois, who has litigated many high- profile police brutality, government misconduct and death penalty cases. Taylor has pursued public interest law to take on allegations of corrupt police tactics and wrongful convictions in the city of Chicago and elsewhere. Taylor was part of a team of negotiators in the 2015 landmark decision by the City of Chicago to award reparations to the survivors of police torture, becoming the first municipal government to do so.  Early life and family  George Flint Taylor, Jr. was born in Farmington, Maine, and was named after his paternal great-grandfather George Flint, a Maine state senator. Taylor's father was a direct descendant of several English Pilgrims who came to Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the Mayflower in 1620. Taylor graduated from Westborough (MA) High School, where he won ten varsity letters in basketball, football, and baseball. He graduated from Brown University with an American History degree in 1968, and from the Northwestern University School of Law in 1972.  Career  During his second year in law school at Northwestern, Taylor began to work with a group of lawyers who were representing counterculture political groups, including the Black Panther Party (BPP), the Young Lords Organization, Rising Up Angry and the Weathermen. In August 1969, these lawyers, together with two other law students, established the People's Law Office (PLO) on the north side of Chicago. = Fred Hampton Black Panther case = One of Taylor's most notable cases involved litigation over the death of Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton, killed in what was reported by police as a shootout at his apartment. Taylor and his colleagues at the People's Law Office filed a civil rights suit following a raid on December 4, 1969, conducted by fourteen Chicago police officers, at the direction of Cook County State's Attorney Edward Hanrahan. The officers entered an apartment on Chicago's West Side, shooting and killing Hampton and Black Panther activist Mark Clark, and wounding four others. Taylor, together with several other People's Law Office lawyers and staff, were called to the apartment by survivors. For the next ten days they collected evidence at the scene.Haas 2009, p. 289-293. This evidence was ultimately turned over to FBI ballistics expert Robert Zimmers, who determined that of the more than 90 bullets fired, all but one were fired by the police. Thousands of Chicago citizens toured the apartment while the evidence was being taken. One older black woman observed that it \\"wasn't nothing but a Northern lynching.\\"Haas 2009, p. 91. In 1970, Taylor and his colleagues sued a wide range of police and prosecutorial officials for $47.7 million in damages on behalf of the families of Hampton, Clark, and the survivors of the police raid. Upon discovering that the FBI also was involved in the raid, under J. Edgar Hoover's COINTELPRO program, they later named several FBI officials as defendants.Haas 2009, p. 127-131. Taylor worked in cooperation with U. S. Senator Frank Church's (D-Idaho) Committee on Intelligence.Haas 2009, p. 224-230. The Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations concluded in its 1976 report that the BPP raid by the Chicago police was part of a nationwide FBI program called COINTELPRO that was designed to \\"destroy\\" the Black Panther movement.Supplementary Detailed Staff Reports on Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans, Book 3, p. 187-223. In January 1976, the BPP civil lawsuits went to trial with Taylor and law partner Jeffrey Haas as trial counsel. The trial lasted for 18 months, longer than any previous federal court case. During the trial, it was established that the FBI had not turned over 200 volumes of Black Panther documents to defense counsel. Both Taylor and Haas were jailed for contempt when they protested what they claimed were unfair rulings by federal Judge Joseph Sam Perry. At the end of the trial, Judge Perry dismissed the case. Taylor, Haas and colleague Dennis Cunningham appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.Haas 2009, p. 314-322. In April 1979, the Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, overturned the dismissal, holding that the evidence introduced at trial supported the allegations of a conspiracy among the Chicago police, the Cook County State's Attorney, and the FBI against the Black Panther members. The appeals court further ruled that the government should be sanctioned for suppression of the FBI documents and that Taylor and Haas were wrongfully cited for contempt. In 1982, the case was settled for $1.85 million. It was never determined who fired the first shot at the apartment. =Greensboro, North Carolina case= On November 3, 1979, members of the Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi Party, with a former FBI and police informant, Edward Dawson, in the lead car, drove into Greensboro, North Carolina. In the absence of police officers, they fired into a crowd of anti- Klan demonstrators, fatally shooting five and wounding ten others. The demonstrators had gathered at a \\"Death to the Klan\\" march, sponsored by the Communist Workers Party, which had been organizing among mostly black workers in the textile mills. Six men were charged with murder in the state's criminal trial; three of these and another six were charged with criminal civil rights violations in a federal trial. All the Klansmen and Nazi defendants were acquitted in the two separate trials by independent all-white juries. In 1980, a volunteer legal team had filed a civil rights damages case alleging a conspiracy among the Klansmen, Nazis, the Greensboro police, and the FBI in failing to protect protesters when they had knowledge of likely Klan violence. Taylor was one of the lead trial counsel. In the spring of 1985, during a ten- week trial in federal district court in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Taylor and his co-counsel Lewis Pitts and Carolyn MacAllister questioned scores of Nazi, Klan, FBI, police and informant witnesses. At one point in the trial, Taylor interrogated reputed Nazi leader Roland Wayne Wood about five miniature skulls pinned to his lapel. The jury of five whites and one African American was at first deadlocked, then they returned a compromise verdict against some of the defendants. The verdict was cited by the plaintiff legal team as an \\"historic victory\\" because it was the first time that anyone had been held responsible for the killings in the Greensboro Massacre. = Chicago Police torture cases = In 1987, Taylor, Haas and law partner John Stainthorp agreed to represent death row prisoner Andrew Wilson in his pro se civil rights suit. Wilson alleged that he was tortured with electric shock by Area 2 Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge and forced to confess to the 1982 murder of two Chicago police officers, for which he was convicted and sentenced to death. In 1989, Wilson's case went to trial with Taylor, Stainthorp and Haas as trial counsel. During the trial, Taylor received a series of anonymous letters from a person claiming to be an officer who worked with Burge. The anonymous letters asserted that what happened to Wilson was part of a decades-old pattern of police torture, led by Burge, that victimized African-American detainees. These letters led Taylor and his colleagues to other alleged torture victims, but federal court trial Judge Brian Barnett Duff did not permit the jury to hear this evidence; he held Taylor and Haas in contempt of court. After eight weeks of trial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The case was retried later in the year. After a second trial that lasted eight weeks, an all-white jury found Burge not guilty, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the verdict. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that District Court Judge Brian Barnett Duff abused his discretion in allowing the Defendants to delve into the gory details of Taylor's past crimes against police officers despite the fact that it was undisputed that Wilson was convicted of those crimes.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th- circuit/1187980.html In a written opinion by Judge Richard Posner (which was joined by noted Judge Frank Easterbrook), the appellate court heavily criticized Judge Brian Barnett Duff's evidentiary rulings saying, \\"...a district judge has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, especially when balancing intangibles [however], we cannot avoid concluding that the limits of permissible judgment were exceeded. A mass of inflammatory evidence having little or no relevance to the issues in this trial (as distinct from Wilson's murder trial) was admitted, and the defendants' counsel was permitted to harp on it to the jury and thus turn the trial of the defendants into a trial of the plaintiff.\\".https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1187980.html at P.1236 In short, the Appellate Court found that Federal District Judge Duff's rulings were so unfairly prejudicial to Wilson, and stacked the deck against him so much that Wilson had to be granted a new trial. The appellate court reiterated multiple times in its opinion that it was Defendant's alleged torturing of prisoners that was at issue, not Taylor's crimes. Eventually Wilson was awarded more than $1 million in attorney's fees and $100,000 in damages; the $100,000 went to the estate of the officers who were killed in 1982. Over the years, more than 100 men had said they were tortured on the South Side under Burge's watch. In addition to suffering electric shock, they told stories of police putting a loaded gun in their mouth or a typewriter cover over their head to make them believe they would die. On the basis of newly discovered evidence, the Chicago Police Department in 1993 fired Burge, having found that there was \\"systematic\\" torture at Area 2. In 1994, Taylor, together with law partners Joey Mogul and Tim Lohraff, began representing death row inmate Aaron Patterson, who alleged that he was tortured by Burge and his men into a coerced confession. In 2000, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that Patterson was entitled to a new hearing on his claims of torture. In 2003 Illinois Governor George Ryan pardoned Patterson and three others on Illinois' death row, saying their torture claims proved the criminal justice system was \\"terribly broken.\\" He had already conducted a three-year review of the justice system and was disturbed to learn that 13 men on death row had been exonerated as innocent. In 2000 he declared a moratorium on use of the death penalty. Taylor, with partners Mogul and Ben Elson, also represented police torture victims Darrell Cannon and Michael Tillman, winning Cannon's freedom in 2007 and Tillman's in 2010. In 2011, Taylor and his colleagues obtained the first judicial decision holding former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley as a defendant in a civil police torture case, alleging a citywide conspiracy to cover it up. Taylor and his associates played a significant role in the decades-long campaign to obtain criminal charges against Burge. In October 2008, Burge was indicted by a federal grand jury for lying in a civil case about torturing suspects. He was convicted in June 2010, and subsequently sentenced to 4½ years in federal prison. Burge was released from prison on October 2, 2014, to spend the remainder of his sentence at a halfway house near his Tampa, Florida, retirement home. Burge will still collect his Chicago police pension. The day Burge was released from prison, Taylor, Mogul, colleagues from the Chicago Torture Justice Memorials (CTJM), and survivors of Chicago police torture, joined by 26 aldermen, urged the Chicago City Council to pass an ordinance to earmark $20 million in reparations to the victims of police torture in Area 2. The ordinance was conceived by noted Chicago civil rights attorney Standish Willis and drafted by CTJM co-founder Joey Mogul. It was the product of years of political organizing by grassroots organizations that included CTJM and Black People Against Police Torture. \\"With a majority of the aldermen on board for this ordinance, the powers that be in this city should take it seriously,\\" Taylor told reporters. \\"There's definitely a political downside for the mayor (Rahm Emanuel) if he doesn't step forward and step forward quickly.\\" = Historic reparations award = For more than a year, the reparations ordinance, which had been introduced by Aldermen co-sponsors Joe Moreno and Howard Brookins Jr. in October 2013, had been stalled in the Chicago City Council. Political pressure began to build during the run-up to the 2015 Chicago mayoral primary. Mayor Rahm Emanuel was seeking a second term in office and faced four challengers, two of whom were African American. CTJM, Amnesty International, and other activists collected 40,000 signatures, which they delivered to Emanuel's office in December 2014, suggesting growing public support for the proposal. After a 2015 Valentine's Day Rally that attracted hundreds of supporters, a team of negotiators that included Taylor, fellow People's Law partner Mogul, and advocates from CTJM, and Amnesty International began negotiations with the city of Chicago's corporation counsel, Stephen Patton, on the terms of the reparations ordinance. The city's initial offer did not include any direct payments to victims or their families, a demand on which the team of negotiators refused to yield. Talks at first were strained. Various aldermen and staffers from the mayor's office and the law department got involved, and a compromise that would include financial payments to living victims, but not to the families of those who had died, was eventually brokered. In May 2015, a month after Emanuel was re-elected, Chicago aldermen unanimously approved a 5.5-million-dollar reparations package, agreeing to compensate the approximately 60 living victims with valid claims of torture while in police custody during Burge's command, each to receive up to $100,000. Additionally, the living survivors, their immediate families, and the immediate families of the deceased torture victims would all gain access to services, including psychological counseling and free tuition to the City Colleges of Chicago. The aldermen also approved building a public memorial to the deceased victims. They also established a requirement that Chicago public schools teach students in the eighth and tenth grades about the Burge legacy of police brutality. At the May Council meeting, in the presence of more than a dozen survivors, Emanuel offered an official apology on behalf of the City of Chicago, and the aldermen stood and applauded them. Taylor stated in an interview that the \\"non-financial reparations make it truly historic.\\" Darrell Cannon, one of those who will receive reparations for his coerced confession under torture, spent 24 years in prison, including nine years in the Illinois supermax prison, Tamms Correctional Center. He told The Guardian that the reparations package \\"is something that sets a precedent that has never been done in the history of America. Reparations given to black men tortured by some white detectives. It's historic.\\" On Chicago becoming the first city to offer restitution to victims of police misconduct, Taylor articulated his hope that this will be a \\"beacon for other cities here and across the world for dealing with racist police brutality so prevalent in the past in this country.\\"  Honors and awards  In March 2002, Chicago magazine named Taylor to its list of the city's \\"30 Tough Lawyers\\". Other awards include: * 2014 IVI-IPO Legal Eagle Award, given annually to lawyers who have advanced the cause of justice. 2014: The IVI-IPO's Legal Eagle Award, given annually to lawyers who have advanced the cause of justice, was presented to G.

Ming Jr. Award for \\"outstanding and substantial contribution to the causes of civil rights and individual liberties.\\" * 1977 – Operation PUSH Letter of Commendation \\"Advocate For Our Freedom\\"  U.S. Supreme Court decisions  Taylor's first case before the U.S. Supreme Court was in 1980, when Taylor, Haas and Cunningham successfully defended the Court of Appeals' decision in the Fred Hampton case against several petitions for certiorari. In 1985, Taylor successfully argued before the Court that federal prison guards should not be given immunity from civil rights liability when they sit on prison disciplinary committees. In 1993, he argued a case in which the Court created an exception to a prosecutor's absolute immunity from suit.  Other significant cases  In the early 1980s, Taylor worked with New Orleans civil rights attorney Mary Howell to obtain a multi-million-dollar settlement in a series of civil rights cases that arose from the alleged torture and killing of several African Americans by New Orleans police officers in the Algiers section of the city. Taylor also worked in the mid 80's with People's Law Office colleagues Cunningham, Haas, Stainthorp, Michael Deutsch and Peter Schmiedel on the \\"street files\\" cases, during which Chicago police detective Frank Laverty brought to light the Chicago Police Department's secret filing system in which detectives concealed evidence that supported a criminal defendant's innocence. = Ford Heights Four = In the late 1990s, Taylor joined Wyoming attorney Jerry Spence, now Federal Judge Matthew Kennelly, and former Northwestern School of Law professor Lawrence Marshall to obtain a $36-million-dollar wrongful conviction settlement for four men, who each served more than a decade behind bars for the 1978 murder of a couple in Ford Heights, Illinois, a suburb just south of Chicago. The Ford Heights Four were freed after DNA tests proved they were innocent. The Chicago Tribune quotes Taylor describing the case as another example of \\"outrageous police misconduct and prosecutorial misconduct.\\" The newspaper reported: > By settling the lawsuits--which named as defendants the Cook County > sheriff's office and five individual officers--the county avoided what > promised to be a lengthy trial with embarrassing revelations about law > enforcement work that was at best shoddy and at worst corrupt ... If any new > investigation does get launched in the case, it will mark a dramatic > departure from the stance previously taken by [Cook County] law-enforcement > officials, who have strongly resisted tackling the issue of individual > accountability for what happened in the Ford Heights Four case.\\" = Ryan Harris case = In 1998, the Chicago police accused a seven-year-old boy, along with his eight-year-old friend, of the murder and sexual assault of an 11-year-old girl, Ryan Harris. The boys were exonerated after DNA evidence established that neither boy could have committed the crimes. In 2005, Taylor and his law colleagues Jan Susler and Stainthorp obtained a multi-million- dollar settlement for the seven-year-old defendant. Taylor remarked to reporters that the case showed \\"systemic misconduct\\" from the top to the bottom of the Chicago police department. When the children were brought in for questioning, Taylor noted, \\"No one said, 'Show me how these kids could have done that.' No one was ever disciplined for it. Everyone walked away.\\" The Ryan Harris case resulted in changes to Illinois law to protect the rights of juvenile suspects. A lawyer must now be in the room when Illinois children under age 13 charged with murder or sex crimes are interrogated. Chicago police also now require a parent or guardian's presence when kids under age 13 are suspected of any felony and are interrogated.  Writing, media, and testimony before official bodies  Taylor contributes to a variety of academic journals, legal publications, additional text. and online blogs, including The Nation and Huffington Post, on the subjects of police misconduct and racism. Both of Chicago's major newspapers have published opinion pieces by Taylor, who remains a harsh critic of Chicago's efforts in fixing accountability for police mistakes and misconduct. He has testified on these topics before the Chicago City Council,Cook County Board,U.S. Congressional Committees, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. When, in July 2006, Cook County Special Prosecutor Edward Egan failed to indict Burge for perjury and instead issued a report after four years of investigation of torture cases, Taylor publicly criticized the Special Prosecutor's failure to indict and called the report a cover-up that whitewashed the role of Richard M. Daley and other high ranking police and prosecutorial officials. Egan responded to Taylor's criticism in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. He questioned Taylor's motives, saying his main interest was making money. Taylor has continued to be a public advocate in the effort to hold Daley accountable for police abuses during his watch. In March 2014, along with colleague Locke Bowman, Taylor filed a lawsuit accusing members of the Daley family of joining in a civil rights conspiracy with numerous high-ranking police and prosecutorial officials to cover-up facts in the case of David Koschman, who died in April 2004, after an altercation with former Mayor Daley's nephew, Richard J. \\"R.J.\\" Vanecko.

Whitney (1873 – 16 July 1949) was an American railway worker who became president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT). He was an influential labor leader during the Great Depression and World War II, and in the years immediately following the war. He was the principal leader of a two- day railroad strike in May 1946 that paralyzed the nation. Early years Alexander E. Whitney was born in Iowa in 1873. In 1888 he started to work for Illinois Central Railroad. The Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen (BRT) was organized on 23 September 1883, and later moved its headquarters to Cleveland, Ohio. The BRT restricted membership to whites. Whitney joined the Brotherhood in 1898. He was appointed a vice president in 1907. Whitney was elected president of the Brotherhood on 1 July 1928. He succeeded William Granville Lee. Depression era labor leader Whitney took office at the start of the Great Depression. A Department of Labor study of veteran railway employees showed that between July 1929 and April 1933 two thirds reported that their earnings had dropped by at least 20%, and two fifths said earnings had dropped by 30% or more. This did not count workers who had lost their jobs. By the spring of 1933 the national unemployment rate was 25%. However, Whitney and other labor leaders were opposed to Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a government relief program that provided simple jobs paying $1 per day. He said the CCC, \\"would place Government's endorsement upon poverty at a bare subsistence level.\\" Whitney soon became an important public figure, representing the trainmen in many discussions with government and business. During his tenure the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen grew to 215,000 members. From 1932 to 1934 Whitney was chairman of the Railway Labor Executives' Association. David B. Robertson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen stepped down in 1932 to devote more time to his union, and Whitney was elected his successor. In 1932 Whitney was among the labor leaders whom the American Federation of Labor was considering endorsing for the position of Secretary of Labor in Roosevelt's government, although Daniel J. Tobin of the Teamsters came to be favored. In the end the president selected Frances Perkins, who took office on 5 March 1933. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in 1933, he appointed a committee to draw up new legislation for the railroads. Their draft included various measures to improve efficiency. On 3 April 1933 Whitney said the plan could throw from 50,000 to 350,000 men out of work, and would violate contracts related to security of employment. He called for guarantees that the government would ensure absorptive employment, consult with the unions on any changes and prevent carriers from interfering with labor's right to organize. The Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 16 June 1933 essentially met these conditions, and was seen by the union leaders as a great victory. In September 1933 Whitney attended a conference in Chicago organized by the League for Independent Political Action, and was one of the signatories to the call for a new political order. It said \\"We the masses of the people must rise up and win economic and political control. We must organize to establish a new social order, a scientifically planned system. We must own and control the means of production and distribution.\\" The Farmer-Labor Political Federation was founded at the conference, headed by Thomas Ryum Amlie. Despite this radical position, Amlie was strongly opposed to Communism, and communists were not welcome in the federation. In 1935 Whitney was a co-sponsor of the Railroad Retirement Act. At times, the BRT came into conflict with other unions. Thus, in 1937 Whitney informed mayor Fiorello La Guardia of New York City that the BRT planned to start organizing Independent Subway System (ISS) motormen and conductors. At first, LaGuardia said he had no objection. Then it emerged that the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen was also thinking of organizing the ISS workers, and that the non-segregated Amalgamated Association of Street Railway and Motor Coach Employees might be more appropriate given the number of black ISS conductors. World War II Whitney and Alvanley Johnston, leader of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), often worked together. They backed Harry S. Truman in his 1940 Senate race, putting up most of the money for his campaign. Truman was a long-time friend of Whitney but disliked Johnston, whom he called a \\"damned Republican.\\" In 1943, during World War II (1939-1945), the government seized the railroads. Johnston and Whitney were made labor consultants. Whitney favored James F. Byrnes as vice-presidential candidate in Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1944 campaign for re-election, until it became clear that Roosevelt preferred Truman. He wrote to a colleague on 12 July 1944, \\"our friend, Jimmy Byrnes ... will not only strengthen the ticket if nominated ... but [is] a man who will fill this high office with dignity.\\" In the 1944 Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 19–21 July 1944 he threw his weight behind Truman. 1945-46 Strike After the war ended, towards the end of 1945 Whitney and the leaders of the other main railroad unions demanded pay increases and a forty-hour work week from the railroad companies, in line with other industries. Negotiations stalled in January 1946. Three of the unions were willing to suspend their demands, but Johnston and Whitney called a strike of the Engineers and Trainmen to start on 16 March 1946. President Truman set up a board to hear the grievances and make recommendations. Negotiations broke down in April, and Whitney and Johnston set 18 May 1946 as the strike date. Whitney's union represented 211,000 trainmen and Johnston represented 78,000 engineers. They could halt all railway traffic nationwide. Truman felt betrayed, writing on 17 May 1946 \\"Lewis, Whitney, Johnston, Murray and all other labor leaders made me certain promises when I took over. They all lied to me.\\" Three days before the deadline for the strike, Truman met Whitney and Johnston in the Oval Office. He told them, \\"If you think I'm going to sit here and let you tie up this whole country, you're crazy as hell.\\" Whitney apologized but said \\"We've got to go through with this, Mr. President. Our men are demanding it.\\" Truman responding by saying that if the labor leaders did not make a settlement within two days he would take over the railroads. The day before the walkout was due Truman seized the railroads by executive order as he had promised. Whitney and Johnston again agreed to postpone the strike for five days. However, after hearing Truman's compromise pay offer their members voted to go on strike on 23 May 1946. The strike stranded travelers, prevented movement of perishable goods and caused concern that many people in war-devastated Europe would starve if grain shipments were delayed. Truman broadcast an appeal to the strikers to return to work, saying \\"It is inconceivable that in our democracy any two men should be placed in a position where they can completely stifle our economy and ultimately destroy our country.\\" He threatened to call out the army to end the strike. On 25 May Truman was addressing Congress, calling for drastic legislation under which strikers could be drafted into the army, when word came that the strikers had accepted his terms and the strike had ended. Later career In the immediate aftermath of the May 1946 strike Whitney was reported to have said the Brotherhood would use all of its capital of $47 million to defeat Truman if he sought reelection. After Henry A. Wallace was dismissed from the Truman administration in September 1946, Whitney was among the labor leaders who considered supporting him as a presidential candidate in the 1948 election. Later, Whitney and most other labor leaders abandoned Wallace as being too far to the left. Whitney was a bitter opponent of Senator Robert A. Taft, saying that his Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 would put the U.S. \\"one step from Hitler's form of government.\\" After the Taft-Hartley bill was passed despite Truman's veto, on 20 July 1947 Whitney said that Truman's veto of the bill had \\"vindicated him in the eyes of labor\\". He ruled out Wallace, saying a third party was now \\"out of the question.\\" A spokesman for the Brotherhood said \\"our Brotherhood will throw all its resources behind President Truman and his Administration in an effort to elect a Congress which will back the President's liberal program.\\" Alexander F.

The band has been inactive since 2011, due to personal issues between the band members. In April 2015, lead singer Warrel Dane confirmed that Nevermore had not disbanded, and there was a possibility for them to continue in the next two years with another album. However, Dane died in December 2017; this ended hopes of a reunion. History =Early years (1992–93)= Nevermore started in the beginning of the 1990s, when the band Sanctuary was pressured by its recording label to change its musical style, switching from heavy metal to grunge, which was obtaining mainstream success at the time due to bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam (both, incidentally, also from Seattle). Two members of the band – vocalist Warrel Dane and bassist Jim Sheppard — did not agree with the change, and thus proceeded to create a project of their own: Nevermore. =Nevermore, In Memory and The Politics of Ecstasy (1994–96)= By the end of 1994, the band assumed a stable lineup, which saw the additions of drummer Van Williams and former Sanctuary touring guitarist Jeff Loomis. In 1995 Nevermore released its debut album through Century Media Records. This album received much attention and specialized review, as its release was followed by a European tour with Blind Guardian and a North American tour with Death. Second guitarist Pat O'Brien joined the band prior to the release of the EP In Memory and also took part in the recording of the subsequent album The Politics of Ecstasy, both from 1996. O'Brien left Nevermore to play in Cannibal Corpse and Curran Murphy from Shatter Messiah was enlisted as a touring guitarist for the band until Tim Calvert (who played for the band Forbidden) was able to join the band. =Dreaming Neon Black and Dead Heart in a Dead World (1999–2001)= Three years without releases followed, but in 1999, the album Dreaming Neon Black was released. The album's lyrics, based partly on the events Warrell Dane underwent after the disappearance of his longtime girlfriend, narrate the story of a man's slow decline into madness, subsequent to the death of the only woman he ever loved. The tracks of this album are varied in style, ranging from slow and melodic to aggressive and progressive. A long tour followed with Nevermore sharing stages with bands such as Mercyful Fate, Arch Enemy, Iced Earth, and Opeth. After the end of the tour, in 2000, guitarist Tim Calvert announced his departure from the band, subsequent to his marriage. Instead of finding a replacement, the band decided to continue as a quartet, hiring session guitarists for live appearances, such as Curran Murphy (who went on to play in Annihilator) and Jag Panzer's Chris Broderick. Nevermore proceeded to record Dead Heart in a Dead World, which was followed by tours with several bands, most notably with In Flames and Shadows Fall in late 2000 and Savatage in 2001. =Enemies of Reality and This Godless Endeavor (2003–07)= The band's fifth album, Enemies of Reality, remained in production for over a year, and was released in 2003. This album faced much criticism for its production and was re-released in 2005, after being remixed by Andy Sneap. On tour, the band was joined by second lead guitarist Steve Smyth, formerly of Vicious Rumors and Testament; Smyth was eventually added to the line-up on a permanent basis. A sixth album, This Godless Endeavor, was released in July 2005. Nevermore then toured on Dave Mustaine's Gigantour during the summer of 2005. In 2006, they toured with Disturbed and also as direct support to In Flames on the second leg of its North American tour. 2006 held a bit of bad luck for Nevermore, as bassist Jim Sheppard underwent a procedure for Crohn's disease, which he has suffered from for over 15 years, and guitarist Steve Smyth was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, and had to get a kidney transplant. Warrel Dane had previously developed type 2 diabetes, and the band was forced to cancel their show in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on May 13, 2006, due to an unspecified illness afflicting Dane. =Solo work and The Year of the Voyager (2006–08)= On September 12, 2006, Nevermore was supposed to record its first full length DVD live at the Zeche club in Bochum, Germany. This event was to be captured by 7 cameras and the live recording was to be produced by Andy Sneap. However, according to Nevermore's official website, on the day of the show, Warrel Dane fell ill with an infection, eventually resulting in the necessity of seeing a doctor at a hospital in Dortmund, Germany. Doctors insisted that he be kept at the hospital and the show was canceled that evening. Apologetic to their fans, Nevermore agreed with the local venue to perform the show on October 11, 2006. The double DVD set would also include a Nevermore documentary, all of the band's promo videos and past recordings from their 11-year career. The DVD was released on October 20, 2008, and is entitled The Year of the Voyager. On August 30, 2007, it was announced that Steve Smyth would no longer be a member of the band, citing personal and business reasons for the departure. He stated that he would also be touring with Danish metal band Hatesphere as they supported Behemoth and later Dimmu Borgir, and would also be working on the release of The Esseness Project, an all-instrumental progressive rock album. Dane and Loomis entered the studio, each to record a solo album. Dane recorded Praises to the War Machine and Loomis recorded Zero Order Phase, both released in 2008. Later that year, the band released their first ever live concert CD/DVD titled The Year of the Voyager, the only release to feature veteran touring guitarist Chris Broderick, who departed to join Megadeth. =The Obsidian Conspiracy and future (2010)= In an interview with Komodo Rock published in July, Jeff Loomis said that \\"I actually have six or seven songs already for the new Nevermore record. I'm about half way there, and we're going to be going into the studio probably some time in the early fall.\\" Nevermore were one of the first bands to be confirmed for Wacken Open Air 2009, where they performed alongside many bands including Motörhead, DragonForce, and HammerFall. Nevermore entered the studio in August with producer and Soilwork guitarist Peter Wichers to record their long-awaited 7th album The Obsidian Conspiracy. The recording was completed in October 2009 and was released June 8, 2010 in America, and May 31, 2010 in the EU On June 1, 2010, Nevermore announced a North American Tour in Fall with openers Warbringer, Hatesphere, and Blackguard. =Hiatus, possible reunion and deaths (2011–2018)= On April 11, 2011, Nevermore canceled their scheduled North American tour with Symphony X. Later on April 21, 2011, long time and founding members Jeff Loomis and Van Williams announced their departure from Nevermore citing personal and musical differences. In addition, on May 3, 2011, it was announced that Nevermore had canceled their entire Australian tour. However, in July 2011, Warrel Dane announced that Nevermore is not dead, and right now his main focus is on Sanctuary. Warrel Dane also mentioned that it'll be hard to keep Nevermore legacy alive, since Jeff Loomis will be tough to replace. Both Jeff Loomis and Warrel Dane talked about the possibility of a reunion, the latter citing that the band split amicably. Dane went on to say in a later interview, that while he wanted to do another Nevermore record, he would not do it without Jeff Loomis. On December 13, 2017, Dane died of a heart attack in São Paulo, Brazil at the age of 56, putting an end to any possibilities of a Nevermore reunion. Former guitarist Tim Calvert died on April 30, 2018, of complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He was 52.Former Nevermore And Forbidden Guitarist Tim Calvert Dies At 52 Musical style Nevermore's main sound is difficult to categorize, containing various styles such as progressive metal, power metal, modern hard rock, classic heavy metal, and thrash metal. They also have used death metal traits such as low tuned and fast paced riffing. The press have used several other genres to describe Nevermore's sound including groove metal and progressive metal. In an interview on The Hard Report, Warrel Dane casually remarked \\"...power metal, or whatever Metal this is.\\" However, in an interview at Metalmania in 2006, singer Warrel Dane did not explicitly disagree with the many genres the band has been put in over the years, but he stated \\"I don't think we're power metal.\\" Band members ;Final line-up *Warrel Dane – vocals (1992–2011; died 2017) *Jeff Loomis – guitar, backing vocals (1992–2011) *Jim Sheppard – bass (1992–2011) *Van Williams – drums (1994–2011) ;Former members *Mark Arrington – drums (1992–1994) *Pat O'Brien – guitar (1996–1997) *Tim Calvert – guitar (1997–2000; died 2018) *Steve Smyth – guitar (2004–2006) ;Live members *Curran Murphy – guitar (2000–2001, 2003–2004) *Adam Gardner – percussion (1995–1996) *James MacDonough – bass (2006) *Chris Broderick – guitar (2001–2003, 2006–2007) *Tim Johnston – bass (2007) *Attila Vörös – guitar (2010–2011) *Dagna Silesia – bass (2011) =Timeline= Discography ;Studio albums *Nevermore (1995) *The Politics of Ecstasy (1996) *Dreaming Neon Black (1999) *Dead Heart in a Dead World (2000) *Enemies of Reality (2003) *This Godless Endeavor (2005) *The Obsidian Conspiracy (2010) References External links *Nevermore on Myspace Category:Musical groups established in 1991 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2011 Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Washington (state) Category:Century Media Records artists Category:Musical quartets Category:Musical groups from Seattle Category:1991 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Nevermore"},{"id":"40130896","text":"The Şırnak Dam is a gravity dam on the Ortasu River (a tributary of the Hezil River) about southeast of Şırnak town in Şırnak Province, southeast Turkey.

The studio's most recognizable films include Looper (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013) and Bloodshot (2020). History DMG Entertainment began as a film production company that was founded by Dan Mintz, Bing Wu, and Peter Xiao. In the late 2000s, DMG began distribution of non-Chinese films in Chinese theaters, including Twilight and Knowing. Film production was added to DMG's portfolio in 2009, and its first production was The Founding of a Republic (2009). DMG also contributed to the productions of Looper (2012) and Iron Man 3 (2013) and distributed the films in theaters in China. DMG became involved with Looper as Endgame Entertainment's Chinese partner. After the companies closed the deal in January 2011, changes to film production included casting Chinese actress Summer Qing and setting part of the film in Shanghai. DMG's involvement allowed it to distribute the film in China at the same time as its international premiere, where there was usually \\"a blackout period\\" before non-Chinese films could be screened in China. Although Chinese regulators did not grant Looper official co-production status, DMG's involvement with Looper as a Chinese company permitted its distribution of the film. Variety reported, \\"That means that the film could be considered domestically Chinese, which can provide the same benefits as a co-production.\\" DMG also contributed as a production partner for Marvel Studios' Iron Man 3, though Disney and DMG withdrew plans to apply for official co-production status in China. Despite the withdrawal, DMG's involvement resulted in inclusion of various Chinese elements such as the casting of Chinese actor Wang Xueqi and footage shot in Beijing. The companies also edited a different version of Iron Man 3 to be distributed in China. The version included a scene with actor Fan Bingbing and \\"bonus footage specifically for Chinese viewers\\". It was reported that the company benefited from \\"strong connections\\" with Chinese government officials and the state-run film enterprise China Film Group. The trade paper said, \\"The journeys of 'Looper' and 'Iron Man 3' were not exactly smooth, with questions over whether they would qualify as co-productions, which enjoy vital benefits in distribution, immunity from blackout periods and a far greater revenue share.\\" Mintz said DMG's involvement with the films has helped validate its approach to the Chinese film market. According to Variety report, In October 2016, DMG Entertainment acquired film and licensing rights to Brandon Sanderson's “Cosmere\\", a series of interconnected fantasy novels, for future screen adaptation. The company also committed to spending $270 million for the first 3 movies which is about half the budget for the future project. Variety: DMG Nabs Rights to Brandon Sanderson’s ‘Cosmere’ Book Universe in Massive Deal (October 27, 2016) DMG Interactive In 2017, DMG Entertainment launched DMG VR, a new division focused on immersive storytelling. As part of a new project, DMG introduced Arcturus, a DMG subsidiary firm developing interactive VR technologies. Variety: DMG Entertainment Gets Into Virtual Reality In 2016 it became known that, DMG also acquired the VR rights to Hasbro’s Transformers franchise, a live-action attraction and a theme park for Transformers Universe featuring its most notable characters in interactive environment using VR technologies. Hollywood Reporter: Hasbro, DMG Sign Deal to Create Huge 'Transformers' Attraction in China The first \\"digital simulation center\\" started in spring 2017 in Shanghai.

Following the full acquisition of comic publisher Valiant Entertainment in 2018, DMG added two new divisions - Books & Comics and Video Games, that gave DMG control over Valiant’s interactive library, the third largest Universe of over 2,000 superhero characters including “X-O Manowar” and “Bloodshot”. As a result, DMG had a deal with Valiant to produce five movies based on Bloodshot and Harbinger.

Converted from a house into the Royal Pavilion Hotel in the early 19th century, its original role soon changed from a hotel to a pub, in which guise it remained until its closure in September 2019. The building was also used as a court for several years early in its history, and prominent local architect Amon Henry Wilds was responsible for its redesign as a hotel and inn. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance, and it stands within a conservation area. History The fishing and agricultural village of Brighthelmstone, on the Sussex coast in southeast England, grew into the fashionable resort of Brighton from the mid-18th century. Inward investment, good transport links and the popularity of sea-bathing helped it develop \\"all of the facilities that would have been expected\\" of an 18th-century leisure destination. One of the most important was the Castle Inn, converted from a house in 1752 by businessman Samuel Shergold. He recognised that the town's wealthy visitors wanted a focal point near the Old Steine—at that time the centre of Brighton's fashionable life—to meet, socialise and stay. It became the nascent resort's most important social venue, especially after an assembly room and ballroom were added. Within 50 years, though, it had declined, and it was demolished in 1823. This allowed the junction of North Street and Old Steine to be widened, and it took the name Castle Square. Castle Square has been an important commercial area for centuries. The Royal Pavilion Tavern is on the right. By 1780, North Street was \\"the principal commercial street in the town\\", and Castle Square itself became a hub of commercial activity. Despite the decline of the Castle Inn, the area retained its fashionable air, and by the early 19th century a mixed series of buildings had been built on the southern side; despite some later alterations, their layout and essential character remains. One such building was the tall terraced house at number 8. Dating from early in the 19th century, it soon took on a second role. In 1808, the Court of Whalesbone, a Hundred Court (an early form of magistrates' court) moved from the county town of Lewes to the building. Sessions were held on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. After short interludes at the Old Ship Hotel and Brighton's original Town Hall, the court sessions returned between 1823 and 1832. By this time, the building had been converted into the Royal Pavilion Hotel. Described as a \\"family and commercial hotel\\", it aimed for middle-class customers who would previously have considered the Castle Inn. It may have been established as early as 1816, and certainly by 1820. In that year or in 1826, famous local architect Amon Henry Wilds was commissioned to redesign the building. His partner Charles Busby, who worked with him on many buildings in Brighton in the early 19th century, may have assisted him; the pair also worked on 1a Castle Square around the same time. Wilds gave the hotel a typical Regency stuccoed bow front and an intricate balcony featuring the interlinked dolphins which featured on Brighton's coat of arms. The building later changed from a hotel to a conventional inn called the Royal Pavilion Tavern. An early proprietor offended Maria Fitzherbert, the Prince Regent's mistress who lived at Steine House (which backed on to the inn), by putting up a sign on the rear wall which read \\"Gin Palace\\". After she complained, he altered it to \\"Shades\\"—a local term with a similar meaning. That name was recalled in 1991 when the building was substantially refurbished; part of it was converted into a café-bar and restaurant called Shades. A World War II-era bar counter was retrieved from a pub at London Victoria railway station and installed during this refit. The pub was latterly owned and operated by the Mitchells & Butlers chain. On 24 September 2019 the company announced that the pub would close permanently two days later. The building is to be converted for residential use. The Royal Pavilion Tavern and the iron railings outside it were listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 13 October 1952. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. It is also within the Valley Gardens Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. This was designated by Brighton Council in 1973 and covers . Architecture The buildings on the south side of Castle Square are all of a similar age but show a great variety of sizes and styles. The Royal Pavilion Tavern is one of the taller buildings at four storeys in height. The slate-tiled gambrel roof has dormer windows and is partly hidden behind a balustrade which sits on top of a parapet and cornice. The façade is stuccoed and projects as a segmental-arched bow front. The stucco is rusticated at ground-floor level. The entrance is in the rightmost of the three bays and is flanked by granite pilasters topped by brackets with foliage decoration. Above this, an iron balcony runs across the full width of the building at first-floor level; this dates from the late 19th century and has finials in the form of interlinked dolphins and crowns, recalling the Borough of Brighton's emblem. Each storey has three windows, but they are treated in various ways; those at first-floor level have architraves, the second-storey windows have a small individual iron balcony with anthemion decoration; and those on the top floor have prominent sills.
