Shoghi Effendi spent his early life in  ªAkk√° (Acre). His education was directed to serving as secretary and translator to his grandfather,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then leader of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and son of the religion's founder, Bah√° ºu'll√°h. After the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in 1921, the leadership of the Bah√° º√≠ community changed from that of a single individual to an administrative order with executive and legislative branches, the head of each being the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, respectively. Shoghi Effendi was referred to as the Guardian, and had the authority to interpret the writings of the three central figures of the religion and define the sphere of legislative authority. His writings are effectively limited to commentaries on the works of the central figures, and broad directives for the future. Future hereditary Guardians were permitted in the Bah√° º√≠ scripture by appointment from one to the next with the prerequisite that appointees be male descendants of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. At the time of Shoghi Effendi's death, all living male descendants of Bah√° ºu'll√°h had been declared Covenant-breakers by either  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° or Shoghi Effendi, leaving no suitable living candidates. Shoghi Effendi died without appointing a successor Guardian, and the Universal House of Justice, the only institution authorized to adjudicate on situations not covered in scripture, later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi Effendi was the first and last person acknowledged as Guardian of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith.  Background  The young Shoghi, Born in  ªAkk√° in the Acre Sanjak of the Ottoman Empire in March 1897, Shoghi Effendi was related to the B√°b through his father, M√≠rz√° H√°d√≠ Sh√≠r√°z√≠, and to Bah√° ºu'll√°h through his mother, ·∏å√≠y√° º√≠yyih Kh√°num, the eldest daughter of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, who provided much of his initial training, greatly influenced Shoghi Effendi from the early years of his life. Shoghi Effendi learned prayers from his grandfather, who encouraged him to chant.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° also insisted that people address the child as \\"Shoghi Effendi\\", (\\"Effendi\\" signifies \\"Sir\\"), rather than simply as \\"Shoghi\\", as a mark of respect towards him. From his early years, Shoghi Effendi was introduced to the suffering which accompanied the Bah√° º√≠s in  ªAkk√°, including the attacks by M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ against  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. As a young boy, he was aware of the desire of Sultan Abdul Hamid II (reigned 1876-1909) to banish  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to the deserts of North Africa where he was expected to perish. At one point, Shoghi Effendi was warned not to drink coffee in the homes of any of the Bah√° º√≠s in the fear that he would be poisoned. = Tablet from  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° = As the eldest grandson of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Shoghi Effendi from his earliest childhood had a special relationship with his grandfather. According to one account, when Shoghi Effendi was only 5 years old, he pestered his grandfather to write a tablet for him, which was common practice for  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. He wrote the following for his grandson: Shoghi Effendi then set out to memorize a number of prayers, and chanted them as loud as he could. This caused family members to ask  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to quieten him down, a request which he apparently refused. = Education = Shoghi Effendi received his early education at home with the other children in the household, then attended a French Christian Brothers school in Haifa, and later boarded at another Catholic school in Beirut. Shoghi Effendi later attended the Syrian Protestant College (later known as the American University of Beirut) for his final years of high school and first years of university, where he earned an arts degree in 1918. He reports being very unhappy in school and often returned on vacations to Haifa to spend time with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. During his studies, he dedicated himself to mastering English‚Äîadding this language to the Persian, Turkish, Arabic and French languages in which he was already fluent‚Äîso that he could translate the letters of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and serve as his secretary. Shoghi Effendi was protected from World War I due to the neutrality of the Syrian Protestant College. Though political tensions in 1917 meant the college was closed briefly, student life continued. In the summer of 1918  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s life was in critical danger until the entry of General Allenby's troops to Haifa. With the Armistice looming and having completed his studies Shoghi Effendi was ready to return to his grandfather. In the Autumn of 1918 Shoghi Effendi went back to Haifa to assist  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in his mounting correspondence. In a private letter to a friend from late 1918 Shoghi Effendi reflects on the untold sufferings of the War but anticipates that \\"this is indeed the era of service\\". After studying at the American University of Beirut he later went to Balliol College, Oxford, in England, where he matriculated in \\"Economics and Social Sciences\\", while still perfecting his translation skills. Shoghi Effendi was happy during his time in Balliol. Accounts from his contemporaries remember him as a cheerful and popular student. He was acquainted with future British prime minister Anthony Eden but they were not close friends. His studies were interspersed with occasional trips around the United Kingdom to meet Bah√° º√≠ communities. Shoghi Effendi was particularly touched meeting the small group of Bah√° º√≠s from Manchester. During this period Shoghi Effendi began what would be a life-long affinity to aspects of British culture such as reading The Times everyday and his love for English literature. = Death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and Guardianship = Shoghi Effendi before 1940 The issue of successorship to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was in the minds of early Bah√° º√≠s, and although the Universal House of Justice was an institution mentioned by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the institution of the Guardianship was not clearly introduced until the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was publicly read after his death. While studying in England, on 29 November 1921, the news of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s death reached Shoghi Effendi, which, according to Wellesley Tudor Pole, the deliverer of the cable, left him \\"in a state of collapse\\". After spending a couple of days with John Esslemont, and after some passport difficulties, he sailed from England accompanied with Sara Blomfield and his sister Ruhangiz on 16 December and arrived in Haifa on 29 December. A few days later he opened  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Will and Testament, which was addressed to Shoghi Effendi. In the will, Shoghi Effendi found that he had been designated as \\"the Sign of God, the chosen branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God\\". He also learned that he had been designated as this when he was still a small child. As Guardian he was appointed as head of the religion, someone whom the Bah√° º√≠s had to look to for guidance.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Will and Testament is considered one of the three charters of the Bah√° º√≠ administrative order, and in it  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° laid down the authority of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice, the elected governing body of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith that had been written about by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and had not yet been established: Shoghi Effendi later expressed to his wife and others that he had no foreknowledge of the existence of the Institution of Guardianship, least of all that he was appointed as Guardian. The most he expected was perhaps, because he was the eldest grandson,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° might have left instructions as to how the Universal House of Justice was to be elected and he might have been designated as Convener of the gathering which would elect it.  Accomplishments  From the time of his appointment as Guardian until his death the Bah√° º√≠ Faith grew from 100,000 to 400,000 members, capitalizing on prior growth and setting the stage for more, and the countries and territories in which Bah√° º√≠s had representation went from 35 to 250. As Guardian and head of the religion, Shoghi Effendi communicated his vision to the Bah√° º√≠s of the world through his numerous letters and his meetings with pilgrims to Palestine. During the 1920s he first started to systematize and extend the Bah√° º√≠ administration throughout the world; the Bah√° º√≠ community was relatively small and undeveloped when he assumed leadership of the religion, and he strengthened and developed it over many years to support the administrative structure envisioned by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Under Shoghi Effendi's direction, National Spiritual Assemblies were formed, and many thousands of Local Spiritual Assemblies were created. During the 1930s he worked on projects translating the works of Bah√° ºu'll√°h into English. Starting in 1937, he set into motion a series of systematic plans to establish Bah√° º√≠ communities in all countries. A Ten Year Crusade was carried out from 1953 to 1963 with the aim of electing the Universal House of Justice as its paramount aim. Starting in the late 1940s, after the establishment of the State of Israel, he started to develop the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre in Haifa, including the construction of the superstructure of the Shrine of the B√°b and the building of the International Archives as well as beautifying the gardens at Bahji, where the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h is located, as well as developing plans and resources to raise several of the continental Bah√° º√≠ Houses of Worship around the world; these plans continued through the 1950s. In the 1950s he also continued building the Bah√° º√≠ administration, establishing in 1951 the International Bah√° º√≠ Council to act as a precursor to the Universal House of Justice, as well as appointing 32 living Hands of the Cause ‚Äî Bah√° º√≠s appointed to the highest rank of service available, whose main function was to propagate and protect the religion. He also acted as the official representative of the religion to legal authorities in Israel as well as designated other representatives to work with the UN. In a more secular cause, prior to World War II he supported the work of restoration-forester Richard St. Barbe Baker to reforest Palestine, introducing him to religious leaders from the major faiths of the region, from whom backing was secured for reforestation.  Translations and writings  One of Shoghi Effendi's earliest letters as Abdu'l-Bah√°'s amanuensis, 1919 In his lifetime, Shoghi Effendi translated into English many of the writings of the B√°b, Bah√° ºu'll√°h and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, including the Hidden Words in 1929, the Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n in 1931, Gleanings in 1935 and Epistle to the Son of the Wolf in 1941. He also translated such historical texts as The Dawn- breakers. His significance is not just that of a translator, but he was also the designated and authoritative interpreter of the Bah√° º√≠ writings. His translations, therefore, are a guideline for all future translations of the Bah√° º√≠ writings. The vast majority of his writings were in the style of letters with Bah√° º√≠s from all parts of the globe. These letters, of which 17,500 have been collected thus far and are believed to number a total of 30,000, ranged from routine correspondence regarding the affairs of Bah√° º√≠s around the world to lengthy letters to the Bah√° º√≠s of the world addressing specific themes. Some of his longer letters include World Order of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, regarding the nature of Bah√° º√≠ administration, Advent of Divine Justice, regarding teaching the religion, and Promised Day is Come regarding Bah√° ºu'll√°h's letters to world leaders. Other letters included statements on Bah√° º√≠ beliefs, history, morality, principles, administration and law. He also wrote obituaries of some distinguished Bah√° º√≠s. Many of his letters to individuals and assemblies have been compiled into several books which stand out as significant sources of literature for Bah√° º√≠s around the world. The only actual book he ever wrote was God Passes By in 1944 to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the religion. The book, which is in English, is an interpretive history of the first century of the B√°b√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ Faiths. A shorter Persian language version was also written.  Leadership  As a young student of twenty-four, Shoghi Effendi was initially shocked at the appointment as Guardian. He was also mourning the death of his grandfather to whom he had great attachment. The trauma of this culminated in him making retreats to the Swiss Alps. However, despite his youth, Shoghi Effendi had a clear idea of the goal he had for the religion. Oxford educated and Western in his style of dress, Shoghi Effendi was a stark contrast to his grandfather  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. He distanced himself from the local clergy and notability, and travelled little to visit Bah√° º√≠s unlike his grandfather. Correspondence and pilgrims were the way that Shoghi Effendi conveyed his messages. His talks are the subject to a great number of \\"pilgrim notes\\". He also was concerned with matters dealing with Bah√° º√≠ belief and practice ‚Äî as Guardian he was empowered to interpret the writings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, and these were authoritative and binding, as specified in  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s will. His leadership style was however, quite different from that of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, in that he signed his letters to the Bah√° º√≠s as \\"your true brother\\", and he did not refer to his own personal role, but instead to the institution of the guardianship. He requested that he be referred in letters and verbal addresses always as Shoghi Effendi, as opposed to any other appellation. He also distanced himself as a local notable. He was critical of the Bah√° º√≠s referring to him as a holy personage, asking them not to celebrate his birthday or have his picture on display.  Private life  Shoghi Effendi's personal life was largely subordinate to his work as Guardian of the religion. His lack of secretarial support with the mass of correspondence had left a pattern of hard work in Haifa interspersed with occasional summer breaks to Europe‚Äîin the early years often to the Swiss Alps. In 1929 and 1940 he also travelled through Africa from south to north. In public Shoghi Effendi was variously described as aristocratic, composed and highly informed in international affairs. In private his contemporaries remembered him as warm, informal and humorous. Shoghi Effendi would sleep very little and usually ate only once a day. He was short in stature, with dark hair, an olive complexion and hazel eyes. He was noted as not resembling his grandfather  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° (who was taller and had blue eyes) but his great-grandfather Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Shoghi Effendi had a great love for the English language. He was an avid fan of English literature, and enjoyed reading the King James Bible. He was noted for speaking English in clipped received pronunciation, and Persian in an Isfahani dialect, inherited from his grandmother. Shoghi Effendi held Iranian (Persian) nationality throughout his life and travelled on an Iranian passport, although he never visited Iran. = Marriage = Mary Maxwell, known as R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num In March 1937, Shoghi Effendi married Mary Maxwell, entitled R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num, a Canadian. She was the only child of May Maxwell, a disciple of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, and William Sutherland Maxwell, a Canadian architect. Shoghi Effendi had first met Mary as a girl when she came on pilgrimage with her mother in 1923. The two had begun a regular correspondence from the mid-1920s. Mary was an active Bah√° º√≠ teacher, and a letter written to Shoghi Effendi described her as \\"a beautiful and most refreshing girl to know\\".Etter-Lewis, Gwendolyn (2006). Lights of the Spirit: Historical Portraits of Black Baha'is in North America, 1898-2000. Baha'i Publishing Trust. p. 80. . Whilst on her third pilgrimage in 1937 the two began a discreet courtship. Then 26 years old, Mary was a tall, athletic woman. Mary had been living in Nazi Germany for 18 months with her cousin prior to coming to Haifa. The couple married in the room of Bah√≠yyih Kh√°num in the House of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in Haifa. The ceremony was a short, simple and quiet one in which R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num wore black. Very few knew the wedding was taking place apart from the witnesses and a small group of residents of Haifa. Therefore the marriage came as a great surprise to the world-wide Bah√° º√≠ community when the mother of Shoghi Effendi cabled the Bah√° º√≠s: While Shoghi Effendi and R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num never had children, R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num became his constant companion and helpmate; in 1941, she became Shoghi Effendi's principal secretary in English. In a rare public statement revealing his private sentiments in 1951 he described his wife as \\"my helpmate, my shield in warding off the darts of Covenant breakers and my tireless collaborator in the arduous tasks I shoulder\\". Opposition M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠ was  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s half brother and was mentioned by Bah√° ºu'll√°h as having a station \\"beneath\\" that of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Muhammad  ªAli later fought  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° for leadership and was ultimately excommunicated, along with several others in the Haifa/ ªAkk√° area who supported him. When Shoghi Effendi was appointed Guardian Muhammad  ªAli tried to revive his claim to leadership, suggesting that Bah√° ºu'll√°h's mention of him in the Kit√°b-i-'Ahd amounted to a succession of leadership. After Shoghi Effendi's death, R√∫h√≠yyih Kh√°num published parts of her personal diaries to show glimpses of Shoghi Effendi's life. She recalls a great deal of pain and suffering caused by his immediate family, and Bah√° º√≠s in Haifa. Throughout Shoghi Effendi's life, nearly all remaining family members and descendants of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° were expelled by him as covenant-breakers when they didn't abide by Shoghi Effendi's request to cut contact with covenant-breakers, as specified by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Other branches of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's family had already been declared Covenant-breakers in  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Will and Testament. At the time of his death, there were no living descendants of Bah√° ºu'll√°h that remained loyal to him.  Unexpected death  Shoghi Effendi's resting place in London at the New Southgate Cemetery Shoghi Effendi's death came unexpectedly in London, on 4 November 1957, as he was travelling to Britain and caught the Asian Flu, during the pandemic which killed two million worldwide, and he is buried there in New Southgate Cemetery. His wife sent the following cable: According to the framework of the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, it was not possible to appoint a successor, and the legislative body \\"possessing the exclusive right to legislate on matters not explicitly revealed\\" was not yet established in the world. Furthermore, Shoghi Effendi had left no will as attested to by the Hands of the Cause, who were required to ratify his selection. All of the 27 living Hands of the Cause unanimously signed a statement shortly after the death of Shoghi Effendi stating that he had died \\"without having appointed his successor...\\" Ministry of the Custodians, pp. 28‚Äì30 = Ministry of the Custodians = In Shoghi Effendi's final message to the Baha'i World, dated October 1957, he named the Hands of the Cause of God, \\"the Chief Stewards of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's embryonic World Commonwealth.\\"Effendi, Shoghi. Messages to the Bah√° º√≠ World: 1950‚Äì1957, p. 127 Consequently, following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was temporarily stewarded by the Hands of the Cause, who elected among themselves 9 \\"Custodians\\" to serve in Haifa as the head of the Faith. They reserved to the \\"entire body of the Hands of the Cause\\" the responsibility to determine the transition of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council into the Universal House of Justice, and that the Custodians reserved to themselves the authority to determine and expel Covenant-breakers. This stewardship oversaw the execution of the final years of Shoghi Effendi's ordinances of the ten year crusade (which lasted until 1963) culminating and transitioning to the election and establishment of the Universal House of Justice, at the first Baha'i World Congress in 1963. = Election of the Universal House of Justice = At the end of the Ten Year Crusade, planned by Shoghi Effendi and concluding in 1963, the Universal House of Justice was first elected. As its first order of business, the Universal House of Justice evaluated the situation caused by the fact that the Guardian had not appointed a successor. It determined that under the circumstances, given the criteria for succession described in the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, there was no legitimate way for another Guardian to be appointed. Therefore, although the Will and Testament of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° leaves provisions for a succession of Guardians, Shoghi Effendi remains the first and last occupant of this office.

Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as \\"y = mx + c\\". Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the \\"vertical change\\" to the \\"horizontal change\\" between (any) two distinct points on a line. Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient (\\"rise over run\\"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line. A line that is decreasing has a negative \\"rise\\". The line may be practical - as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan. The steepness, incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical. *A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. The slope is positive, i.e. m>0. *A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right. The slope is negative, i.e. m<0. *If a line is horizontal the slope is zero. This is a constant function. *If a line is vertical the slope is undefined (see below). The rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say y1 and y2, or in other words, the rise is (y2 ‚àí y1) = Œîy. For relatively short distances, where the earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (x2 ‚àí x1) = Œîx. Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line. In mathematical language, the slope m of the line is :m=\\\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}. The concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering. Through trigonometry, the slope m of a line is related to its angle of incline Œ∏ by the tangent function :m = \\\\tan (\\\\theta) Thus, a 45¬∞ rising line has a slope of +1 and a 45¬∞ falling line has a slope of ‚àí1\\\\. As a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of differential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of the tangent line at that point. When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points. When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic formula, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve. This generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors. Thereby, the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment.  Definition  Slope illustrated for y = (3/2)x ‚àí 1\\\\. Click on to enlarge Slope of a line in coordinates system, from f(x)=-12x+2 to f(x)=12x+2 The slope of a line in the plane containing the x and y axes is generally represented by the letter m, and is defined as the change in the y coordinate divided by the corresponding change in the x coordinate, between two distinct points on the line. This is described by the following equation: :m = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{vertical} \\\\, \\\\text{change} }{\\\\text{horizontal} \\\\, \\\\text{change} }= \\\\frac{\\\\text{rise}}{\\\\text{run}}. (The Greek letter delta, Œî, is commonly used in mathematics to mean \\"difference\\" or \\"change\\".) Given two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), the change in x from one to the other is (run), while the change in y is (rise). Substituting both quantities into the above equation generates the formula: :m = \\\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. The formula fails for a vertical line, parallel to the y axis (see Division by zero), where the slope can be taken as infinite, so the slope of a vertical line is considered undefined. = Examples = Suppose a line runs through two points: P = (1, 2) and Q = (13, 8). By dividing the difference in y-coordinates by the difference in x-coordinates, one can obtain the slope of the line: :m = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x} = \\\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\\\frac{8 - 2}{13 - 1} = \\\\frac{6}{12} = \\\\frac{1}{2}. :Since the slope is positive, the direction of the line is increasing. Since m<1, the incline is not very steep (incline <45¬∞). As another example, consider a line which runs through the points (4, 15) and (3, 21). Then, the slope of the line is :m = \\\\frac{ 21 - 15}{3 - 4} = \\\\frac{6}{-1} = -6. :Since the slope is negative, the direction of the line is decreasing. Since m>1, this decline is fairly steep (decline >45¬∞). Algebra and geometry *If y is a linear function of x, then the coefficient of x is the slope of the line created by plotting the function. Therefore, if the equation of the line is given in the form ::y = mx + b :then m is the slope. This form of a line's equation is called the slope-intercept form, because b can be interpreted as the y-intercept of the line, that is, the y-coordinate where the line intersects the y-axis. *If the slope m of a line and a point (x1,y1) on the line are both known, then the equation of the line can be found using the point-slope formula: ::y - y_1 = m(x - x_1). *The slope of the line defined by the linear equation ::ax + by +c = 0 :is ::-\\\\frac {a}{b} . *Two lines are parallel if and only if they are not the same line (coincident) and either their slopes are equal or they both are vertical and therefore both have undefined slopes. Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is ‚àí1 or one has a slope of 0 (a horizontal line) and the other has an undefined slope (a vertical line). *The angle Œ∏ between ‚àí90¬∞ and 90¬∞ that a line makes with the x-axis is related to the slope m as follows: ::m = \\\\tan (\\\\theta) :and ::\\\\theta = \\\\arctan (m) (this is the inverse function of tangent; see inverse trigonometric functions). =Examples= For example, consider a line running through the points (2,8) and (3,20). This line has a slope, , of :\\\\frac {(20 - 8)}{(3 - 2)} \\\\; = 12. One can then write the line's equation, in point-slope form: :y - 8 = 12(x - 2) = 12x - 24 or: :y = 12x - 16. The angle Œ∏ between -90¬∞ and 90¬∞ that this line makes with the -axis is :\\\\theta=\\\\arctan (12) \\\\approx 85.2^{\\\\circ} \\\\,. Consider the two lines: and . Both lines have slope . They are not the same line. So they are parallel lines. Consider the two lines and . The slope of the first line is . The slope of the second line is . The product of these two slopes is ‚àí1. So these two lines are perpendicular.  Statistics  In statistical mathematics, the gradient of the least-squares regression line of best fit for a given distribution of data which is linear, numerical, and free of outliers, may be written as m = \\\\frac{rs_y}{s_x}, where m is defined as the statistical gradient for the line of best fit (y=mx+c), r is Pearson's correlation coefficient, s_y is the standard deviation of the y-values and s_x is the standard deviation of the x-values. This may also be written as a ratio of covariances: m = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(Y,X)}{\\\\operatorname{cov}(X,X)}  Slope of a road or railway  :Main articles: Grade (slope), Grade separation There are two common ways to describe the steepness of a road or railroad. One is by the angle between 0¬∞ and 90¬∞ (in degrees), and the other is by the slope in a percentage. See also steep grade railway and rack railway. The formulae for converting a slope given as a percentage into an angle in degrees and vice versa are: ::\\\\text{angle} = \\\\arctan \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\text{slope}}{100\\\\%} \\\\right) , (this is the inverse function of tangent; see trigonometry) :and ::\\\\mbox{slope} = 100\\\\% \\\\cdot \\\\tan( \\\\mbox{angle}), where angle is in degrees and the trigonometric functions operate in degrees. For example, a slope of 100% or 1000‚Ä∞ is an angle of 45¬∞. A third way is to give one unit of rise in say 10, 20, 50 or 100 horizontal units, e.g. 1:10. 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100 (or \\"1 in 10\\", \\"1 in 20\\" etc.) Note that 1:10 is steeper than 1:20. For example, steepness of 20% means 1:5 or an incline with angle 11,3¬∞. Roads and railways have both longitudinal slopes and cross slopes.

Czech Republic File:Railway gradient post.jpgSteam-age railway gradient post indicating a slope in both directions at Meols railway station, United Kingdom Calculus At each point, the derivative is the slope of a line that is tangent to the curve at that point. Note: the derivative at the point A is positive where green and dash-dot, negative where red and dashed, and zero where black and solid. The concept of a slope is central to differential calculus. For non-linear functions, the rate of change varies along the curve. The derivative of the function at a point is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point, and is thus equal to the rate of change of the function at that point. If we let Œîx and Œîy be the distances (along the x and y axes, respectively) between two points on a curve, then the slope given by the above definition, :m = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x}, is the slope of a secant line to the curve. For a line, the secant between any two points is the line itself, but this is not the case for any other type of curve. For example, the slope of the secant intersecting y = x2 at (0,0) and (3,9) is 3. (The slope of the tangent at is also 3‚Äîa consequence of the mean value theorem.) By moving the two points closer together so that Œîy and Œîx decrease, the secant line more closely approximates a tangent line to the curve, and as such the slope of the secant approaches that of the tangent. Using differential calculus, we can determine the limit, or the value that Œîy/Œîx approaches as Œîy and Œîx get closer to zero; it follows that this limit is the exact slope of the tangent. If y is dependent on x, then it is sufficient to take the limit where only Œîx approaches zero. Therefore, the slope of the tangent is the limit of Œîy/Œîx as Œîx approaches zero, or dy/dx. We call this limit the derivative. :\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta x \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x} Its value at a point on the function gives us the slope of the tangent at that point. For example, let y=x2. A point on this function is (-2,4). The derivative of this function is dy/dx=2x. So the slope of the line tangent to y at (-2,4) is 2*(-2) = -4. The equation of this tangent line is: y-4=(-4)(x-(-2)) or y = -4x - 4.

Its modern manifestation was invented by Charles Parsons in 1884. The steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in the expansion of the steam, which results in a closer approach to the ideal reversible expansion process. Because the turbine generates rotary motion, it is particularly suited to be used to drive an electrical generator‚Äîabout 85% of all electricity generation in the United States in the year 2014 was by use of steam turbines. History generator (left). The first device that may be classified as a reaction steam turbine was little more than a toy, the classic Aeolipile, described in the 1st century by Hero of Alexandria in Roman Egypt. In 1551, Taqi al-Din in Ottoman Egypt described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit. Steam turbines were also described by the Italian Giovanni Branca (1629) and John Wilkins in England (1648). The devices described by Taqi al-Din and Wilkins are today known as steam jacks. In 1672 an impulse steam turbine driven car was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest. A more modern version of this car was produced some time in the late 18th century by an unknown German mechanic. In 1775 at Soho James Watt designed a reaction turbine that was put to work there. In 1827 the Frenchmen Real and Pichon patented and constructed a compound impulse turbine. The modern steam turbine was invented in 1884 by Charles Parsons, whose first model was connected to a dynamo that generated of electricity. The invention of Parsons' steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized marine transport and naval warfare. Parsons' design was a reaction type. His patent was licensed and the turbine scaled-up shortly after by an American, George Westinghouse. The Parsons turbine also turned out to be easy to scale up. Parsons had the satisfaction of seeing his invention adopted for all major world power stations, and the size of generators had increased from his first set up to units of capacity. Within Parson's lifetime, the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times, and the total output from turbo-generators constructed by his firm C. A. Parsons and Company and by their licensees, for land purposes alone, had exceeded thirty million horse-power. A number of other variations of turbines have been developed that work effectively with steam. The de Laval turbine (invented by Gustaf de Laval) accelerated the steam to full speed before running it against a turbine blade. De Laval's impulse turbine is simpler, less expensive and does not need to be pressure-proof. It can operate with any pressure of steam, but is considerably less efficient. Auguste Rateau developed a pressure compounded impulse turbine using the de Laval principle as early as 1896, obtained a US patent in 1903, and applied the turbine to a French torpedo boat in 1904. He taught at the √âcole des mines de Saint-√âtienne for a decade until 1897, and later founded a successful company that was incorporated into the Alstom firm after his death. One of the founders of the modern theory of steam and gas turbines was Aurel Stodola, a Slovak physicist and engineer and professor at the Swiss Polytechnical Institute (now ETH) in Zurich. His work Die Dampfturbinen und ihre Aussichten als W√§rmekraftmaschinen (English: The Steam Turbine and its prospective use as a Heat Engine) was published in Berlin in 1903. A further book Dampf und Gas-Turbinen (English: Steam and Gas Turbines) was published in 1922. The Brown-Curtis turbine, an impulse type, which had been originally developed and patented by the U.S. company International Curtis Marine Turbine Company, was developed in the 1900s in conjunction with John Brown & Company. It was used in John Brown- engined merchant ships and warships, including liners and Royal Navy warships. Manufacturing The present-day manufacturing industry for steam turbines is dominated by Chinese power equipment makers. Harbin Electric, Shanghai Electric, and Dongfang Electric, the top three power equipment makers in China, collectively hold a majority stake in the worldwide market share for steam turbines in 2009-10 according to Platts. Other manufacturers with minor market share include Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Siemens, Alstom, General Electric, Doosan ≈†koda Power, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Toshiba. The consulting firm Frost & Sullivan projects that manufacturing of steam turbines will become more consolidated by 2020 as Chinese power manufacturers win increasing business outside of China. Types Steam turbines are made in a variety of sizes ranging from small <0.75 kW (<1 hp) units (rare) used as mechanical drives for pumps, compressors and other shaft driven equipment, to turbines used to generate electricity. There are several classifications for modern steam turbines. =Blade and stage design= Schematic diagram outlining the difference between an impulse and a 50% reaction turbine Turbine blades are of two basic types, blades and nozzles. Blades move entirely due to the impact of steam on them and their profiles do not converge. This results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades. A turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed nozzles is called an impulse turbine, , Rateau turbine, or Brown-Curtis turbine. Nozzles appear similar to blades, but their profiles converge near the exit. This results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles. Nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit. A turbine composed of moving nozzles alternating with fixed nozzles is called a reaction turbine or Parsons turbine. Except for low-power applications, turbine blades are arranged in multiple stages in series, called compounding, which greatly improves efficiency at low speeds. A reaction stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving nozzles. Multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops, resulting in a pressure-compounded turbine. Impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded, velocity-compounded, or pressure- velocity compounded. A pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving blades, with multiple stages for compounding. This is also known as a Rateau turbine, after its inventor. A velocity-compounded impulse stage (invented by Curtis and also called a \\"Curtis wheel\\") is a row of fixed nozzles followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades. This divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops. A series of velocity- compounded impulse stages is called a pressure-velocity compounded turbine. Diagram of an AEG marine steam turbine circa 1905 By 1905, when steam turbines were coming into use on fast ships (such as ) and in land-based power applications, it had been determined that it was desirable to use one or more Curtis wheels at the beginning of a multi-stage turbine (where the steam pressure is highest), followed by reaction stages. This was more efficient with high-pressure steam due to reduced leakage between the turbine rotor and the casing. This is illustrated in the drawing of the German 1905 AEG marine steam turbine. The steam from the boilers enters from the right at high pressure through a throttle, controlled manually by an operator (in this case a sailor known as the throttleman). It passes through five Curtis wheels and numerous reaction stages (the small blades at the edges of the two large rotors in the middle) before exiting at low pressure, almost certainly to a condenser. The condenser provides a vacuum that maximizes the energy extracted from the steam, and condenses the steam into feedwater to be returned to the boilers. On the left are several additional reaction stages (on two large rotors) that rotate the turbine in reverse for astern operation, with steam admitted by a separate throttle. Since ships are rarely operated in reverse, efficiency is not a priority in astern turbines, so only a few stages are used to save cost. =Blade design challenges= A major challenge facing turbine design was reducing the creep experienced by the blades. Because of the high temperatures and high stresses of operation, steam turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and superalloys with solid-solution strengthening and grain boundary strengthening are used in blade designs. Protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit oxidation. These coatings are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment. The nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The microstructure of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition. A uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase ‚Äì a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium ‚Äì promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure. Refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the fatigue resistance, strength, and creep resistance. =Steam supply and exhaust conditions= A low-pressure steam turbine in a nuclear power plant. These turbines exhaust steam at a pressure below atmospheric. Turbine types include condensing, non-condensing, reheat, extraction and induction. Condensing turbines are most commonly found in electrical power plants. These turbines receive steam from a boiler and exhaust it to a condenser. The exhausted steam is at a pressure well below atmospheric, and is in a partially condensed state, typically of a quality near 90%. Non-condensing or back pressure turbines are most widely used for process steam applications, in which the steam will be used for additional purposes after being exhausted from the turbine. The exhaust pressure is controlled by a regulating valve to suit the needs of the process steam pressure. These are commonly found at refineries, district heating units, pulp and paper plants, and desalination facilities where large amounts of low pressure process steam are needed. Reheat turbines are also used almost exclusively in electrical power plants. In a reheat turbine, steam flow exits from a high-pressure section of the turbine and is returned to the boiler where additional superheat is added. The steam then goes back into an intermediate pressure section of the turbine and continues its expansion. Using reheat in a cycle increases the work output from the turbine and also the expansion reaches conclusion before the steam condenses, thereby minimizing the erosion of the blades in last rows. In most of the cases, maximum number of reheats employed in a cycle is 2 as the cost of super- heating the steam negates the increase in the work output from turbine. Extracting type turbines are common in all applications. In an extracting type turbine, steam is released from various stages of the turbine, and used for industrial process needs or sent to boiler feedwater heaters to improve overall cycle efficiency. Extraction flows may be controlled with a valve, or left uncontrolled. Extracted steam results in a loss of power in the downstream stages of the turbine. Induction turbines introduce low pressure steam at an intermediate stage to produce additional power. =Casing or shaft arrangements= These arrangements include single casing, tandem compound and cross compound turbines. Single casing units are the most basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a generator. Tandem compound are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator. A cross compound turbine arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds. A cross compound turbine is typically used for many large applications. A typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below; this shows high- and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear, with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine. Starboard steam turbine machinery arrangement of Japanese Furutaka- and Aoba-class cruisers. =Two-flow rotors= A two-flow turbine rotor. The steam enters in the middle of the shaft, and exits at each end, balancing the axial force. The moving steam imparts both a tangential and axial thrust on the turbine shaft, but the axial thrust in a simple turbine is unopposed. To maintain the correct rotor position and balancing, this force must be counteracted by an opposing force. Thrust bearings can be used for the shaft bearings, the rotor can use dummy pistons, it can be double flow- the steam enters in the middle of the shaft and exits at both ends, or a combination of any of these. In a double flow rotor, the blades in each half face opposite ways, so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together. This design of rotor is also called two-flow, double-axial-flow, or double-exhaust. This arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine. Principle of operation and design An ideal steam turbine is considered to be an isentropic process, or constant entropy process, in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine. No steam turbine is truly isentropic, however, with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20 to 90% based on the application of the turbine. The interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or buckets. One set of stationary blades is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft. The sets intermesh with certain minimum clearances, with the size and configuration of sets varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage. Practical thermal efficiency of a steam turbine varies with turbine size, load condition, gap losses and friction losses. They reach top values up to about 50% in a turbine; smaller ones have a lower efficiency. To maximize turbine efficiency the steam is expanded, doing work, in a number of stages. These stages are characterized by how the energy is extracted from them and are known as either impulse or reaction turbines. Most steam turbines use a mixture of the reaction and impulse designs: each stage behaves as either one or the other, but the overall turbine uses both. Typically, lower pressure sections are reaction type and higher pressure stages are impulse type. =Impulse turbines= A selection of impulse turbine blades An impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets. These jets contain significant kinetic energy, which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades, as the steam jet changes direction. A pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades, with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage. As the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure (atmospheric pressure or, more usually, the condenser vacuum). Due to this high ratio of expansion of steam, the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity. The steam leaving the moving blades has a large portion of the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle. The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss. The law of moment of momentum states that the sum of the moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the control volume is equal to the net time change of angular momentum flux through the control volume. The swirling fluid enters the control volume at radius r_1 with tangential velocity V_{w1} and leaves at radius r_2 with tangential velocity V_{w2}. Velocity triangle A velocity triangle paves the way for a better understanding of the relationship between the various velocities. In the adjacent figure we have: :V_1 and V_2 are the absolute velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively. :V_{f1} and V_{f2} are the flow velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively. :V_{w1} and V_{w2} are the swirl velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively, in the moving reference. :V_{r1} and V_{r2} are the relative velocities at the inlet and outlet respectively. :U_1 and U_2 are the velocities of the blade at the inlet and outlet respectively. :\\\\alpha is the guide vane angle and \\\\beta is the blade angle. Then by the law of moment of momentum, the torque on the fluid is given by: : T = \\\\dot{m} \\\\left(r_2 V_{w2} - r_1 V_{w1}\\\\right) For an impulse steam turbine: r_2 = r_1 = r. Therefore, the tangential force on the blades is F_u = \\\\dot{m}\\\\left(V_{w1} - V_{w2}\\\\right). The work done per unit time or power developed: W = T\\\\omega. When œâ is the angular velocity of the turbine, then the blade speed is U = \\\\omega r. The power developed is then W = \\\\dot{m}U(\\\\Delta V_w).  Blade efficiency  Blade efficiency ({\\\\eta_b}) can be defined as the ratio of the work done on the blades to kinetic energy supplied to the fluid, and is given by : \\\\eta_b = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Work~Done}}{\\\\mathrm{Kinetic~Energy~Supplied}} = \\\\frac{U\\\\Delta V_w}{{V_1}^2}  Stage efficiency  Convergent-divergent nozzle Graph depicting efficiency of impulse turbine A stage of an impulse turbine consists of a nozzle set and a moving wheel. The stage efficiency defines a relationship between enthalpy drop in the nozzle and work done in the stage. : {\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{stage}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Work~done~on~blade}}{\\\\mathrm{Energy~supplied~per~stage}} = \\\\frac{U\\\\Delta V_w}{\\\\Delta h} Where \\\\Delta h = h_2 - h_1 is the specific enthalpy drop of steam in the nozzle. By the first law of thermodynamics: : h_1 + \\\\frac{1}{2}{V_1}^2 = h_2 + \\\\frac{1}{2}{V_2}^2 Assuming that V_1 is appreciably less than V_2, we get {\\\\Delta h} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2}{V_2}^2. Furthermore, stage efficiency is the product of blade efficiency and nozzle efficiency, or \\\\eta_\\\\text{stage} = \\\\eta_b\\\\eta_N. Nozzle efficiency is given by \\\\eta_N = \\\\frac{{V_2}^2}{2\\\\left(h_1 - h_2\\\\right)}, where the enthalpy (in J/Kg) of steam at the entrance of the nozzle is h_1 and the enthalpy of steam at the exit of the nozzle is h_2. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta V_w &= V_{w1} - \\\\left(-V_{w2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= V_{w1} + V_{w2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= V_{r1}\\\\cos\\\\beta_1 + V_{r2}\\\\cos\\\\beta_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= V_{r1}\\\\cos\\\\beta_1\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{V_{r2}\\\\cos\\\\beta_2}{V_{r1}\\\\cos\\\\beta_1}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} The ratio of the cosines of the blade angles at the outlet and inlet can be taken and denoted c = \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\beta_2}{\\\\cos\\\\beta_1}. The ratio of steam velocities relative to the rotor speed at the outlet to the inlet of the blade is defined by the friction coefficient k = \\\\frac{V_{r2}}{V_{r1}}. k < 1 and depicts the loss in the relative velocity due to friction as the steam flows around the blades (k = 1 for smooth blades). : \\\\eta_b = \\\\frac{2U\\\\Delta V_w}{{V_1}^2} = \\\\frac{2U}{V_1}\\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\frac{U}{V_1}\\\\right)(1 + kc) The ratio of the blade speed to the absolute steam velocity at the inlet is termed the blade speed ratio \\\\rho = \\\\frac{U}{V_1}. \\\\eta_b is maximum when \\\\frac{d\\\\eta_b}{d\\\\rho} = 0 or, \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\rho}\\\\left(2{\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\rho^2}(1 + kc)\\\\right) = 0. That implies \\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 and therefore \\\\frac{U}{V_1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1. Now \\\\rho_{opt} = \\\\frac{U}{V_1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 (for a single stage impulse turbine). Therefore, the maximum value of stage efficiency is obtained by putting the value of \\\\frac{U}{V_1} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 in the expression of \\\\eta_b. We get: {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{max} = 2\\\\left(\\\\rho\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\rho^2\\\\right)(1 + kc) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1 (1 + kc). For equiangular blades, \\\\beta_1 = \\\\beta_2, therefore c = 1, and we get {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{max} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1(1 + k). If the friction due to the blade surface is neglected then {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{max} = \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1.  Conclusions on maximum efficiency  : {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{max} = \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1 # For a given steam velocity work done per kg of steam would be maximum when \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1 = 1 or \\\\alpha_1 = 0 . # As \\\\alpha_1 increases, the work done on the blades reduces, but at the same time surface area of the blade reduces, therefore there are less frictional losses. =Reaction turbines= In the reaction turbine, the rotor blades themselves are arranged to form convergent nozzles. This type of turbine makes use of the reaction force produced as the steam accelerates through the nozzles formed by the rotor. Steam is directed onto the rotor by the fixed vanes of the stator. It leaves the stator as a jet that fills the entire circumference of the rotor. The steam then changes direction and increases its speed relative to the speed of the blades. A pressure drop occurs across both the stator and the rotor, with steam accelerating through the stator and decelerating through the rotor, with no net change in steam velocity across the stage but with a decrease in both pressure and temperature, reflecting the work performed in the driving of the rotor.  Blade efficiency  Energy input to the blades in a stage: E = \\\\Delta h is equal to the kinetic energy supplied to the fixed blades (f) + the kinetic energy supplied to the moving blades (m). Or, E = enthalpy drop over the fixed blades, \\\\Delta h_f \\\\+ enthalpy drop over the moving blades, \\\\Delta h_m. The effect of expansion of steam over the moving blades is to increase the relative velocity at the exit. Therefore, the relative velocity at the exit V_{r2} is always greater than the relative velocity at the inlet V_{r1}. In terms of velocities, the enthalpy drop over the moving blades is given by: : \\\\Delta h_m = \\\\frac{V_{r2}^2 - V_{r1}^2}{2} (it contributes to a change in static pressure) Velocity diagram The enthalpy drop in the fixed blades, with the assumption that the velocity of steam entering the fixed blades is equal to the velocity of steam leaving the previously moving blades is given by: : \\\\Delta h_f = \\\\frac{V_1^2 - V_0^2}{2} where V0 is the inlet velocity of steam in the nozzle V_0 is very small and hence can be neglected. Therefore, \\\\Delta h_f = \\\\frac{V_1^2}{2} : \\\\begin{align} E &= \\\\Delta h_f + \\\\Delta h_m \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{V_1^2}{2} + \\\\frac{V_{r2}^2 - V_{r1}^2}{2} \\\\end{align} A very widely used design has half degree of reaction or 50% reaction and this is known as Parson's turbine. This consists of symmetrical rotor and stator blades. For this turbine the velocity triangle is similar and we have: : \\\\alpha_1 = \\\\beta_2, \\\\beta_1 = \\\\alpha_2 : V_1 = V_{r2}, V_{r1} = V_2 Assuming Parson's turbine and obtaining all the expressions we get : E = V_1^2 - \\\\frac{V_{r1}^2}{2} From the inlet velocity triangle we have V_{r1}^2 = V_1^2 + U^2 - 2UV_1\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 : \\\\begin{align} E &= V_1^2 - \\\\frac{V_1^2}{2} - \\\\frac{U^2}{2} + \\\\frac{2UV_1\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{V_1^2 - U^2 + 2UV_1\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1}{2} \\\\end{align} Work done (for unit mass flow per second): W = U\\\\Delta V_w = U\\\\left(2V_1\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - U\\\\right) Therefore, the blade efficiency is given by : \\\\eta_b = \\\\frac{2U(2V_1\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - U)}{V_1^2 - U^2 + 2V_1U\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1}  Condition of maximum blade efficiency  Comparing Efficiencies of Impulse and Reaction turbines If {\\\\rho} = \\\\frac{U}{V_1}, then : {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{max} = \\\\frac{2\\\\rho(\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\rho)}{V_1^2 - U^2 + 2UV_1\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1} For maximum efficiency {d\\\\eta_b\\\\over d\\\\rho} = 0, we get : \\\\left(1 - \\\\rho^2 + 2\\\\rho\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1\\\\right)\\\\left(4\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - 4\\\\rho\\\\right) - 2\\\\rho\\\\left(2\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\rho\\\\right)\\\\left(-2\\\\rho + 2\\\\cos\\\\alpha_1\\\\right) = 0 and this finally gives \\\\rho_{opt} = \\\\frac{U}{V_1} = \\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 Therefore, {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{max} is found by putting the value of \\\\rho = \\\\cos\\\\alpha_1 in the expression of blade efficiency : \\\\begin{align} {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{reaction} &= \\\\frac{2\\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1}{1 + \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\eta_b}_\\\\text{impulse} &= \\\\cos^2\\\\alpha_1 \\\\end{align} =Operation and maintenance= A modern steam turbine generator installation Because of the high pressures used in the steam circuits and the materials used, steam turbines and their casings have high thermal inertia. When warming up a steam turbine for use, the main steam stop valves (after the boiler) have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine. Also, a turning gear is engaged when there is no steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent uneven expansion. After first rotating the turbine by the turning gear, allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane (no bowing), then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine, first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10‚Äì15 RPM (0.17‚Äì0.25 Hz) to slowly warm the turbine. The warm-up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours. During normal operation, rotor imbalance can lead to vibration, which, because of the high rotation velocities, could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing. To reduce this risk, considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine. Also, turbines are run with high-quality steam: either superheated (dry) steam, or saturated steam with a high dryness fraction. This prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades (moisture carry over). Also, liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft. To prevent this, along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high-quality steam, condensate drains are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine. Maintenance requirements of modern steam turbines are simple and incur low costs (typically around $0.005 per kWh); their operational life often exceeds 50 years. =Speed regulation= Diagram of a steam turbine generator system The control of a turbine with a governor is essential, as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications (such as the generation of alternating current electricity) require precise speed control. Uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an overspeed trip, which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close. If these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart, often catastrophically. Turbines are expensive to make, requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials. During normal operation in synchronization with the electricity network, power plants are governed with a five percent droop speed control. This means the full load speed is 100% and the no-load speed is 105%. This is required for the stable operation of the network without hunting and drop-outs of power plants. Normally the changes in speed are minor. Adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a centrifugal governor. Generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication. =Thermodynamics of steam turbines= T-s diagram of a superheated Rankine cycle The steam turbine operates on basic principles of thermodynamics using the part 3-4 of the Rankine cycle shown in the adjoining diagram. Superheated steam (or dry saturated steam, depending on application) leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure. At entry to the turbine, the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle (a fixed nozzle in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine). When the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor. A force is created on the blades due to the pressure of the vapor on the blades causing them to move. A generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft, and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used. The steam leaves the turbine as a saturated vapor (or liquid-vapor mix depending on application) at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled. The first law enables us to find a formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass. Assuming there is no heat transfer to the surrounding environment and that the changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible compared to the change in specific enthalpy we arrive at the following equation : \\\\frac{\\\\dot{W}}{\\\\dot{m}} = h_3 - h_4 where * ·∫Ü is the rate at which work is developed per unit time * ·πÅ is the rate of mass flow through the turbine Isentropic efficiency To measure how well a turbine is performing we can look at its isentropic efficiency. This compares the actual performance of the turbine with the performance that would be achieved by an ideal, isentropic, turbine. When calculating this efficiency, heat lost to the surroundings is assumed to be zero. Steam's starting pressure and temperature is the same for both the actual and the ideal turbines, but at turbine exit, steam's energy content ('specific enthalpy') for the actual turbine is greater than that for the ideal turbine because of irreversibility in the actual turbine. The specific enthalpy is evaluated at the same steam pressure for the actual and ideal turbines in order to give a good comparison between the two. The isentropic efficiency is found by dividing the actual work by the ideal work. : \\\\eta_t = \\\\frac{h_3 - h_4}{h_3 - h_{4s}} where * h3 is the specific enthalpy at state three * h4 is the specific enthalpy at state 4 for the actual turbine * h4s is the specific enthalpy at state 4s for the isentropic turbine (but note that the adjacent diagram does not show state 4s: it is vertically below state 3) Direct drive A direct-drive 5 MW steam turbine fuelled with biomass Electrical power stations use large steam turbines driving electric generators to produce most (about 80%) of the world's electricity. The advent of large steam turbines made central-station electricity generation practical, since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky, and operated at slow speeds. Most central stations are fossil fuel power plants and nuclear power plants; some installations use geothermal steam, or use concentrated solar power (CSP) to create the steam. Steam turbines can also be used directly to drive large centrifugal pumps, such as feedwater pumps at a thermal power plant. The turbines used for electric power generation are most often directly coupled to their generators. As the generators must rotate at constant synchronous speeds according to the frequency of the electric power system, the most common speeds are 3,000 RPM for 50 Hz systems, and 3,600 RPM for 60 Hz systems. Since nuclear reactors have lower temperature limits than fossil-fired plants, with lower steam quality, the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds, but with four-pole generators, to reduce erosion of turbine blades. Marine propulsion Turbinia, 1894, the first steam turbine-powered ship High and low pressure turbines for . Parsons turbine from the 1928 Polish destroyer . In steamships, advantages of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size, lower maintenance, lighter weight, and lower vibration. A steam turbine is only efficient when operating in the thousands of RPM, while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 RPM; consequently, precise (thus expensive) reduction gears are usually required, although numerous early ships through World War I, such as Turbinia, had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts. Another alternative is turbo-electric transmission, in which an electrical generator run by the high-speed turbine is used to run one or more slow-speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts; precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime. Turbo-electric drive was most used in large US warships designed during World War I and in some fast liners, and was used in some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in World War II. The higher cost of turbines and the associated gears or generator/motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power, although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency. To reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years. =Early development= The development of steam turbine marine propulsion from 1894 to 1935 was dominated by the need to reconcile the high efficient speed of the turbine with the low efficient speed (less than 300 rpm) of the ship's propeller at an overall cost competitive with reciprocating engines. In 1894, efficient reduction gears were not available for the high powers required by ships, so direct drive was necessary. In Turbinia, which has direct drive to each propeller shaft, the efficient speed of the turbine was reduced after initial trials by directing the steam flow through all three direct drive turbines (one on each shaft) in series, probably totaling around 200 turbine stages operating in series. Also, there were three propellers on each shaft for operation at high speeds. The high shaft speeds of the era are represented by one of the first US turbine-powered destroyers, , launched in 1909, which had direct drive turbines and whose three shafts turned at 724 rpm at . The use of turbines in several casings exhausting steam to each other in series became standard in most subsequent marine propulsion applications, and is a form of cross-compounding. The first turbine was called the high pressure (HP) turbine, the last turbine was the low pressure (LP) turbine, and any turbine in between was an intermediate pressure (IP) turbine. A much later arrangement than Turbinia can be seen on in Long Beach, California, launched in 1934, in which each shaft is powered by four turbines in series connected to the ends of the two input shafts of a single-reduction gearbox. They are the HP, 1st IP, 2nd IP, and LP turbines. =Cruising machinery and gearing= The quest for economy was even more important when cruising speeds were considered. Cruising speed is roughly 50% of a warship's maximum speed and 20-25% of its maximum power level. This would be a speed used on long voyages when fuel economy is desired. Although this brought the propeller speeds down to an efficient range, turbine efficiency was greatly reduced, and early turbine ships had poor cruising ranges. A solution that proved useful through most of the steam turbine propulsion era was the cruising turbine. This was an extra turbine to add even more stages, at first attached directly to one or more shafts, exhausting to a stage partway along the HP turbine, and not used at high speeds. As reduction gears became available around 1911, some ships, notably the battleship , had them on cruising turbines while retaining direct drive main turbines. Reduction gears allowed turbines to operate in their efficient range at a much higher speed than the shaft, but were expensive to manufacture. Cruising turbines competed at first with reciprocating engines for fuel economy. An example of the retention of reciprocating engines on fast ships was the famous of 1911, which along with her sisters and had triple- expansion engines on the two outboard shafts, both exhausting to an LP turbine on the center shaft. After adopting turbines with the s launched in 1909, the United States Navy reverted to reciprocating machinery on the s of 1912, then went back to turbines on Nevada in 1914. The lingering fondness for reciprocating machinery was because the US Navy had no plans for capital ships exceeding until after World War I, so top speed was less important than economical cruising. The United States had acquired the Philippines and Hawaii as territories in 1898, and lacked the British Royal Navy's worldwide network of coaling stations. Thus, the US Navy in 1900‚Äì1940 had the greatest need of any nation for fuel economy, especially as the prospect of war with Japan arose following World War I. This need was compounded by the US not launching any cruisers 1908‚Äì1920, so destroyers were required to perform long-range missions usually assigned to cruisers. So, various cruising solutions were fitted on US destroyers launched 1908‚Äì1916. These included small reciprocating engines and geared or ungeared cruising turbines on one or two shafts. However, once fully geared turbines proved economical in initial cost and fuel they were rapidly adopted, with cruising turbines also included on most ships. Beginning in 1915 all new Royal Navy destroyers had fully geared turbines, and the United States followed in 1917. In the Royal Navy, speed was a priority until the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916 showed that in the battlecruisers too much armour had been sacrificed in its pursuit. The British used exclusively turbine-powered warships from 1906. Because they recognized that a significant cruising range would be desirable given their worldwide empire, some warships, notably the s, were fitted with cruising turbines from 1912 onwards following earlier experimental installations. In the US Navy, the s, launched 1935‚Äì36, introduced double-reduction gearing. This further increased the turbine speed above the shaft speed, allowing smaller turbines than single-reduction gearing. Steam pressures and temperatures were also increasing progressively, from / [saturated steam] on the World War I-era to / [superheated steam] on some World War II s and later ships. A standard configuration emerged of an axial-flow high-pressure turbine (sometimes with a cruising turbine attached) and a double-axial-flow low-pressure turbine connected to a double-reduction gearbox. This arrangement continued throughout the steam era in the US Navy and was also used in some Royal Navy designs. Machinery of this configuration can be seen on many preserved World War II-era warships in several countries. When US Navy warship construction resumed in the early 1950s, most surface combatants and aircraft carriers used / steam. This continued until the end of the US Navy steam-powered warship era with the s of the early 1970s. Amphibious and auxiliary ships continued to use steam post-World War II, with , launched in 2001, possibly the last non-nuclear steam-powered ship built for the US Navy. =Turbo-electric drive= , a nuclear icebreaker with nuclear- turbo-electric propulsion Turbo-electric drive was introduced on the battleship , launched in 1917. Over the next eight years the US Navy launched five additional turbo-electric-powered battleships and two aircraft carriers (initially ordered as s). Ten more turbo-electric capital ships were planned, but cancelled due to the limits imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. Although New Mexico was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931‚Äì1933 refit, the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers. This system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts. The system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port, with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more reverse power than with most geared systems. Some ocean liners were also built with turbo-electric drive, as were some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in World War II. However, when the US designed the \\"treaty cruisers\\", beginning with launched in 1927, geared turbines were used to conserve weight, and remained in use for all fast steam-powered ships thereafter. =Current usage= Since the 1980s, steam turbines have been replaced by gas turbines on fast ships and by diesel engines on other ships; exceptions are nuclear-powered ships and submarines and LNG carriers. Some auxiliary ships continue to use steam propulsion. In the U.S. Navy, the conventionally powered steam turbine is still in use on all but one of the Wasp-class amphibious assault ships. The Royal Navy decommissioned its last conventional steam-powered surface warship class, the , in 2002, with the Italian Navy following in 2006 by decommissioning its last conventional steam-powered surface warships, the s. In 2013, the French Navy ended its steam era with the decommissioning of its last . Amongst the other blue-water navies, the Russian Navy currently operates steam-powered s and s. The Indian Navy currently operates INS Vikramaditya, a modified ; it also operates three s commissioned in the early 2000s and one scheduled for decommissioning. The Chinese Navy currently operates steam-powered s, s along with s and the lone Type 051B destroyer. Most other naval forces either retired or re-engined their steam-powered warships by 2010. As of 2020, the Mexican Navy operates four steam-powered former U.S. and two steam-powered former U.S. . The Egyptian Navy and the Republic of China Navy respectively operate two and six former U.S. s. The Ecuadorian Navy currently operates two steam-powered s (modified s). Today, propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50%, yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50%, especially in marine applications. Diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required. Thus, conventional steam power is used in very few new ships. An exception is LNG carriers which often find it more economical to use boil-off gas with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it. Nuclear-powered ships and submarines use a nuclear reactor to create steam for turbines. Nuclear power is often chosen where diesel power would be impractical (as in submarine applications) or the logistics of refuelling pose significant problems (for example, icebreakers). It has been estimated that the reactor fuel for the Royal Navy's s is sufficient to last 40 circumnavigations of the globe ‚Äì potentially sufficient for the vessel's entire service life. Nuclear propulsion has only been applied to a very few commercial vessels due to the expense of maintenance and the regulatory controls required on nuclear systems and fuel cycles. Locomotives A steam turbine locomotive engine is a steam locomotive driven by a steam turbine. The first steam turbine rail locomotive was built in 1908 for the Officine Meccaniche Miani Silvestri Grodona Comi, Milan, Italy. In 1924 Krupp built the steam turbine locomotive T18 001, operational in 1929, for Deutsche Reichsbahn. The main advantages of a steam turbine locomotive are better rotational balance and reduced hammer blow on the track. However, a disadvantage is less flexible output power so that turbine locomotives were best suited for long-haul operations at a constant output power. Testing British, German, other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test steam turbines. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems. In the United States, ASME has produced several performance test codes on steam turbines. These include ASME PTC 6‚Äì2004, Steam Turbines, ASME PTC 6.2-2011, Steam Turbines in Combined Cycles, PTC 6S-1988, Procedures for Routine Performance Test of Steam Turbines. These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing steam turbines. The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 6, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance.

Appearing in Disney comics, Scrooge is an elderly Scottish anthropomorphic Pekin duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a red or blue frock coat, top hat, pince-nez glasses, and spats. He is portrayed in animations as speaking with a Scottish English accent. Originally intended to be used only once, Scrooge became one of the most popular characters in Disney comics, and Barks' signature work. Named after Ebenezer Scrooge from the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is an incredibly wealthy business magnate and self-proclaimed \\"adventure-capitalist\\" whose dominant character traits are his wealth, frugality, and tendency to seek more wealth through adventure. He is the maternal uncle of Donald Duck, the maternal grand-uncle of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and a usual financial backer of Gyro Gearloose. Within the context of the fictional Donald Duck universe, he is the world's richest person. He is portrayed as an oil tycoon, businessman, industrialist, and owner of the largest mining concerns and many factories to operate different activities. His \\"Money Bin\\" ‚Äî and indeed Scrooge himself ‚Äî are often used as a humourous metonyms for great wealth in popular culture around the world. McDuck was initially characterised as a greedy miser and antihero (as Charles Dickens' original Scrooge was), but in later appearances he has often been portrayed as a thrifty hero, adventurer and explorer. He was originally created by Barks as an antagonist for Donald Duck, first appearing in the 1947 Four Colour story Christmas on Bear Mountain (#178). However, McDuck's popularity grew so large that he became a major figure of the Donald Duck universe. In 1952, he was given his own comic book series, called Uncle Scrooge, which still runs today. Scrooge was most famously drawn by his creator Carl Barks, and later by Don Rosa. Like other Disney franchise characters, Scrooge McDuck's international popularity has resulted in literature that is often translated into other languages. Comics have remained Scrooge's primary medium, although he has also appeared in animated cartoons, most extensively in the television series DuckTales (1987‚Äì1991) and its reboot (2017-present) as the main protagonist of both series. Comics history =First appearance= One of Scrooge's first panels in Christmas on Bear Mountain Scrooge McDuck, maternal uncle of previously established character Donald Duck, made his first named appearance in the story Christmas on Bear Mountain which was published in Dell's Four Color Comics #178, December 1947, written and drawn by artist Carl Barks. His appearance may have been based on a similar-looking, Scottish \\"thrifty saver\\" Donald Duck character from the 1943 propaganda short The Spirit of '43.Gerstein, David, \\"1st Scrooge McDuck in 1943??\\", Retrieved on October 9, 2008. In Christmas on Bear Mountain, Scrooge was a bearded, bespectacled, reasonably wealthy old duck, visibly leaning on his cane, and living in isolation in a \\"huge mansion\\".Barks, Carl (writer and illustrator). \\"Christmas on Bear Mountain\\". Four Color Comics #178, Donald Duck. July 1947. Scrooge's misanthropic thoughts in this first story are quite pronounced: \\"Here I sit in this big lonely dump, waiting for Christmas to pass! Bah! That silly season when everybody loves everybody else! A curse on it! Me‚ÄîI'm different! Everybody hates me, and I hate everybody!\\" Barks later reflected, \\"Scrooge in 'Christmas on Bear Mountain' was only my first idea of a rich, old uncle. I had made him too old and too weak. I discovered later on that I had to make him more active. I could not make an old guy like that do the things I wanted him to do.\\"Ortman, Steve (trans.); Laqua, Charsten, \\"Carl Barks ‚Äì the Author \\", Carl Barks His Work and His Life (site). Retrieved on September 5, 2007. =Recurring character= Barks would later claim that he originally only intended to use Scrooge as a one-shot character, but then decided Scrooge (and his fortune) could prove useful for motivating further stories. Barks continued to experiment with Scrooge's appearance and personality over the next four years. Scrooge's second appearance, in The Old Castle's Secret (first published in June 1948), had him recruiting his nephews to search for a family treasure hidden in Dismal Downs, the McDuck family's ancestral castle, built in the middle of Rannoch Moor in Scotland. Foxy Relations (first published in November 1948) was the first story where Scrooge is called by his title and catchphrase \\"The Richest Duck in the World\\". A panel from an Uncle Scrooge comic by Jack Bradbury =First hints of Scrooge's past= The story, Voodoo Hoodoo, first published in Dell's Four Color Comics #238, August 1949, was the first story to hint at Scrooge's past with the introduction of two figures from it. The first was Foola Zoola, an old African sorcerer and chief of the Voodoo tribe who had cursed Scrooge, seeking revenge for the destruction of his village and the taking of his tribe's lands by Scrooge decades ago. Scrooge privately admitted to his nephews that he had used an army of \\"cutthroats\\" to get the tribe to abandon their lands, in order to establish a rubber plantation. The event was placed by Carl Barks in 1879 during the story, but it would later be retconned by Don Rosa to 1909 to fit with Scrooge's later-established personal history in Rosa's story The Empire- Builder from Calisota. The second figure was Bombie the Zombie, the organ of the sorcerer's curse and revenge. He had reportedly sought Scrooge for decades before reaching Duckburg, mistaking Donald for Scrooge. Barks, with a note of skepticism often found in his stories, explained the zombie as a living person who has never died, but has somehow gotten under the influence of a sorcerer. Although some scenes of the story were intended as a parody of Bela Lugosi's White Zombie, the story is the first to not only focus on Scrooge's past but also touch on the darkest aspects of his personality. =Later stories= Trail of the Unicorn, first published in February 1950, introduced Scrooge's private zoo. One of his pilots had managed to photograph the last living unicorn, which lived in the Indian part of the Himalayas. Scrooge offered a reward to competing cousins Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander, which would go to the one who captured the unicorn for Scrooge's collection of animals. This was also the story that introduced Scrooge's private airplane. Barks would later establish Scrooge as an experienced aviator. Donald had previously been shown as a skilled aviator, as was Flintheart Glomgold in later stories. In comparison, Huey, Dewey, and Louie were depicted as only having taken flying lessons in the story Frozen Gold (published in January 1945). The Pixilated Parrot, first published in July 1950, introduced a precursor to Scrooge's money bin. In this story, Scrooge's central office building is said to contain \\"three cubic acres of money\\". Two nameless burglars who briefly appear during the story are considered to be the precursors of the Beagle Boys.Andrae, Thomas Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity. Jackson, Miss: Univ. Press Mississippi, 2006. Print. =Scrooge as a major character= The Magic Hourglass, first published in September 1950, was arguably the first story to change the focus of the Duck stories from Donald to Scrooge. During the story, several themes were introduced for Scrooge. Donald first mentions in this story that his uncle practically owns Duckburg, a statement that Scrooge's rival John D. Rockerduck would later put in dispute. Scrooge first hints that he was not born into wealth, as he remembers buying the Hourglass in Morocco when he was a member of a ship's crew as a cabin boy. It's also the first story in which Scrooge mentions speaking another language besides his native English and reading other alphabets besides the Latin alphabet, as during the story, he speaks Arabic and reads the Arabic alphabet. The latter theme would be developed further in later stories. Barks and current Scrooge writer Don Rosa have depicted Scrooge as being fluent in Arabic, Dutch, German, Mongolian, Spanish, Mayan, Bengali, Finnish, and a number of Chinese dialects. Scrooge acquired this knowledge from years of living or traveling to the various regions of the world where those languages are spoken. Later writers would depict Scrooge having at least working knowledge of several other languages. He has also encountered several historical figures during his lifetime, such as U.S. President Roosevelt (The Buckaroo of the Badlands, The Invader of Fort Duckburg, and The Sharpie of the Culebra Cut), Apache leader Geronimo (The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff), Czar Nicholas II of Russia, (The Empire-Builder from Calisota) and philologist Elias L√∂nnrot (The Quest for Kalevala). Scrooge was shown in The Magic Hourglass in a more positive light than in previous stories, but his more villainous side is present too. Scrooge is seen in this story attempting to reacquire a magic hourglass that he gave to Donald, before finding out that it acted as a protective charm for him. Scrooge starts losing one billion dollars each minute, and comments that he will go bankrupt within 600 years. This line is a parody of Orson Welles's line in Citizen Kane \\"You know, Mr. Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in ... 60 years\\".See Citizen Kane quotes from the Internet Movie Database To convince his nephews to return it, he pursues them throughout Morocco, where they had headed to earlier in the story. Memorably during the story, Scrooge interrogates Donald by having him tied up and tickled with a feather in an attempt to get Donald to reveal the hourglass's location. Scrooge finally manages to retrieve it, exchanging the item for a flask of water, as he had found his nephews exhausted and left in the desert with no supplies. As Scrooge explains, he intended to give them a higher offer, but he just could not resist having somebody at his mercy without taking advantage of it. =Final developments= A Financial Fable, first published in March 1951, had Scrooge teaching Donald some lessons in productivity as the source of wealth, along with the laws of supply and demand. Perhaps more importantly, it was also the first story where Scrooge observes how diligent and industrious Huey, Louie, and Dewey are, making them more similar to himself rather than to Donald. Donald in Barks's stories is depicted as working hard on occasion, but given the choice often proves to be a shirker. The three younger nephews first side with Scrooge rather than Donald in this story, with the bond between granduncle and grandnephews strengthening in later stories. However, there have been rare instances where Donald proved invaluable to Scrooge, such as when the group traveled back in time to Ancient Egypt to retrieve a pharaoh's papyrus. Donald cautions against taking it with him, as no one would believe the story unless it was unearthed. Donald then buries it and makes a marking point from the Nile River, making Scrooge think to himself admiringly, \\"Donald must have swallowed the !\\" Terror of the Beagle Boys, first published in November 1951, introduced the readers to the Beagle Boys, although Scrooge in this story seems to be already familiar with them. The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill introduced Scrooge's money bin, built on Killmotor Hill in the center of Duckburg. By this point, Scrooge had become familiar to readers in the United States and Europe. Other Disney writers and artists besides Barks began using Scrooge in their own stories, including Italian writer Romano Scarpa. Western Publishing, the then-publisher of the Disney crafty comics, started thinking about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character, and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self-titled comic. Uncle Scrooge #1, featuring the story Only a Poor Old Man, was published in March 1952. This story along with Back to the Klondike, first published a year later in March 1953, became the biggest influences in how Scrooge's character, past, and beliefs would become defined. After this point, Barks produced most of his longer stories in Uncle Scrooge, with a focus mainly on adventure, while his ten-page stories for Walt Disney's Comics and Stories continued to feature Donald as the star and focused on comedy. In Scrooge's stories, Donald and his nephews were cast as Scrooge's assistants, who accompanied Scrooge in his adventures around the world. This change of focus from Donald to Scrooge was also reflected in stories by other contemporary writers. Since then, Scrooge remains a central figure of the Duck comics' universe, thus the coining of the term \\"Scrooge McDuck Universe\\". =Modern era= After Barks's retirement, the character continued under other artists. In 1972, Barks was persuaded to write more stories for Disney. He wrote Junior Woodchuck stories where Scrooge often plays the part of the villain, closer to the role he had before he acquired his own series. Under Barks, Scrooge always was a malleable character who would take on whatever persona was convenient to the plot. The Italian writer and artist Romano Scarpa made several additions to Scrooge McDuck's universe, including characters such as Brigitta McBridge, Scrooge's self-styled fianc√©e, and Gideon McDuck, a newspaper editor who is Scrooge's brother. Those characters have appeared mostly in European comics. This is also the case for Scrooge's rival John D. Rockerduck (created by Barks for just one story) and Donald's cousin Fethry Duck, who sometimes works as a reporter for Scrooge's newspaper. Another major development was the arrival of writer and artist Don Rosa in 1986, with his story \\"The Son of the Sun\\", released by Gladstone Publishing and nominated for a Harvey Award, one of the comics industry's highest honors. Rosa has said in interviews that he considers Scrooge to be his favorite Disney character. Unlike most other Disney writers, Don Rosa considered Scrooge as a historical character whose Disney adventures had occurred in the fifties and sixties and ended (in his undepicted death) in 1967 when Barks retired. He considered only Barks' stories canonical, and fleshed out a timeline as well as a family tree based on Barks' stories. Eventually he wrote and drew The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, a full history in twelve chapters which received an Eisner Award in 1995. Later editions included additional chapters. Under Rosa, Scrooge became more ethical; while he never cheats, he ruthlessly exploits any loopholes. He owes his fortune to his hard work and his money bin is \\"full of souvenirs\\" since every coin reminds him of a specific circumstance. Rosa remains the foremost contemporary duck artist and has been nominated for five 2007 Eisner Awards. His work is regularly reprinted by itself as well as along with Barks stories for which he created a sequel. Daan Jippes, who can mimic Barks's art to a close extent, repenciled all of Barks's 1970s Junior Woodchucks stories, as well as Barks' final Uncle Scrooge stories, from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Other notable Disney artists who have worked with the Scrooge character include Michael Peraza, Marco Rota, William Van Horn, and Tony Strobl. In an interview with the Norwegian \\"Aftenposten\\" from 1992 Don Rosa says that \\"in the beginning Scrooge [owed] his existence to his nephew Donald, but that has changed and today it's Donald that [owes] his existence to Scrooge\\" and he also says that this is one of the reasons why he is so interested in Scrooge. Characterization =Overview= Scrooge's signature dive into money The character is almost exclusively portrayed as having worked his way up the financial ladder from humble immigrant roots. The real life of Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish-American immigrant and tycoon of the Industrial Age, and the fictional character of Charles Dickens' miser Ebenezer Scrooge are both believed to be strong influences on Scrooge's characterization. The comic book series The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, written and drawn by Don Rosa, shows Scrooge's fictional life. As a young boy, he takes up a job polishing and shining boots in his native Glasgow. A pivotal moment comes in 1877, when a ditchdigger pays him with an 1875 US dime, which is useless as currency in 19th century Glasgow; he only notices what sort of coin he's been given after the man has left. Enraged, Scrooge vows to never be taken advantage of again, to be \\"sharper than the sharpies and smarter than the smarties.\\" He takes a position as cabin boy on a Clyde cattle ship to the United States to make his fortune at the age of 13. In 1898, after many adventures, he finally ends up in Klondike, where he finds a golden rock the size of a goose's egg. By the following year, he has made his first $1,000,000 and bought the deed for Killmule Hill from Casey Coot, the son of Clinton Coot and grandson of Cornelius Coot, the founder of Duckburg. He finally ends up in Duckburg in 1902. After some dramatic events where he faces both the Beagle Boys and President Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders at the same time, he tears down the rest of the old fort Duckburg and builds his famous Money Bin at the site. In the years to follow, Scrooge travels all around the world to increase his fortune, while his family remains behind to manage the Money Bin. When Scrooge finally returns to Duckburg, he is the richest duck in the world, rivaled only by Flintheart Glomgold, John D. Rockerduck, and less prominently, the maharaja of the fictional country Howdoyoustan (play on Hindustan). His experiences, however, have changed him into a hostile miser, and his family leaves him in disgust at his new personality. Some 12 years later, he closes his empire down, but eventually returns to a public life five years later and restarts his business in the comic's final chapter. He keeps the majority of his wealth in a massive Money Bin overlooking the city of Duckburg. In the short Scrooge McDuck and Money, he remarks to his nephews that this money is \\"just petty cash\\". In the Dutch and Italian version, he regularly forces Donald and his nephews to polish the coins one by one in order to pay off Donald's debts; Scrooge will not pay them much for this lengthy, tedious, hand-breaking work. As far as he is concerned, even 5 cents an hour is too much expenditure. A shrewd businessman and noted tightwad, he is fond of diving into and swimming in his money, without injury. He is also the richest member of The Billionaires Club of Duckburg, a society which includes the most successful businessmen of the world and allows them to keep connections with each other. Glomgold and Rockerduck are also influential members of the Club. His most famous prized possession is his Number One Dime. =Wealth= Valuation of Scrooge assets in Barks' The Second Richest Duck The sum of Scrooge's wealth is unclear. According to Barks' The Second Richest Duck as noted by a Time article, Scrooge is worth \\"one multiplujillion, nine obsquatumatillion, six hundred twenty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\\". The DuckTales episode \\"Liquid Assets\\", Fenton Crackshell (Scrooge's accountant) notes that McDuck's money bin contains \\"607 tillion 386 zillion 947 trillion 522 billion dollars and 36 cents\\". Don Rosa's Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck notes that Scrooge amounts to \\"five multiplujillion, nine impossibidillion, seven fantastica trillion dollars and sixteen cents\\". A thought bubble from Scrooge McDuck sitting in his car with his chauffeur in Walt Disney's Christmas Parade No. 1 (published in 1949) that takes place in the story \\"Letter to Santa\\" clearly states \\"What's the use of having 'eleven octillion dollars' if I don't make a big noise about it?\\". In DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp, Scrooge mentions \\"We quadzillionaires have our own ideas of fun.\\" In the first episode of the DuckTales reboot, Scrooge states that he runs \\"a multi-trillion dollar business\\". Forbes magazine has occasionally tried to estimate Scrooge's wealth in real terms. In 2007, the magazine estimated his wealth at $28.8 billion. By 2011, it rose to $44.1 billion due to the rise in gold prices. Another, more in-depth, analysis of Scrooge's wealth was done by MatPat of The Film Theory channel on YouTube. Using four different methodologies to calculate the volume of actual gold in Scrooge's money bin (depth gauge, ladder length, blueprints, and 3 cubic acres), the four amounts from most conservative to \\"more money than the entire planet Earth\\" the amounts were: $52,348,493,767.50 (depth gauge), $239,307,400,080 (ladder), $12,434,013,552,490 (blueprints), $333,927,633,863,527 (3 cubic acres); with each valuation based on a then current gold price of $1243.30 per troy ounce.Film Theorists, TV Theories S1 E3, Film Theory: Scrooge McDuck's Net Worth Solved (Disney's DuckTales), published August 8,2017 Whatever the amount, Scrooge never considers it to be enough; he believes that he has to continue to earn money by any means possible. A running gag is Scrooge always making profit on any business deal. On the other hand, his total estimated net worth is $315,360,000,000,000,000 or 315 quadrillion and 360 trillion as mentioned in one of his comics when Scrooge says that he would be broke in 600 years if he lost 1 billion dollars a minute but it is still not known.[Walt Disney \\"Golden Key\\" Comics Digest #January 19, 1970 \\"Much Luck McDuck\\"] =Education= Scrooge never completed a formal education, as he left school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge has become something of a scholar and an amateur archaeologist. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to treasure. Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers, and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition. As a result of his research, Scrooge has built up an extensive personal library, which includes many rare tomes. In Barks's and Rosa's stories, among the prized pieces of this library is an almost complete collection of Spanish and Dutch naval logs of the 16th and 17th centuries. Their references to the fates of other ships have often allowed Scrooge to locate sunken vessels and recover their treasures from their watery graves. Mostly self-taught as he is, Scrooge is a firm believer in the saying \\"knowledge is power\\". Scrooge is also an accomplished linguist and entrepreneur, having learned to speak several different languages during his business trips around the world, selling refrigerators to Eskimos, wind to windmill manufacturers in the Netherlands, etc. =Morality and beliefs= Both as a businessman and as a treasure hunter, Scrooge is noted for his drive to set new goals and face new challenges.This Christmas, Let's Celebrate a Different Scrooge: Scrooge McDuck, Mises Institute As Carl Barks described his character, for Scrooge there is \\"always another rainbow\\". The phrase later provided the title for one of Barks's better-known paintings depicting Scrooge. Periods of inactivity between adventures and lack of serious challenges tend to be depressing for Scrooge after a while; some stories see these phases take a toll on his health. Scrooge's other motto is \\"Work smarter, not harder.\\" As a businessman, Scrooge often resorts to aggressive tactics and deception. He seems to have gained significant experience in manipulating people and events towards his own ends. As often seen in stories by writer Guido Martina and occasionally by others, Scrooge is noted for his cynicism, especially towards ideals of morality when it comes to business and the pursuit of set goals. This has been noted by some as not being part of Barks's original profile of the character, but has since come to be accepted as one valid interpretation of Scrooge's way of thinking. Scrooge seems to have a personal code of honesty that offers him an amount of self-control. He can often be seen contemplating the next course of action, divided between adopting a ruthless pursuit of his current goal against those tactics he considers more honest. At times, he can sacrifice his goal in order to remain within the limits of this sense of honesty. Several fans of the character have come to consider these depictions as adding to the depth of his personality, because based on the decisions he takes Scrooge can be both the hero and the villain of his stories. This is one thing he has in common with his nephew Donald. Scrooge's sense of honesty also distinguishes him from his rival Flintheart Glomgold, who places no such self-limitations. During the cartoon series DuckTales, at times he would be heard saying to Glomgold, \\"You're a cheater, and cheaters never prosper!\\" Like his nephew Donald, Scrooge has also a temper (but not as a strong temper as his nephew) and rarely hesitates to use cartoon violence against those who provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to- door salesmen). However, he seems to be against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word‚Äînever breaking a promise once given.An example is when Scrooge, his family, and the Beagle Boys are trapped in the past. Hatching a plan to return to their normal time, he is told they could easily leave the Beagles stranded in the past; Scrooge refuses, noting that he gave his word everyone would return safely. In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions. Carl Barks gave Scrooge a definite set of ethics which were in tone with the time he was supposed to have made his fortune. The robber barons and industrialists of the 1890‚Äì1920s era were McDuck's competition as he earned his fortune. Scrooge proudly asserts \\"I made it by being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties! And I made it square!\\". Barks's creation is averse to dishonesty in the pursuit of wealth. When Disney filmmakers first contemplated a Scrooge feature cartoon in the fifties, the animators had no understanding of the Scrooge McDuck character and merely envisioned Scrooge as a duck version of Ebenezer Scrooge‚Äîa very unsympathetic character. In the end, they shelved the idea because a duck who gets all excited about money just was not funny enough. In an interview, Barks summed up his beliefs about Scrooge and capitalism: =DuckTales= Scrooge stars alongside his great-nephews in DuckTales In the DuckTales series, Scrooge has adopted the nephews (as Donald has joined the Navy and is away on his tour of duty), and, as a result, his darker personality traits are downplayed. While most of his persona remain from the comics, he is notably more optimistic and level-headed in the animated cartoon. In an early episode, Scrooge credits his improved temperament to the nephews and Webby (his housekeeper's granddaughter, who comes to live in Scrooge's mansion), saying that \\"for the first time since I left Scotland, I have a family\\". Though Scrooge is far from tyrannical in the comics, he is rarely so openly affectionate. While he still hunts for treasure in DuckTales, many episodes focus on his attempts to thwart villains. However, he remains just as tightfisted with money as he has always been. But he's also affable and patient with his family and friends. Scrooge displays a strict code of honor, insisting that the only valid way to acquire wealth is to \\"earn it square,\\" and he goes to great lengths to thwart those (sometimes even his own nephews) who gain money dishonestly. This code also prevents him from ever being dishonest himself, and he avows that \\"Scrooge McDuck's word is as good as gold.\\" He also expresses great disgust at being viewed by others as a greedy liar and cheater. The series fleshes out Scrooge's upbringing by depicting his life as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest but also, he defends his family and friends from any dangers, including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It's shown that money is no longer the most important thing in his life. For one episode, he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is to make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him. On occasion, he demonstrates considerable physical strength by single-handedly beating bigger foes. He credits his robustness to \\"lifting money bags.\\" =Voice= Another part of Scrooge's persona is his Scottish accent. Dallas McKennon was the first actor to provide Scrooge's voice for the 1960 Disneyland Records album, Donald Duck and His Friends. When Scrooge later made his speaking animated debut in Scrooge McDuck and Money in 1967, he was voiced by Bill Thompson. Thompson had previously voiced Jock the Scottish Terrier in Lady and the Tramp and, according to Alan Young, Thompson had some Scottish ancestry. Following Scrooge McDuck and Money's release, Scrooge made no further animated appearances prior to Thompson's death in 1971. In 1974, Disneyland Records produced the album, An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players. Alan Young belonged to a Dickens Society and was asked to help adapt the story to fit in the classic Disney characters. Young, whose parents were Scottish and who lived in Scotland for a few years when he was an infant, voiced Scrooge for this record in addition to voicing Mickey Mouse and Merlin from The Sword in the Stone. When Disney decided to adapt the record into the 1983 theatrical short, Mickey's Christmas Carol, Young returned to voice Scrooge. Young remained as Disney's official voice for Scrooge until his death in 2016, although Will Ryan voiced Scrooge for the 1987 television special, Sport Goofy in Soccermania and Alan Reid voiced Scrooge for Tuomas Holopainen's 2014 album, Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge. Young's last performance as Scrooge was in the 2016 Mickey Mouse short, \\"No\\". Since Young's death, several actors have provided Scrooge's voice. John Kassir has voiced Scrooge for the Mickey Mouse shorts starting with \\"Duck the Halls\\" in 2016. Eric Bauza voiced Scrooge for a cameo in the television series, Legend of the Three Caballeros. Scottish actor Enn Reitel voices Scrooge for Disney park appearances as well as in the English dub of Kingdom Hearts III. David Tennant voices Scrooge for the 2017 reboot of DuckTales. According to executive producer Matt Youngberg: =Europe= Many of the European comics based on the Disney Universe have created their own version of Scrooge McDuck, usually involving him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s‚Äì1980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or blunderbuss, or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings up at the end of the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb ‚Äì something which Scrooge shows little concern for ‚Äì he tends to end up with nothing. Another running joke is Scrooge reminiscing about his adventures while gold prospecting in the Klondike much to Donald and the nephews' chagrin at hearing the never-ending and tiresome stories. =Age= According to Carl Barks' 1955 one-pager \\"Watt an Occasion\\" (Uncle Scrooge #12), Scrooge is 75 years of age. According to Don Rosa, Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867, and earned his Number One Dime (or First Coin) exactly ten years later. The DuckTales episodes (and many European comics) show a Scrooge who hailed from Scotland in the 19th century, yet was clearly familiar with all the technology and amenities of the 1980s. Despite this extremely advanced age, Scrooge does not appear to be on the verge of dotage, and is vigorous enough to keep up with his nephews in adventures. With rare exceptions, there appears to be no sign of him slowing down. Barks responded to some fan letters asking about Scrooge's Adamic age, that in the story \\"That's No Fable!\\", when Scrooge drank water from a Fountain of Youth for several days, rather than making him young again (bodily contact with the water was required for that), ingesting the water rejuvenated his body and cured him of his rheumatia, which arguably allowed Scrooge to live beyond his expected years with no sign of slowdown or senility. Don Rosa's solution to the issue of Scrooge's age is that he set all of his stories in the 1950s or earlier, which was when he himself discovered and reveled in Barks' stories as a kid, and in his unofficial timelines, he had Scrooge die in 1967, at the age of 100 years.https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/~starback/dcml/creators/rosa-on- himself.html#dateshttps://inducks.org/s.php?c=GC+HD++77B In the 15th episode of the 2017 DuckTales reboot, \\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\\", it is revealed that Scrooge was \\"stuck in a timeless demon dimension\\" called Demogorgana for an unknown amount of time, which is used to explain his young look.\\"The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!\\" In the 21st episode, \\"The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!\\", Webby Vanderquack's research on Scrooge reveals that he was born in 1867, as previously established by Rosa. This would make Scrooge 153 years old as of 2020.\\"The Other Bin of Scrooge McDuck!\\" In popular culture =Cultural impact= Forbes magazine routinely lists Scrooge McDuck on its annual \\"Fictional 15\\" list of the richest fictional characters by net worth: { - valign =\\"top\\"  * 2002: #4 with $8.2 billion * 2005: #6 with $8.2 billion * 2006: #3 with $10.9 billion * 2007: #1 with $28.8 billion (‚Ç§17.6 billion)  * 2008: #2 with $29.1 billion * 2010: #2 with $33.5 billion * 2011: #1 with $44.1 billion * 2013: #1 with $65.4 billion } Grupo Ronda S.A has the license to use the character, as well as other Disney characters in the board game T√≠o Rico Mc.

In 2008 The Weekly Standard parodied the bailout of the financial markets by publishing a memo where Scrooge applies to the TARP program.

(Disney's DuckTales). Youtube, 8 August 2017. Retrieved 17 August 2017 =Scrooge McDuck Universe= The popularity of Scrooge McDuck comics spawned an entire mythology around the character, including new supporting characters, adventures, and life experiences as told by numerous authors. The popularity of the Duck universe ‚Äì the fandom term for the associated intellectual properties that have developed from Scrooge's stories over the years, including the city of Duckburg ‚Äì has led Don Rosa to claim that \\"in the beginning Scrooge [owed] his existence to his nephew Donald, but that has changed and today it's Donald that [owes] his existence to Scrooge.\\" In addition to the many original and existing characters in stories about Scrooge McDuck, authors have frequently led historical figures to meet Scrooge over the course of his life. Most notably, Scrooge has met US president Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Scrooge would meet each other at least three times: in the Dakotas in 1883, in Duckburg in 1902, and in Panama in 1906. See Historical Figures in Scrooge McDuck stories. Based on writer Don Rosa's The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, a popular timeline chronicling Scrooge's adventures was created consisting of the most important \\"facts\\" about Scrooge's life. See Scrooge McDuck timeline according to Don Rosa. In 2014, composer Tuomas Holopainen of Nightwish released a conceptual album based on the book, The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck. The album is titled Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge. Don Rosa illustrated the cover artwork for the album. =In other media= The character of Scrooge has appeared in various mediums aside from comic books. Scrooge's voice was first heard on the 1960 record album Donald Duck and His Friends; Dal McKennon voiced the character for this appearance. It took the form of a short dramatization called \\"Uncle Scrooge's Rocket to the Moon,\\" a story of how Scrooge builds a rocket to send all his money to the moon to protect it from the Beagle Boys. In 1961 this story was reissued as a 45rpm single record entitled \\"Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge's Money Rocket.\\" Initially, Scrooge was to make his animated debut in the Donald Duck theatrical cartoons. Late in 1954, Carl Barks was asked by the Disney Studios if he would be free to write a script for a Scrooge McDuck 7-minute animated cartoon.http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonapproach.htm Scrooge was a huge success in the comic books at the time, and Disney now wanted to introduce the miserly duck to theater audiences as well. Barks supplied the studios with a detailed 9-page script, telling the story of the happy-go-lucky Donald Duck working for the troubled Scrooge who tries to save his money from a hungry rat.http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonsynopsis.htm Barks also sent number of sketches of his ideas for the short, including a money-sorting machine, which Barks had already used on the cover of one of the Uncle Scrooge issues.http://www.cbarks.dk/theshelvedcartoonsketches.htm The script was never used as Disney soon after decided to concentrate on TV shows instead. Scrooge's first appearance in animated form (save for a brief Mickey Mouse Club television series cameo) was in Disney's 1967 theatrical short Scrooge McDuck and Money (voiced by Bill Thompson), in which he teaches his nephews basic financial tips.Berg, Bill (writer) & Hamilton, Luske (director). Scrooge McDuck and Money, Walt Disney Studios. March 23, 1967. In 1974, Disneyland Records released an adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol . Eight years later, the Walt Disney Animation Studios decided to make a featurette of this same story, this time dubbed Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). He also appeared as himself in the television special Sport Goofy in Soccermania (1987). Scrooge's biggest role outside comics would come in the 1987 animated series DuckTales, a series loosely based on Carl Barks's comics, and where Alan Young returned to voice him. In this series, premiered over two-hours on September 18, 1987, while the regular episodes began three days later, Scrooge becomes the legal guardian of Huey, Dewey and Louie when Donald joins the United States Navy. Scrooge's DuckTales persona is considerably mellow compared to most previous appearances; his aggression is played down and his often duplicitous personality is reduced in many episodes to that of a curmudgeonly but well-meaning old uncle. Still, there are flashes of Barks' Scrooge to be seen, particularly in early episodes of the first season. Scrooge also appeared in DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp, released during the series' run. He was mentioned in the Darkwing Duck episode \\"Tiff of the Titans\\", but never really seen. He has appeared in some episodes of Raw Toonage, two shorts of Mickey Mouse Works and some episodes (specially \\"House of Scrooge\\") of Disney's House of Mouse, as well as the direct-to-video films Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas and Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas. His video game appearances include the three DuckTales releases (DuckTales, DuckTales 2, and DuckTales: The Quest for Gold), and in Toontown Online as the accidental creator of the Cogs. Additionally, he is a secret playable character in 2008 quiz game, Disney TH!NK Fast. In the 2012 Nintendo 3DS game Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion, he is one of the first characters Mickey rescues, running a shop in the fortress selling upgrades and serving as a Sketch summon in which he uses his cane pogostick from the Ducktales NES games. Scrooge in Kingdom Hearts II Scrooge also makes sporadic appearances in Disney's and Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts series, helping Mickey Mouse establish a world transit system to expand his business empire to other worlds. He first appears in Kingdom Hearts II as a minor non-playable character in Hollow Bastion, where he is trying to recreate his favorite ice cream flavor ‚Äì sea-salt.Nojima, Kazushige (writer), Nomura, Tetsuya (writer/director), Oka, Masaru (writer), Sakemi, Harunori (writer) & Watanabe, Daisuke (writer).

He works on establishing an ice-cream business in Radiant Garden and gives Ventus three passes to the Dream Festival in Disney Town. Scrooge returns in Kingdom Hearts III, now managing a bistro in Twilight Town with the help of Remy from Ratatouille. Alan Young reprises the role in the English version of Birth by Sleep, while Enn Reitel voices the character in III. Scrooge has appeared in the Boom! Studios Darkwing Duck comic, playing a key role at the end of its initial story, \\"The Duck Knight Returns\\". Later he would also play a key role on the final story arc \\"Dangerous Currency\\", where he teams up with Darkwing Duck in order to stop the Phantom Blot and Magica De Spell from taking over St. Canard and Duckburg. In 2015, Scrooge was seen in the Mickey Mouse short \\"Goofy's First Love\\", where Mickey and Donald are trying to help Goofy find his love. Donald suggests money, and they head over to Scrooge's mansion where Donald tells his uncle that Goofy needs a million dollars. Scrooge then has his butler kick them out. When Goofy is inadvertently launched from a treadmill and catapulted off another building, he lands in Scrooge's mansion. The butler kicks Goofy out and the process repeats itself but this time Mickey and Donald are catapulted as well and kicked out by the butler. Scrooge is seen at the end attending Goofy's wedding with a sandwich. In the 2016 Mickey Mouse Christmas special, \\"Duck the Halls\\", after Young's death, John Kassir took over voicing Scrooge McDuck, however he later tweeted that he won't be reprising his role in the reboot. Kassir continues to voice the character in subsequent appearances in this series. Scrooge makes a cameo appearance in the Legend of the Three Caballeros episode \\"Shangri-La-Di-Da\\". In the new DuckTales, Scrooge is played by Scottish actor David Tennant. This series shows that Scrooge previously adventured with his nephew Donald and his niece Della Duck, but when Della disappeared during an expedition to space, Donald blamed Scrooge and the two became estranged for ten years. He develops a pessimistic attitude about family as a result until Donald re-enters his life with Huey, Dewey, and Louie, rekindling his spirit of adventure and appreciation of family, and he invites them to live with him at McDuck Manor as they travel the world on adventures.

The ritual is referred to as \\"sitting shiva\\" in English. The shiva period lasts for seven days following the burial. Following the initial period of despair and lamentation immediately after the death, shiva embraces a time when individuals discuss their loss and accept the comfort of others. Its observance is a requirement for the parents, spouses, children, and/or siblings of the person who has died. It is not a requirement for an individual who was less than thirty days old at the time of death. At the funeral, mourners wear an outer garment that is torn before the procession in a ritual known as keriah. In some traditions, mourners wear a black ribbon that is cut in place of an everyday garment. The torn article is worn throughout the entirety of shiva. Typically, the seven days begin immediately after the deceased has been buried. Following burial, mourners assume the halakhic status of (). It is necessary for the burial spot to be entirely covered with earth in order for shiva to commence. This state lasts for the entire duration of shiva. During the period of shiva, mourners remain at home. Friends and family visit those in mourning in order to give their condolences and provide comfort. The process, dating back to biblical times, formalizes the natural way an individual confronts and overcomes grief. Shiva allows for the individual to express their sorrow, discuss the loss of a loved one, and slowly re-enter society. Etymology The word shiva comes from the Hebrew word shiv'ah (), referring to the seven-day length of this period. Biblical accounts similar to shiva A number of Biblical accounts described mourning for fixed periods; in several cases, this period is seven days. After the death of Jacob, his son Joseph and those accompanying Joseph observed a seven- day mourning period. The seven day period of mourning that Joseph endured was depicted by the sages before the revelation at Mount Sinai. In the Book of Job, it was stated that Job mourned his misfortune for seven days. During this time, he sat on the ground with his friends surrounding him. Biblical mourning involved refraining from feasts, songs, and Temple rituals. Amos declared to the people that God would \\"turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentations\\" as a punishment for sin, describing this mourning as similar to \\"the mourning for an only son\\". After two of the sons of Aaron, a High Priest, were killed, Aaron refused to eat the animal sacrifices, saying this would inappropriate at a time he was mourning the sons' death. Stages of bereavement The process of mourning begins with the first stage, otherwise known as Aninut. During this time, individuals experience the initial shock of their loss. Often emotions associated with the period of Aninut include anger, denial, and disbelief. This is the most extreme period of mourning, and it is at this time in which the keriah, or the rending of the garments, is performed. The stage commences from the moment the individual dies until the end of the funeral. Following Aninut is shiva, in which the mourners delve into seven days dedicated towards remembrance of the deceased individual. Throughout shiva, individuals are instructed to take a break from their routines in order to focus on their loss as well. Following shiva is the stage of mourning known as sheloshim. During this period, mourning proceeds for thirty days following the burial. The first seven days of sheloshim is the period of shiva, however sheloshim continues on after shiva has ended. After the intense period of shiva, which is mainly contained to the home, sheloshim allows individuals to leave their residences and begin to interact with others again. Sheloshim encourages individuals to begin to partake in social relations in order to slowly ease back into normal daily activities. Through the final stage, yahrzeit or yizkor, the twelve-month period of mourning ceases and yearly remembrance ceremonies are held for the individual who had died. Computing the timing of shiva and sheloshim The period of shiva (seven days of mourning) commences immediately after the burial; the remainder of the day is considered to be the first day of shiva, even though it is only a partial day. On the seventh day (e.g., on Monday, if the first day was Tuesday), shiva ends in the morning after shacharit prayers (if no public services are held on the morning of the seventh day, a service is conducted in the home of the mourner); thus, the seventh day is again a partial day. The sheloshim (thirty-day period of mourning) continues until the end of morning services on the 30th day, 23 days after the end of shiva; as with shiva, the two partial days at the beginning and end are counted as full days. Had the news of a close relative's death reached him 30 days after his deceased relative had expired, the 30th-day included, the mourner is only obligated to sit in mourning for one day. However, had the news of a close relative's death reached him within 30 days after expiration, the mourner is required to sit in mourning for seven days. =Religious holidays during times of mourning= Religious holidays during shiva and sheloshim change the mourning period slightly. Because Judaism embraces the holidays with joy, the sadness and grief associated with mourning are meant to be set aside until the holiday concludes. Typically, if an individual dies before the beginning of a holiday, the holiday removes the observance of shiva or sheloshim. The days of the holiday are counted towards the days of mourning, and the rules enforced during mourning are revoked in order to encourage the celebration of a holiday. If a death occurred during the holiday or unknowingly, mourning commences after the holiday ends. In other situations, if the entirety of shiva has been observed prior to the start of a holiday, the holiday will cancel the observance of sheloshim, signifying the fulfillment of this period of mourning. A major Jewish Holiday would terminate the shiva, whereas the Shabbat merely suspends certain aspects thereof. Sabbath During Shabbat, private mourning continues, while public mourning is suspended. Individuals are permitted to wear shoes and leave their home to partake in public prayer services. In order to prepare for Shabbat, individuals are allowed to interrupt shiva for up to one hour and fifteen minutes in order to cook, dress, and perform other tasks. If this is not enough time to do so, in certain situations there may be two and a half hours allotted for such. Passover During Passover, any days in observance of shiva before the start will equate to seven when the holiday begins. Since Passover is celebrated for eight days, any mourning prior will total to fifteen days when holiday ends, leaving only fifteen days of observance of sheloshim. Shavuot During Shavuot, any days in observance of shiva before the start will equate to seven when the holiday begins. The first day of Shavuot equates to seven days. The second day of Shavuot is considered the fifteenth day, leaving only fifteen days left of observance of sheloshim. Sukkot During Sukkot, any days in observance of shiva before the start will equate to seven when the holiday begins. Since Sukkot is observed for seven days, any mourning prior will total to fourteen days when the holiday ends. Shemini Atzeret is considered the eighth day of Sukkot, and equates to seven days of mourning. Simchat Torah is considered the twenty-second day of mourning, leaving only eight days of observance of sheloshim. Rosh Hashanah During Rosh Hashanah, any days in observance of shiva before the start will equate to seven days when the holiday begins. Yom Kippur following Rosh Hashanah, will symbolize the end of mourning, and the end of both shiva and sheloshim. Yom Kippur During Yom Kippur, any days in observance of shiva before the start will equate to seven days when the holiday begins. Sukkot, following Yom Kippur, will symbolize the end of mourning, and the end of both shiva and sheloshim. Yom Tov If the death occurs during Yom Tov, shiva does not begin until the burial is completed. Burial may not take place on Yom Tov, but can during the intermediate days of Sukkot or Passover, otherwise known as Chol HaMoed. Chol HaMoed If a burial occurs on Chol HaMoed of Passover, shiva does not begin until after the Yom Tov is completed. In the Diaspora, where most Yamim Tovim are observed for two days, mourning does not take place on the second day, but the day is still counted as one of the days of shiva. Shiva customs There are many traditions that are upheld in order to observe shiva. Throughout this time, mourners are required to stay at home and refrain from engaging with the social world. =Keriah= After hearing of the death of a close relative, Jewish beliefs and traditions instruct individuals to tear their clothing as the primary expression of grief. The process of tearing the garment is known as keriah. The tearing is done while standing and is required to extend in length to a tefach (handbreadth),, s.v. Hilkot Avel 8:1‚Äì2 or what is equivalent to about . Upon tearing the clothing, the mourner recites a blessing which describes God as \\"the true Judge\\". This blessing reminds mourners to acknowledge that God has taken the life of a close relative, and is seen as the first step in the acceptance of grief. The garment is torn over the heart if the individual who died was a parent, or over the chest on the right side if the individual who died was another relative. The torn article of clothing is worn throughout the period of shiva, the only exception being on Shabbat. =Washing hands= After being near or around the deceased, it is ancient custom to wash one's self, or at minimum wash hands, as a means of purification. After a funeral, or visitation to a cemetery, individuals are required to wash hands as a mark of spiritual transition through water. During shiva, it is especially mandatory to do so before entering the home. There are many different origins of this tradition, however typically the act is associated with symbolic cleansing, the idea being that death is impure in a spiritual sense. Within Judaism, the living is thought to emphasize value of life rather than focus on death. When washing hands after visiting the deceased, it is custom to not pass the cup of water used from person to person. The reason behind this stems from the beliefs and hopes of stopping the tragedy it began, rather than allowing it to continue from person to person as symbolized by the passing of the cup. =Meal of Condolences= The first meal which should be eaten after the funeral is known as the seudat havra'ah (). Traditionally, mourners should be served the meal of condolences by neighbors.Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 205:7 The act of preparing such meal is considered to be a mitzvah. Though being the tradition, if the meal of condolences is unable to be prepared by a neighbor, extended family may do so, and in the last case the mourner themselves may prepare the meal. It was seen that many times following the death of a loved one, individuals who were in mourning possessed a death wish and often attempted to undergo starvation. The meal given to them upon returning home provided warmth in order to lessen such wishes. In order to be deemed the meal of condolences, the food selections must contain several specific dishes. An example of this is bread, which is symbolic for the staff of life. Aside from this, the meal must contain hard-boiled eggs, cooked vegetables, and coffee or tea. Often wine is allowed to be served as well. The only time the meal of condolences is not served occurs when there is no public observance of mourning or if the individual who died did so due to suicide. =Candles= A red shiva candle Within Judaism, candles are symbolic of special events throughout life. They are lit during major holidays, during Shabbat, and during the process of mourning candles are required to burn for the entirety of shiva. Prior to the death of Rabbi Judah HaNasi in the third century, he instructed that a light should be kept burning.Ketubot 103a During shiva, the candle represents the deceased. The light is symbolic of the human being, the wick and flame are representative of the body and soul respectively, as well as their connection with one another. Traditionally, candles are required to be made of either oil or paraffin and are not allowed to be electric. The candle is ideally burned in the home of the deceased, however exceptions can be made. Regardless, however, candles should be in the presence of those observing shiva. During major holidays, the candle may be moved in order to lessen the feeling of mourning and focus on the joyous occasion at hand. =Mirrors= Individuals who are in mourning, or in a shiva home, are required to cover mirrors from the time an individual dies until the end of shiva. There are several reasons as to why Judaism requires this. The first reason may stem from the idea that man was created in the image of God. In doing so, man acquires the same dignity and value as God. When a creation of God dies, this lessens His image. The death of human beings disrupts the connection between the living man and living God. Since the purpose of mirrors is to reflect such image, they are covered during mourning. A second reason as to why mirrors are covered in Judaism branches from contemplation of ones relationship with God during the death of a loved one. At this time, individuals are instructed to focus on grief and mourning rather than themselves. In order to prevent selfish thoughts, all mirrors are covered within the homes of mourners. A third reason which depicts why mirrors should be covered comes from the law which states that an individual may not stand directly in front of an image or worship one. Therefore, mirrors and pictures are hidden during mourning. Pictures Some have an additional custom to cover all pictures of people. One reason, which is linked to the covering of mirrors (and, by some, all pictures of people too) is that prayer services are held in the house of mourning, if a quorum can be gathered, and \\"Jewish law clearly states that one may not worship an image or standing directly in front of one .. picture .. mirror.\\" =Shoes= Leather shoes are not permitted to be worn during the observance of shiva. The reasoning behind this involves a lack of luxury. Without leather shoes, an individual is able to concentrate on mourning and the deeper meaning of life. However, exceptions to this rule include pregnant women. and those with ailments of the feet. Aside from those observing shiva or sheloshim, guests and individuals who are not should refrain from wearing leather shoes in the home of mourners as well. =Personal grooming= Similar to the idea of wearing leather shoes, hygiene and personal grooming fall under the idea of the task being done for pleasure. Such acts are prohibited during the observation of shiva or sheloshim as they are seen as actions done for physical comfort. However, there is a fine line which separates grooming for hygienic reasons and for comfort. Therefore, in order to prevent grooming for comfort individuals who are mourning are instructed to only bathe separate parts of the body, head, and face. On top of this, cold or cool water is recommended. The use of cosmetics are not allowed as this constitutes as an act done for comfort and pleasure. However, the exception to this rule being a woman who is a bride, engaged to be married, dating to be married, or feels as though the use of makeup is necessary. =\\"Sitting\\" shiva= \\"Sitting\\" shiva refers to the act of sitting on low stools during times of mourning. As mentioned in the Book of Job, upon mourning, Job's friends \\"sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights\\". Therefore, originally, individuals who were observing a period of mourning were required to turn couches or beds over and sit on the ground. After time, modifications towards this rule were made. The Halakhah states that an individual is required to sit on low stools, or on the floor. The individual partakes in sitting on a low stool in order to signify their lack of concern for personal comfort during their time of mourning. Mourning finds its expression in the sorrow and anguish of the soul and in symbolic, external actions. Different communities have practised different customs during the actual process of \\"sitting\\" shiva. Sephardic Jews no longer sit whilst draped in their Tallit, but Yemenite Jews still follow the ancient Jewish custom of sitting seven-days whilst draped in a Tallit. The practice is alluded to in the Talmud (Mo'ed Katan),Babylonian Talmud (Mo'ed Katan 15a). In Meiri's commentary, Beit ha-Be·∏•irah (ibid. s.v. ◊ê◊ë◊ú ◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ë ◊ë◊¢◊ò◊ô◊§◊™ ◊î◊®◊ê◊©), he writes: \\"The mourner requires having his head covered, so that he will not remain bare- headed; his head being draped in such a way that part of his face is covered in front of his eyes, as well as below in front of his lip, so that he might appear as a man brought under submission and broken. Insofar that God has said to Ezekiel (Ezek. 24:17) [at a time of joy], 'Do not lay a covering upon your moustache,' we learn the reverse of what the entire world is required to do [when they are in mourning].\\" and in the writings of the early rabbinic authorities., s.v. Hilkot Avel 5:19, s.v. Hilkot AvelJoseph Karo, Shulchan Arukh (Yoreh De'ah 386:1), Hil. Avel (p. 439) Among Ashkenazi and Sephardic communities the practice is now obsolete, they adhering to the adjudicators of Jewish law that have come of late (Bayit Chadash, the ·π¨urei Zahav, and Siftei Cohen) and who have canceled the custom, writing thus: \\"And at this time, there is no custom of covering up one's head, so that it may not lead to frivolity. In any case, the hat should be pulled over one's eyes.\\" The only ones who continue to observe the custom are the Jews of Yemen. =Place of observance= The ideal place to observe shiva is in the home of the deceased individual. If this is not possible, the second best place is in the home of a relative close to the deceased. During the observance of shiva, individuals are generally not permitted to leave the premises. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule, including: not having enough room to house for every individual observing, the loss of another loved one, and the inability to conduct services in the home. If an individual mourning is allowed to leave the home, they must do so without disturbing others and never alone. Prayers in the shiva house Praying in the home of a mourner is done in order to demonstrate respect for the grieving individual as well as the deceased. Even as early as 1790, the \\"Hebra Maarib beZemanah Oheb Shalom\\" (◊ó◊ë◊®◊î ◊û◊¢◊®◊ô◊ë ◊ë◊ñ◊û◊†◊î ◊ê◊ï◊î◊ë ◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù) organization was founded in order to provide mourners observing shiva with a minyan. During 1853 in London, the \\"Hebrath Menachem Abelim Hesed Ve Emeth\\" organization was founded to accomplish a similar goal. Throughout history, prayers during mourning have been important. However, during shiva, the prayers change slightly. =Kaddish= During the process of mourning, Kaddish is typically recited. Rather than losing faith in the religion, Jewish traditions require those who have experienced the loss of a loved one to publicly assert their faith in God. This is typically done in front of a minyan. The recitation of Kaddish is done in order to protect the dignity and merit of the individual who died within God's eyes. Judaism believes that prior to a soul's entry into heaven, a maximum of twelve months is required in order for even the worst soul to be purified. Though the entirety of mourning lasts for twelve months, Kaddish is only recited for eleven months so as to not imply the soul required an entire twelve months of purification. =Mourner's prayer= Traditionally the true mourner's prayer is known as El Malei Rachamim in Ashkenazi literature and Hashkavah in Sephardic literature. Often the mourner's prayer is mistaken for Kaddish. The recitation of the mourner's prayer is done for the soul of an individual who has died. The prayer itself is an appeal for the soul of the deceased to be given proper rest. Typically recitation of this prayer is done at the graveside during burial, during the unveiling of the tombstone, as in the Yizkor services on Jewish holidays. If the recitation is done as an individual commemoration, the prayer contains the name of the individual who died. However, if the recitation is done in the presence of a group, the prayer will contain a description of the individual who died. =Minyan during shiva= A minyan is traditionally a quorum of ten or more adult males. Often in Conservative or Reform communities, a minyan is composed of a mix of ten or more adult males and females. During shiva, a minyan will gather at the home of those in mourning for services. The services are similar to those held at a synagogue. During shiva, however, certain prayers or verses are either added or omitted. During the days that the Torah is read in a synagogue, it is likewise read at the shiva home. An effort is made by the community to lend a Torah scroll to the mourner for this purpose. =Changes in service during mourning= The following changes are made in the Shacharit (morning) prayer, listed by order in the prayer service: * Omission of the Priestly Blessing and Hallel on Rosh Chodesh. * Omission of Tachanun and Nefilat Appayim; similarly, on Monday & Thursday mornings (before Torah reading), Erech Apayim is omitted. * Omission of Psalm 20 * Omission of * Addition of Psalm 49 - Redemption of the Soul (): twice per day: mornings, also evenings (Sfard) or Mincha (Ashkenaz). * Substitution of Psalm 16 for Psalm 49 on days when Tachanun is omitted * Omission of Pitum Haketoret In addition, the following changes are made in other prayers: * Omission of Tachanun and Nefilat Appayim from the Mincha service * Omission of the six Psalms before Friday night services * Spices are omitted from use in the home of a mourner during Havdalah (the end of shabbat).

A semi-trailer attaches to the tractor with a type of hitch called a fifth-wheel. It is variously known as a transport truck, semi-trailer truck, tractor-trailer truck, semi- tractor truck, semi-truck, trailer truck, tractor truck, transfer truck, articulated truck, artic, single truck, semi-tractor-trailer, semi-trailer, tractor-trailer, semi-tractor, semi, trailer, tractor, big rig, eighteen- wheeler and articulated lorry, depending on the country and region. Regional configurations =Europe= A semi-trailer truck (Renault Magnum) of Ninatrans in London, England The noticeable difference between tractor units in Europe and North America is that almost all European models are cab over engine (called \\"forward control\\" in England), while the majority of North American trucks are \\"conventional\\" (called \\"normal control\\" or \\"bonneted\\" in England). European trucks, whether straight trucks or fully articulated, have a sheer face on the front. This allows shorter trucks with longer trailers (with larger freight capacity) within the legal maximum total length. Furthermore, it offers greater maneuverability in confined areas, a more balanced weight-distribution and better overall view for the driver. The major disadvantage is that for repairs on COE trucks, the entire cab has to hinge forward to allow maintenance access. Conversely, \\"conventional\\" cab tractors offer the driver a more comfortable driving environment, easier access getting in or out and better protection in a collision. In Europe usually only the driven tractor axle has dual wheels, while single wheels are used for every other axle on the tractor and the trailer. The most common combination used in Europe is a semi tractor with two axles, and a cargo trailer with three axles, one of which is sometimes a lift axle, giving 5 axles and 12 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe as it is able to meet the EU maximum weight limit of without overloading any axle, Individual countries have raised their own weight limit, for example the UK which has a limit, this increase is achieved by adding an extra axle to the tractor usually in the form of a middle unpowered lifting axle (midlift) with a total of 14 wheels, The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but increases maneuverability while at the same time reducing fuel consumption and tyre wear when carrying lighter loads, by raising one or multiple axle set(s) off the roadway. Although lift axles usually operate automatically, they can be lowered manually even while carrying light loads, in order to remain within legal (safe) limits when, for example, navigating back-road bridges with severely restricted axle loads. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below. When using a dolly, which generally has to be equipped with lights and a license plate, rigid trucks can be used to pull semi-trailers. The dolly is equipped with a fifth wheel to which the trailer is coupled. Because the dolly attaches to a pintle hitch on the truck, maneuvering a trailer hooked to a dolly is different from maneuvering a fifth wheel trailer. Backing the vehicle requires same technique as backing an ordinary truck/full trailer combination, though the dolly/semi setup is probably longer, thus requiring more space for maneuvering. The tractor/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also, construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor/semi-trailer setup. Continental Europe All EuroCombi variants being considered for Europe-wide adoption The maximum overall length in the EU and EEA member states was with a maximum weight of if carrying an ISO container. However, rules limiting the semi-trailers to and 18.75 m are met with trucks carrying a standardized body with one additional 7.82 m body on tow as a trailer. truck combinations were developed under the branding of EcoCombi which influenced the name of EuroCombi for an ongoing standardization effort where such truck combinations shall be legal to operate in all jurisdictions of the European Economic Area. With the 50% increase in cargo weight, the fuel efficiency increases with an average of 20% with a corresponding relative decrease in carbon emissions and with the added benefit of one third fewer trucks on the road. The 1996 EU regulation defines a Europe Module System (EMS) as it was implemented in Sweden. The wording of EMS combinations and EuroCombi are now used interchangeably to point to truck combinations as specified in the EU document; however, apart from Sweden and Finland, the EuroCombi is only allowed to operate on specific roads in other EU member states. Since 1996, when Sweden and Finland formally won a final exemption from the European Economic Area rules with 60 tonne and combinations, all other From 2006, 25.25 m truck trailer combinations are to be allowed on restricted routes within Germany, following a similar (on-going) trial in The Netherlands. Similarly, Denmark has allowed 25.25 m combinations on select routes. These vehicles will run a weight limit. Two types are to be used: 1) a 26-tonne truck pulling a dolly and semi-trailer, or 2) an articulated tractor unit pulling a B-double, member states gained the ability to adopt the same rules. In Italy the maximum permitted weight (unless exceptional transport is authorized) is 44 tonnes for any kind of combination with five axles or more. Czechia has allowed 25.25 m combinations with a permission for a selected route. The tractor/semi-trailer configuration is rarely used on timber trucks, since these will use the two big advantages of having the weight of the load on the drive wheels, and the loader crane used to lift the logs from the ground can be mounted on the rear of the truck behind the load, allowing a short (lightweight) crane to reach both ends of the vehicle without uncoupling. Also construction trucks are more often seen in a rigid + midaxle trailer configuration instead of the tractor/semi-trailer setup. Nordic Countries A truck with a swap body pulling a trailer using a dolly; the overall length is Denmark and Norway allow trucks (Denmark from 2008, and Norway from 2008 on selected routes). In Sweden the allowed length has been since 1967. Before that, the maximum length was unlimited; the only limitations were on axle load. What stopped Sweden from adopting the same rules as the rest of Europe, when securing road safety, was the national importance of a competitive forestry industry. Finland, with the same road safety issues and equally important forestry industry, followed suit. The change made trucks able to carry three stacks of cut-to-length logs instead of two, as it would be in a short combination. They have one on stack together with a crane on the 6√ó4 truck, and two additional stacks on a four axle trailer. The allowed gross weight in both countries is up to depending on the distance between the first and last axle. In the negotiations starting in the late 1980s preceding Sweden and Finland's entries to the European Economic Area and later the European Union, they insisted on exemptions from the EU rules citing environmental concerns and the transportation needs of the logging industry. In 1995, after their entry to the union, the rules changed again, this time to allow trucks carrying a standard CEN unit of to draw a standard semi-trailer on a dolly, a total overall length of 25.25 m. Later, B-double combinations came into use, often with one container on the B-link and a container (or two containers) on a semi-trailer bed. In allowing the longer truck combinations, what would take two semi-trailer trucks and one truck and trailer to haul on the continent now could be handled by just two 25.25 m trucks ‚Äì greatly reducing overall costs and emissions. Prepared since late 2012 and effective on January 2013, Finland has changed its regulations to allow total maximum legal weight of a combination to be . At the same time the maximum allowed height would be increased by ; from current maximum of to . The effect this major maximum weight increase would cause to the roads and bridges in Finland over time is strongly debated. However, longer and heavier combinations are regularly seen on public roads; special permits are issued for special cargo. The mining company Boliden AB have a standing special permit for combinations on select routes between mines in the inland and the processing plant in Boliden, taking a load of ore. Volvo has a special permit for a , steering B-trailer-trailer combination carrying two containers to and from Gothenburg harbour and the Volvo Trucks factory, all on the island of Hisingen. Another example is the ongoing project En Trave Till (lit. One more pile/stack) started in December 2008. It will allow even longer vehicles to further rationalize the logging transports. As the name of the project points out, it will be able to carry four stacks of timber, instead of the usual three. The test is limited to Norrbotten county and the European route E4 between the timber terminal in √ñverkalix and the sawmill in Munksund (outside Pite√•). The vehicle is a long truck trailer combination with a gross weight exceeding . It is estimated that this will give a 20% lower cost and 20-25% CO2 emissions reduction compared to the regular truck combinations. As the combinations spreads its weight over more axles, braking distance, road wear and traffic safety is believed to be either the same or improved with the truck-trailer. In the same program two types of combinations will be tested in Dalsland and Bohusl√§n counties in western Sweden: an enhanced truck and trailer combination for use in the forest and a b-double for plain highway transportation to the mill in Skoghall. In 2012, the Northland Mining company received permission for combinations with normal axle load (an extra dolly) for use on the Kaunisvaara-Svappavaara route, carrying iron ore.full law text in Finnish language, explanation by Finnish Forest Association in English, 76 tons in the newspaper , the longest and heaviest truck in everyday use in Finland is operated by transport company Ketosen Kuljetus as part of a pilot project studying transport efficiency in the timber industry. The combined vehicle is long, has 13 axles, and weighs a total of . Starting from Jan 21 2019 Finland Government change the maximum allowed length of truck from . New types of vehicle combinations that differ from the current standards may also be used on the road. The requirements for combinations also include camera systems for side visibility, an advanced emergency braking and lane detector system, electronic driving stability system and electronically controlled brakes. United Kingdom Semi-trailer trucks with extended tents, representing Renault at Silverstone In the United Kingdom the maximum permitted gross weight of a semi-trailer truck without the use of a Special Type General Order (STGO) is . In order for a 44,000 kg semi-trailer truck to be permitted on UK roads the tractor and semi-trailer must have three or more axles each. Lower weight semi-trailer trucks can mean some tractors and trailer having fewer axles. In practice, as with double decker buses and coaches in the UK, there is no legal height limit for semi-trailer trucks; however, bridges over do not have the height marked on them. Semi-trailer trucks in continental Europe have a height limit of . Vehicles heavier than 44,000 kg are permitted on UK roads but are indivisible loads, which would be classed as abnormal (or oversize). Such vehicles are required to display an STGO (Special Types General Order) plate on the front of the tractor unit and, under certain circumstances, are required to travel by an authorized route and have an escort. Most UK trailers are long and, dependent on the position of the fifth wheel and kingpin, a coupled tractor unit and trailer will have a combined length of between . Although the Construction and Use Regulations allow a maximum rigid length of , this, combined with a shallow kingpin and fifth wheel set close to the rear of the tractor unit, can give an overall length of around . Starting in January 2012 the Department for Transport is conducting a trial of longer semi-trailers. The trial involves 900 semi- trailers of in length (i.e. longer than the current maximum), and a further 900 semi-trailers of in length (i.e. longer). This will result in the total maximum length of the semi-trailer truck being for trailers in length, and for trailers long. The increase in length will not result in the weight limit being exceeded and will allow some operators to approach the weight limit which may not have been previously possible due to the previous length of trailers. The trial will run for a maximum of 10 years. Providing certain requirements are fulfilled, a Special Types General Order (STGO) allows for vehicles of any size or weight to travel on UK roads. However, in practice any such vehicle has to travel by a route authorized by the Department of Transport and move under escort. The escort of abnormal loads in the UK is now predominantly carried out by private companies, but extremely large or heavy loads that require road closures must still be escorted by the police. In the UK, some semi-trailer trucks have eight tires on three axles on the tractor; these are known as six-wheelers or \\"six leggers\\", with either the center or rear axle having single wheels which normally steer as well as the front axle and can be raised when not needed (i.e. when unloaded or only a light load is being carried; an arrangement known as a TAG axle when it is the rear axle, or mid-lift when it is the center axle). Some trailers have two axles which have twin tires on each axle; other trailers have three axles, of which one axle can be a lift axle which has super-single wheels. In the UK, two wheels bolted to the same hub are classed as a single wheel, therefore a standard six-axle articulated truck is considered to have twelve wheels, even though it has twenty tires. The UK also allows semi-trailer truck which have six tires on two axles; these are known as four-wheelers. In 2009, the operator Denby Transport designed and built a B-Train (or B-Double) semi-trailer truck called the Denby Eco-Link to show the benefits of such a vehicle, which were a reduction in road accidents and result in less road deaths, a reduction in emissions due to the one tractor unit still being used and no further highway investment being required. Furthermore, Denby Transport asserted that two Eco- Links would replace three standard semi-trailer trucks while, if limited to the current UK weight limit of , it was claimed the Eco-Link would reduce carbon emissions by 16% and could still halve the number of trips needed for the same amount of cargo carried in conventional semi-trailer trucks. This is based on the fact that for light but bulky goods such as toilet paper, plastic bottles, cereals and aluminum cans, conventional semi-trailer trucks run out of cargo space before they reach the weight limit. At , as opposed to usually associated with B-Trains, the Eco-Link also exerts less weight per axle on the road compared to the standard six-axle semi-trailer truck. The vehicle was built after Denby Transport believed they had found a legal-loophole in the present UK law to allow the Eco-Link to be used on the public roads. The relevant legislation concerned the 1986 Road Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations. The 1986 regulations state that \\"certain vehicles\\" may be permitted to draw more than one trailer and can be up to . The point of law reportedly hinged on the definition of a \\"towing implement\\", with Denby prepared to argue that the second trailer on the Eco-Link was one. The Department for Transport were of the opinion that this refers to recovering a vehicle after an accident or breakdown, but the regulation does not explicitly state this. During BTAC performance testing the Eco-Link was given an \\"excellent\\" rating for its performance in maneuverability, productivity, safety and emissions tests, superseding ordinary semi-trailer trucks in many respects. Reportedly, private trials had also shown the Denby vehicle had a 20% shorter stopping distance than conventional semi-trailer trucks of the same weight, due to having extra axles. The active steer system meant that the Eco-Link had a turning circle of , the same as a conventional semi-trailer truck. Although the Department for Transport advised that the Eco-Link was not permissible on public roads, Denby Transport gave the Police prior warning of the timing and route of the test drive on the public highway, as well as outlining their position in writing to the Eastern Traffic Area Office. On 1 December 2009 Denby Transport were preparing to drive the Eco-Link on public roads, but this was cut short because the Police pulled the semi-trailer truck over as it left the gates in order to test it for its legality \\"to investigate any... offenses which may be found\\". The Police said the vehicle was unlawful due to its length and Denby Transport was served with a notice by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) inspector to remove the vehicle from the road for inspection. Having returned to the yard, Denby Transport was formally notified by Police and VOSA that the semi-trailer truck could not be used. Neither the Eco-Link, nor any other B-Train, have since been permitted on UK roads. However, this prompted the Department for Transport to undertake a desk study into semi-trailer trucks, which has resulted in the longer semi-trailer trial which commenced in 2012. =North America= Tractor unit hauling tractor units in Idaho In North America, the combination vehicles made up of a powered semi-tractor and one or more semitrailers are known as \\"semis\\", \\"semitrailers\\",Merriam-Webster \\"tractor-trailers\\", \\"big rigs\\", \\"semi-trucks\\", \\"eighteen-wheelers\\" or \\"semi-tractor-trailers\\". The tractor unit typically has two or three axles; those built for hauling heavy-duty commercial-construction machinery may have as many as five, some often being lift axles. The most common tractor-cab layout has a forward engine, one steering axle, and two drive axles. The fifth-wheel trailer coupling on most tractor trucks is movable fore and aft, to allow adjustment in the weight distribution over its rear axle(s). Ubiquitous in Europe, but less common in North America since the 1990s, is the cabover engine configuration, where the driver sits next to, or over the engine. With changes in the US to the maximum length of the combined vehicle, the cabover was largely phased out of North American over-the-road (long-haul) service by 2007. Cabovers were difficult to service; for a long time the cab could not be lifted on its hinges to a full 90-degree forward tilt, severely limiting access to the front part of the engine. , a truck could cost , while the diesel fuel cost could be $70,000 per year. Trucks average from , with fuel economy standards requiring better than efficiency by 2014. Power requirements in standard conditions are 170 hp at or 280 hp at , and somewhat different power usage in other conditions. Rocky Mountain Double STAA double pup 28.5-foot trailers The cargo trailer usually has tandem axles at the rear, each of which has dual wheels, or eight tires on the trailer, four per axle. In the US it is common to refer to the number of wheel hubs, rather than the number of tires; an axle can have either single or dual tires with no legal difference. The combination of eight tires on the trailer and ten tires on the tractor is what led to the moniker eighteen wheeler, although this term is considered by some truckers to be a misnomer (the term \\"eighteen- wheeler\\" is a nickname for a five-axle over-the-road combination). Many trailers are equipped with movable tandem axles to allow adjusting the weight distribution. To connect the second of a set of doubles to the first trailer, and to support the front half of the second trailer, a converter gear known as a \\"dolly\\" is used. This has one or two axles, a fifth-wheel coupling for the rear trailer, and a tongue with a ring-hitch coupling for the forward trailer. Individual states may further allow longer vehicles, known as \\"longer combination vehicles\\" (or LCVs), and may allow them to operate on roads other than Interstates. Long combination vehicle types include: * Doubles (officially \\"STAA doubles\\", known colloquially as \\"a set of joints\\"): Two trailers. * B-Doubles: Twin trailers in B-double configuration (very common in Canada but rarely used in the United States). * Triples: Three trailers. * Turnpike Doubles: Two trailers. * Rocky Mountain Doubles: One trailer (though usually no more than ) and one trailer (known as a \\"pup\\"). * In Canada, a Turnpike Double is two trailers, and a Rocky Mountain Double is a trailer with a \\"pup\\". British Columbia, max. dimension of semi-trailer truckManitoba, max. dimension of semi-trailer truckOntario, max. dimension of semi-trailer truck Future long combination vehicles under consideration and study for the US MAP-21 transportation bill are container doubles. These combinations are under study for potential recommendation in November 2014: * trailer Turnpike Doubles, GVWR * and trailer Rocky Mountain Doubles, GVWR * Double trailers. The US federal government, which only regulates the Interstate Highway System, does not set maximum length requirements (except on auto and boat transporters), only minimums. Tractors can pull two or three trailers if the combination is legal in that state. Weight maximums are on a single axle, on a tandem, and total for any vehicle or combination. There is a maximum width of and no maximum height. Roads other than the Interstates are regulated by the individual states, and laws vary widely. Maximum weight varies between to , depending on the combination. Most states restrict operation of larger tandem trailer setups such as triple units, turnpike doubles and Rocky-Mountain doubles. Reasons for limiting the legal trailer configurations include both safety concerns and the impracticality of designing and constructing roads that can accommodate the larger wheelbase of these vehicles and the larger minimum turning radii associated with them. In general, these configurations are restricted to the Interstates. Except for these units, double setups are not restricted to certain roads any more than a single setup. They are also not restricted by weather conditions or \\"difficulty of operation\\". The Canadian province of Ontario, however, does have weather-related operating restrictions for larger tandem trailer setups. =Oceania= Australia Australian road transport has a reputation for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers, with four tyres on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. Super singles are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle. The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit. Long haul transport usually operates as B-doubles with two trailers (each with three axles), for a total of nine axles (including steering). In some lighter duty applications only one of the rear axles of the truck is driven, and the trailer may have only two axles. From July 2007, the Australian Federal and State Governments allowed the introduction of B-triple trucks on a specified network of roads. B-Triples are set up differently from conventional road trains. The front of their first trailer is supported by the turntable on the prime mover. The second and third trailers are supported by turntables on the trailers in front of them. As a result, B-Triples are much more stable than road trains and handle exceptionally well. True road trains only operate in remote areas, regulated by each state or territory government. In total, the maximum length that any articulated vehicle may be (without a special permit and escort) is , its maximum load may be up to 164 tonnes gross, and may have up to four trailers. However, heavy restrictions apply to the areas where such a vehicle may travel in most states. In remote areas such as the Northern Territory great care must be taken when sharing the road with longer articulated vehicles that often travel during the daytime, especially four-trailer road trains. Articulated trucks towing a single trailer or two trailers (commonly known as \\"short doubles\\") with a maximum overall length of are referred to as \\"General access heavy vehicles\\" and are permitted in all areas, including metropolitan. B-doubles are limited to a maximum total weight of 62.5 tonnes and overall length of , or if they are fitted with approved FUPS (Front Underrun Protection System) devices. B-doubles may only operate on designated roads, which includes most highways and some major metropolitan roads. B-doubles are very common in all parts of Australia including state capitals and on major routes they outnumber single trailer configurations. Maximum width of any vehicle is and a height of . In the past few years, allowance has been made by several states to allow certain designs of heavy vehicles up to high but they are also restricted to designated routes. In effect, a 4.6 meter high B-double will have to follow two sets of rules: they may access only those roads that are permitted for B-doubles and for 4.6 meter high vehicles. In Australia, both conventional prime movers and cabovers are common, however, cabovers are most often seen on B-doubles on the eastern seaboard where the reduction in total length allows the vehicle to pull longer trailers and thus more cargo than it would otherwise. File:B double logging truck in Australia.jpgAn Australian prime mover Kenworth and B double trailer combination File:Road Train2.jpgA road train in Australia File:Red B-double truck.jpgB-double truck on the Sturt Highway New Zealand New Zealand legislation governing truck dimensions falls under the Vehicle Dimensions and Mass Rules, published by NZ Transport Agency. New rules were introduced effective 1 February 2017, which increased the maximum height, width and weight of loads and vehicles, to simplify regulations, increase the amount of freight carried by road, and to improve the range of vehicles and trailers available to transport operators. Common combinations in New Zealand are a standard semi-trailer, a B-double, or a rigid towing vehicle pulling a trailer with a drawbar, with a maximum of nine axles. Standard maximum vehicle lengths for trailers with one axle set are: * Semi-trailer: * Simple: * Pole: Trailers with two axle sets can be long, including heavy rigid vehicles towing two trailers. Oversized loads require, at minimum, a permit, and may require one or more pilot vehicles.

The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a forward axle, provided by the towing engine, to carry half the load weight. When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a \\"trailer swing\\", although it is also commonly described as a \\"jackknife\\". Jackknifing is a condition where the tractive unit swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa. =Braking= A pair of semi-trailer \\"Suzies\\" at the back of an Australian prime mover, red line for emergency/supply and blue for control Semi trucks use air pressure, rather than hydraulic fluid, to actuate the brake. The use of air hoses allows for ease of coupling and uncoupling of trailers from the tractor unit. The most common failure is brake fade, usually caused when the drums or discs and the linings of the brakes overheat from excessive use. The parking brake of the tractor unit and the emergency brake of the trailer are spring brakes that require air pressure in order to be released. They are applied when air pressure is released from the system, and disengaged when air pressure is supplied. This is a fail-safe design feature which ensures that if air pressure to either unit is lost, the vehicle will stop to a grinding halt, instead of continuing without brakes and becoming uncontrollable. The trailer controls are coupled to the tractor through two gladhand connectors, which provide air pressure, and an electrical cable, which provides power to the lights and any specialized features of the trailer. Glad-hand connectors (also known as palm couplings) are air hose connectors, each of which has a flat engaging face and retaining tabs. The faces are placed together, and the units are rotated so that the tabs engage each other to hold the connectors together. This arrangement provides a secure connection but allows the couplers to break away without damaging the equipment if they are pulled, as may happen when the tractor and trailer are separated without first uncoupling the air lines. These connectors are similar in design to the ones used for a similar purpose between railroad cars. Two air lines typically connect to the trailer unit. An emergency or main air supply line pressurizes the trailer's air tank and disengages the emergency brake, and a second service line controls the brake application during normal operation. In the UK, male/female quick release connectors (red line or emergency), have a female on the truck and male on the trailer, but a yellow line or service has a male on the truck and female on the trailer. This avoids coupling errors (causing no brakes) plus the connections will not come apart if pulled by accident. The three electrical lines will fit one way around a primary black, a secondary green, and an ABS lead, all of which are collectively known as suzies or suzie coils. Another braking feature of semi-trucks is engine braking, which could be either a compression brake (usually shortened to Jake brake) or exhaust brake or combination of both. However, the use of compression brake alone produces a loud and distinctive noise, and to control noise pollution, some local municipalities have prohibited or restricted the use of engine brake systems inside their jurisdictions, particularly in residential areas. The advantage to using engine braking instead of conventional brakes is that a truck can descend a long grade without overheating its wheel brakes. Some vehicles can also be equipped with hydraulic or electric retarders which have an advantage of near silent operation. =Transmission= Traditional manual transmissions have 4-5 ratios on main shift and 3-4 on the auxiliary: pictured is a 5√ó3 with five main ratios and three auxiliaries Because of the wide variety of loads the semi may carry, they usually have a manual transmission to allow the driver to have as much control as possible. However, all truck manufacturers now offer semi-automatic transmissions (manual gearboxes with automated gear change), as well as automatic transmissions. Semi-truck transmissions can have as few as three forward speeds or as many as 18 forward speeds (plus 2 reverse speeds). A large number of transmission ratios means the driver can operate the engine more efficiently. Modern on-highway diesel engines are designed to provide maximum torque in a narrow RPM range (usually 1200-1500 RPM); having more gear ratios means the driver can hold the engine in its optimum range regardless of road speed (drive axle ratio must also be considered). A ten- speed manual transmission, for example is controlled via a six-slot H-box pattern, similar to that in five-speed cars ‚Äî five forward and one reverse gear. Gears six to ten (and high speed reverse) are accessed by a Lo/High range splitter; gears one to five are Lo range; gears six to ten are High range using the same shift pattern. A Super-10 transmission, by contrast, has no range splitter; it uses alternating \\"stick and button\\" shifting (stick shifts 1-3-5-7-9, button shifts 2-4-6-8-10). The 13-, 15-, and 18-speed transmissions have the same basic shift pattern, but include a splitter button to enable additional ratios found in each range. Some transmissions may have 12 speeds. Another difference between semi-trucks and cars is the way the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes. =Lights= An electrical connection is made between the tractor and the trailer through a cable often referred to as a pigtail. This cable is a bundle of wires in a single casing. Each wire controls one of the electrical circuits on the trailer, such as running lights, brake lights, turn signals, etc. A straight cable would break when the rig went around corners, so a coiled cable is used which retracts these coils when not under tension. It is these coils that cause the cable to look like a pigtail. In most countries, a trailer or semi-trailer must have minimum * 2 rear lights (red) * 2 stop lights (red) * 2 turning lights; one for right and one for left, flashing (amber; red optional in North America) * 2 marking lights behind if wider than certain specifications (red; plus a group of 3 red lights in the middle in North America) * 2 marking lights front if wider than the truck or wider than certain specifications (white; amber in North America) =Wheels and tires= Although dual wheels are the most common, use of two single, wider tires, known as super singles, on each axle is becoming popular among bulk cargo carriers and other weight-sensitive operators. With increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the use of the super-single tire is gaining popularity. There are several advantages to this configuration. The first of these is that super singles reduce fuel consumption. In 1999, tests on an oval track showed a 10% fuel savings when super singles were used. These savings are realized because less energy is wasted flexing fewer tire sidewalls. Second, the lighter overall tire weight allows a truck to be loaded with more freight. The third advantage is that the single wheel encloses less of the brake unit, which allows faster cooling and reduces brake fade. One of the major disadvantages of the super singles is that they are currently not as widely available as a standard tire. In addition, if a tire should become deflated or be destroyed, there is not another tire attached to the same hub to maintain the dynamic stability of the vehicle, as would be the case with dual wheels. With dual wheels, the remaining tire may be overloaded, but it will typically allow the vehicle to be safely stopped or driven to a repair facility. In Europe, super singles became popular when the allowed weight of semitrailer rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two axles with dual wheels, with three axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on super singles must be considered when comparing road wear from single versus dual wheels. The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of . The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of . (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) =Skirted trailers= An innovation rapidly growing in popularity is the skirted trailer. The space between the road and the bottom of the trailer frame was traditionally left open until it was realized that the turbulent air swirling under the trailer is a major source of aerodynamic drag. Three split skirt concepts were verified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide fuel savings greater than 5%, and four split skirt concepts had EPA-verified fuel savings between 4% and 5%. Skirted trailers are often combined with Underrun Protection Systems (underride guards), greatly improving safety for passenger vehicles sharing the road. =Underride guard= Crash test of an underride guard at ; the truck platform at head height has been prevented from slicing through the windshield Underride protection systems can be installed at the rear, front and sides of a truck and the rear and sides of a trailer. A Rear Underrun Protection System (RUPS) is a rigid assembly hanging down from trailer's chassis, which is intended to provide some protection for passenger cars which collide with the rear of the trailer. Public awareness of this safeguard was increased in the aftermath of the accident that killed actress Jayne Mansfield on 29 June 1967, when the car she was in hit the rear of a tractor-trailer, causing fatal head trauma. After her death, the NHTSA recommended requiring a rear underride guard, also known as a Mansfield bar, an ICC bar, or a DOT bumper. The bottom rear of the trailer is near head level for an adult seated in a car, and without the underride guard, the only protection for such an adult's head in a rear-end collision would be the car's windshield and A pillars. The front of the car goes under the platform of the trailer rather than making contact via the passenger car bumper, so the car's protective crush zone becomes irrelevant and air bags are ineffective in protecting the passengers. The underride guard provides a rigid area for the car to contact that is lower than the lip of the bonnet/hood, preventing the vehicle from squatting and running under the truck and ensuring that the vehicle's crush zones and engine block absorb the force of the collision. In addition to rear underride guards, truck tractor cabs may be equipped with a Front Underrun Protection System (FUPS) at the front bumper of the truck, if the front end is not low enough for the bumper to provide the adequate protection on its own. The safest tractor-trailers are also equipped with side underride guards, also called Side Underrun Protection System (SUPS). These additional barriers prevent passenger cars from skidding underneath the trailer from the side, such as in an oblique or side collision, or if the trailer jackknifes across the road, and helps protect cyclists, pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. In Europe, side and rear underrun protection are mandated on all lorries and trailers with a gross weight of or more. Several US states and cities have adopted or are in the process of adopting truck side guards, including New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington DC. The NTSB has recommended that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) develop standards for side underride protection systems for trucks, and for newly manufactured trucks to be equipped with technology meeting the standards. In addition to safety benefits, these underride guards may improve fuel mileage by reducing air turbulence under the trailer at highway speeds. Another benefit of having a sturdy rear underride guard is that it may be secured to a loading dock with a hook to prevent \\"trailer creep\\", a movement of the trailer away from the dock, which opens up a dangerous gap during loading or unloading operations.Underride Guard on Everything2; Retrieved: 29 November 2007.

These endorsements are gained through training and experience. The minimum age to hold an endorsed license is 18 years, and/or must have held open (full) driver's license for minimum 12 months. The following are the heavy vehicle license classes in Australia: * LR (Light Rigid) ‚Äì Class LR covers a rigid vehicle with a GVM (gross vehicle mass) of more than 4.5 tonnes but not more than 8 tonnes. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9 tonnes GVM. Also includes vehicles with a GVM up to 8 tonnes which carry more than 12 adults including the driver and vehicles in Class C. * MR (Medium Rigid) ‚Äì Class MR covers a rigid vehicle with two axles and a GVM of more than 8 tonnes. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9 tonnes GVM. Also includes vehicles in Class LR. * HR (Heavy Rigid) ‚Äì Class HR covers a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than 15 tonnes. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than 9 tonnes GVM. Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in Class MR. * HC (Heavy Combination) ‚Äì Class HC covers heavy combination vehicles like a prime mover towing a semi-trailer, or rigid vehicles towing a trailer with a GVM of more than 9 tonnes. Also includes vehicles in Class HR. * MC (Multi Combination) ‚Äì Class MC covers multi- combination vehicles like road trains and B-double vehicles. Also includes vehicles in Class HC. In order to obtain an HC License the driver must have held an MR or HR license for at least 12 months. To upgrade to an MC License the driver must have held a HR or HC license for at least 12 months. From licenses MR and upward there is also a B Condition which may apply to the license if testing in a synchromesh or automatic transmission vehicle. The B Condition may be removed upon the driver proving the ability to drive a constant mesh transmission using the clutch. Constant mesh transmission refers to crash box transmissions, predominantly Road Ranger eighteen-speed transmissions in Australia. =Canada= Regulations vary by province. A license to operate a vehicle with air brakes is required (i.e., normally a Class I, II, or III commercial license with an \\"A\\" or \\"S\\" endorsement in provinces other than Ontario). In Ontario, a \\"Z\\" endorsement\\"Z\\" endorsement is required to drive any vehicle using air brakes; in provinces other than Ontario, the \\"A\\" endorsement is for air brake operation only, and an \\"S\\" endorsement is for both operation and adjustment of air brakes. Anyone holding a valid Ontario driver's license (i.e., excluding a motorcycle license) with a \\"Z\\" endorsement can legally drive any air-brake-equipped truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicle) up to 11 tonnes, that includes one trailer weighing no more than 4.6 tonnes if the license falls under the following three classes: Class E (school bus‚Äîmaximum 24-passenger capacity or ambulance), F (regular bus‚Äîmaximum 24-passenger capacity or ambulance) or G (car, van, or small-truck). A Class B (any school bus), C (any urban-transit-vehicle or highway-coach), or D (heavy trucks other than tractor-trailers) license enables its holder to drive any truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicle) greater than 11 tonnes, that includes one trailer weighing no more than 4.6 tonnes.Ontario drivers classes Anyone holding an Ontario Class A license (or its equivalent) can drive any truck-trailer combination with a registered- or actual-gross-vehicle-weight (i.e., including towing- and towed-vehicles) greater than 11 tonnes, that includes one or more trailers weighing more than 4.6 tonnes. =Europe= A category CE driving licence is required to drive a tractor-trailer in Europe. Category C (Œì in Greece) is required for vehicles over , while category E is for heavy trailers, which in the case of trucks and buses means any trailer over . Vehicles over ‚Äîwhich is the maximum limit of B license‚Äîbut under can be driven with a C1 license. Buses require a D (Œî in Greece) license. A bus that is registered for no more than 16 passengers, excluding the driver, can be driven with a D1 license. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, drivers of heavy vehicles require specific licenses, termed as classes. A Class 1 license (car license) will allow the driving of any vehicle with Gross Laden Weight (GLW) or Gross Combination Weight (GCW) of or less. For other types of vehicles the classes are separately licensed as follows: * Class 2 ‚Äì Medium Rigid Vehicle: Any rigid vehicle with GLW or less with light trailer of or less, any combination vehicle with GCW or less, any rigid vehicle of any weight with no more than two axles, or any Class 1 vehicle. * Class 3 ‚Äì Medium Combination Vehicle: Any combination vehicle of GCW or less, or any Class 2 vehicle. * Class 4 ‚Äì Heavy Rigid Vehicle: Any rigid vehicle of any weight, any combination vehicle which consists of a heavy vehicle and a light trailer, or any vehicle of Class 1 or 2 (but not 3). * Class 5 ‚Äì Heavy Combination Vehicle: Any combination vehicle of any weight, and any vehicle covered by previous classes. * Class 6 ‚Äì Motorcycle. Further information on the New Zealand licensing system for heavy vehicles can be found at the New Zealand Transport Agency. =Taiwan= Taiwanese sign prohibiting heavy trailers The Road Traffic Security Rules (ÈÅìË∑Ø‰∫§ÈÄöÂÆâÂÖ®Ë¶èÂâá) require a combination vehicle driver license () to drive a combination vehicle (). These rules define a combination vehicle as a motor vehicle towing a heavy trailer, i.e., a trailer with a gross weight of more than . =United States= Drivers of semi-trailer trucks generally require a Class A commercial driver's license (CDL) to operate any combination vehicles with a gross combination weight rating (or GCWR) in excess of if the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of the towed vehicle(s) is in excess of . Some states (such as North Dakota) provide exemptions for farmers, allowing non-commercial license holders to operate semis within a certain air-mile radius of their reporting location. State exemptions, however, are only applicable in intrastate commerce; stipulations of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be applied in interstate commerce. Also a person under the age of 21 cannot operate a commercial vehicle outside the state where the commercial license was issued. This restriction may also be mirrored by certain states in their intrastate regulations. A person must be at least 18 in order to be issued a commercial license. In addition, endorsements are necessary for certain cargo and vehicle arrangements and types; * H ‚Äì Hazardous Materials (HazMat or HM) ‚Äì necessary if materials require HM placards. * N ‚Äì Tankers ‚Äì the driver is acquainted with the unique handling characteristics of liquids tankers. * X ‚Äì Signifies Hazardous Materials and Tanker endorsements, combined. * T ‚Äì Doubles & Triples ‚Äì the licensee may pull more than one trailer. * P ‚Äì Buses ‚Äì Any Vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers (including the driver). * S ‚Äì School Buses ‚Äì Any school bus designed to transport 11 or more passengers (including the driver). * W ‚Äì Tow Truck Role in trade Modern day semi- trailer trucks often operate as a part of a domestic or international transport infrastructure to support containerized cargo shipment. Various types of rail flat bed train cars are modified to hold the cargo trailer or container with wheels or without. This is called Intermodal or piggyback. The system allows the cargo to switch from highway to railway or vice versa with relative ease by using gantry cranes. The large trailers pulled by a tractor unit come in many styles, lengths, and shapes. Some common types are: vans, reefers, flatbeds, sidelifts and tankers. These trailers may be refrigerated, heated, ventilated, or pressurized, depending on climate and cargo. Some trailers have movable wheel axles that can be adjusted by moving them on a track underneath the trailer body and securing them in place with large pins.

Patrons of the Stonewall, other Village lesbian and gay bars and neighborhood street people fought back when the police became violent. The riots are widely considered to constitute one of the most important events leading to the gay liberation movement; ; and the twentieth century fight for LGBT rights in the United States.; Gay Americans in the 1950s and 1960s faced an anti-gay legal system. Early homosexual groups in the U.S. sought to prove that gay people could be assimilated into society, and they favored non-confrontational education for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. The last years of the 1960s, however, were contentious, as many social/political movements were active, including the civil rights movement, the counterculture of the 1960s and the anti- Vietnam War movement. These influences, along with the liberal environment of Greenwich Village, served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots. Very few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. At the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the Mafia. It catered to an assortment of patrons and was known to be popular among the poorest and most marginalized people in the gay community: butch lesbians, effeminate young men, drag queens, male prostitutes, transgender people, and homeless youth. While police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn on June 28. Tensions between New York City police and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their sexual orientation without fear of being arrested. After the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. A year after the uprising, to mark the anniversary on June 28, 1970, the first gay pride marches took place in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The anniversary of the riots was also commemorated in Chicago and similar marches were organized in other cities. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. The Stonewall National Monument was established at the site in 2016. Today, LGBT Pride events are held annually throughout the world toward the end of June to mark the Stonewall riots. Stonewall 50 ‚Äì WorldPride NYC 2019 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising with city officials estimating 5 million attendees in Manhattan,About 5 million people attended WorldPride in NYC, mayor says By karma allen, Jul 2, 2019. Accessed July 4, 2019. and on June 6, 2019, New York City Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill rendered a formal apology on behalf of the New York Police Department for the actions of its officers at Stonewall in 1969. Background =Homosexuality in 20th-century United States= Following the social upheaval of World War II, many people in the United States felt a fervent desire to \\"restore the prewar social order and hold off the forces of change\\", according to historian Barry Adam. Spurred by the national emphasis on anti-communism, Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted hearings searching for communists in the U.S. government, the U.S. Army, and other government-funded agencies and institutions, leading to a national paranoia. Anarchists, communists, and other people deemed un-American and subversive were considered security risks. Gay men and lesbians were included in this list by the U.S. State Department on the theory that they were susceptible to blackmail. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by Clyde R. Hoey noted in a report, \\"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\\", and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \\"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\\".David K. Johnson (2004). The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government. University of Chicago Press, pp. 101‚Äì102, 114‚Äì115 Between 1947 and 1950, 1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and police departments kept lists of known homosexuals, their favored establishments, and friends; the U.S. Post Office kept track of addresses where material pertaining to homosexuality was mailed. State and local governments followed suit: bars catering to gay men and lesbians were shut down, and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities performed \\"sweeps\\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual. In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed homosexuality in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent‚Äìchild relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1974. =Homophile activism= In response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide social opportunities where they could socialize without fear of being arrested. Los Angeles area homosexuals created the Mattachine Society in 1950, in the home of communist activist Harry Hay. Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \\"sexual deviants\\" with legal troubles. Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals. Soon after, several women in San Francisco met in their living rooms to form the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) for lesbians. Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society. One of the first challenges to government repression came in 1953. An organization named ONE, Inc. published a magazine called ONE. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service. Homophile organizations‚Äîas homosexual groups self-identified in this era‚Äîgrew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, news on Cuban prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the United Nations and the White House. Similar demonstrations were then held also at other government buildings. The purpose was to protest the treatment of gay people in Cuba and U.S. employment discrimination. These pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB.DiGuglielmo, Joey (October 20, 2011). \\"Steps to Stonewall\\". Washington Blade. Retrieved on November 5, 2012. At the same time, demonstrations in the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces. =Earlier resistance and riots= On the outer fringes of the few small gay communities were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people who dressed and lived in contrast to their gender assigned at birth, either part or full-time. Contemporaneous nomenclature classified them as transvestites, and they were the most visible representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people.Stryker, Susan (Winter, 2008). \\"Transgender History, Homonormativity, and Disciplinarity\\". Radical History Review, pp. 145‚Äì157. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people staged a small riot at the Cooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment. In a larger 1966 event in San Francisco, drag queens, hustlers, and trans womenDevor, Aaron, and Ardel Haefele-Thomas (2019). Transgender: A Reference Handbook, p. 30 were sitting in Compton's Cafeteria when the police arrived to arrest people appearing to be physically male who were dressed as women. A riot ensued, with the cafeteria patrons slinging cups, plates, and saucers, and breaking the plexiglass windows in the front of the restaurant, and returning several days later to smash the windows again after they were replaced.Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). \\"San Francisco\\" in the Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America, Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71‚Äì78. Professor Susan Stryker classifies the Compton's Cafeteria riot as an \\"act of anti- transgender discrimination, rather than an act of discrimination against sexual orientation\\" and connects the uprising to the issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile organizations. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco. =Greenwich Village= Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village The Manhattan neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and Harlem were home to sizable gay and lesbian populations after World War I, when people who had served in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger cities. The enclaves of gay men and lesbians, described by a newspaper story as \\"short-haired women and long- haired men\\", developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades. Prohibition inadvertently benefited gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with other behaviors considered immoral. New York City passed laws against homosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in high demand, speakeasies and impromptu drinking establishments were so numerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all. However, police raids continued, resulting in the closure of iconic establishments such as Eve's Hangout in 1926. The social repression of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs‚Äîboth Greenwich Village residents‚Äîalso wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community. By the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together‚Äîor the officer bought the man a drink‚Äîhe was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer. The Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly elected mayor John Lindsay to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the New York State Liquor Authority (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become \\"disorderly\\". Despite the high population of gay men and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \\"sip-in\\" at a Greenwich Village bar named Julius, which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008). \\"Before Stonewall: Remembering that, before the riots, there was a Sip-In\\" . The Village Voice. Retrieved on September 8, 2008. None of the bars frequented by gay men and lesbians were owned by gay people. Almost all of them were owned and controlled by organized crime, who treated the regulars poorly, watered down the liquor, and overcharged for drinks. However, they also paid off police to prevent frequent raids. =Stonewall Inn= The Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, along with several other establishments in the city, was owned by the Genovese crime family. In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals. Once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff known as a gayola, as the Stonewall Inn had no liquor license. It had no running water behind the bar‚Äîdirty glasses were run through tubs of water and immediately reused. There were no fire exits, and the toilets overran consistently. Though the bar was not used for prostitution, drug sales and other \\"cash transactions\\" took place. It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed; dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club. Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 were greeted by a bouncer who inspected them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called \\"Lily Law\\", \\"Alice Blue Gown\\", or \\"Betty Badge\\"), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private \\"bottle club\\", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or black lights. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching. In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by \\"queens\\"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go. Only a few transvestites, or men in full drag, were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were \\"98 percent male\\" but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby Christopher Park, would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks. The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, black, and Hispanic patrons. Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as \\"the gay bar in the city\\". Police raids on gay bars were frequent‚Äîoccurring on average once a month for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to facilitate resuming business as quickly as possible if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars‚Äîincluding a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots‚Äîand the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village. Riots =Police raid= Layout of the Stonewall Inn, 1969 At 1:20 a.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, and Detective Charles Smythe and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced \\"Police! We're taking the place!\\" Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p. 194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate. Historian David Carter presents information indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the Financial District. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay Wall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205 people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered, > \\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden > there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our > identification ready to be led out of the bar.\\" The raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any people appearing to be physically male and dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those suspected of cross- dressing in a room in the back of the bar. Maria Ritter, then known as male to her family, recalled, \\"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\\" Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \\"feeling some of them up inappropriately\\" while frisking them. The police were to transport the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15 minutes. Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150 people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \\"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\\" When the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd‚Äîmost of whom were homosexual‚Äîhad grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet. Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \\"Gay power!\\", someone began singing \\"We Shall Overcome\\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \\"growing and intensive hostility\\". An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author Edmund White, who had been passing by, recalled, \\"Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing.\\" Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten. A scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \\"a typical New York butch\\" and \\"a dyke‚Äìstone butch\\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a baton for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight. Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown (Storm√© DeLarverie has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \\"Why don't you guys do something?\\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon, the crowd became a mob and went \\"berserk\\": \\"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\\" =Violence breaks out= The police tried to restrain some of the crowd, knocking a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon‚Äîwith a few slashed tires‚Äîleft immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because \\"they didn't pay off the cops\\", to which someone else yelled \\"Let's pay them off!\\" Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted \\"Pigs!\\" and \\"Faggot cops!\\" Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600 people, grabbed several people, including folk singer and mentor of Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk‚Äîwho had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \\"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another.\\" Van Ronk was one of thirteen arrested that night. page scans Ten police officers‚Äîincluding two policewomen‚Äîbarricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a column writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety. Multiple accounts of the riot assert that there was no pre-existing organization or apparent cause for the demonstration; what ensued was spontaneous. Michael Fader explained, > We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. > It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of > like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular > night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized > demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go > back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had > always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, > but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and > everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing > most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break > free.

This photograph appeared in the front page of The New York Daily News on Sunday, June 29, 1969, showing the \\"street kids\\" who were the first to fight with the police. The only known photograph taken during the first night of the riots shows the homeless youth who slept in nearby Christopher Park, scuffling with police. The Mattachine Society newsletter a month later offered its explanation of why the riots occurred: \\"It catered largely to a group of people who are not welcome in, or cannot afford, other places of homosexual social gathering... The Stonewall became home to these kids. When it was raided, they fought for it. That, and the fact that they had nothing to lose other than the most tolerant and broadminded gay place in town, explains why.\\" Garbage cans, garbage, bottles, rocks, and bricks were hurled at the building, breaking the windows. Witnesses attest that \\"flame queens\\", hustlers, and gay \\"street kids\\"‚Äîthe most outcast people in the gay community‚Äîwere responsible for the first volley of projectiles, as well as the uprooting of a parking meter used as a battering ram on the doors of the Stonewall Inn.

The mob lit garbage on fire and stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was ineffective in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. =Escalation= The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived to free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: \\"I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill.\\" With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, \\"Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon.\\" His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, \\"All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously.\\" The TPF formed a phalanx and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang to the tune of Ta- ra-ra Boom-de-ay: \\"We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair.\\"Sara Warner (2012). Acts of Gaiety: LGBT Performance and the Politics of Pleasure. p. 17 Some references have the last line as \\"...pubic hairs\\" instead. Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: \\"A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery in the form of a chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay power[-]ites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue.\\" One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, \\"The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick.\\" Another account stated, \\"I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [nightsticks] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line.\\" Christopher Park, where many of the demonstrators met after the first night of rioting to talk about what had happened, now features a sculpture of four white figures by George Segal that commemorates the milestone. Craig Rodwell, owner of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop, reported watching police chase participants through the crooked streets, only to see them appear around the next corner behind the police. Members of the mob stopped cars, overturning one of them to block Christopher Street. Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke, in their column printed in Screw, declared that \\"massive crowds of angry protesters chased [the police] for blocks screaming, 'Catch them!' \\" By 4:00 a.m., the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be \\"electricity in the air\\". One commented: \\"There was a certain beauty in the aftermath of the riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street.\\" Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police. =A second night of rioting= During the siege of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called The New York Times, the New York Post, and the Daily News to inform them what was happening. All three papers covered the riots; the Daily News placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, or triggered by \\"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\\". All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. Graffiti appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \\"Drag power\\", \\"They invaded our rights\\", \\"Support gay power\\", and \\"Legalize gay bars\\", along with accusations of police looting, and‚Äîregarding the status of the bar‚Äî\\"We are open.\\" The next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent. Many of the same people returned from the previous evening‚Äîhustlers, street youths, and \\"queens\\"‚Äîbut they were joined by \\"police provocateurs\\", curious bystanders, and even tourists. Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: \\"From going to places where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. We were in the streets.\\" Thousands of people had gathered in front of the Stonewall, which had opened again, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining blocks. The throng surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless they either admitted they were gay or indicated their support for the demonstrators. Sylvia Rivera saw a friend of hers jump on a nearby car trying to drive through; the crowd rocked the car back and forth, terrifying its occupants. Another of Rivera's friends, Marsha P. Johnson, an African-American street queen, climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the windshield. As on the previous evening, fires were started in garbage cans throughout the neighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Precincts, but after 2:00 a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as \\"sissies\\" or \\"swishes\\", the crowd surged to recapture them. Street battling ensued again until 4:00 a.m. Beat poet and longtime Greenwich Village resident Allen Ginsberg lived on Christopher Street, and happened upon the jubilant chaos. After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, \\"Gay power! Isn't that great!... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves\\", and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, \\"You know, the guys there were so beautiful‚Äîthey've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago.\\" =Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence= Activity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \\"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \\"intolerable situation\\". Not everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \\"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\\" Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \\"sleaze joint\\", as advantageous to the Village. On Wednesday, however, The Village Voice ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \\"forces of faggotry\\", \\"limp wrists\\", and \\"Sunday fag follies\\". A mob descended upon Christopher Street once again and threatened to burn down the offices of The Village Voice. Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, local shops getting looted (apparently by nongay protesters), and arrests of five people. The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \\"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\\" Aftermath The feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines. This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \\"None of that! None of that!\\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches. Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, \\"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\\" Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day. Gay rights demonstration in Trafalgar Square, London, including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the London School of Economics on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972. =Gay Liberation Front= Although the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \\"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\\" When a Mattachine officer suggested an \\"amicable and sweet\\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \\"Sweet! Bullshit! That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\\" With a flyer announcing: \\"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\\", the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \\"gay\\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis, and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names. The rise of militancy became apparent to Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings‚Äîwho had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles‚Äîwhen they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \\"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\\" The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and antiwar demonstrators with the ideal that they \\"could work to restructure American society\\". They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the Women's House of Detention in support of Afeni Shakur, and other radical New Left causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure. =Gay Activists Alliance= Within six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called Gay; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city‚ÄîThe Village Voice‚Äîrefused to print the word \\"gay\\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers. Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: Come Out! and Gay Power; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000. GLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of capitalism. In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \\"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\\" The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a zap, where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor John Lindsay was zapped several times‚Äîonce on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience. Raids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167 people were arrested. One of them was Diego Vi√±ales, an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be deported as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a spike fence. The New York Daily News printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF. They also sponsored a letter- writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village Democratic Party and Congressman Ed Koch sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city. The Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business. =Gay Pride= Christopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in Los Angeles and Chicago, these were the first Gay Pride marches in U.S. history.De la Croix, Sukie (2007). \\"Gay power: A History of Chicago Pride\\" Chicago Free Press. Retrieved on June 1, 2009. The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in Boston, Dallas, Milwaukee, London, Paris, West Berlin, and Stockholm. The march in New York covered 51 blocks, from Christopher Street to Central Park. The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers. The New York Times reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks.Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970). \\"Thousands of Homosexuals Hold A Protest Rally in Central Park\\". The New York Times, p. 1. Reporting by The Village Voice was positive, describing \\"the out-front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago\\". By 1972, the participating cities included Atlanta, Buffalo, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Miami, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia, as well as San Francisco. Frank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \\"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\\" Similar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \\"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\\". The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \\"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\\". Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \\"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\\" David Carter, in his article \\"What made Stonewall different\\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups. Legacy =Unlikely community= Within two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their same-sex attraction. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place. Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after Barbara Gittings exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist Jean O'Leary protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by cross-dressers and drag queens in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster jumped on the stage and shouted \\"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!\\" Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust. O'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to upstate New York, September 21, 1995. Accessed July 24, 2015. but later returned to the city in the mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. September 21, 1995. Accessed July 24, 2015. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \\"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\\" \\"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\\" O'Leary was referring to the Lavender Menace, a description by second wave feminist Betty Friedan for attempts by members of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971. The growth of lesbian feminism in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men‚Äîentrapment and public solicitation‚Äîwere not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what Adrienne Rich termed \\"the violent, self- destructive world of the gay bars\\". Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \\"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\\" Throughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \\"zap\\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). At a conference on behavior modification, during a film demonstrating the use of electroshock therapy to decrease same-sex attraction, Morris Kight and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \\"Torture!\\" and \\"Barbarism!\\" They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20 psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill. When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought John E. Fryer, a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973‚Äîin large part due to the efforts of gay activists‚Äîthe APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Gay men and lesbians came together to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation. The subsequent 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots. =Rejection of prior gay subculture= The Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior gay and lesbian culture, such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian Martin Duberman writes, \\"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\\" Sociologist Barry Adam notes, \\"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\\" In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of butch and femme that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \\"all role playing is sick.\\" Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior. Some women, according to Lillian Faderman, were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall. Author Michael Bronski highlights the \\"attack on pre- Stonewall culture\\", particularly gay pulp fiction for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \\"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\\", have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \\"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\\" =Lasting impact and recognition= The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the Stonewall Inn was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a National Historic Landmark. The riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \\"exploitation and degradation\\". The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \\"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\\". Historian Nicholas Edsall writes, > Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and > defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and > certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to > move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which > sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall > radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on > college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as > well. Before the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, > a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or > despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was > a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the > United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native > Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other > cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had > no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could > identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the > first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From > that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude > toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change > rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect. Historian Lillian Faderman calls the riots the \\"shot heard round the world\\", explaining, \\"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\\" The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance Joan Nestle co-founded the Lesbian Herstory Archives in 1974, and credits \\"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\\" Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes, > I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and > I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a > historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human > beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... > Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made > it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's > more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall. The events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the Lower Manhattan raid was a factor: it was across the street from The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.Armstrong, Elizabeth A., Crage, Suzanna M. (October 2006). \\"Movements and Memory: The Making of the Stonewall Myth\\", American Sociological Review, 71 (5) pp. 724‚Äì752. . Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community in the weeks and months after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world. Stonewall (officially Stonewall Equality Limited) is an LGBT rights charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1989, and named after the Stonewall Inn because of the Stonewall riots. The Stonewall Awards is an annual event the charity has held since 2006 to recognize people who have affected the lives of British lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. The middle of the 1990s was marked by the inclusion of bisexuals as a represented group within the gay community, when they successfully sought to be included on the platform of the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. Transgender people also asked to be included, but were not, though trans-inclusive language was added to the march's list of demands.Schalger, Neil, (ed.) (1997). Gay and Lesbian Almanac. St. James Press. pp. 22‚Äì23 The transgender community continued to find itself simultaneously welcome and at odds with the gay community as attitudes about non-binary gender discrimination and pansexual orientation developed and came increasingly into conflict.Thompson, Kara (2004). \\"Transsexuals, Transvestites, Transgender People, and Cross- Dressers\\" in Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America, Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. pp. 203‚Äì208. In 1994, New York City celebrated \\"Stonewall 25\\" with a march that went past the United Nations Headquarters and into Central Park. Estimates put the attendance at 1.1 million people. Sylvia Rivera led an alternate march in New York City in 1994 to protest the exclusion of transgender people from the events. Attendance at LGBT Pride events has grown substantially over the decades. Most large cities around the world now have some kind of Pride demonstration. Pride events in some cities mark the largest annual celebration of any kind.\\"Pride Marches and Parades\\", in Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History in America, Marc Stein, ed. (2004), Charles Scribner's Sons. The growing trend towards commercializing marches into parades‚Äîwith events receiving corporate sponsorship‚Äîhas caused concern about taking away the autonomy of the original grassroots demonstrations that put inexpensive activism in the hands of individuals. A \\"Stonewall Shabbat Seder\\" was first held at B'nai Jeshurun, a synagogue on New York's Upper West Side, in 1995. President Barack Obama declared June 2009 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, citing the riots as a reason to \\"commit to achieving equal justice under law for LGBT Americans\\".\\"Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2009\\" . The White House (June 1, 2009). Retrieved on June 2, 2009. The year marked the 40th anniversary of the riots, giving journalists and activists cause to reflect on progress made since 1969. Frank Rich noted in The New York Times that no federal legislation exists to protect the rights of gay Americans. An editorial in the Washington Blade compared the scruffy, violent activism during and following the Stonewall riots to the lackluster response to failed promises given by President Obama; for being ignored, wealthy LGBT activists reacted by promising to give less money to Democratic causes.Naff, Kevin (June 26, 2009). \\"Alas, Poor Activism, We Knew Her Well\\". Washington Blade. Retrieved on March 2, 2014. Two years later, the Stonewall Inn served as a rallying point for celebrations after the New York State Senate voted to pass same-sex marriage. The act was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo on June 24, 2011.Zraick, Karen (June 25, 2011). \\"NY legalizes gay marriage 42 years after Stonewall\\" . Yahoo!. Retrieved June 25, 2011. Individual states continue to battle with homophobia. The Missouri Senate passed a measure its supporters characterize as a religious freedom bill that could change the state's constitution despite Democrats' objections, and their 39-hour filibuster. This bill allows the \\"protection of certain religious organizations and individuals from being penalized by the state because of their sincere religious beliefs or practices concerning marriage between two persons of the same sex\\" discriminating against homosexual patronage. Obama also referenced the Stonewall riots in a call for full equality during his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013: > We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths‚Äîthat all of us > are created equal‚Äîis the star that guides us still; just as it guided our > forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall.... Our journey is > not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else > under the law‚Äîfor if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we > commit to one another must be equal as well. A banner hanging from the top of the building the day after President Obama announced creation of the Stonewall National Monument This was a historic moment, being the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word \\"gay\\" in an inaugural address. In 2014, a marker dedicated to the Stonewall riots was included in the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago celebrating LGBT history and people. Throughought June 2019, Stonewall 50 ‚Äì WorldPride NYC 2019, produced by Heritage of Pride in partnership with the I Love New York program's LGBT division, was held in New York to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. The final official estimate included 5 million visitors attending in Manhattan alone, making it the largest LGBTQ celebration in history. June is traditionally Pride month in New York City and worldwide, and the events were held under the auspices of the annual NYC Pride March. An apology from New York City Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill, on June 6, 2019, coincided with WorldPride being celebrated in New York City. O'Neill apologized on behalf of the NYPD for the actions of its officers at the Stonewall uprising in 1969. The official 50th commemoration of the Stonewall Uprising happened on 28 June on Christopher Street in front of Stonewall Inn. The official commemoration was themed as a rally‚Äîin reference to the original rallies in front of Stonewall Inn in 1969. Talent for this event included Mayor Bill De Blasio, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Congressman Jerry Nadler, American activist Emma Gonzalez and global activist R√©my Bonny. In 2019, Paris, France officially named a square in the Marais as Place des √âmeutes-de-Stonewall. Stonewall Day Stonewall Day logo by Pride Live In 2018, 49 years after the uprising, Stonewall Day was announced as a commemoration day by Pride Live, a social advocacy and community engagement organization. The second Stonewall Day was held on Friday, June 28, 2019, outside the Stonewall Inn. During this event, Pride Live introduced their Stonewall Ambassadors program, to raise awareness for the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. Those appearing at the event included: Geena Rocero, First Lady of New York City Chirlane McCray, Josephine Skriver, Wilson Cruz, Ryan Jamaal Swain, Angelica Ross, Donatella Versace, Conchita Wurst, Bob the Drag Queen, Whoopi Goldberg, and Lady Gaga, with performances by Alex Newell and Alicia Keys. =Historic landmark and monument= Plaque commemorating the Stonewall Riots In June 1999, the U.S. Department of the Interior designated 51 and 53 Christopher Street and the surrounding area in Greenwich Village to be on the National Register of Historic Places, the first of significance to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In a dedication ceremony, Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior John Berry stated, \\"Let it forever be remembered that here‚Äîon this spot‚Äîmen and women stood proud, they stood fast, so that we may be who we are, we may work where we will, live where we choose and love whom our hearts desire.\\"Dunlap, David (June 26, 1999). \\"Stonewall, Gay Bar That Made History, Is Made a Landmark\\". The New York Times. Retrieved September 27, 2008. The Stonewall Inn was itself named a National Historic Landmark in February 2000. In May 2015, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission announced it would officially consider designating the Stonewall Inn as a landmark, making it the first city location to be considered based on its LGBT cultural significance alone. On June 23, 2015, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously approved the designation of the Stonewall Inn as a city landmark, making it the first landmark honored for its role in the fight for gay rights. On June 24, 2016, President Obama announced the establishment\\"President Obama Designates Stonewall National Monument\\" (official announcement from White House Press Office; June 24, 2016) of the Stonewall National Monument site to be administered by the National Park Service. The designation, which followed transfer of city parkland to the federal government, protects Christopher Park and adjacent areas totaling more than seven acres; the Stonewall Inn is within the boundaries of the monument but remains privately owned. The National Park Foundation formed a new nonprofit organization to raise funds for a ranger station and interpretive exhibits for the monument.

Enlarge to view labels. A stalactite (, ; from the Greek stalasso, (œÉœÑŒ±ŒªŒ¨œÉœÉœâ), \\"to drip\\", and meaning \\"that which drips\\") is a type of formation that hangs from the ceiling of caves, hot springs, or manmade structures such as bridges and mines. Any material that is soluble, can be deposited as a colloid, or is in suspension, or is capable of being melted, may form a stalactite. Stalactites may be composed of lava, minerals, mud, peat, pitch, sand, sinter, and amberat (crystallized urine of pack rats). A stalactite is not necessarily a speleothem, though speleothems are the most common form of stalactite because of the abundance of limestone caves. The corresponding formation on the floor of the cave is known as a stalagmite. Mnemonics have been developed for which word refers to which type of formation; one is that stalactite has a C for \\"ceiling\\", and stalagmite has a G for \\"ground\\".http://nature.nps.gov/geology/education/StudentPages_speleothems_New.pdf Formation and type Demonstration of drip stone formation in a lab. The blue color is due to the addition of cupric ions (Cu2+) to the mother solution. =Limestone stalactites= The most common stalactites are speleothems, which occur in limestone caves. They form through deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions. Limestone is the chief form of calcium carbonate rock which is dissolved by water that contains carbon dioxide, forming a calcium bicarbonate solution in caverns.C. Michael Hogan. 2010. Calcium. eds. A.Jorgensen, C. Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. The chemical formula for this reaction is: :: + + ‚Üí This solution travels through the rock until it reaches an edge and if this is on the roof of a cave it will drip down. When the solution comes into contact with air the chemical reaction that created it is reversed and particles of calcium carbonate are deposited. The reversed reaction is: :: ‚Üí + + An average growth rate is a year. The quickest growing stalactites are those formed by a constant supply of slow dripping water rich in calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which can grow at per year.Hill, C A, and Forti, P, (1986, 1997). Cave Minerals of the World, 1st & 2nd editions. [Huntsville, Alabama: National Speleological Society Inc.] The drip rate must be slow enough to allow the CO2 to degas from the solution into the cave atmosphere, resulting in deposition of CaCO3 on the stalactite. Too fast a drip rate and the solution, still carrying most of the CaCO3, falls to the cave floor where degassing occurs and CaCO3 is deposited as a stalagmite. All limestone stalactites begin with a single mineral-laden drop of water. When the drop falls, it deposits the thinnest ring of calcite. Each subsequent drop that forms and falls deposits another calcite ring. Eventually, these rings form a very narrow (‚âà4 to 5 mm diameter), hollow tube commonly known as a \\"soda straw\\" stalactite. Soda straws can grow quite long, but are very fragile. If they become plugged by debris, water begins flowing over the outside, depositing more calcite and creating the more familiar cone-shaped stalactite. The same water drops that fall from the tip of a stalactite deposit more calcite on the floor below, eventually resulting in a rounded or cone-shaped stalagmite. Unlike stalactites, stalagmites never start out as hollow \\"soda straws\\". Given enough time, these formations can meet and fuse to create pillars of calcium carbonate known as a \\"column\\". Stalactite formation generally begins over a large area, with multiple paths for the mineral rich water to flow. As minerals are dissolved in one channel slightly more than other competing channels, the dominant channel begins to draw more and more of the available water, which speeds its growth, ultimately resulting in all other channels being choked off. This is one reason why formations tend to have minimum distances from one another. The larger the formation, the greater the interformation distance. =Lava stalactites= Another type of stalactite is formed in lava tubes while lava is still active inside. The mechanism of formation is the deposition of material on the ceilings of caves, however with lava stalactites formation happens very quickly in only a matter of hours, days, or weeks, whereas limestone stalactites may take up to thousands of years. A key difference with lava stalactites is that once the lava has ceased flowing, so too will the stalactites cease to grow. This means that if the stalactite were to be broken it would never grow back. The generic term lavacicle has been applied to lava stalactites and stalagmites indiscriminately and evolved from the word icicle. Like limestone stalactites, they can leave lava drips on the floor that turn into lava stalagmites and may eventually fuse with the corresponding stalactite to form a column. Shark tooth stalactites The shark tooth stalactite is broad and tapering in appearance. It may begin as a small driblet of lava from a semi-solid ceiling, but then grows by accreting layers as successive flows of lava rise and fall in the lava tube, coating and recoating the stalactite with more material. They can vary from a few millimeters to over a meter in length. Shark tooth stalactites. Splash stalactites As lava flows through a tube, material will be splashed up on the ceiling and ooze back down, hardening into a stalactite. This type of formation results in an irregularly-shaped stalactite, looking somewhat like stretched taffy. Often they may be of a different color than the original lava that formed the cave. Tubular lava stalactites When the roof of a lava tube is cooling, a skin will form that traps semi-molten material inside. Trapped gases force lava to extrude out through small openings that result in hollow, tubular stalactites analogous to the soda straws formed as depositional speleothems in solution caves, The longest known is almost 2 meters in length. These are common in Hawaiian lava tubes and are often associated with a drip stalagmite that forms below as material is carried through the tubular stalactite and piles up on the floor beneath. Sometimes the tubular form collapses near the distal end, most likely when the pressure of escaping gases decreased and still-molten portions of the stalactites deflated and cooled. Often these tubular stalactites will acquire a twisted, vermiform appearance as bits of lava crystallize and force the flow in different directions. These tubular lava helictites may also be influenced by air currents through a tube and point downwind. =Ice stalactites= Ice stalactites on gutter of house A common stalactite found seasonally or year round in many caves is the ice stalactite, commonly referred to as icicles, especially on the surface. Water seepage from the surface will penetrate into a cave and if temperatures are below freezing the water will form stalactites. Creation may also be done by the freezing of water vapor. Similar to lava stalactites, ice stalactites form very quickly within hours or days. Unlike lava stalactites however, they may grow back as long as water and temperatures are suitable. Ice stalactites can also form under sea ice when saline water is introduced to ocean water. These specific stalactites are referred to as brinicles. Ice stalactites may also form corresponding stalagmites below them and given time may grow together to form an ice column. =Concrete stalactites= Concrete stalactites. Calthemite soda straw stalactites under a concrete slab. Stalactites can also form on concrete, and on plumbing where there is a slow leak and calcium, magnesium or other ions in the water supply, although they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment. These secondary deposits, such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone and others, which are derived from the lime, mortar or other calcareous material in concrete, outside of the \\"cave\\" environment, can not be classified as \\"speleothems\\" due to the definition of the term. The term \\"calthemite\\" is used to encompass the secondary deposits which mimic the shapes and forms of speleothems outside the cave environment.Smith, G K. (2016). \\"Calcite straw stalactites growing from concrete structures\\". Cave and Karst Science 43(1), pp4-10. The way stalactites form on concrete is due to different chemistry than those that form naturally in limestone caves and is due of the presence of calcium oxide in cement. Concrete is made from aggregate, sand and cement. When water is added to the mix, the calcium oxide in the cement reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). The chemical formula for this is: :: + ‚Üí Over time, any rainwater that penetrates cracks in set (hard) concrete will carry any free calcium hydroxide in solution to the edge of the concrete. Stalactites can form when the solution emerges on the underside of the concrete structure where it is suspended in the air, for example, on a ceiling or a beam. When the solution comes into contact with air on the underside of the concrete structure, another chemical reaction takes place. The solution reacts with carbon dioxide in the air and precipitates calcium carbonate. :: + ‚Üí + When this solution drops down it leaves behind particles of calcium carbonate and over time these form into a stalactite. They are normally a few centimeters long and with a diameter of approximately . The growth rate of stalactites is significantly influenced by supply continuity of saturated solution and the drip rate. A straw shaped stalactite which has formed under a concrete structure can grow as much as 2 mm per day in length, when the drip rate is approximately 11 minutes between drops. Changes in leachate solution pH can facilitate additional chemical reactions, which may also influence calthemite stalactite growth rates. Records The White Chamber in the Jeita Grotto's upper cavern in Lebanon contains an limestone stalactite which is accessible to visitors and is claimed to be the longest stalactite in the world. Another such claim is made for a limestone stalactite that hangs in the Chamber of Rarities in the Gruta Rei do Mato (Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil). However, vertical cavers have often encountered longer stalactites while exploring. One of the longest stalactites viewable by the general public is in Pol an Ionain (Doolin Cave), County Clare, Ireland, in a karst region known as The Burren; what makes it more impressive is the fact that the stalactite is held on by a section of calcite less than . Origin of the term Stalactites are first mentioned (though not by name) by the Roman natural historian Pliny in a text which also mentions stalagmites and columns and refers to their creation by the dripping of water. The term \\"stalactite\\" was coined in the 17th century by the Danish Physician Ole Worm,Olao Worm, Museum Wormianum. ... (Amsterdam (\\"Amstelodami\\"), (the Netherlands): Louis & Daniel Elzevier, 1655), pages 50-52. who coined the Latin word from the Greek word œÉœÑŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫œÑœåœÇ (stalaktos, \\"dripping\\") and the Greek suffix -ŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ (-ites, connected with or belonging to).See: Online Etymology Dictionary Photo gallery Image:Upclose caves.jpgStalactites at the Puerto Princesa Underground River, Palawan, Philippines.

Category:Speleothems ","title":"Stalactite"},{"id":"29392","text":"A summer in Si Phan Don, Laos Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn. At or around the summer solstice (about 3 days before Midsummer Day), the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. Summer timing From an astronomical view, the equinoxes and solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons, but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice, the time of maximal insolation, often identified with the 21st day of June or December. A variable seasonal lag means that the meteorological centre of the season, which is based on average temperature patterns, occurs several weeks after the time of maximal insolation. The meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere and the months of December, January, and February in the southern hemisphere.\\"Professor Paul Hardaker answers questions on meteorological forecasting\\" . Royal Geographical Society. Under meteorological definitions, all seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning of a calendar month and end at the end of a month. This meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of summer as the season with the longest (and warmest) days of the year, in which daylight predominates. The meteorological reckoning of seasons is used in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Russia and Japan. It is also used by many in the United Kingdom and in Canada. In Ireland, the summer months according to the national meteorological service, Met √âireann, are June, July and August. However, according to the Irish Calendar, summer begins on 1 May and ends on 1 August. School textbooks in Ireland follow the cultural norm of summer commencing on 1 May rather than the meteorological definition of 1 June. In midsummer, the sun can appear even at midnight in the northern hemisphere. Photo of midnight sun in Inari, Finland. Days continue to lengthen from equinox to solstice and summer days progressively shorten after the solstice, so meteorological summer encompasses the build-up to the longest day and a diminishing thereafter, with summer having many more hours of daylight than spring. Reckoning by hours of daylight alone, summer solstice marks the midpoint, not the beginning, of the seasons. Midsummer takes place over the shortest night of the year, which is the summer solstice, or on a nearby date that varies with tradition. Where a seasonal lag of half a season or more is common, reckoning based on astronomical markers is shifted half a season. By this method, in North America, summer is the period from the summer solstice (usually 20 or 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere) to the autumn equinox. Reckoning by cultural festivals, the summer season in the United States is traditionally regarded as beginning on Memorial Day weekend (the last Weekend in May) and ending on Labor Day (the first Monday in September), more closely in line with the meteorological definition for the parts of the country that have four-season weather. The similar Canadian tradition starts summer on Victoria Day one week prior (although summer conditions vary widely across Canada's expansive territory) and ends, as in the United States, on Labour Day. In Chinese astronomy, summer starts on or around 5 May, with the ji√©q√¨ (solar term) known as l√¨xi√† (Á´ãÂ§è), i.e. \\"establishment of summer\\", and it ends on or around 6 August. In southern and southeast Asia, where the monsoon occurs, summer is more generally defined as lasting from March, April, May and June, the warmest time of the year, ending with the onset of the monsoon rains. Because the temperature lag is shorter in the oceanic temperate southern hemisphere, most countries in this region use the meteorological definition with summer starting on 1 December and ending on the last day of February. Weather Wet season thunderstorm at night in Darwin, Australia. Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In the Mediterranean regions, it is also associated with dry weather, while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime.Charles Darwin University (2009). Characteristics of tropical savannas. Charles Darwin University. Retrieved on 27 December 2008. Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds, it is known as a monsoon.Glossary of Meteorology (2009). Monsoon. American Meteorological Society. Retrieved 16 January 2009. Hurricane Lester from late August 1992. In the northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct tropical cyclone season occurs from 1 June to 30 November. The statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is 10 September. The Northeast Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity, but in a similar timeframe to the Atlantic. The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September. In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with peaks in May and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone season runs from 1 November until the end of April with peaks in mid-February to early March. Thunderstorm season in the United States and Canada runs in the spring through summer but sometimes can run as late as October or even November in the fall. These storms can produce hail, strong winds and tornadoes, usually during the afternoon and evening. Holidays =School breaks= Schools and universities typically have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days. In almost all countries, children are out of school during this time of year for summer break, although dates vary. In the United States, public schools usually end in late May in Memorial Day weekend, while colleges finish in early May. Public school traditionally resumes near Labor Day, while higher institutions often resume in mid-August. In England and Wales, school ends in mid-July and resumes again in early September; in Scotland, the summer holiday begins in late June and ends in mid- to late-August. Similarly, in Canada the summer holiday starts on the last or second-last Friday in June and ends in late August or on the first Tuesday of September, with the exception of when that date falls before Labour Day, in which case, ends on the second Tuesday of the month. In Russia the summer holiday begins at the end of May and ends on 31 August. In the Southern Hemisphere, school summer holiday dates include the major holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day. School summer holidays in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa begin in early December and end in early February, with dates varying between states. In South Africa, the new school-year usually starts during the second week of January, thus aligning the academic year with the Calendar year. In India, school ends in late April and resumes in early or mid-June. In Cameroon and Nigeria, schools usually finish for summer vacation in mid-July, and resume in the later weeks of September or the first week of October. =Public holidays= A wide range of public holidays fall during summer, including: * Memorial Day (United States) or Victoria Day (Canada) through Labor Day * Independence Day (Jordan) (25 May) * Bank holidays in the United Kingdom and Ireland * Festa della Repubblica, Italian national day and republic day (2 June) * National Day of Sweden (6 June) and Midsummer, sometimes referred to as the \\"alternative National Day\\" * Canada Day (1 July) * Independence Day (United States) (4 July) * Bastille Day, National Day of France (14 July) * Belgian National Day (21 July) * √ìlavs√∏ka, Faroe Islands (29 July) * Swiss National Day (1 August) * Independence Day (Pakistan) (14 August) * Independence Day (India) (15 August) * Australia Day (26 January) Activities Hotels and tourists along the Atlantic Ocean shoreline in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in summer People generally take advantage of the high temperatures by spending more time outdoors during summer. Activities such as travelling to the beach and picnics occur during the summer months. Sports such as soccer, basketball, football, volleyball, skateboarding, baseball, softball, cricket, tennis and golf are played. Water sports also occur. These include water skiing, wakeboarding, swimming, surfing, tubing and water polo. The modern Olympics have been held during the summer months every four years since 1896. The 2000 Summer Olympics, in Sydney, however, were held during the Australian Spring. Summer is normally a low point in television viewing, and television schedules generally reflect this by not scheduling new episodes of their most popular shows between the end of May sweeps and the beginning of the television season in September, instead scheduling low-cost reality television shows and burning off commitments to already-cancelled series. There is an exception to this with children's television. Many television shows made for children and are popular with children are released during the summer months, especially on children's cable channels such as the Disney Channel in the United States, as children are off school. Disney Channel, for example, ends its pre-school programming earlier in the day for older school-age children in the summer months while it reverts to the original scheduling as the new school year begins. Conversely, the music and film industries generally experience higher returns during the summer than other times of the year and market their summer hits accordingly. Summer is most popular for animated movies to be released theatrically in movie theaters. With most school-age children and college students (except those attending summer school and summer camp) on summer vacation during the summer months, especially in the United States, travel and vacationing traditionally peak during the summer, with the volume of travel in a typical summer weekend rivalled only by Thanksgiving. Teenagers and college students often take summer jobs in industries that cater to recreation. Business activity for the recreation, tourism, restaurant, and retail industries peaks during the summer months as well as the holiday season.

The family is composed of 33 species in four genera. The family name, and that of the largest genus, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for \\"butcher\\", and some shrikes are also known as butcherbirds because of their feeding habits. The common English name shrike is from Old English , alluding to the shrike's shriek-like call.  Distribution, migration, and habitat  Most shrike species have a Eurasian and African distribution, with just two breeding in North America (the loggerhead and northern shrikes). No members of this family occur in South America or Australia, although one species reaches New Guinea. The shrikes vary in the extent of their ranges, with some species such as the great grey shrike ranging across the Northern Hemisphere to the Newton's fiscal which is restricted to the island of S√£o Tom√©. They inhabit open habitats, especially steppe and savannah. A few species of shrikes are forest dwellers, seldom occurring in open habitats. Some species breed in northern latitudes during the summer, then migrate to warmer climes for the winter.  Description  Shrikes are medium-sized birds with grey, brown, or black and white plumage. Most species are between and in size, however, the genus Corvinella with its extremely elongated tail feathers may reach up to in length. Their beaks are hooked, like those of a bird of prey, reflecting their predatory nature, and their calls are strident.  Behaviour  A bee presumably caught and impaled by a shrike Shrikes are known for their habit of catching insects and small vertebrates and impaling their bodies on thorns, the spikes on barbed-wire fences, or any available sharp point. This helps them to tear the flesh into smaller, more conveniently sized fragments, and serves as a cache so that the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time. This same behaviour of impaling insects serves as an adaptation to eating the toxic lubber grasshopper, Romalea microptera. The bird waits for 1‚Äì2 days for the toxins within the grasshopper to degrade, when they can then eat it. Loggerhead Shrikes kill vertebrates by using their beaks to grab the neck and violently shake their prey. Shrikes are territorial, and these territories are defended from other pairs. In migratory species, a breeding territory is defended in the breeding grounds and a smaller feeding territory is established during migration and in the wintering grounds. Where several species of shrikes exist together, competition for territories can be intense. Shrikes make regular use of exposed perch sites, where they adopt a conspicuous upright stance. These sites are used to watch for prey and to advertise their presence to rivals. = Breeding = Shrikes are generally monogamous breeders, although polygyny has been recorded in some species. Co- operative breeding, where younger birds help their parents raise the next generation of young, has been recorded in both species in the genera Eurocephalus and Corvinella, as well as one species of Lanius. Males attract females to their territory with well-stocked caches, which may include inedible but brightly coloured items. During courtship, the male performs a ritualised dance which includes actions that mimic the skewering of prey on thorns, and feeds the female. Shrikes make simple, cup-shaped nests from twigs and grasses, in bushes and the lower branches of trees.  Species in taxonomic order  Lizard impaled on thorns by a southern grey shrike, Lanius meridionalis, Lanzarote The family Laniidae was introduced (as Lanidia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815.

The Australasian butcherbirds are not shrikes, although they occupy a similar ecological niche.  In fiction  In Michael Connelly's 2020 novel, Fair Warning, a serial killer is named \\"The Shrike\\" because he snaps the necks of his victims. In the science fiction novel Hyperion, by Dan Simmons, the central antagonist is a strange creature, perhaps cybernetic and futuristic in origin, that has the ability to appear in any area of space and time, kidnapping seemingly random individuals. These victims are later seen impaled on an impossibly large metal tree of thorns, agonized eternally. This gives the entity a quality not unlike this bird, although it does not consume its victims for sustenance. The entity is referred to simply as The Shrike. In the Mortal Engines book series by Philip Reeve, and in the movie adaption, a 'Stalker', named \\"Shrike\\", is one of the main characters: a resurrected bounty hunter who was once part of a military unit known as the Lazarus Brigade, of which all members were named after birds, hence how Shrike got his name. In the American versions of the novels however, Shrike is renamed to \\"Grike\\", possibly to avoid legal issues with Dan Simmons' \\"Hyperion\\", which has a creature known as \\"The Shrike\\". In the short story \\"The Lesser Evil\\" by Andrzej Sapkowski, from his The Witcher series, the suspected monster Renfri is called Shrike due to her alleged habit of impaling living people on poles. In Hannibal (TV series), serial killer Garret Jacob Hobbs is known as the \\"Minnesota Shrike\\" due to the way that he mounted his victims on deer antlers, similar to the way that the shrike impales its victims on spikes.

Gay bars across North America stopped serving screwdrivers and invented this cocktail to replace it. The sales and proceeds of the cocktail went to gay rights activists and helped fund their work against Bryant. The campaign was ultimately successful as Bryant's activism damaged her musical and business career. Her contract with the Florida Citrus Commission was left to expire in 1980 after they stated she was \\"worn out\\" as a spokesperson. After that, gay bars started selling screwdrivers again.

A single-stage-to-orbit (or SSTO) vehicle reaches orbit from the surface of a body using only propellants and fluids and without expending tanks, engines, or other major hardware. The term usually, but not exclusively, refers to reusable vehicles. To date, no Earth-launched SSTO launch vehicles have ever been flown; orbital launches from Earth have been performed by either fully or partially expendable multi- stage rockets. The main projected advantage of the SSTO concept is elimination of the hardware replacement inherent in expendable launch systems. However, the non-recurring costs associated with design, development, research and engineering (DDR&E;) of reusable SSTO systems are much higher than expendable systems due to the substantial technical challenges of SSTO, assuming that those technical issues can in fact be solved.Dick, Stephen and Lannius, R., \\"Critical Issues in the History of Spaceflight,\\" NASA Publication SP-2006-4702, 2006. It is considered to be marginally possible to launch a single-stage-to-orbit chemically-fueled spacecraft from Earth. The principal complicating factors for SSTO from Earth are: high orbital velocity of over ; the need to overcome Earth's gravity, especially in the early stages of flight; and flight within Earth's atmosphere, which limits speed in the early stages of flight and influences engine performance. Advances in rocketry in the 21st century have resulted in a substantial fall in the cost to launch a kilogram of payload to either low Earth orbit or the International Space Station,Harry W. Jones (2018). \\"The Recent Large Reduction in Space Launch Cost\\" (PDF). ICES. Retrieved 12 December 2018. reducing the main projected advantage of the SSTO concept. Notable single stage to orbit concepts include Skylon, the DC-X, the Lockheed Martin X-33, and the Roton SSTO. However, despite showing some promise, none of them has come close to achieving orbit yet due to problems with finding a sufficiently efficient propulsion system. Single-stage-to-orbit is much easier to achieve on extraterrestrial bodies that have weaker gravitational fields and lower atmospheric pressure than Earth, such as the Moon and Mars, and has been achieved from the Moon by both the Apollo program's Lunar Module and several robotic spacecraft of the Soviet Luna program. History =Early concepts= ROMBUS concept art Before the second half of the twentieth century, very little research was conducted into space travel. During the 1960s, some of the first concept designs for this kind of craft began to emerge. One of the earliest SSTO concepts was the expendable One stage Orbital Space Truck (OOST) proposed by Philip Bono,Philip Bono and Kenneth William Gatland, Frontiers of Space, an engineer for Douglas Aircraft Company. A reusable version named ROOST was also proposed. Another early SSTO concept was a reusable launch vehicle named NEXUS which was proposed by Krafft Arnold Ehricke in the early 1960s. It was one of the largest spacecraft ever conceptualized with a diameter of over 50 metres and the capability to lift up to 2000 short tons into Earth orbit, intended for missions to further out locations in the solar system such as Mars. The North American Air Augmented VTOVL from 1963 was a similarly large craft which would have used ramjets to decrease the liftoff mass of the vehicle by removing the need for large amounts of liquid oxygen while traveling through the atmosphere. From 1965, Robert Salked investigated various single stage to orbit winged spaceplane concepts. He proposed a vehicle which would burn hydrocarbon fuel while in the atmosphere and then switch to hydrogen fuel for increasing efficiency once in space. Further examples of Bono's early concepts (prior to the 1990s) which were never constructed include: *ROMBUS (Reusable Orbital Module, Booster, and Utility Shuttle), another design from Philip Bono. This was not technically single stage since it dropped some of its initial hydrogen tanks, but it came very close. *Ithacus, an adapted ROMBUS concept which was designed to carry soldiers and military equipment to other continents via a sub-orbital trajectory. *Pegasus, another adapted ROMBUS concept designed to carry passengers and payloads long distances in short amounts of time via space. *Douglas SASSTO, another launch vehicle concept. *Hyperion, yet another Philip Bono concept which used a sled to build up speed before liftoff to save on the amount of fuel which had to be lifted into the air. In 1979 Rockwell International unveiled a concept for a 100 ton payload heavy-lift multicycle airbreather ramjet/cryogenic rocket engine, horizontal takeoff/horizontal landing single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane named Star-Raker, designed to launch heavy Space-based solar power satellites into a 300 nautical mile Earth orbit.http://www.alternatewars.com/SpaceRace/Star_Raker/Star_Raker_Original_Raw.pdf Around 1985 the NASP project was intended to launch a scramjet vehicle into orbit, but funding was stopped and the project cancelled. At around the same time, the HOTOL tried to use precooled jet engine technology, but failed to show significant advantages over rocket technology.Flight international 1 March 1986 =DC-X technology= The maiden flight of the DC-X The DC-X, short for Delta Clipper Experimental, was an uncrewed one-third scale vertical takeoff and landing demonstrator for a proposed SSTO. It is one of only a few prototype SSTO vehicles ever built. Several other prototypes were intended, including the DC-X2 (a half-scale prototype) and the DC-Y, a full-scale vehicle which would be capable of single stage insertion into orbit. Neither of these were built, but the project was taken over by NASA in 1995, and they built the DC-XA, an upgraded one-third scale prototype. This vehicle was lost when it landed with only three of its four landing pads deployed, which caused it to tip over on its side and explode. The project has not been continued since. =Roton= From 1999 to 2001 Rotary Rocket attempted to build a SSTO vehicle called the Roton. It received a large amount of media attention and a working sub-scale prototype was completed, but the design was largely impractical. Approaches There have been various approaches to SSTO, including pure rockets that are launched and land vertically, air-breathing scramjet-powered vehicles that are launched and land horizontally, nuclear- powered vehicles, and even jet-engine-powered vehicles that can fly into orbit and return landing like an airliner, completely intact. For rocket-powered SSTO, the main challenge is achieving a high enough mass-ratio to carry sufficient propellant to achieve orbit, plus a meaningful payload weight. One possibility is to give the rocket an initial speed with a space gun, as planned in the Quicklaunch project. For air-breathing SSTO, the main challenge is system complexity and associated research and development costs, material science, and construction techniques necessary for surviving sustained high- speed flight within the atmosphere, and achieving a high enough mass-ratio to carry sufficient propellant to achieve orbit, plus a meaningful payload weight. Air-breathing designs typically fly at supersonic or hypersonic speeds, and usually include a rocket engine for the final burn for orbit. Whether rocket-powered or air-breathing, a reusable vehicle must be rugged enough to survive multiple round trips into space without adding excessive weight or maintenance. In addition a reusable vehicle must be able to reenter without damage, and land safely. While single-stage rockets were once thought to be beyond reach, advances in materials technology and construction techniques have shown them to be possible. For example, calculations show that the Titan II first stage, launched on its own, would have a 25-to-1 ratio of fuel to vehicle hardware. It has a sufficiently efficient engine to achieve orbit, but without carrying much payload. =Dense versus hydrogen fuels= Hydrogen fuel might seem the obvious fuel for SSTO vehicles. When burned with oxygen, hydrogen gives the highest specific impulse of any commonly used fuel: around 450 seconds, compared with up to 350 seconds for kerosene. Hydrogen has the following advantages: * Hydrogen has nearly 30% higher specific impulse (about 450 seconds vs. 350 seconds) than most dense fuels. * Hydrogen is an excellent coolant. * The gross mass of hydrogen stages is lower than dense- fuelled stages for the same payload. * Hydrogen is environmentally friendly. However, hydrogen also has these disadvantages: * Very low density (about of the density of kerosene) ‚Äì requiring a very large tank * Deeply cryogenic ‚Äì must be stored at very low temperatures and thus needs heavy insulation * Escapes very easily from the smallest gap * Wide combustible range ‚Äì easily ignited and burns with a dangerously invisible flame * Tends to condense oxygen which can cause flammability problems * Has a large coefficient of expansion for even small heat leaks. These issues can be dealt with, but at extra cost. While kerosene tanks can be 1% of the weight of their contents, hydrogen tanks often must weigh 10% of their contents. This is because of both the low density and the additional insulation required to minimize boiloff (a problem which does not occur with kerosene and many other fuels). The low density of hydrogen further affects the design of the rest of the vehicle: pumps and pipework need to be much larger in order to pump the fuel to the engine. The end result is the thrust/weight ratio of hydrogen-fueled engines is 30‚Äì50% lower than comparable engines using denser fuels. This inefficiency indirectly affects gravity losses as well; the vehicle has to hold itself up on rocket power until it reaches orbit. The lower excess thrust of the hydrogen engines due to the lower thrust/weight ratio means that the vehicle must ascend more steeply, and so less thrust acts horizontally. Less horizontal thrust results in taking longer to reach orbit, and gravity losses are increased by at least . While not appearing large, the mass ratio to delta-v curve is very steep to reach orbit in a single stage, and this makes a 10% difference to the mass ratio on top of the tankage and pump savings. The overall effect is that there is surprisingly little difference in overall performance between SSTOs that use hydrogen and those that use denser fuels, except that hydrogen vehicles may be rather more expensive to develop and buy. Careful studies have shown that some dense fuels (for example liquid propane) exceed the performance of hydrogen fuel when used in an SSTO launch vehicle by 10% for the same dry weight. In the 1960s Philip Bono investigated single- stage, VTVL tripropellant rockets, and showed that it could improve payload size by around 30%. Operational experience with the DC-X experimental rocket has caused a number of SSTO advocates to reconsider hydrogen as a satisfactory fuel. The late Max Hunter, while employing hydrogen fuel in the DC-X, often said that he thought the first successful orbital SSTO would more likely be fueled by propane. =One engine for all altitudes= Some SSTO concepts use the same engine for all altitudes, which is a problem for traditional engines with a bell-shaped nozzle. Depending on the atmospheric pressure, different bell shapes are optimal. Engines operating in the lower atmosphere have shorter bells than those designed to work in vacuum. Having a bell that is only optimal at a single altitude lowers the overall engine efficiency. One possible solution would be to use an aerospike engine, which can be effective in a wide range of ambient pressures. In fact, a linear aerospike engine was to be used in the X-33 design. Other solutions involve using multiple engines and other altitude adapting designs such as double-mu bells or extensible bell sections. Still, at very high altitudes, the extremely large engine bells tend to expand the exhaust gases down to near vacuum pressures. As a result, these engine bells are counterproductive due to their excess weight. Some SSTO concepts use very high pressure engines which permit high ratios to be used from ground level. This gives good performance, negating the need for more complex solutions. =Airbreathing SSTO= Skylon spaceplane Some designs for SSTO attempt to use airbreathing jet engines that collect oxidizer and reaction mass from the atmosphere to reduce the take-off weight of the vehicle. Some of the issues with this approach are: * No known air breathing engine is capable of operating at orbital speed within the atmosphere (for example hydrogen fueled scramjets seem to have a top speed of about Mach 17). This means that rockets must be used for the final orbital insertion. * Rocket thrust needs the orbital mass to be as small as possible to minimize propellant weight. * The thrust-to-weight ratio of rockets that rely on on- board oxygen increases dramatically as fuel is expended, because the oxidizer fuel tank has about 1% of the mass as the oxidizer it carries, whereas air- breathing engines traditionally have a poor thrust/weight ratio which is relatively fixed during the air-breathing ascent. * Very high speeds in the atmosphere necessitate very heavy thermal protection systems, which makes reaching orbit even harder. * While at lower speeds, air-breathing engines are very efficient, but the efficiency (Isp) and thrust levels of air-breathing jet engines drop considerably at high speed (above Mach 5‚Äì10 depending on the engine) and begin to approach that of rocket engines or worse. * Lift to drag ratios of vehicles at hypersonic speeds are poor, however the effective lift to drag ratios of rocket vehicles at high g is not dissimilar. Thus with for example scramjet designs (e.g. X-43) the mass budgets do not seem to close for orbital launch. Similar issues occur with single-stage vehicles attempting to carry conventional jet engines to orbit‚Äîthe weight of the jet engines is not compensated sufficiently by the reduction in propellant. On the other hand, LACE-like precooled airbreathing designs such as the Skylon spaceplane (and ATREX) which transition to rocket thrust at rather lower speeds (Mach 5.5) do seem to give, on paper at least, an improved orbital mass fraction over pure rockets (even multistage rockets) sufficiently to hold out the possibility of full reusability with better payload fraction.Cimino, P.; Drake, J.; Jones, J.; Strayer, D.; Venetoklis, P.: \\"Transatmospheric vehicle propelled by air- turborocket engines\\", AIAA, Joint Propulsion Conference, 21st, Monterey, CA, 8‚Äì11 July 1985. 10 p. Research supported by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute., 07/1985 It is important to note that mass fraction is an important concept in the engineering of a rocket. However, mass fraction may have little to do with the costs of a rocket, as the costs of fuel are very small when compared to the costs of the engineering program as a whole. As a result, a cheap rocket with a poor mass fraction may be able to deliver more payload to orbit with a given amount of money than a more complicated, more efficient rocket. =Launch assists= Many vehicles are only narrowly suborbital, so practically anything that gives a relatively small delta-v increase can be helpful, and outside assistance for a vehicle is therefore desirable. Proposed launch assists include: *sled launch (rail, maglev including Bantam, MagLifter, and StarTram, etc.)https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&context;=ijaaa *air launch or aircraft tow *in-flight fueling *Lofstrom launch loop/space fountains And on-orbit resources such as: *Space tether *tugs =Nuclear propulsion= Due to weight issues such as shielding, many nuclear propulsion systems are unable to lift their own weight, and hence are unsuitable for launching to orbit. However, some designs such as the Orion project and some nuclear thermal designs do have a thrust to weight ratio in excess of 1, enabling them to lift off. Clearly, one of the main issues with nuclear propulsion would be safety, both during a launch for the passengers, but also in case of a failure during launch. No current program is attempting nuclear propulsion from Earth's surface. =Beam-powered propulsion= Because they can be more energetic than the potential energy that chemical fuel allows for, some laser or microwave powered rocket concepts have the potential to launch vehicles into orbit, single stage. In practice, this area is not possible with current technology. Design challenges inherent in SSTO The design space constraints of SSTO vehicles were described by rocket design engineer Robert Truax: The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation expresses the maximum change in velocity any single rocket stage can achieve: where: The mass ratio of a vehicle is defined as a ratio the initial vehicle mass when fully loaded with propellants \\\\left ( m_i \\\\right ) to the final vehicle mass \\\\left ( m_f \\\\right ) after the burn: {m_s + m_\\\\text{pl}}}} where: The propellant mass fraction (\\\\zeta) of a vehicle can be expressed solely as a function of the mass ratio: The structural coefficient (\\\\lambda) is a critical parameter in SSTO vehicle design.Hale, Francis, Introduction to Space Flight, Prentice Hall, 1994. Structural efficiency of a vehicle is maximized as the structural coefficient approaches zero. The structural coefficient is defined as: Comparison of growth factor sensitivity for Single-Stage-to-Orbit (SSTO) and restricted stage Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) vehicles. Based on a LEO mission of Delta v = 9.1 km/s and payload mass = 4500 kg for range of propellant Isp. = \\\\frac {\\\\frac {m_s} {m_i}} {1 - \\\\frac {m_\\\\text{pl}} {m_i}}}} The overall structural mass fraction \\\\left ( \\\\frac {m_s} {m_i} \\\\right) can be expressed in terms of the structural coefficient: {m_i} \\\\right )}} An additional expression for the overall structural mass fraction can be found by noting that the payload mass fraction \\\\left ( \\\\frac {m_\\\\text{pl}} {m_i} \\\\right), propellant mass fraction and structural mass fraction sum to one: {m_i} + \\\\frac {m_p} {m_i} + \\\\frac {m_s} {m_i} = \\\\frac {m_\\\\text{pl}} {m_i} + \\\\zeta + \\\\frac {m_s} {m_i}}} {m_i}}} Equating the expressions for structural mass fraction and solving for the initial vehicle mass yields: {1 - \\\\left ( \\\\frac {\\\\zeta} {1 - \\\\lambda} \\\\right )}}} This expression shows how the size of a SSTO vehicle is dependent on its structural efficiency. Given a mission profile \\\\left( \\\\Delta v, m_\\\\text{pl} \\\\right) and propellant type \\\\left ( I_\\\\text{sp} \\\\right ), the size of a vehicle increases with an increasing structural coefficient.Mossman, Jason, \\"Investigation of Advanced Propellants to Enable Single Stage to Orbit Launch Vehicles\\", Master's thesis, California State University, Fresno, 2006. This growth factor sensitivity is shown parametrically for both SSTO and two-stage- to-orbit (TSTO) vehicles for a standard LEO mission.Livington, J.W., \\"Comparative Analysis of Rocket and Air-Breathing Launch Vehicle Systems\\", Space 2004 Conference and Exhibit, San Diego, California, 2004. The curves vertically asymptote at the maximum structural coefficient limit where mission criteria can no longer be met: In comparison to a non-optimized TSTO vehicle using restricted staging, a SSTO rocket launching an identical payload mass and using the same propellants will always require a substantially smaller structural coefficient to achieve the same delta-v. Given that current materials technology places a lower limit of approximately 0.1 on the smallest structural coefficients attainable,Curtis, Howard, Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students, Third Edition, Oxford: Elsevier, 2010. Print. reusable SSTO vehicles are typically an impractical choice even when using the highest performance propellants available. Examples It is easier to achieve SSTO from a body with lower gravitational pull than Earth, such as the Moon or Mars. The Apollo Lunar Module ascended from the lunar surface to lunar orbit in a single stage. A detailed study into SSTO vehicles was prepared by Chrysler Corporation's Space Division in 1970‚Äì1971 under NASA contract NAS8-26341. Their proposal (Shuttle SERV) was an enormous vehicle with more than of payload, utilizing jet engines for (vertical) landing. While the technical problems seemed to be solvable, the USAF required a winged design that led to the Shuttle as we know it today. The uncrewed DC-X technology demonstrator, originally developed by McDonnell Douglas for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program office, was an attempt to build a vehicle that could lead to an SSTO vehicle. The one-third-size test craft was operated and maintained by a small team of three people based out of a trailer, and the craft was once relaunched less than 24 hours after landing. Although the test program was not without mishap (including a minor explosion), the DC-X demonstrated that the maintenance aspects of the concept were sound. That project was cancelled when it landed with three of four legs deployed, tipped over, and exploded on the fourth flight after transferring management from the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization to NASA. The Aquarius Launch Vehicle was designed to bring bulk materials to orbit as cheaply as possible. =Current development= Current and previous SSTO projects include the Japanese Kankoh-maru project, ARCA Haas 2C, and the Indian Avatar spaceplane. =Skylon= The British Government partnered with the ESA in 2010 to promote a single-stage to orbit spaceplane concept called Skylon. This design was pioneered by Reaction Engines Limited (REL), a company founded by Alan Bond after HOTOL was canceled. The Skylon spaceplane has been positively received by the British government, and the British Interplanetary Society. Following a successful propulsion system test that was audited by ESA's propulsion division in mid-2012, REL announced that it would begin a three-and-a-half- year project to develop and build a test jig of the Sabre engine to prove the engines performance across its air-breathing and rocket modes. In November 2012, it was announced that a key test of the engine precooler had been successfully completed, and that ESA had verified the precooler's design. The project's development is now allowed to advance to its next phase, which involves the construction and testing of a full-scale prototype engine.Thomson, Ian. \\"European Space Agency clears SABRE orbital engines\\". The Register. 29 November 2012. Alternative approaches to inexpensive spaceflight Many studies have shown that regardless of selected technology, the most effective cost reduction technique is economies of scale. Merely launching a large total number reduces the manufacturing costs per vehicle, similar to how the mass production of automobiles brought about great increases in affordability. Using this concept, some aerospace analysts believe the way to lower launch costs is the exact opposite of SSTO. Whereas reusable SSTOs would reduce per launch costs by making a reusable high-tech vehicle that launches frequently with low maintenance, the \\"mass production\\" approach views the technical advances as a source of the cost problem in the first place. By simply building and launching large quantities of rockets, and hence launching a large volume of payload, costs can be brought down. This approach was attempted in the late 1970s, early 1980s in West Germany with the Democratic Republic of the Congo-based OTRAG rocket. This is somewhat similar to the approach some previous systems have taken, using simple engine systems with \\"low-tech\\" fuels, as the Russian and Chinese space programs still do. An alternative to scale is to make the discarded stages practically reusable: this is the goal of the SpaceX reusable launch system development program and their Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship. A similar approach is being pursued by Blue Origin, using New Glenn.

This subject is of great interest to biologists because macromolecules carry out most of the functions of cells, and it is only by coiling into specific three- dimensional shapes that they are able to perform these functions. This architecture, the \\"tertiary structure\\" of molecules, depends in a complicated way on each molecule's basic composition, or \\"primary structure.\\" Hemoglobin, the oxygen transporting protein found in red blood cells Biomolecules are too small to see in detail even with the most advanced light microscopes. The methods that structural biologists use to determine their structures generally involve measurements on vast numbers of identical molecules at the same time.

But variations on these methods are also used to watch nascent or denatured molecules assume or reassume their native states. See protein folding. A third approach that structural biologists take to understanding structure is bioinformatics to look for patterns among the diverse sequences that give rise to particular shapes. Researchers often can deduce aspects of the structure of integral membrane proteins based on the membrane topology predicted by hydrophobicity analysis. See protein structure prediction. Examples of protein structures from the alt= In the past few years it has become possible for highly accurate physical molecular models to complement the in silico study of biological structures.

The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions. According to Sunni traditions, Muhammad designated his successor as Abu Bakr by commanding him to lead prayers when he was ill.Fitzpatrick, Coeli; Walker, Adam Hani (2014). Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God [2 volumes]. ABC-CLIO. pp. 2‚Äì3. . The Muslim community later corroborated this by electing him as the first caliph. This contrasts with the Shia view, which holds that Muhammad announced his son-in-law and cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor, most notably at Ghadir Khumm. Political tensions between Sunnis and Shias continued with varying intensity throughout Islamic history and have been exacerbated in recent times by ethnic conflicts and the rise of Salafism and Wahhabism. The adherents of Sunni Islam are referred to in Arabic as (\\"the people of the Sunnah and the community\\") or for short. In English, its doctrines and practices are sometimes called Sunnism, while adherents are known as Sunni Muslims, Sunnis, Sunnites and Ahlus Sunnah. Sunni Islam is sometimes referred to as \\"orthodox Islam\\", though some scholars view this translation as inappropriate.An Introduction to the Hadith. John Burton. Published by Edinburgh University Press. 1996. p. 201. Cite: \\"Sunni: Of or pertaining sunna, especially the Sunna of the Prophet. Used in conscious opposition to Shi'a, Shi'√≠. There being no ecclesia or centralized magisterium, the translation 'orthodox' is inappropriate. To the Muslim 'unorthodox' implies heretical, mubtadi, from bid'a, the contrary of sunna and so 'innovation'.\\" The Quran, together with hadith (especially those collected in Kutub al-Sittah) and binding juristic consensus, form the basis of all traditional jurisprudence within Sunni Islam. Sharia rulings are derived from these basic sources, in conjunction with analogical reasoning, consideration of public welfare and juristic discretion, using the principles of jurisprudence developed by the traditional legal schools. In matters of creed, the Sunni tradition upholds the six pillars of imƒÅn (faith) and comprises the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools of rationalistic theology as well as the textualist school known as traditionalist theology. Terminology (Classical Arabic: ), also commonly referred to as , is a term derived from the word ' ( , plural ' ), meaning \\"habit\\", \\"usual practice\\",Sunnah , Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement \\"custom\\", \\"tradition\\". In Arabic, the word is an adjective literally meaning \\"pertaining to the Sunnah\\". The Muslim use of this term refers to the sayings and living habits of the prophet Muhammad. In Arabic, this branch of Islam is referred to as ' (), \\"the people of the sunnah and the community\\", which is commonly shortened to ' (Arabic ÿ£ŸáŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÜÿ©). History One common mistake is to assume that Sunni Islam represents a normative Islam that emerged during the period after Muhammad's death, and that Sufism and Shi'ism developed out of Sunni Islam. This perception is partly due to the reliance on highly ideological sources that have been accepted as reliable historical works, and also because the vast majority of the population is Sunni. Both Sunnism and Shiaism are the end products of several centuries of competition between ideologies. Both sects used each other to further cement their own identities and doctrines. The Kaaba mosque in Mecca is the largest and most important mosque in the world. Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Mosque in Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia The first four caliphs are known among Sunnis as the RƒÅshidun or \\"Rightly-Guided Ones\\". Sunni recognition includes the aforementioned Abu Bakr as the first, Umar as the second, Uthman as the third, and Ali as the fourth. Sunnis recognised different rulers as the caliph, though they did not include anyone in the list of the rightly guided ones or RƒÅshidun after the murder of Ali, until the caliphate was constitutionally abolished in Turkey on 3 March, 1924. =Transition of caliphate into dynastic monarchy of Banu Umayya= The seeds of metamorphosis of caliphate into kingship were sown, as the second caliph Umar had feared, as early as the regime of the third caliph Uthman, who appointed many of his kinsmen from his clan Banu Umayya, including MarwƒÅn and Walid bin Uqba on important government positions, becoming the main cause of turmoil resulting in his murder and the ensuing infighting during Ali's time and rebellion by MuƒÅwiya, another of Uthman's kinsman. This ultimately resulted in the establishment of firm dynastic rule of Banu Umayya after Husain, the younger son of Ali from FƒÅtima, was killed at the Battle of KarbalƒÅ. The rise to power of Banu Umayya, the Meccan tribe of elites who had vehemently opposed Muhammad under the leadership of Abu SufyƒÅn, MuƒÅwiya's father, right up to the conquest of Mecca by Muhammad, as his successors with the accession of Uthman to caliphate, replaced the egalitarian society formed as a result of Muhammad's revolution to a society stratified between haves and have-nots as a result of nepotism, and in the words of El-Hibri through \\"the use of religious charity revenues (zakƒÅt) to subsidise family interests, which Uthman justified as \\"al-sila\\" (pious filial support).\\" Ali, during his rather brief regime after Uthman maintained austere life style and tried hard to bring back the egalitarian system and supremacy of law over the ruler idealised in Muhammad's message, but faced continued opposition, and wars one after another by Aisha-Talhah-Zubair, by MuƒÅwiya and finally by the KhƒÅrjites. After he was murdered his followers immediately elected Hasan ibn Ali his elder son from FƒÅtima to succeed him. Hasan, however, shortly afterwards signed a treaty with MuƒÅwiya relinquishing power in favour of the latter, with a condition inter alia, that one of the two who will outlive the other will be the caliph, and that this caliph will not appoint a successor but will leave the matter of selection of the caliph to the public. Subsequently, Hasan was poisoned to death and Muawiya enjoyed unchallenged power. Not honouring his treaty with Hasan he however nominated his son Yazid to succeed him. Upon MuƒÅwiya's death, Yazid asked Husain, the younger brother of Hasan, Ali's son and Muhammad's grandson, to give his allegiance to Yazid, which he plainly refused. His caravan was cordoned by Yazid's army at KarbalƒÅ and he was killed with all his male companions ‚Äì total 72 people, in a day long battle after which Yazid established himself as a sovereign, though strong public uprising erupted after his death against his dynasty to avenge the massacre of KarbalƒÅ, but Banu Umayya were able to quickly suppress them all and ruled the Muslim world, till they were finally overthrown by Banu AbbƒÅs. = Caliphate and the dynastic monarchy of Banu AbbƒÅs = The rule of and \\"caliphate\\" of Banu Umayya came to an end at the hands of Banu AbbƒÅs a branch of Banu HƒÅshim, the tribe of Muhammad, only to usher another dynastic monarchy styled as caliphate from 750 CE. This period is seen formative in Sunni Islam as the founders of the four schools viz, Abu Hanifa, MƒÅlik bin Anas, ShƒÅfi'i and Ahmad bin Hanbal all practised during this time, so also did Jafar al SƒÅdiq who elaborated the doctrine of imƒÅmate, the basis for the Shi'a religious thought. There was no clearly accepted formula for determining succession in the Abbasid caliphate. Two or three sons or other relatives of the dying caliph emerged as candidates to the throne, each supported by his own party of supporters. A trial of strength ensued and the most powerful party won and expected favours of the caliph they supported once he ascended the throne. The caliphate of this dynasty ended with the death of the Caliph al-Ma'mun in 833 CE, when the period of Turkish domination began. =Sunni Islam in the contemporary era= The fall, at the end of World War I of the Ottoman Empire, the biggest Sunni empire for six centuries, brought the caliphate to an end. This resulted in Sunni protests in far off places including the Khilafat Movement in India, which was later on upon gaining independence from Britain divided into Sunni dominated Pakistan and secular India. Pakistan, the most populous Sunni state at its birth, however later got partitioned into Pakistan and Bangladesh. The demise of Ottoman caliphate also resulted in the emergence of Saudi Arabia, a dynastic absolute monarchy with the support of the British and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of Wahhabism.Gail Minault, The Khilafat Movement: Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India (1982). This was followed by a considerable rise in Wahhabism, Salafism and Jihadism under the influence of the preaching of Ibn Taymiyyah a self proclaimed advocate of the traditions of Ahmad bin Hanbal. The expediencies of cold war resulted in encouragement of Afghan refugees in Pakistan to be radicalised, trained and armed to fight the communist regime backed by USSR forces in Afghanistan giving birth to Taliban. The Taliban wrestled power from the communists in Afghanistan and formed a government under the leadership of Mohammed Omar, who was addressed as the Emir of the faithful, an honorific way of addressing the caliph. The Taliban regime was recognised by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia till after 9/11, perpetrated by Osama bin Laden ‚Äì a Saudi national by birth and harboured by the Taliban ‚Äì took place, resulting in a war on terror launched against the Taliban. The sequence of events of the 20th century has led to resentment in some quarters of the Sunni community due to the loss of pre- eminence in several previously Sunni-dominated regions such as the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Balkans, the North Caucasus and the Indian sub continent. The latest attempt by a section of Salafis to re-establish a Sunni caliphate was seen in the emergence of the militant group ISIL, whose leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi is known among his followers as caliph and Amir-al-mu'amineen, \\"The Commander of the Faithful\\". Jihadism is however being opposed from within the Muslim community (known as the Ummah in Arabic) in all quarters of the world as evidenced by turnout of almost 2% of the Muslim population in London protesting against ISIL. Following the puritan approach of Ibn Kathir, Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad Rashid Rida, many contemporary tafsir (exegetic treatises) downplay the earlier significance of Biblical material (IsrƒÅ'iliyyƒÅt). Half of the Arab commentaries reject IsrƒÅ'iliyyƒÅt in general, while Turkish tafsir usually partly allow referring to Biblical material. Nevertheless, most non-Arabic commentators regard them as useless or not applicable.Johanna Pink (2010). Sunnitischer Tafsƒ´r in der modernen islamischen Welt: Akademische Traditionen, Popularisierung und nationalstaatliche Interessen. Brill, , pp. 114-116. A direct reference to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict could not be found. It remains unclear whether the refusal of IsrƒÅ'iliyyƒÅt is motivated by political discourse or by traditionalist thought alone. The usage of tafsir'ilmi is another notable characteristic of modern Sunni tafsir. Tafsir'ilmi stands for alleged scientific miracles found in the Qur'an. In short, the idea is that the Qur'an contains knowledge about subjects an author of the 7th century could not possibly have. Such interpretations are popular among many commentators. However, some scholars, such as the Commentators of Al-Azhar University, reject this approach, arguing the Qur'an is a text for religious guidance, not for science and scientific theories that may be disproved later; thus tafsir'ilmi might lead to interpreting Qur'anic passages as falsehoods.Johanna Pink (2010). Sunnitischer Tafsƒ´r in der modernen islamischen Welt: Akademische Traditionen, Popularisierung und nationalstaatliche Interessen. Brill, , pp. 120-121. Modern trends of Islamic interpretation are usually seen as adjusting to a modern audience and purifying Islam from alleged alterings, some of which are believed to be intentional corruptions brought into Islam to undermine and corrupt its message.

Shiites may be underrepresented in some countries where they do not appear in official statistics. Sunnis believe the companions of Prophet Muhammad to be reliable transmitters of Islam, since God and Muhammad accepted their integrity. Medieval sources even prohibit cursing or vilifying them.Coeli Fitzpatrick Ph.D., Adam Hani Walker Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God [2 volumes] ABC-CLIO, 25.04.2014 p. 106-107 This belief is based upon prophetic traditions such as one narrated by Abdullah, son of Masud, in which Muhammad said: \\"The best of the people are my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.\\" Support for this view is also found in the Qur'an, according to Sunnis.Quran, Therefore, narratives of companions are also reliably taken into account for knowledge of the Islamic faith. Sunnis also believe that the companions were true believers since it was the companions who were given the task of compiling the Qur'an. Sunni Islam does not have a formal hierarchy. Leaders are informal, and gain influence through study to become a scholar of Islamic law (sharia) or Islamic theology (KalƒÅm). Both religious and political leadership are in principle open to all Muslims.Simone Chambers, Peter Nosco Dissent on Core Beliefs: Religious and Secular Perspectives Cambridge University Press, 23.04.2015 p. 138 According to the Islamic Center of Columbia, South Carolina, anyone with the intelligence and the will can become an Islamic scholar.

These varied traditions reflect differing viewpoints on some laws and obligations within Islamic law. While one school may see a certain act as a religious obligation, another may see the same act as optional. These schools aren't regarded as sects; rather, they represent differing viewpoints on issues that are not considered the core of Islamic belief. Historians have differed regarding the exact delineation of the schools based on the underlying principles they follow. Many traditional scholars saw Sunni Islam in two groups: Ahl al-Ra'i, or \\"people of reason,\\" due to their emphasis on scholarly judgment and discourse; and Ahl al-Hadith, or \\"people of traditions,\\" due to their emphasis on restricting juristic thought to only what is found in scripture.Murtada Mutahhari, The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation , Al-Tawhid volume IV, No. 2, Publisher: Islamic Thought Foundation Ibn Khaldun defined the Sunni schools as three: the Hanafi school representing reason, the ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´te school representing tradition, and a broader, middle school encompassing the Shafi'ite, Malikite and Hanbalite schools.Meinhaj Hussain, A New Medina, The Legal System, Grande Strategy, January 5th, 2012Ign√°c Goldziher, The Zahiris, p. 5. Trns. Wolfgang Behn, intro. Camilla Adang. Volume three of Brill Classics in Islam. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2008. During the Middle Ages, the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt delineated the acceptable Sunni schools as only Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali, excluding the ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´ school. The Ottoman Empire later reaffirmed the official status of four schools as a reaction to the Shiite character of their ideological and political archrival, the Persian Safavids,Chibli Mallat, Introduction to Middle Eastern Law, p. 116. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007. though former Prime Minister of Sudan Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, as well as the Amman Message issued by King Abdullah II of Jordan, recognize the ·∫íƒÅhirƒ´ and keep the number of Sunni schools at five.Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim, \\"An Overview of al-Sadiq al-Madhi's Islamic Discourse.\\" Taken from The Blackwell Companion to Contemporary Islamic Thought, p. 172. Ed. Ibrahim Abu-Rabi'. Hoboken: Wiley- Blackwell, 2008. =Differences in the schools= The Great Mosque of Kairouan (also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in the city of Kairouan, Tunisia, was, particularly from the 9th‚Äî11th century, an important center of Islamic learning with an emphasis on the Maliki Madh'hab.Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Riad Nourallah, The future of Islam, Routledge, 2002, page 199 Interpreting Islamic law by deriving specific rulings ‚Äì such as how to pray ‚Äì is commonly known as Islamic jurisprudence. The schools of law all have their own particular tradition of interpreting this jurisprudence. As these schools represent clearly spelled out methodologies for interpreting Islamic law, there has been little change in the methodology with regard to each school. While conflict between the schools was often violent in the past, the four Sunni schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries. Pillars of iman All the branches of Sunni Islam testify to six principal articles of faith known as the six pillars of imƒÅn (Arabic for \\"faith\\"), which are believed to be essential. These are # Belief in the Oneness of God # Belief in the Angels of God # Belief in the Divine Revelations (Books) # Belief in the Prophets of God # Belief in Resurrection after Death and the Day of Judgment and # Belief in Preordainment (Qadar) These six articles are common that present-day Sunnis agree on, from those who adhere to traditional Sunnism to those who adhere to latter-day movements. Additionally, classical Sunni Islam also outlined numerous other cardinal doctrines from the eighth-century onwards, such as the Creed of TahƒÅwi. However, none of these creeds gained the importance attributed to the Nicene Creed in Christianity. But while most of the tenets outlined in the classical creeds are accepted by all Sunnis, some of these doctrines have been rejected by the aforementioned movements as lacking strictly scriptural precedent. Traditionally, these other important Sunni articles of faith have included the following (those that are controversial today because of their rejection by such groups shall be denoted by an asterisk): * Belief in the six principal articles of faith being essential for salvation for MuslimsAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al-  øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya LXVI * Belief in God having created creation with His wisdomAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XVIII * Belief in Muhammad having been the Seal of the Prophets or the last prophet sent to mankindAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XXIX * Belief in the Qur'an being the eternal, uncreated Word of GodAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XXXIII * Belief in the beatific vision being a reality in the afterlife, even if it will not be all- encompassing and the \\"manner\\" of it remains unknownAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠- ·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XXXV * Belief in the Night Journey of Muhammad having happened in a bodily form, while he was \\"awake\\"Al-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XXXIX * Belief in the intercession of Muhammad being a reality on the Last DayAl- ·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XLI * Belief in God's covenant with Adam and his offspring having been \\"true\\"Al-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XLII * Belief in Abraham having been God's \\"intimate friend\\"Al-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠- ·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya LII * Belief in Moses having conversed directly with God without a mediator * Belief in the idea that wrong works in themselves does not make a Muslim an \\"unbeliever\\" and that it is forbidden to declare takfir on those who know that what they are doing is wrongAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya LVII * Belief in it being wrong to \\"make a distinction\\" between the various prophets of GodAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya LXVII * Belief in believing in that which \\"all the prophets\\" brought from God * Belief in avoiding \\"deviations, divisions, and differences\\" in the fold of IslamAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al-  øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya LXXIII * Belief in venerating all the Companions of MuhammadAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XCIII * Belief in the existence of saints, and in venerating them and accepting the traditional narratives of their lives and miraclesAl-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya XCVIII-IX (*) * Belief that saints, while exalted in their own right, occupy an infinitely lesser rank than the prophets and that \\"one of the prophets is greater than all the saints put together\\" (*) * Belief in the Signs of the ApocalypseAl- ·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwƒ´, Al- øAqƒ´dah a·π≠-·π¨a·∏•ƒÅwiyya C * Belief that Jesus is the Promised Messiah of God and that all Muslims await his Second Coming Theological traditions Some Islamic scholars faced questions that they felt were not explicitly answered in the Qur'an and the Sunnah, especially questions with regard to philosophical conundra such as the nature of God, the existence of human free will, or the eternal existence of the Qur'an. Various schools of theology and philosophy developed to answer these questions, each claiming to be true to the Qur'an and the Muslim tradition (sunnah). Among Sunni Muslims, various schools of thought in theology began to be born out of the sciences of kalƒÅm in opposition to the textualists who stood by affirming texts without delving into philosophical speculation as they saw it as an innovation in Islam. The following were the three dominant schools of theology that grew. All three of these are accepted by Muslims around the globe, and are considered within \\"Islamic orthodoxy\\". The key beliefs of classical Sunni Islam are all agreed upon (being the six pillars of ImƒÅn) and codified in the treatise on Aqeedah by Imam Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-TahƒÅwi in his Aqeedat TahƒÅwiyyah. =Ash'ari= Founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari (873‚Äì935). This theological school of Aqeedah was embraced by many Muslim scholars and developed in parts of the Islamic world throughout history; al-Ghazali wrote on the creed discussing it and agreeing upon some of its principles. Ash'ari theology stresses divine revelation over human reason. Contrary to the Mu'tazilites, they say that ethics cannot be derived from human reason, but that God's commands, as revealed in the Quran and the Sunnah (the practices of Muhammad and his companions as recorded in the traditions, or hadith), are the sole source of all morality and ethics. Regarding the nature of God and the divine attributes, the Ash'ari rejected the Mu'tazili position that all Quranic references to God as having real attributes were metaphorical. The Ash'aris insisted that these attributes were as they \\"best befit His Majesty\\". The Arabic language is a wide language in which one word can have 15 different meanings, so the Ash'aris endeavor to find the meaning that best befits God and is not contradicted by the Quran. Therefore, when God states in the Quran, \\"He who does not resemble any of His creation,\\" this clearly means that God cannot be attributed with body parts because He created body parts. Ash'aris tend to stress divine omnipotence over human free will and they believe that the Quran is eternal and uncreated. =Maturidi= Founded by Abu Mansur al- Maturidi (died 944), the Maturidiyyah was the major tradition in Central AsiaMarl√®ne Laruelle Being Muslim in Central Asia: Practices, Politics, and Identities BRILL, 11.01.2018 p. 21 based on Hanafi-law. It is more influenced by Persian interpretations of Islam and less on the traditions established within Arabian culture.Marl√®ne Laruelle Being Muslim in Central Asia: Practices, Politics, and Identities BRILL, 11.01.2018 p. 21 In contrast to the traditionalistic approach, Maturidism allows to reject hadiths based on reason alone.Rico Isaacs, Alessandro Frigerio Theorizing Central Asian Politics: The State, Ideology and Power Springer, 2018 p. 108 Nevertheless, revelation remains important to inform humans about that is beyond their intellectual limits, such as the concept of an afterlife. Ethics on the other hand, do not need prophecy or revelation, but can be understood by reason alone. One of the tribes, the Seljuk Turks, migrated to Turkey, where later the Ottoman Empire was established. Their preferred school of law achieved a new prominence throughout their whole empire although it continued to be followed almost exclusively by followers of the Hanafi school while followers of the Shafi and Maliki schools within the empire followed the Ash'ari and Athari schools of thought. Thus, wherever can be found Hanafi followers, there can be found the Maturidi creed. =Traditionalist= Traditionalist theology is a movement of Islamic scholars who reject rationalistic Islamic theology (kalam) in favor of strict textualism in interpreting the Quran and sunnah. The name derives from \\"tradition\\" in its technical sense as translation of the Arabic word hadith. It is also sometimes referred to as athari as by several other names. Adherents of traditionalist theology believe that the zahir (literal, apparent) meaning of the Qur'an and the hadith have sole authority in matters of belief and law; and that the use of rational disputation is forbidden even if it verifies the truth. They engage in a literal reading of the Qur'an, as opposed to one engaged in ta'wil (metaphorical interpretation). They do not attempt to conceptualize the meanings of the Qur'an rationally, and believe that their realities should be consigned to God alone (tafwid). In essence, the text of the Qur'an and Hadith is accepted without asking \\"how\\" or \\"Bi-la kaifa\\". Traditionalist theology emerged among scholars of hadith who eventually coalesced into a movement called ahl al-hadith under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. In matters of faith, they were pitted against Mu'tazilites and other theological currents, condemning many points of their doctrine as well as the rationalistic methods they used in defending them. In the tenth century al-Ash'ari and al-Maturidi found a middle ground between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, using the rationalistic methods championed by Mu'tazilites to defend most tenets of the traditionalist doctrine. Although the mainly Hanbali scholars who rejected this synthesis were in the minority, their emotive, narrative-based approach to faith remained influential among the urban masses in some areas, particularly in Abbasid Baghdad. While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni \\"orthodoxy\\", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith. In the modern era it has had a disproportionate impact on Islamic theology, having been appropriated by Wahhabi and other traditionalist Salafi currents and spread well beyond the confines of the Hanbali school of law. Sunni mysticism There has also been a rich tradition of mysticism within Sunni Islam, which has most prominently manifested itself in the principal orders of Sunni Sufism. Historically, Sufism became \\"an incredibly important part of Islam\\" and \\"one of the most widespread and omnipresent aspects of Muslim life\\" in Islamic civilization from the early medieval period onwards, when it began to permeate nearly all major aspects of Sunni Islamic life in regions stretching from India and Iraq to Senegal. Sufism continued to remain a crucial part of daily Islamic life until the twentieth century, when its historical influence upon Islamic civilization began to be combated by the rise of Salafism and Wahhabism.Jonathan A.C. Brown, Misquoting Muhammad (London: Oneworld Publications, 2015), p. 254 Islamic scholar Timothy Winter has remarked: \\"[In] classical, mainstream, medieval Sunni Islam ... [the idea of] 'orthodox Islam' would not ... [have been possible] without Sufism,\\" and that the classical belief in Sufism being an essential component of Islam has only weakened in some quarters of the Islamic world \\"a generation or two ago\\" with the rise of Salafism. In the modern world, the classical interpretation of Sunni orthodoxy, which sees in Sufism an essential dimension of Islam alongside the disciplines of jurisprudence and theology, is represented by institutions such as Al-Azhar University and Zaytuna College, with Al-Azhar's current Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb defining \\"Sunni orthodoxy\\" as being a follower \\"of any of the four schools of [legal] thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki or Hanbali) and ... [also] of the Sufism of Imam Junayd of Baghdad in doctrines, manners and [spiritual] purification.\\" In the eleventh-century, Sufism, which had previously been a less \\"codified\\" trend in Islamic piety, began to be \\"ordered and crystallized\\"Seyyed Hossein Nasr, The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ed. William C. Chittick (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2007), p. 76 into orders which have continued until the present day. All these orders were founded by a major Sunni Islamic saint, and some of the largest and most widespread included the Qadiriyya (after Abdul-Qadir Gilani [d. 1166]), the Rifa'iyya (after Ahmed al- Rifa'i [d. 1182]), the Chishtiyya (after Moinuddin Chishti [d. 1236]), the Shadiliyya (after Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili [d. 1258]), and the Naqshbandiyya (after Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari [d. 1389]). Contrary to popular perception in the West,Martin Lings, What is Sufism? (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), p. 16 however, neither the founders of these orders nor their followers ever considered themselves to be anything other than orthodox Sunni Muslims, and in fact all of these orders were attached to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni Islam. Thus, the Qadiriyya order was Hanbali, with its founder, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, being a renowned Hanbali jurist; the Chishtiyya was Hanafi; the Shadiliyya order was Maliki; and the Naqshbandiyya order was Hanafi.Massington, L., Radtke, B., Chittick, W.C., Jong, F. de., Lewisohn, L., Zarcone, Th., Ernst, C, Aubin, Fran√ßoise and J.O.

Heinrichs; q.v. \\"Hanafi,\\" \\"Hanbali,\\" and \\"Maliki,\\" and under \\"mysticism in...\\" for each. Thus, \\"many of the most eminent defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, such as Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Ghazali, and the Sultan ·π¢alƒÅ·∏• ad-Dƒ´n (Saladin) were connected with Sufism.\\"Titus Burckhardt, Introduction to Sufi Doctrine (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2008, p. 4, note 2 The contemporary Salafi and Wahhabi strands of Sunnis, however, do not accept the traditional stance on mystical practices.Jeffrey Halverson, Theology and Creed in Sunni Islam, 2010, p. 48 Sunni view of hadith S√ºleymaniye mosque in Istanbul.

Later generations sought out oral traditions regarding the early history of Islam, and the practices of Muhammad and his first followers, and wrote them down so that they might be preserved. These recorded oral traditions are called hadith.Mufti Taqi Usmani, The Authority of Sunnah, Delhi: Kitab Bhawan, p. 6 Muslim scholars have through the ages sifted through the hadith and evaluated the chain of narrations of each tradition, scrutinizing the trustworthiness of the narrators and judging the strength of each hadith accordingly.Muhammad Mustafa Azmi, \\"Hadith Criticism: History and Methodolgy\\". Studies in Hadith Methodology and Literature, pp. 46-57 =Kutub al-Sittah= Kutub al-Sittah are six books containing collections of hadiths. Sunni Muslims accept the hadith collections of Bukhari and Muslim as the most authentic (sahih), and while accepting all hadiths verified as authentic, grant a slightly lesser status to the collections of other recorders. There are, however, four other collections of hadith that are also held in particular reverence by Sunni Muslims, making a total of six: * Sahih al-Bukhari of Muhammad al-Bukhari * Sahih Muslim of Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj * Sunan al-Sughra of Al-Nasa'i * Sunan Abu Dawud of Abu Dawood * Jami' at-Tirmidhi of Al-Tirmidhi * Sunan Ibn Majah of Ibn Majah There are also other collections of hadith which also contain many authentic hadith and are frequently used by scholars and specialists.

The term Sikh has its origin in the word ' (), meaning 'disciple' or 'student'. According to Article I of the Sikh Rehat Maryada ('code of conduct'), a Sikh is:. > Any human being who faithfully believes in One Immortal Being; eleven gurus, > from Guru Nanak to Guru Granth Sahib; the teachings of the 6 Gurus, 15 > bhagats, 11 bhatts, 4 Gursikhs and the baptism bequeathed by the tenth Guru. Male Sikhs generally have Singh ('lion') as their middle or last name, though not all Singhs are necessarily Sikhs; likewise, female Sikhs have Kaur ('princess') as their middle or last name. Sikhs who have undergone the Khan·∏çe-kƒ´-Pahul ('baptism by Khanda') which is an initiation ceremony know as Amrit are from the day of their initiation known as Khalsa Amritdhari Sikhs, and they must at all times have on their bodies five Ks: # kesh, uncut hair, which is kept covered usually by a turban; # kara, an iron or steel bracelet; # kirpan, a dagger-like sword tucked into a gatra strap or a kamal kasar belt; # kachera, a cotton undergarment; and # kanga, a small wooden comb. The Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent has been the historic homeland of the Sikhs, having even been ruled by the Sikhs for significant parts of the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the Punjab state in northwest India has a majority Sikh population, and sizeable communities of Sikhs exist around the world. Many countries, such as the United Kingdom, recognize Sikhs as a designated religion on their censuses, and, as of 2020, Sikhs are considered as a separate ethnic group in the United States. History Gurdwara Janam Asthan, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Guru Nanak (1469-1539), the founder of Sikhism, was born to Mehta Kalu and Mata Tripta in the village of Talwandi, present-day Nankana Sahib, near Lahore. Throughout his life, Guru Nanak was a religious leader and social reformer. However, Sikh political history may be said to begin in 1606 with the death of the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan Dev. Religious practices were formalised by Guru Gobind Singh on 30 March 1699, when the Guru initiated five people from a variety of social backgrounds, known as the Panj Piare (\\"beloved five\\") to form a collective body of initiated Sikhs, known as the Khalsa (\\"pure\\"). During the rule of the Mughal Empire in India (1556‚Äì1707), several Sikh gurus were killed by the Mughals for opposing their persecution of minority religious communities, including Sikhs. The Sikhs subsequently militarized to oppose Mughal rule. Samadhi of Emperor Ranjit Singh in Lahore, Pakistan Golden Temple A Sikh Khalsa Army sowar's battle helmet After defeating the Afghans and Mughals, sovereign states called Misls were formed under Jassa Singh Ahluwalia. The Confederacy of these states would be unified and transformed into the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh Bahadur. This era would be characterised by religious tolerance and pluralism, including Christians, Muslims, and Hindus in positions of power. Its secular administration implemented military, economic, and governmental reforms. The empire is considered the zenith of political Sikhism, encompassing Kashmir, Ladakh, and Peshawar. Hari Singh Nalwa, the commander-in-chief of the Sikh Khalsa Army in the North West Frontier, expanded the confederacy to the Khyber Pass. = British rule = left After the annexation of the Sikh kingdom by the British, the latter would begin recruiting from that area once recognizing the martial qualities of the Sikhs and Punjabis in general. During the 1857 Indian mutiny, the Sikhs stayed loyal to the British, resulting in heavy recruitment from Punjab to the colonial army for the next 90 years of the British Raj. The distinct turban that differentiates a Sikh from other turban wearers is a relic of the rules of the British Indian Army. The British colonial rule saw the emergence of many reform movements in India, including Punjab, such as the formation of the First and Second Singh Sabha in 1873 and 1879 respectively. The Sikh leaders of the Singh Sabha worked to offer a clear definition of Sikh identity and tried to purify Sikh belief and practice. The later years of British colonial rule saw the emergence of the Akali movement to bring reform in the gurdwaras during the early 1920s. The movement led to the introduction of Sikh Gurdwara Bill in 1925, which placed all the historical Sikh shrines in India under the control of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. = Partition and post-Partition = The months leading up to the 1947 partition of India were marked by conflict in the Punjab between Sikhs and Muslims. This caused the religious migration of Punjabi Sikhs and Hindus from West Punjab to the east (modern India), mirroring a simultaneous religious migration of Punjabi Muslims from East Punjab to the west (modern Pakistan). The 1960s saw growing animosity between Sikhs and Hindus in India, with the Sikhs demanding the creation of a Punjabi state on a linguistic basis similar to other states in India. This was promised to Sikh leader Master Tara Singh by Jawaharlal Nehru, in return for Sikh political support during negotiations for Indian independence. Although the Sikhs obtained the Punjab, they lost Hindi-speaking areas to Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan. In 1966, on the first of November, Chandigarh was made a union territory and the capital of Punjab and Haryana. Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale triggered violence in the Punjab, resulting in then-prime minister Indira Gandhi ordering an operation to remove Bhindranwale from the Golden Temple in Operation Blue Star. This would subsequently lead to Gandhi's assassination by her Sikh bodyguards. Her assassination would be followed by an explosion of violence against Sikh communities and the killing of thousands of Sikhs throughout India. Since 1984, relations between Sikhs and Hindus have moved toward a rapprochement aided by economic prosperity. During the day of Vaisakhi in 1999, Sikhs worldwide celebrated the 300th anniversary of the creation of the Khalsa. Canada Post honoured Sikh Canadians with a commemorative stamp in conjunction with the anniversary. Likewise, on 9 April 1999 Indian president K. R. Narayanan issued a stamp commemorating the 300th anniversary of the Khalsa as well. In 2004, Manmohan Singh became the first Sikh Prime Minister of India, and first Sikh Head of government in the world. Culture and religious observations =Daily routine= From the Guru Granth Sahib: =Five Ks= Kanga, Kara and Kirpan: three of the five Sikh articles of faith The five Ks (panj kakaar) are five articles of faith which all baptized (Amritdhari) Sikhs are obliged to wear. The symbols represent the ideals of Sikhism: honesty, equality, fidelity, meditating on Waheguru, and never bowing to tyranny. The five symbols are: #Kesh: Uncut hair, usually tied and wrapped in a dastar #Kanga: A wooden comb, usually worn under a dastar to always also keep one's hair clean and well groomed. #Kachera: Cotton undergarments, Worn by both sexes, the kachera is a symbol of chastity, also historically appropriate in battle due to increased mobility when compared to a dhoti. #Kara: An iron bracelet, a symbol of eternity, strength and a constant reminder for strength of will to keep hands away from any kind of unethical practices. #Kirpan: An iron sword/dagger in different sizes. In the UK, Sikhs can wear a small dagger, but in the Punjab they might wear a traditional curved sword from one to three feet in length. Kirpan is only a weapon of defense, used to serve humanity and to be used against oppression. =Music and instruments= Woman playing the dilruba The Sikhs have a number of musical instruments, including the rebab, dilruba, taus, jori, and sarinda. Playing the sarangi was encouraged by Guru Hargobind. The rebab was played by Bhai Mardana as he accompanied Guru Nanak on his journeys. The jori and sarinda were introduced to Sikh devotional music by Guru Arjan. The taus (Persian for \\"peacock\\") was designed by Guru Hargobind, who supposedly heard a peacock singing and wanted to create an instrument mimicking its sounds. The dilruba was designed by Guru Gobind Singh at the request of his followers, who wanted a smaller instrument than the taus. After Japji Sahib, all of the shabad in the Guru Granth Sahib were composed as raags. This type of singing is known as Gurmat Sangeet. When they marched into battle, the Sikhs would play a ranjit nagara (\\"victory drum\\") to boost morale. Nagaras (usually two to three feet in diameter, although some were up to five feet in diameter) are played with two sticks. The beat of the large drums, and the raising of the Nishan Sahib, meant that the Singhs were on their way. Demographics India's Sikh population and their percentage of the total population Sikhs number about 25 million worldwide, and approximately 83% of them live in India. About 76% of all Sikhs live in the north Indian State of Punjab, forming the majority (about two-thirds) of the population.Sikhs in Punjab. Globalsecurity.org. Retrieved on 6 October 2011. Substantial communities of Sikhs live in the Indian states or union territories of Chandigarh where they form 13.11% of the population, Haryana (over 1.2 million), Rajasthan, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir. Another substantial community of Sikhs exists within the Canadian province of British Columbia, numbering 0.2 million or 5% of the total population; outside India, it is the only province or state in the world with Sikhism as the second most followed religion among the populace. = Migration = Sikh migration from British India began in earnest during the second half of the 19th century, when the British completed their annexation of the Punjab. The British Raj recruited Sikhs for the Indian Civil Service (particularly the British Indian Army), which led to Sikh migration throughout India and the British Empire. During the Raj, semiskilled Sikh artisans were transported from the Punjab to British East Africa to help build railroads. Sikhs emigrated from India after World War II, most going to the United Kingdom but many to North America. Some Sikhs who had settled in eastern Africa were expelled by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1972. Economics is a major factor in Sikh migration, and significant communities exist in the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, East Africa, Australia, Singapore and Thailand. Due to this, Canada is the country that has the highest number of Sikhs in proportion to the population in the world at 1.4 per cent of Canada's total population. Map showing world Sikh population areas and historical migration patterns (2004 estimate) After the Partition of India in 1947, many Sikhs from what would become the Punjab of Pakistan migrated to India as well as to Afghanistan in fear of persecution. Afghanistan was home to hundreds of thousands of Sikhs and Hindus as of the 1970s, but due to the wars in Afghanistan by the 2010s the vast majority of Afghan Sikhs had migrated to India, Pakistan or the west. Although the rate of Sikh migration from the Punjab has remained high, traditional patterns of Sikh migration favouring English-speaking countries (particularly the United Kingdom) have changed during the past decade due to stricter immigration laws. Moliner (2006) wrote that as a consequence of Sikh migration to the UK becoming \\"virtually impossible since the late 1970s,\\" migration patterns evolved to continental Europe. Italy is a rapidly growing destination for Sikh migration, with Reggio Emilia and Vicenza having significant Sikh population clusters. Italian Sikhs are generally involved in agriculture, agricultural processing, the manufacture of machine tools, and horticulture. Johnson and Barrett (2004) estimate that the global Sikh population increases annually by 392,633 (1.7% per year, based on 2004 figures); this percentage includes births, deaths, and conversions. Primarily for socio-economic reasons, Indian Sikhs have the lowest adjusted growth rate of any major religious group in India, at 16.9 percent per decade (estimated from 1991 to 2001). The Sikh population has the lowest gender balance in India, with only 903 women per 1,000 men according to the 2011 Indian census. =Castes= Since Sikhism has never actively sought converts, Sikhs have remained a relatively homogeneous ethnic group. Caste is still practiced in the Sikh community, despite Guru Nanak's calls for treating everyone equally in Sri Granth Sahib. As such, Sikhs comprise a number of sub- ethnic groups. Along with Guru Nanak, other Sikh Gurus had also denounced the hierarchy of the caste system, however, they all belonged to the same caste, the Khatris.id Over 60% of Sikhs belong to the Jat ( Jatt) caste, traditionally agrarian in occupation. Despite being very small in numbers, the mercantile Khatri and Arora castes also wield considerable influence within the Sikh community. Other common Sikh castes include Ahluwalias (brewers), Kambojs or Kambos (rural caste), Ramgarhias (artisans), Rajputs (kshatriyas), Sainis (kshatriyas), Rai Sikh (rural caste), Labanas (merchants), and Kumhars, as well as the two Dalit castes known in Sikh terminology as the Mazhabi and the Ravidasias. Some Sikhs belonging to the landowning dominant castes have especially not shed all their prejudices against the Dalits. While Dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras but in some gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar (communal meal). Therefore, wherever they could mobilize resources, the Sikh Dalits of Punjab have tried to construct their own gurdwara and other local level institutions in order to attain a certain degree of cultural autonomy. In 1953, Sikh leader and activist, Master Tara Singh, succeeded in persuading the Indian government to include Sikh castes of the converted untouchables in the list of scheduled castes.Puri, Harish K. (2003). \\"The Scheduled Castes in the Sikh Community: A Historical Perspective\\". Economic & Political Weekly 38(26):2693‚Äì701. . Republished in Dalits in Regional Context (2004). . In the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, 20 of the 140 seats are reserved for low-caste Sikhs. Other castes (over 1,000 members) include the Arain, Bhatra, Bairagi, Bania, Basith, Bawaria, Bazigar, Bhabra, Chamar, Chhimba (cotton farmers), Darzi, Dhobi, Gujar, Jhinwar, Kahar, Kalal, Kumhar, Lohar, Mahtam, Megh, Mirasi, Mochi, Mohyal, Nai, Ramgarhia, Sansi, Sudh, Tarkhan, and Kashyap. The 3HO organisation claim to have inspired a moderate growth in non-Indian adherents of Sikhism. In 1998, an estimated 7,800 3HO Sikhs, known colloquially as gora () Sikhs, were mainly centred around Espa√±ola, New Mexico, and Los Angeles, California. = Diaspora = A Sikh temple, Nanaksar Gurudwara, in Richmond, British Columbia During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Sikhs began to emigrate to East Africa, the Far East, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1907 the Khalsa Diwan Society was established in Vancouver, and four years later the first gurdwara was established in London. In 1912 the first gurdwara in the United States was founded in Stockton, California. There was a large Sikh immigration to Canada. While Sikhs were temporarily disenfranchised several decades ago, currently 17 of the 338 Canadian legislators are Sikhs, which is disproportionately higher than their share of the total Canadian population. Sikhs in Toronto celebrating Vaisakhi, the birth of the Khalsa As Sikhs wear turbans and keep beards (among other physical similarities to Middle Eastern men), Sikh men in Western countries have been mistaken for Muslim, Arabic, and/or Afghan since the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War. Several days after the 9/11 attacks, Sikh-American gas station owner Balbir Singh Sodhi was murdered in Arizona by a man who took Sodhi to be a member of al-Qaeda, marking the first recorded hate-crime in America motivated by 9/11. CNN would go on to suggest an increase in hate crimes against Sikh men in the US and the UK after the 9/11 attacks. In an attempt to foster Sikh leaders in the Western world, youth initiatives by a number of organisations exist. The Sikh Youth Alliance of North America sponsors an annual Sikh Youth Symposium, a public- speaking and debate competition held in gurdwaras throughout the US and Canada. The Sikh diaspora has been most successful in North America, and UK Sikhs have the highest percentage of home ownership (82%) of any religious community. UK Sikhs are the second-wealthiest religious group in the UK (after the Jewish community), with a median total household wealth of . In May 2019, the UK government exempted \\"Kirpan\\" from the list of banned knives. The U.K. government has passed an amendment by which Sikhs in the country will be allowed to carry kirpans and use it during religious and cultural functions. The bill had been amended late last year to ensure that it would not impact the right of the British Sikh community to possess and supply kirpans, or religious swords. Similarly, the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund overturned a 1925 Oregon law banning the wearing of turbans by teachers and government officials.Sikh Teachers Are Now Able to Teach in Oregon Public Schools ¬´ SALDEF. Saldef.org (2 April 2010). Retrieved on 6 October 2011. =Agriculture= Historically, most Indians have been farmers and 66 per cent of the Indian population are engaged in agriculture. Indian Sikhs are employed in agriculture to a lesser extent; India's 2001 census found 39 per cent of the working population of the Punjab employed in this sector. According to the Swedish political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmad, a factor in the success of the Indian green revolution was the \\"Sikh cultivator, often the Jat, whose courage, perseverance, spirit of enterprise and muscle prowess proved crucial.\\" However, Indian physicist Vandana Shiva wrote that the green revolution made the \\"negative and destructive impacts of science [i.e. the green revolution] on nature and society\\" invisible, and was a catalyst for Punjabi Sikh and Hindu tensions despite a growth in material wealth.  Notable Sikhs in modern history  Manmohan Singh is an Indian economist, academic, and politician who served as the 13th Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014. The first Sikh in office, Singh was also the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five- year term. In the United States, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations and former governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley, was born and raised as a Sikh, but converted to Christianity after her marriage. She still actively attends both Sikh and Christian services. Notable Sikhs in science include nuclear scientist Piara Singh Gill, who worked on the Manhattan Project; fibre-optics pioneer Narinder Singh Kapany; and physicist, science writer and broadcaster Simon Singh. In business, the UK-based clothing retailers New Look and the Thai-based JASPAL were founded by Sikhs. India's largest pharmaceutical company, Ranbaxy Laboratories, is headed by Sikhs. Apollo Tyres is headed by Onkar Singh Kanwar. In Singapore Kartar Singh Thakral expanded his family's trading business, Thakral Holdings, into total assets of almost and is Singapore's 25th-richest person. Sikh Bob Singh Dhillon is the first Indo-Canadian billionaire. Mastercard CEO is a Sikh named Ajaypal Singh Banga In sports, Sikhs include England cricketer Monty Panesar; former 400-metre runner Milkha Singh; his son, professional golfer Jeev Milkha Singh; Indian wrestler and actor Dara Singh; former Indian hockey team captains Sandeep Singh, Ajitpal Singh and Balbir Singh Sr.; former Indian cricket captain Bishen Singh Bedi; Harbhajan Singh, India's most successful off spin cricket bowler; Yuvraj Singh, World Cup winning allrounder; Maninder Singh, World Cup winning off spinner; and Navjot Singh Sidhu, former Indian cricketer-turned-politician.

The Indian government does not release religious or ethnic origins of the military personnel, but a 1991 report by Tim McGirk estimated that 20% of Indian Army officers were Sikhs. Together with the Gurkhas recruited from Nepal, the Maratha Light Infantry from Maharashtra and the Jat Regiment, the Sikhs are one of the few communities to have exclusive regiments in the Indian Army. The Sikh Regiment is one of the most-decorated regiments in the army, with 73 Battle Honours, 14 Victoria Crosses, 21 first- class Indian Orders of Merit (equivalent to the Victoria Cross), 15 Theatre Honours, 5 COAS Unit Citations, two Param Vir Chakras, 14 Maha Vir Chakras, 5 Kirti Chakras, 67 Vir Chakras, and 1,596 other awards. The highest-ranking general in the history of the Indian Air Force is a Punjabi Sikh, Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh. Plans by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence for a Sikh infantry regiment were scrapped in June 2007. Sikhs supported the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. By the beginning of World War I, Sikhs in the British Indian Army totaled over 100,000 (20 per cent of the force). Until 1945 fourteen Victoria Crosses (VC) were awarded to Sikhs, a per-capita regimental record. In 2002 the names of all Sikh VC and George Cross recipients were inscribed on the monument of the Memorial Gates on Constitution Hill, next to Buckingham Palace. Chanan Singh Dhillon was instrumental in campaigning for the memorial. During World War I, Sikh battalions fought in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Gallipoli and France. Six battalions of the Sikh Regiment were raised during World War II, serving in the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Burma and Italian campaigns and in Iraq and receiving 27 battle honours. Around the world, Sikhs are commemorated in Commonwealth cemeteries.  Sikh nationalism and the Khalistan movement  The Khalistan movement is a Sikh separatist movement, which seeks to create a separate country called KhalistƒÅn (\\"The Land of the Khalsa\\") in the Punjab region of South Asia to serve as a homeland for Sikhs. The territorial definition of the proposed country Khalistan consists of both the Punjab, India, along with Punjab, Pakistan, and includes parts of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Rajasthan.The foreign policy of Pakistan: ethnic impacts on diplomacy, 1971-1994 - Mehtab Ali Shah \\"Such is the political, psychological and religious attachment of the Sikhs to that city that a Khalistan without Lahore would be like a Germany without Berlin.\\"Amritsar to Lahore: A Journey Across the India-Pakistan Border - Stephen Alter \\"Ever since the separatist movement gathered force in the 1980s, Pakistan has sided with the Sikhs, the territorial ambitions of Khalistan have at times included Chandigarh, sections of the Indian Punjab, including whole North India and some parts of western states of India.\\" Khalistan movement began as an expatriate venture. In 1971, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in an advertisement published in the New York Times by an expat Jagjit Singh Chohan. By proclaiming the formation of Khalistan he was able to collect millions of dollars from the Sikh diaspora. On 12 April 1980 he declared the formation of \\"National Council of Khalistan\\", at Anandpur Sahib. He declared himself as the President of the Council and Balbir Singh Sandhu as its Secretary General. In May 1980, Jagjit Singh Chohan traveled to London and announced the formation of Khalistan. A similar announcement was made by Balbir Singh Sandhu, in Amritsar, who released stamps and currency of Khalistan. The inaction of the authorities in Amritsar and elsewhere was decried by Akali Dal headed by the Sikh leader Harchand Singh Longowal as a political stunt by the Congress(I) party of Indira Gandhi. Sikhs in London protesting against Indian government actions With financial and political support of the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab, which has a Sikh-majority population and reached its zenith in the late 1970s and 1980s when the secessionist movement caused large scale violence among the local population. Operation Blue Star was an Indian military operation carried out between 1 and 8 June 1984, ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex in Amritsar, Punjab. In July 1983, the Sikh political party Akali Dal's President Harchand Singh Longowal had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence in Golden Temple Complex to evade arrest.Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume II: 1839-2004, New Delhi, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 337. Bhindranwale later on made the sacred temple complex an armoury and headquarters. In the violent events leading up to the Operation Blue Star since the inception of Akali Dharm Yudh Morcha, the militants had killed 165 Hindus and Nirankaris, even 39 Sikhs opposed to Bhindranwale were killed. The total number of deaths was 410 in violent incidents and riots while 1,180 people were injured. Casualty figures for the Army were 83 dead and 249 injured. According to the official estimate presented by the Indian government, 1592 were apprehended and there were 493 combined militant and civilian casualties. High civilian casualties were attributed to militants using pilgrims trapped inside the temple as human shields. Assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and bombing of Air India plane killing 328 passengers by Sikhs happened in the aftermath. Various pro-Khalistan outfits have been involved in a separatist movement against the Government of India ever since. There are claims of funding from Sikhs outside India to attract young people into these pro-Khalistan militant groups. In January 1986, the Golden Temple was occupied by militants belonging to All India Sikh Students Federation and Damdami Taksal.Sikh Temple Sit-In Is a Challenge for Punjab, The New York Times 2 February 1986 On 26 January 1986, a gathering known as the Sarbat Khalsa (a de facto parliament) passed a resolution (gurmattƒÅ) favouring the creation of Khalistan. Subsequently, a number of rebel militant groups in favour of Khalistan waged a major insurgency against the government of India. Indian security forces suppressed the insurgency in the early 1990s, but Sikh political groups such as the Khalsa Raj Party and SAD (A) continued to pursue an independent Khalistan through non-violent means. Pro-Khalistan organisations such as Dal Khalsa (International) are also active outside India, supported by a section of the Sikh diaspora. In the 1990s the insurgency petered out, and the movement failed to reach its objective due to multiple reasons including a heavy police crackdown on separatists, divisions among the Sikhs and loss of support from the Sikh population. Art and culture Opaque watercolour-on-paper Nakashi art; about 1880, by an unknown artist from Lahore or Amritsar, and used to decorate the walls of Harmandir Sahib Darbar Sahib, circa 1870 Sikh art and culture are nearly synonymous with that of the Punjab, and Sikhs are easily recognised by their distinctive turban (Dastar). The Punjab has been called India's melting pot, due to the confluence of invading cultures from the rivers from which the region gets its name. Sikh culture is therefore a synthesis of cultures. Sikhism has forged a unique architecture, which S. S. Bhatti described as \\"inspired by Guru Nanak's creative mysticism\\" and \\"is a mute harbinger of holistic humanism based on pragmatic spirituality\\". The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs \\"self-identify as an 'ethnic minority'\\" and believe \\"that they are more than just a religion\\". During the Mughal and Afghan persecution of the Sikhs during the 17th and 18th centuries, the latter were concerned with preserving their religion and gave little thought to art and culture. With the rise of Ranjit Singh and the Sikh Raj in Lahore and Delhi, there was a change in the landscape of art and culture in the Punjab; Hindus and Sikhs could build decorated shrines without the fear of destruction or looting. The Sikh Confederacy was the catalyst for a uniquely Sikh form of expression, with Ranjit Singh commissioning forts, palaces, bungas (residential places) and colleges in a Sikh style. Sikh architecture is characterised by gilded fluted domes, cupolas, kiosks, stone lanterns, ornate balusters and square roofs. A pinnacle of Sikh style is Harmandir Sahib (also known as the Golden Temple) in Amritsar. Sikh culture is influenced by militaristic motifs (with the Khanda the most obvious), and most Sikh artifacts‚Äîexcept for the relics of the Gurus‚Äîhave a military theme. This theme is evident in the Sikh festivals of Hola Mohalla and Vaisakhi, which feature marching and displays of valor. Although the art and culture of the Sikh diaspora have merged with that of other Indo-immigrant groups into categories like \\"British Asian\\", \\"Indo- Canadian\\" and \\"Desi-Culture\\", a minor cultural phenomenon which can be described as \\"political Sikh\\" has arisen. The art of diaspora Sikhs like Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra and Amrit and Rabindra Kaur Singh (the \\"Singh Twins\\") is influenced by their Sikhism and current affairs in the Punjab. Bhangra and Giddha are two forms of Punjabi folk dancing which have been adapted and pioneered by Sikhs. Punjabi Sikhs have championed these forms of expression worldwide, resulting in Sikh culture becoming linked to Bhangra (although \\"Bhangra is not a Sikh institution but a Punjabi one\\"). =Painting= Sikh painting is a direct offshoot of the Kangra school of painting. In 1810, Ranjeet Singh (1780‚Äì1839) occupied Kangra Fort and appointed Sardar Desa Singh Majithia his governor of the Punjab hills. In 1813 the Sikh army occupied Guler State, and Raja Bhup Singh became a vassal of the Sikhs. With the Sikh kingdom of Lahore becoming the paramount power, some of the Pahari painters from Guler migrated to Lahore for the patronage of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh and his Sardars. The Sikh school adapted Kangra painting to Sikh needs and ideals. Its main subjects are the ten Sikh gurus and stories from Guru Nanak's Janamsakhis. The tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, left a deep impression on the followers of the new faith because of his courage and sacrifices. Hunting scenes and portraits are also common in Sikh painting.

Written by Basic Role-Playing and RuneQuest author Steve Perrin, Superworld began as one third of the Worlds of Wonder product, which also included a generic fantasy setting, \\"Magic World\\", and a generic science fiction setting, \\"Future World\\", all using the same core Basic Role-Playing rules. Only Superworld became a game in its own right. Game system Superworld is based on the traditional Chaosium Basic Role-Playing system augmented by super-powers. Seven characteristics (Strength, Constitution, Size, Intelligence, Power, Dexterity, Appearance) are rolled with dice (2D6+6, rather than the 3d6 used for many other Basic Role-Playing games.) The sum of these characteristics gives a total of Hero Points used to buy super powers. The super powers system follows the Champions model of powers that are described by their effects. For example, one does not buy \\"Laser Vision\\", but the effect \\"Energy Blast\\" and specifies that it is a laser emitted by the hero's eyes. Each effect can be modified by Advantages (less energy expenditure, for example) or Disadvantages (reduced number of uses, for example) which increase or reduce the cost of a power. Hero Points can also be used to buy skills or increase characteristics. It is possible to get more Hero Points for character creation by choosing Disabilities for the character, such as Public Identity, Vulnerability to a Substance, Psychological Problems, etc. More Hero Points would be awarded for experience at the end of a game session. The system functions in the same way as the other Basic Role-Playing games, by rolling percentile dice against skills. Lower rolls than needed can cause increased effect from Specials (equivalent to Impales in RuneQuest), or Criticals, and high rolls can cause critical failures (Fumbles). Combat rules have many options and take into account three types of energy for damage: Kinetic, Electric, and Radiation. Game materials The game box contains three rules booklets, a booklet of character sheets, a booklet of tables for the Gamemaster, a page of cardboard figure silhouettes to be cut out, and a set 6, 8, and 20-sided dice. Printings from 1984 also contain a 4-page booklet of errata. * The \\"Superheroes Book\\" (32 pages) contains character creation rules, the game system itself, and two character sheets with a male and female standing silhouette. * The \\"Superpowers Book\\" (40 pages) describes the Powers available to the characters, Advantages and Disadvantages that can be applied to them, and Disabilities that can affect the character. The interior covers have two more character sheets, this time with silhouettes of a male and female in flight. * The \\"Gamemasters Book\\" (40 pages) advises the GM on various aspects of a campaign, the legal system, animals, and the creation of organizations adapted to a superhero universe, with three specific examples: FIRE for Free Investigatory Research Enterprise, FORCE for Federal Organization for the Registration and Certification of Exotics, and the Omega Institute. The \\"Gamemasters Book\\" also includes two scenarios: \\"Deadly Devices of Doctor Dread\\", which pits a team of heroes against the Dr. Dread of the title and his subordinates, and \\"The Haunting\\", which describes a mysterious and ancient volume desired by a mystical super-villain. Supplements =Bad Medicine for Dr. Drugs= (1984) Scenario. Author: Ken Rolston. Set in a high school, and designed for teenage characters. It comes with six young pregenerated heroes, or lets players use their own. Beginning with the funeral of one of their friends, it sets the heroes on the track of a drug distribution network in their school, directed by the aforementioned Dr. Drugs. It also includes rules for the creation and management of adolescent characters that have just discovered their powers, and a plan of Warren G. Harding High School, though the scenario recommends substituting the school in which the GM and the players studied. =Superworld Companion= (1985) Rules supplement. Many authors: Stephen R. Marsh, Stephen Perrin, Ian Lee Starcher, Anthony Affronti, Jimmy Akin II, William A Barton, Norman Doege, Bruce Dresselhaus, Ray Greer, Zoran Kovacich, George MacDonald, Steve Maurer, Sandy Petersen, Wayne Shaw, John Sullivan‚Äîmost are listed because they provided one or more optional rules. Includes: * new and expanded powers, limitations, and other optional rules * guides for conversion to and from Champions and Villains and Vigilantes * character sheets covering two pages instead of one: with a male or female silhouette * a description of the effects of the climate on the play (natural or caused by powers) * \\"Project Superhero\\", a detailed base (site, plans, personnel) for Superworld and Champions, and rules for Danger Rooms Cover of Trouble for HAVOC = Trouble for HAVOC= (1984) Scenario / Campaign. Authors: Stephen Perrin, Yurek Chodak, Donald Harrington, Charles Huber. A linked collection of three scenarios based on the members of the criminal organization HAVOC. All the characters are presented with characteristics for use with three different systems, Superworld, Champions and Villains & Vigilantes. Each may be played separately, or as part of a campaign. * \\"Crisis At Calliente\\" introduces HAVOC. The heroes are called to dislodge a group of villains from a nuclear reactor. * \\"Return of the Elokians\\" includes a call for help, an earthquake, a confrontation with the villain King Snake, whose henchmen include members of HAVOC, and a lost world cavern occupied by a race facing extinction. * \\"Fourth for Bridge?\\" is set in Antarctica, where several teams of super-beings‚ÄîAmericans, Russians, and a team from HAVOC‚Äîeach try to be the first to the wreck of a spaceship landed in the ice. It is possible to play any team, or even play two or three teams in parallel if there are enough players. Pre-generated characters are proposed for each team but the players are free to substitute their usual characters. Reception Jon Sutherland reviewed Superworld for White Dwarf #51, giving it an overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that \\"This represents an intelligent attempt to provide a playable format for a difficult topic to simulate. The only rules that I have ever seen with anything like this in scope was the Golden Heroes FRP which may soon be available in a modified form from GW.\\" Steve Marsh reviewed Superworld in Ares Magazine #17 and commented that \\"The game is anything but chaotic, but should create change in any gaming group that sees it. It is well done, and worth the price.\\" Crede Lambard reviewed Superworld in Space Gamer No. 70. Lambard commented that \\"Superworld is very good. I doubt that it will ever supplant Champions, but it certainly supplements it . . . especially now that both Hero Games and Chaosium are putting out adventures with stats for both games.\\" Reviews * Different Worlds #33 (March/April, 1984) Wild Cards The Wild Cards series of science fiction books came from a Superworld campaign gamemastered by George R.

He also shared volumes and collaborated with Charles Lamb, Robert Southey, and Charles Lloyd. He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria. His critical work, especially on William Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including \\"suspension of disbelief\\".See J C McKusick '\\"Living Words‚Äù: Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Genesis of the OED', Modern Philology, 90.1 (1992), which notes that the OED first edition (1884‚Äì1928) cites Coleridge for 3,569 words, many of which he coins. He had a major influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson and American transcendentalism. Throughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated that he had bipolar disorder, which had not been defined during his lifetime.Jamison, Kay Redfield. Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament. Free Press (1994), 219‚Äì224. He was physically unhealthy, which may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with laudanum, which fostered a lifelong opium addiction. Early life and education Coleridge was born on 21 October 1772 in the town of Ottery St Mary in Devon, England.Radley, 13 Samuel's father was the Reverend John Coleridge (1718‚Äì1781), the well-respected vicar of St Mary's Church, Ottery St Mary and was headmaster of the King's School, a free grammar school established by King Henry VIII (1509‚Äì1547) in the town. He had previously been master of Hugh Squier's School in South Molton, Devon, and lecturer of nearby Molland.Unsworth, John, The Early Background of S.T. Coleridge, published in The Coleridge Bulletin, No 1, Summer 1988, pp 16‚Äì25 \\"Lecturer of Molland\\" was an office established and funded by a member of the Courtenay family, lords of the manor of Molland, and involved preaching sermons in Molland Church, possibly also in Knowstone Church adjoining John Coleridge had three children by his first wife. Samuel was the youngest of ten by the Reverend Mr. Coleridge's second wife, Anne Bowden (1726‚Äì1809),James Gillman (2008) The Life of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Bastion Books probably the daughter of John Bowden, Mayor of South Molton, Devon, in 1726.Unsworth, John, The Early Background of S.T. Coleridge, published in The Coleridge Bulletin, No 1, Summer 1988, pp 16‚Äì25 Coleridge suggests that he \\"took no pleasure in boyish sports\\" but instead read \\"incessantly\\" and played by himself.Coleridge, Samuel Taylor, Joseph Noel Paton, Katharine Lee Bates.Coleridge's Ancient Mariner Ed Katharine Lee Bates. Shewell, & Sanborn (1889) p.2 After John Coleridge died in 1781, 8-year-old Samuel was sent to Christ's Hospital, a charity school which was founded in the 16th century in Greyfriars, London, where he remained throughout his childhood, studying and writing poetry. At that school Coleridge became friends with Charles Lamb, a schoolmate, and studied the works of Virgil and William Lisle Bowles.Morley, Henry. Table Talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christabel, &c.; New York: Routledge (1884) pp.i-iv In one of a series of autobiographical letters written to Thomas Poole, Coleridge wrote: \\"At six years old I remember to have read Belisarius, Robinson Crusoe, and Philip Quarll ‚Äì and then I found the Arabian Nights' Entertainments ‚Äì one tale of which (the tale of a man who was compelled to seek for a pure virgin) made so deep an impression on me (I had read it in the evening while my mother was mending stockings) that I was haunted by spectres whenever I was in the dark ‚Äì and I distinctly remember the anxious and fearful eagerness with which I used to watch the window in which the books lay ‚Äì and whenever the sun lay upon them, I would seize it, carry it by the wall, and bask, and read.\\" Coleridge seems to have appreciated his teacher, as he wrote in recollections of his school days in Biographia Literaria: > I enjoyed the inestimable advantage of a very sensible, though at the same > time, a very severe master [...] At the same time that we were studying the > Greek Tragic Poets, he made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and > they were the lessons too, which required most time and trouble to bring up, > so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of > the loftiest, and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its > own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, > more complex, and dependent on more, and more fugitive causes. [...] In our > own English compositions (at least for the last three years of our school > education) he showed no mercy to phrase, metaphor, or image, unsupported by > a sound sense, or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal > force and dignity in plainer words...

Princeton UP, 1985, p. 10. He later wrote of his loneliness at school in the poem Frost at Midnight: \\"With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt/Of my sweet birthplace.\\" From 1791 until 1794, Coleridge attended Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1792, he won the Browne Gold Medal for an ode that he wrote on the slave trade.Radley, 14 In December 1793, he left the college and enlisted in the 15th (The King's) Light Dragoons using the false name \\"Silas Tomkyn Comberbache\\",Holmes, 4 perhaps because of debt or because the girl that he loved, Mary Evans, had rejected him. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later under the reason of \\"insanity\\" and he was readmitted to Jesus College, though he would never receive a degree from the university. Pantisocracy and marriage Mary Matilda Betham, Sara Coleridge (Mrs. Samuel Taylor Coleridge), Portrait miniature, 1809Image of Coleridge, from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and The Vision of Sir Launfal (by Coleridge and James Russell Lowell), published by Sampson Low, 1906. Plaque commemorating Coleridge at St Mary's Church, Ottery St Mary =Cambridge and Somerset= At Jesus College, Coleridge was introduced to political and theological ideas then considered radical, including those of the poet Robert Southey with whom he collaborated on the play The Fall of Robespierre. Coleridge joined Southey in a plan, later abandoned, to found a utopian commune-like society, called Pantisocracy, in the wilderness of Pennsylvania. In 1795, the two friends married sisters Sara and Edith Fricker, in St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, but Coleridge's marriage with Sara proved unhappy. He grew to detest his wife, whom he married mainly because of social constraints. Following the birth of their fourth child, he eventually separated from her. A third sister, Mary, had already married a third poet Robert Lovell and both became partners in Pantisocracy. Lovell also introduced Coleridge and Southey to their future patron Joseph Cottle but died of a fever in April 1796. Coleridge was with him at his death. In 1796 he released his first volume of poems entitled Poems on various subjects, which also included four poems by Charles Lamb as well as a collaboration with Robert Southey and a work suggested by his and Lamb's schoolfriend Robert Favell. Among the poems were Religious Musings, Monody on the Death of Chatterton and an early version of The Eolian Harp entitled Effusion 35. A second edition was printed in 1797, this time including an appendix of works by Lamb and Charles Lloyd, a young poet to whom Coleridge had become a private tutor. In 1796 he also privately printed Sonnets from Various Authors, including sonnets by Lamb, Lloyd, Southey and himself as well as older poets such as William Lisle Bowles. Coleridge made plans to establish a journal, The Watchman, to be printed every eight days to avoid a weekly newspaper tax.Bate, 24 The first issue of the short-lived journal was published in March 1796. It had ceased publication by May of that year.Radley, 16 The years 1797 and 1798, during which he lived in what is now known as Coleridge Cottage, in Nether Stowey, Somerset, were among the most fruitful of Coleridge's life. In 1795, Coleridge met poet William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy. (Wordsworth, having visited him and being enchanted by the surroundings, rented Alfoxton Park, a little over three miles [5 km] away.) Besides The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Coleridge composed the symbolic poem Kubla Khan, written‚ÄîColeridge himself claimed‚Äîas a result of an opium dream, in \\"a kind of a reverie\\"; and the first part of the narrative poem Christabel. The writing of Kubla Khan, written about the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan and his legendary palace at Xanadu, was said to have been interrupted by the arrival of a \\"Person from Porlock\\" ‚Äì an event that has been embellished upon in such varied contexts as science fiction and Nabokov's Lolita. During this period, he also produced his much-praised \\"conversation poems\\" This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, Frost at Midnight, and The Nightingale. In 1798, Coleridge and Wordsworth published a joint volume of poetry, Lyrical Ballads, which proved to be the starting point for the English romantic age. Wordsworth may have contributed more poems, but the real star of the collection was Coleridge's first version of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It was the longest work and drew more praise and attention than anything else in the volume. In the spring Coleridge temporarily took over for Rev. Joshua Toulmin at Taunton's Mary Street Unitarian ChapelWelcome to Taunton's Historic Unitarian Congregation and Chapel (Dec. 2005). Unitarian Chapel, Mary Street, Taunton. Retrieved 21 October 2006. while Rev. Toulmin grieved over the drowning death of his daughter Jane. Poetically commenting on Toulmin's strength, Coleridge wrote in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin, \\"I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin. I suppose you must have heard that his daughter, (Jane, on 15 April 1798) in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between Sidmouth and Bere (Beer). These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian, ‚Äì there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the Heavenly Father.\\" =The West Midlands and the North= Coleridge also worked briefly in Shropshire, where he came in December 1797 as locum to its local Unitarian minister, Dr Rowe, in their church in the High Street at Shrewsbury. He is said to have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner at a literary evening in Mardol. He was then contemplating a career in the ministry, and gave a probationary sermon in High Street church on Sunday, 14 January 1798. William Hazlitt, a Unitarian minister's son, was in the congregation, having walked from Wem to hear him. Coleridge later visited Hazlitt and his father at Wem but within a day or two of preaching he received a letter from Josiah Wedgwood II, who had offered to help him out of financial difficulties with an annuity of ¬£150 (approximately ¬£13,000 in today's money) per year on condition he give up his ministerial career. Coleridge accepted this, to the disappointment of Hazlitt who hoped to have him as a neighbour in Shropshire. From 16 September 1798, Coleridge and the Wordsworths left for a stay in Germany; Coleridge soon went his own way and spent much of his time in university towns. In February 1799 he enrolled at the University of G√∂ttingen, where he attended lectures by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. During this period, he became interested in German philosophy, especially the transcendental idealism and critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and in the literary criticism of the 18th-century dramatist Gotthold Lessing. Coleridge studied German and, after his return to England, translated the dramatic trilogy Wallenstein by the German Classical poet Friedrich Schiller into English. He continued to pioneer these ideas through his own critical writings for the rest of his life (sometimes without attribution), although they were unfamiliar and difficult for a culture dominated by empiricism. In 1799, Coleridge and the Wordsworths stayed at Thomas Hutchinson's farm on the River Tees at Sockburn, near Darlington. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's daughter Sara Coleridge ‚Äì 1830. Portrait by Richard James Lane It was at Sockburn that Coleridge wrote his ballad-poem Love, addressed to Sara Hutchinson. The knight mentioned is the mailed figure on the Conyers tomb in ruined Sockburn church. The figure has a wyvern at his feet, a reference to the Sockburn Worm slain by Sir John Conyers (and a possible source for Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky). The worm was supposedly buried under the rock in the nearby pasture; this was the 'greystone' of Coleridge's first draft, later transformed into a 'mount'. The poem was a direct inspiration for John Keats' famous poem La Belle Dame Sans Merci.The Conyers falchion (a broad, short medieval sword) is traditionally presented to incoming Bishops of Durham, as they ride across the bridge at Croft. Coleridge's early intellectual debts, besides German idealists like Kant and critics like Lessing, were first to William Godwin's Political Justice, especially during his Pantisocratic period, and to David Hartley's Observations on Man, which is the source of the psychology which is found in Frost at Midnight. Hartley argued that one becomes aware of sensory events as impressions, and that \\"ideas\\" are derived by noticing similarities and differences between impressions and then by naming them. Connections resulting from the coincidence of impressions create linkages, so that the occurrence of one impression triggers those links and calls up the memory of those ideas with which it is associated (See Dorothy Emmet, \\"Coleridge and Philosophy\\"). Coleridge was critical of the literary taste of his contemporaries, and a literary conservative insofar as he was afraid that the lack of taste in the ever growing masses of literate people would mean a continued desecration of literature itself. In 1800, he returned to England and shortly thereafter settled with his family and friends in Greta Hall at Keswick in the Lake District of Cumberland to be near Grasmere, where Wordsworth had moved. He was a houseguest of the Wordsworths' for eighteen months, but was a difficult houseguest, as his dependency on laudanum grew and his frequent nightmares would wake the children. He was also a fussy eater, to Dorothy Wordsworth's frustration, who had to cook. For example, not content with salt, Coleridge sprinkled cayenne pepper on his eggs, which he ate from a teacup. His marital problems, nightmares, illnesses, increased opium dependency, tensions with Wordsworth, and a lack of confidence in his poetic powers fuelled the composition of Dejection: An Ode and an intensification of his philosophical studies. In 1802, Coleridge took a nine-day walking holiday in the fells of the Lake District. Coleridge is credited with the first recorded descent of Scafell to Mickledore via Broad Stand, although this was more due to his getting lost than a keenness for mountaineering. Later life and increasing drug use Coleridge at age 42, portrait by Washington Allston =Travel and The Friend= In 1804, he travelled to Sicily and Malta, working for a time as Acting Public Secretary of Malta under the Civil Commissioner, Alexander Ball, a task he performed quite successfully. He lived in San Anton Palace in the village of Attard. He gave this up and returned to England in 1806. Dorothy Wordsworth was shocked at his condition upon his return. From 1807 to 1808, Coleridge returned to Malta and then travelled in Sicily and Italy, in the hope that leaving Britain's damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium. Thomas De Quincey alleges in his Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict, using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth. It has been suggested that this reflects De Quincey's own experiences more than Coleridge's. His opium addiction (he was using as much as two quarts of laudanum a week) now began to take over his life: he separated from his wife Sara in 1808, quarrelled with Wordsworth in 1810, lost part of his annuity in 1811, and put himself under the care of Dr. Daniel in 1814. His addiction caused severe constipation, which required regular and humiliating enemas.Holmes, Richard. Coleridge: Darker Reflections, London: HarperCollins, 1998, pp. 12‚Äì14 (quoting Coleridge \\"Notebooks\\" 2805). In 1809, Coleridge made his second attempt to become a newspaper publisher with the publication of the journal entitled The Friend. It was a weekly publication that, in Coleridge's typically ambitious style, was written, edited, and published almost entirely single-handedly. Given that Coleridge tended to be highly disorganised and had no head for business, the publication was probably doomed from the start. Coleridge financed the journal by selling over five hundred subscriptions, over two dozen of which were sold to members of Parliament, but in late 1809, publication was crippled by a financial crisis and Coleridge was obliged to approach \\"Conversation Sharp\\",For an appraisal of Sharp's role in Coleridge's career, see Knapman, D. (2004) Conversation Sharp: the Biography of a London Gentleman, Richard Sharp (1759‚Äì1835), in Letters, Prose and Verse. [Private Publication]. (Held by British Library) Tom Poole and one or two other wealthy friends for an emergency loan to continue. The Friend was an eclectic publication that drew upon every corner of Coleridge's remarkably diverse knowledge of law, philosophy, morals, politics, history, and literary criticism. Although it was often turgid, rambling, and inaccessible to most readers, it ran for 25 issues and was republished in book form a number of times. Years after its initial publication, a revised and expanded edition of The Friend, with added philosophical content including his 'Essays on the Principles of Method', became a highly influential work and its effect was felt on writers and philosophers from John Stuart Mill to Ralph Waldo Emerson. =London: final years and death= Blue plaque, 7 Addison Bridge Place, West Kensington, London Between 1810 and 1820, Coleridge gave a series of lectures in London and Bristol ‚Äì those on Shakespeare renewed interest in the playwright as a model for contemporary writers. Much of Coleridge's reputation as a literary critic is founded on the lectures that he undertook in the winter of 1810‚Äì11, which were sponsored by the Philosophical Institution and given at Scot's Corporation Hall off Fetter Lane, Fleet Street. These lectures were heralded in the prospectus as \\"A Course of Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton, in Illustration of the Principles of Poetry.\\" Coleridge's ill-health, opium-addiction problems, and somewhat unstable personality meant that all his lectures were plagued with problems of delays and a general irregularity of quality from one lecture to the next. As a result of these factors, Coleridge often failed to prepare anything but the loosest set of notes for his lectures and regularly entered into extremely long digressions which his audiences found difficult to follow. However, it was the lecture on Hamlet given on 2 January 1812 that was considered the best and has influenced Hamlet studies ever since. Before Coleridge, Hamlet was often denigrated and belittled by critics from Voltaire to Dr. Johnson. Coleridge rescued the play's reputation, and his thoughts on it are often still published as supplements to the text. In 1812 he allowed Robert Southey to make use of extracts from his vast number of private notebooks in their collaboration Omniana; Or, Horae Otiosiores. In August 1814, Coleridge was approached by Lord Byron's publisher, John Murray, about the possibility of translating Goethe's classic Faust (1808). Coleridge was regarded by many as the greatest living writer on the demonic and he accepted the commission, only to abandon work on it after six weeks. Until recently, scholars were in agreement that Coleridge never returned to the project, despite Goethe's own belief in the 1820s that he had in fact completed a long translation of the work. In September 2007, Oxford University Press sparked a heated scholarly controversy by publishing an English translation of Goethe's work that purported to be Coleridge's long-lost masterpiece (the text in question first appeared anonymously in 1821).The debate is being followed at a dedicated page on . Between 1814 and 1816, Coleridge lived in Calne, Wiltshire and seemed able to focus on his work and manage his addiction, drafting Biographia Literaria. He rented rooms from a local surgeon, Mr Page, on Church Street, just opposite the entrance to the churchyard. A blue plaque marks the property today. In April 1816, Coleridge, with his addiction worsening, his spirits depressed, and his family alienated, took residence in the Highgate homes, then just north of London, of the physician James Gillman, first at South Grove and later at the nearby 3 The Grove.Holmes (1998), p.429. It is unclear whether his growing use of opium (and the brandy in which it was dissolved) was a symptom or a cause of his growing depression. Gillman was partially successful in controlling the poet's addiction. Coleridge remained in Highgate for the rest of his life, and the house became a place of literary pilgrimage for writers including Carlyle and Emerson. In Gillman's home, Coleridge finished his major prose work, the Biographia Literaria (mostly drafted in 1815, and finished in 1817), a volume composed of 23 chapters of autobiographical notes and dissertations on various subjects, including some incisive literary theory and criticism. He composed a considerable amount of poetry, of variable quality. He published other writings while he was living at the Gillman homes, notably the Lay Sermons of 1816 and 1817, Sibylline Leaves (1817), Hush (1820), Aids to Reflection (1825), and On the Constitution of the Church and State (1830). He also produced essays published shortly after his death, such as Essay on Faith (1838) and Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit (1840). A number of his followers were central to the Oxford Movement, and his religious writings profoundly shaped Anglicanism in the mid-nineteenth century.See Luke S. H. Wright, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Anglican Church (Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 2010). Coleridge also worked extensively on the various manuscripts which form his \\"Opus Maximum\\", a work which was in part intended as a post-Kantian work of philosophical synthesis.See Peter Cheyne, Coleridge's Contemplative Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020). The work was never published in his lifetime, and has frequently been seen as evidence for his tendency to conceive grand projects which he then had difficulty in carrying through to completion. But while he frequently berated himself for his \\"indolence\\", the long list of his published works calls this myth into question. Critics are divided on whether the \\"Opus Maximum\\", first published in 2002, successfully resolved the philosophical issues he had been exploring for most of his adult life.Mary Anne Perkins and Nicholas Reid both argue that in September 1818 Coleridge resolved the problems he had earlier faced in his discussion of Schelling in the Biographia, and that the \\"Opus Maximum\\" accordingly sets out a relatively systematic post-Kantian position (Perkins, Coleridge's Philosophy, p.10, and Reid, Coleridge, Form and Symbol, pp.viii and 126). Coleridge died in Highgate, London on 25 July 1834 as a result of heart failure compounded by an unknown lung disorder, possibly linked to his use of opium. Coleridge had spent 18 years under the roof of the Gillman family, who built an addition onto their home to accommodate the poet. > Faith may be defined as fidelity to our own being, so far as such being is > not and cannot become an object of the senses; and hence, by clear inference > or implication to being generally, as far as the same is not the object of > the senses; and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the > condition, or concomitant, or consequence of the same.

Essay on Faith Carlyle described him at Highgate: \\"Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill, in those years, looking down on London and its smoke-tumult, like a sage escaped from the inanity of life's battle ... The practical intellects of the world did not much heed him, or carelessly reckoned him a metaphysical dreamer: but to the rising spirits of the young generation he had this dusky sublime character; and sat there as a kind of Magus, girt in mystery and enigma; his Dodona oak-grove (Mr. Gilman's house at Highgate) whispering strange things, uncertain whether oracles or jargon.\\"Carlye, Thomas, Life of John Sterling, Book 1 Chapter 8  Remains  Coleridge is buried in the aisle of St. Michael's Parish Church in Highgate, London. He was originally buried at Old Highgate Chapel but was re-interred in St. Michael's in 1961. Coleridge could see the red door of the then new church from his last residence across the green, where he lived with a doctor he had hoped might cure him (in a house owned today by Kate Moss). When it was discovered Coleridge's vault had become derelict, the coffins ‚Äì Coleridge's and those of his wife, daughter, son-in-law, and grandson ‚Äì were moved to St. Michael's after an international fundraising appeal. Drew Clode, a member of St. Michael's stewardship committee states, \\"they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them\\". A recent excavation revealed the coffins were not in the location most believed, the far corner of the crypt, but actually below a memorial slab in the nave inscribed with: \\"Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\". St. Michael's plans to restore the crypt and allow public access. Says vicar Kunle Ayodeji of the plans: \\"...we hope that the whole crypt can be cleared as a space for meetings and other uses, which would also allow access to Coleridge‚Äôs cellar.\\" Poetry Coleridge is one of the most important figures in English poetry. His poems directly and deeply influenced all the major poets of the age. He was known by his contemporaries as a meticulous craftsman who was more rigorous in his careful reworking of his poems than any other poet, and Southey and Wordsworth were dependent on his professional advice. His influence on Wordsworth is particularly important because many critics have credited Coleridge with the very idea of \\"Conversational Poetry\\". The idea of utilising common, everyday language to express profound poetic images and ideas for which Wordsworth became so famous may have originated almost entirely in Coleridge‚Äôs mind. It is difficult to imagine Wordsworth‚Äôs great poems, The Excursion or The Prelude, ever having been written without the direct influence of Coleridge‚Äôs originality. As important as Coleridge was to poetry as a poet, he was equally important to poetry as a critic. His philosophy of poetry, which he developed over many years, has been deeply influential in the field of literary criticism. This influence can be seen in such critics as A. O. Lovejoy and I. A. Richards. =The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and Kubla Khan= Coleridge draft of the poem Kubla Khan Coleridge is arguably best known for his longer poems, particuarly The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel. Even those who have never read the Rime have come under its influence: its words have given the English language the metaphor of an albatross around one's neck, the quotation of \\"water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink\\" (almost always rendered as \\"but not a drop to drink\\"), and the phrase \\"a sadder and a wiser man\\" (usually rendered as \\"a sadder but wiser man\\"). The phrase \\"All creatures great and small\\" may have been inspired by The Rime: \\"He prayeth best, who loveth best;/ All things both great and small;/ For the dear God who loveth us;/ He made and loveth all.\\" Christabel is known for its musical rhythm, language, and its Gothic tale. Kubla Khan, or, A Vision in a Dream, A Fragment, although shorter, is also widely known. Both Kubla Khan and Christabel have an additional \\"Romantic\\" aura because they were never finished. Stopford Brooke characterised both poems as having no rival due to their \\"exquisite metrical movement\\" and \\"imaginative phrasing.\\" =The Conversation poems= { - valign=top  *The Eolian Harp (1795) *Reflections on having left a Place of Retirement (1795) *This Lime-Tree Bower my Prison (1797) *Frost at Midnight (1798)  *Fears in Solitude (1798) *The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem (1798) *Dejection: An Ode (1802) *To William Wordsworth (1807) } The eight of Coleridge's poems listed above are now often discussed as a group entitled \\"Conversation poems\\". The term itself was coined in 1928 by George McLean Harper, who borrowed the subtitle of The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem (1798) to describe the seven other poems as well.Harper (1928), pp. 3‚Äì27.Magnuson (2002), p. 45. The poems are considered by many critics to be among Coleridge's finest verses; thus Harold Bloom has written, \\"With Dejection, The Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan, Frost at Midnight shows Coleridge at his most impressive.\\"Bloom (1971), p. 202. They are also among his most influential poems, as discussed further below. Harper himself considered that the eight poems represented a form of blank verse that is \\"...more fluent and easy than Milton's, or any that had been written since Milton\\".Harper (1928), p. 11. In 2006 Robert Koelzer wrote about another aspect of this apparent \\"easiness\\", noting that Conversation poems such as \\"... Coleridge's The Eolian Harp and The Nightingale maintain a middle register of speech, employing an idiomatic language that is capable of being construed as un-symbolic and un-musical: language that lets itself be taken as 'merely talk' rather than rapturous 'song'.\\"Koelzer (2006), p. 68. A statue of the Ancient Mariner at Watchet Harbour, Somerset, England The last ten lines of Frost at Midnight were chosen by Harper as the \\"best example of the peculiar kind of blank verse Coleridge had evolved, as natural-seeming as prose, but as exquisitely artistic as the most complicated sonnet.\\"Harper (1928), p. 15. The speaker of the poem is addressing his infant son, asleep by his side: > Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee, Whether the summer clothe the > general earth With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing Betwixt the > tufts of snow on the bare branch Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch > Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall Heard only in the > trances of the blast, Or if the secret ministry of frost Shall hang them up > in silent icicles, Quietly shining to the quiet Moon. In 1965, M. H. Abrams wrote a broad description that applies to the Conversation poems: \\"The speaker begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation.\\"Abrams (1965), p. In fact, Abrams was describing both the Conversation poems and later poems influenced by them. Abrams' essay has been called a \\"touchstone of literary criticism\\".Koelzer (2006). p. 67. As Paul Magnuson described it in 2002, \\"Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the 'greater Romantic lyric', a genre that began with Coleridge's 'Conversation' poems, and included Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey, Shelley's Stanzas Written in Dejection and Keats's Ode to a Nightingale, and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and W. H. Auden.\\" Literary criticism =Biographia Literaria= In addition to his poetry, Coleridge also wrote influential pieces of literary criticism including Biographia Literaria, a collection of his thoughts and opinions on literature which he published in 1817. The work delivered both biographical explanations of the author's life as well as his impressions on literature. The collection also contained an analysis of a broad range of philosophical principles of literature ranging from Aristotle to Immanuel Kant and Schelling and applied them to the poetry of peers such as William Wordsworth.Beckson (1963), pp. 265‚Äì266.See article on Mimesis Coleridge's explanation of metaphysical principles were popular topics of discourse in academic communities throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and T.S. Eliot stated that he believed that Coleridge was \\"perhaps the greatest of English critics, and in a sense the last.\\" Eliot suggests that Coleridge displayed \\"natural abilities\\" far greater than his contemporaries, dissecting literature and applying philosophical principles of metaphysics in a way that brought the subject of his criticisms away from the text and into a world of logical analysis that mixed logical analysis and emotion. However, Eliot also criticises Coleridge for allowing his emotion to play a role in the metaphysical process, believing that critics should not have emotions that are not provoked by the work being studied.Eliot (1956), pp. 50‚Äì56. Hugh Kenner in Historical Fictions, discusses Norman Fruman's Coleridge, the Damaged Archangel and suggests that the term \\"criticism\\" is too often applied to Biographia Literaria, which both he and Fruman describe as having failed to explain or help the reader understand works of art. To Kenner, Coleridge's attempt to discuss complex philosophical concepts without describing the rational process behind them displays a lack of critical thinking that makes the volume more of a biography than a work of criticism.Kenner (1995), pp. 40‚Äì45. In Biographia Literaria and his poetry, symbols are not merely \\"objective correlatives\\" to Coleridge, but instruments for making the universe and personal experience intelligible and spiritually covalent. To Coleridge, the \\"cinque spotted spider,\\" making its way upstream \\"by fits and starts,\\" [Biographia Literaria] is not merely a comment on the intermittent nature of creativity, imagination, or spiritual progress, but the journey and destination of his life. The spider's five legs represent the central problem that Coleridge lived to resolve, the conflict between Aristotelian logic and Christian philosophy. Two legs of the spider represent the \\"me-not me\\" of thesis and antithesis, the idea that a thing cannot be itself and its opposite simultaneously, the basis of the clockwork Newtonian world view that Coleridge rejected. The remaining three legs‚Äîexothesis, mesothesis and synthesis or the Holy trinity‚Äîrepresent the idea that things can diverge without being contradictory. Taken together, the five legs‚Äîwith synthesis in the center, form the Holy Cross of Ramist logic. The cinque-spotted spider is Coleridge's emblem of holism, the quest and substance of Coleridge's thought and spiritual life. =Coleridge and the influence of the Gothic= Engraving of a scene from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The frozen crew and the albatross by Gustave Dor√© (1876) Coleridge wrote reviews of Ann Radcliffe's books and The Mad Monk, among others. He comments in his reviews: \\"Situations of torment, and images of naked horror, are easily conceived; and a writer in whose works they abound, deserves our gratitude almost equally with him who should drag us by way of sport through a military hospital, or force us to sit at the dissecting-table of a natural philosopher. To trace the nice boundaries, beyond which terror and sympathy are deserted by the pleasurable emotions, ‚Äì to reach those limits, yet never to pass them, hic labor, hic opus est.\\" and \\"The horrible and the preternatural have usually seized on the popular taste, at the rise and decline of literature. Most powerful stimulants, they can never be required except by the torpor of an unawakened, or the languor of an exhausted, appetite... We trust, however, that satiety will banish what good sense should have prevented; and that, wearied with fiends, incomprehensible characters, with shrieks, murders, and subterraneous dungeons, the public will learn, by the multitude of the manufacturers, with how little expense of thought or imagination this species of composition is manufactured.\\" However, Coleridge used these elements in poems such as The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798), Christabel and Kubla Khan (published in 1816, but known in manuscript form before then) and certainly influenced other poets and writers of the time. Poems like these both drew inspiration from and helped to inflame the craze for Gothic romance. Coleridge also made considerable use of Gothic elements in his commercially successful play Remorse.Parker, p. 111 Mary Shelley, who knew Coleridge well, mentions The Rime of the Ancient Mariner twice directly in Frankenstein, and some of the descriptions in the novel echo it indirectly. Although William Godwin, her father, disagreed with Coleridge on some important issues, he respected his opinions and Coleridge often visited the Godwins. Mary Shelley later recalled hiding behind the sofa and hearing his voice chanting The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. C. S. Lewis also makes mention of his name in The Screwtape Letters (as a poor example of prayer, in which the devils should encourage). Religious beliefs Although his father was an Anglican vicar, Coleridge worked as a Unitarian preacher between 1796 and 1797. He eventually returned to the Church of England in 1814. His most noteworthy writings on religion are Lay Sermons (1817), Aids to Reflection (1825) and The Constitution of Church and State (1830). =Theological legacy= Despite being mostly remembered today for his poetry and literary criticism, Coleridge was also (perhaps in his own eyes primarily) a theologian. His writings include discussions of the status of scripture, the doctrines of the Fall, justification and sanctification, and the personality and infinity of God. A key figure in the Anglican theology of his day, his writings are still regularly referred to by contemporary Anglican theologians. F. D. Maurice, F. J. A. Hort, F. W. Robertson, B. F. Westcott, John Oman and Thomas Erskine (once called the \\"Scottish Coleridge\\") were all influenced by him. Political thinking Coleridge was also a profound political thinker. While he began his life as a political radical, and an enthusiast for the French Revolution, over the years Coleridge developed a more conservative view of society, somewhat in the manner of Burke.D Daiches ed., Companion to Literature 1 (1963) p. 110 Although seen as cowardly treachery by the next generation of Romantic poets,D Hay, Young Romantics (London 2011) p. 38 and p. 67 Coleridge's later thought became a fruitful source for the evolving radicalism of J. S. Mill.E Halevy, The Triumph of Reform (London 1961) p. 158 Mill found three aspects of Coleridge's thought especially illuminating: # First, there was Coleridge's insistence on what he called \\"the Idea\\" behind an institution ‚Äì its social function, in later terminology ‚Äì as opposed to the possible flaws in its actual implementation.A Ryan, J S Mill (London 1974) p. 70; A Hamilton, 'Coleridge and Conservatism: Contemplation of an Idea', in ed. P Cheyne, Coleridge and Contemplation (Oxford: OUP 2017) Coleridge sought to understand meaning from within a social matrix, not outside it, using an imaginative reconstruction of the past (Verstehen) or of unfamiliar systems.J Skorupski, Why Read Mill Today?

Analysis of its parallax shows that it is located 250 ¬± 10 light years from the Sun. It is a spectroscopic binary star and rotating ellipsoidal variable; a system whose two stars are so close together they are egg-shaped rather than spherical, and can only be separated by their spectra. The primary is a blue giant and a variable star of the Beta Cephei type. Spica, along with Arcturus and Denebola or Regulus depending on the source, is part of the Spring Triangle asterism, and by extension, also of the Great Diamond together with the star Cor Caroli. Nomenclature In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Spica for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The name is derived from the Latin spƒ´ca virginis \\"the virgin's ear of [wheat] grain\\". It was also anglicized as Virgin's Spike. Œ± Virginis (Latinised to Alpha Virginis) is the system's Bayer designation. Johann Bayer cited the name Arista. Other traditional names are Azimech , from Arabic ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÖÿßŸÉ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿπÿ≤ŸÑ al-simƒÅk al- ºa Ωzal 'the unarmed simƒÅk' (of unknown meaning, cf. Eta Bo√∂tis); Alarph, Arabic for 'the grape-gatherer' or 'gleaner', and Sumbalet (Sombalet, Sembalet and variants), from Arabic ÿ≥ŸÜÿ®ŸÑÿ©‚Äé sunbulah \\"ear of grain\\". In Chinese, (), meaning Horn (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of Spica and Œ∂ Virginis. Consequently, the Chinese name for Spica is (, ). In Hindu astronomy, Spica corresponds to the Nakshatra ChitrƒÅ. Observational history Spica is the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo (lower left). As one of the nearest massive binary star systems to the Sun, Spica has been the subject of many observational studies. Spica is believed to be the star that gave Hipparchus the data that led him to discover the precession of the equinoxes. A temple to Menat (an early Hathor) at Thebes was oriented with reference to Spica when it was built in 3200 BC, and, over time, precession slowly but noticeably changed Spica's location relative to the temple. Nicolaus Copernicus made many observations of Spica with his home-made triquetrum for his researches on precession.  Observation  left Spica is 2.06 degrees from the ecliptic and can be occulted by the Moon and sometimes by planets. The last planetary occultation of Spica occurred when Venus passed in front of the star (as seen from Earth) on November 10, 1783. The next occultation will occur on September 2, 2197, when Venus again passes in front of Spica. The Sun passes a little more than 2¬∞ north of Spica around October 16 every year, and the star's heliacal rising occurs about two weeks later. Every 8 years, Venus passes Spica around the time of the star's heliacal rising, as in 2009 when it passed 3.5¬∞ north of the star on November 3. A method of finding Spica is to follow the arc of the handle of the Big Dipper (or Plough) to Arcturus, and then continue on the same angular distance to Spica. This can be recalled by the mnemonic phrase, \\"arc to Arcturus and spike to Spica.\\" Physical properties Spica is a close binary star whose components orbit each other every four days. They stay close together enough that they cannot be resolved as two stars through a telescope. The changes in the orbital motion of this pair results in a Doppler shift in the absorption lines of their respective spectra, making them a double-lined spectroscopic binary. Initially, the orbital parameters for this system were inferred using spectroscopic measurements. Between 1966 and 1970, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer was used to observe the pair and to directly measure the orbital characteristics and the angular diameter of the primary, which was found to be , and the angular size of the semi-major axis of the orbit was found to be only slightly larger at . Spica is a rotating ellipsoidal variable, which is a non-eclipsing close binary star system where the stars are mutually distorted through their gravitational interaction. This effect causes the apparent magnitude of the star system to vary by 0.03 over an interval that matches the orbital period. This slight dip in magnitude is barely noticeable visually. Both stars rotate faster than their mutual orbital period. This lack of synchronization and the high ellipticity of their orbit may indicate that this is a young star system. Over time, the mutual tidal interaction of the pair may lead to rotational synchronization and orbit circularization. Spica is a polarimetric variable, first discovered to be such in 2016. The majority of the polarimetric signal is the result of the reflection of the light from one star off the other (and vice versa). The two stars in Spica were the first ever to have their reflectivity (or geometric albedo) measured. The geometric albedos of Spica A and B are, respectively, 3.61 percent and 1.36 percent, values that are low compared to planets. The MK spectral classification of Spica is typically considered to be an early B-type main sequence star. Individual spectral types for the two components are difficult to assign accurately, especially for the secondary due to the Struve‚ÄìSahade effect. The Bright Star Catalogue derived a spectral class of B1 III-IV for the primary and B2V for the secondary, but later studies have given various different values. The primary star has a stellar classification of B1 III‚ÄìIV. The luminosity class matches the spectrum of a star that is midway between a subgiant and a giant star, and it is no longer a main-sequence star. The evolutionary stage has been calculated to be near or slightly past the end of the main sequence phase. This is a massive star with more than 10 times the mass of the Sun and seven times the Sun's radius. The bolometric luminosity of the primary is about 20,500 times that of the Sun, and nine times the luminosity of its companion. The primary is one of the nearest stars to the Sun that has enough mass to end its life in a Type II supernova explosion. The primary is classified as a Beta Cephei variable star that varies in brightness over a 0.1738-day period. The spectrum shows a radial velocity variation with the same period, indicating that the surface of the star is regularly pulsating outward and then contracting. This star is rotating rapidly, with a rotational velocity of 199 km/s along the equator. The secondary member of this system is one of the few stars whose spectrum is affected by the Struve‚ÄìSahade effect. This is an anomalous change in the strength of the spectral lines over the course of an orbit, where the lines become weaker as the star is moving away from the observer. It may be caused by a strong stellar wind from the primary scattering the light from secondary when it is receding. This star is smaller than the primary, with about 7 times the mass of the Sun and 3.6 times the Sun's radius. Its stellar classification is B2 V, making this a main-sequence star. In culture Both American ships USS Spica (AK-16) and USNS Spica (T-AFS-9) were named after this star while USS Azimech (AK-124), a Crater-class cargo ship, was given one of the star's medieval names. A blue star represents Spica on the flag of the Brazilian state of Par√°. Spica is also the star representing Par√° on the Brazilian flag. A South Korean Girl Group was named after the star. Spica is a Vocaloid song sung by Hatsune Miku. In a non-canonical chapter in Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World-, Subaru had a daughter with Rem named Spica. Spica is the pseudonym of Lili in the children's manga series, Zodiac P.I. In his Three Books of Occult Philosophy, Cornelius Agrippa attributes Spica's kabbalistic symbol Image:Agrippa1531 Spica.png to Hermes Trismegistus.

B. White. It was White's first children's book, and it is now widely recognized as a classic in children's literature. Stuart Little was illustrated by the subsequently award-winning artist Garth Williams, also his first work for children. The book is a realistic and fantasy story about a mouse-like human boy named Stuart Little. According to the first chapter, he ‚Ä≥looked very much like a rat/mouse in every way‚Ä≥. Background In a letter White wrote in response to inquiries from readers, he described how he came to conceive of Stuart Little: \\"Many years ago, I went to bed one night in a railway sleeping car, and during the night I dreamed about a tiny boy who acted rather like a rat. That's how the story of Stuart Little got started\\". He had the dream in the spring of 1926, while sleeping on a train on his way back to New York from a visit to the Shenandoah Valley.Sims 2011, p. 145 Biographer Michael Sims wrote that Stuart \\"arrived in [White's] mind in a direct shipment from the subconscious.\\" White typed up a few stories about Stuart, which he told to his 18 nieces and nephews when they asked him to tell them a story. In 1935, White's wife Katharine showed these stories to Clarence Day, then a regular contributor to The New Yorker. Day liked the stories and encouraged White not to neglect them, but neither Oxford University Press nor Viking Press was interested in the stories,Elledge (1986), p. 254 and White did not immediately develop them further.Sims 2011, p. 146 In the fall of 1938, as his wife wrote her annual collection of children's book reviews for The New Yorker, White wrote a few paragraphs in his \\"One Man's Meat\\" column in Harper's Magazine about writing children's books. Anne Carroll Moore, the head children's librarian at the New York Public Library, read this column and responded by encouraging him to write a children's book that would \\"make the library lions roar\\". White's editor at Harper, who had heard about the Stuart stories from Katherine, asked to see them, and by March 1939 was intent on publishing them. Around that time, White wrote to James Thurber that he was \\"about half done\\" with the book; however, he did not finish it until the winter of 1944-1945.Elledge (1986), p. 255 Plot A boy named Stuart is born to an ordinary family in New York City. He is normal in every way except that he is only just over two inches high and looks exactly like a mouse. At first the family is concerned with how Stuart will survive in a human-sized world, but by the age of seven, he speaks, thinks, and behaves on the level of a human of sixteen and shows surprising ingenuity in adapting, performing such helpful family tasks as fishing his mother's wedding ring from a sink drain. The family's cat, Snowbell, dislikes Stuart because while he feels a natural instinct to chase him, he is aware that Stuart is a member of the human family and thus off- limits. On a cold winter's day, the family discovers a songbird named Margalo half-frozen on their doorstep. Margalo is taken in and spends the winter in the family, where she befriends Stuart; Stuart in turn protects her from Snowbell. The bird repays his kindness by saving Stuart when he is trapped in a garbage can and shipped out to sea for disposal. In the spring, when she is set free from the house, she continues to visit Stuart, infuriating Snowbell, who now finds himself with two small animals he is not allowed to eat. Snowbell makes a deal with the Angora cat to eat Margalo to get rid of one of his temptations (reasoning that it's only wrong if he eats her). Margalo is warned in advance and flees in the middle of the night. Stuart is heartbroken but becomes determined to find her. He first goes to the local dentist, Dr. Carey, who is a friend of Stuart. The dentist's patient, Edward Clydesdale, suggests that Margalo may have flown to Connecticut, and Dr. Carey loans Stuart his motorized, gas-powered toy car for the long journey. Stuart travels from adventure to adventure and finds himself in the town of Ames Crossing, where he takes work as a substitute teacher. There he learns that living in Ames Crossing is a fifteen-year-old girl named Harriet Ames who is the same size as Stuart but looks like a human being. Stuart purchases a miniature souvenir canoe, prepping it to make it comfortable and waterproof, and invites Harriet out on a boating date. However, when the two arrive for the date, the canoe has been discovered and played with by local children, who have ruined it. Harriet tries to be polite but is put-off by Stuart's sulking over his broken boat. Stuart decides to leave Ames Crossing and continue on his quest to find Margalo. He sets off once more in his car, thinking that he will never see her again. Reception Lucien Agosta, in his overview of the critical reception of the book, notes that \\"Critical reactions to Stuart Little have varied from disapprobation to unqualified admiration since the book was published in 1945, though generally it has been well received.\\"Agosta 1995, p. 59 Anne Carroll Moore, who had initially encouraged White to write the book, was critical of it when she read a proof of it.Elledge 1986, p. 263-264 She wrote letters to White, his wife Katharine, and Harper's children's editor Ursula Nordstrom, advising that the book not be published. Malcolm Cowley, who reviewed the book for The New York Times, wrote, \\"Mr. White has a tendency to write amusing scenes instead of telling a story. To say that Stuart Little is one of the best children's books published this year is very modest praise for a writer of his talent.\\" The book has become a children's classic, and is widely read by children and used by teachers.A Guide for Using Stuart Little in the Classroom, Lorraine Kujawa and Virginia Wiseman, Teacher Created Resources 2004, White received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal in 1970 for Stuart Little and Charlotte's Web. Adaptations =Audio= Actress Julie Harris narrated an unabridged adaptation on LP in two volumes for Pathways Of Sound (POS 1036 and 1037). The complete recording was later released on audio cassette by Bantam Audio and on CD by Listening Library. =Films= The book was very loosely adapted into a 1999 film of the same name, which combined live-action with computer animation. In the film, Stuart is adopted instead of born into the Little family and the plot focuses on Stuart looking for his real parents (who were killed in an accident when Stuart was a baby) and Snowbell's attempt to get rid of him. A 2002 sequel, Stuart Little 2, features the character of Margalo and more closely follows the plot of the book. A third film, Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild was released direct-to-video in 2006. This film was entirely computer-animated, and its plot was not derived from the book. All three films also leave out the plot of Stuart being a one- time substitute for a schoolhouse. All three films feature Hugh Laurie as Mr. Little, Geena Davis as Mrs. Little, and Michael J. Fox as the voice of Stuart Little. In 2015, it was announced that a remake of a Stuart Little film is in the works at Sony Pictures Entertainment and Red Wagon Entertainment. The movie will remain as a hybrid of live-action/computer animation. Douglas Wick, the producer of the original films, will produce the remake. =Television= \\"The World of Stuart Little,\\" a 1966 episode of NBC's Children's Theater, narrated by Johnny Carson, won a Peabody Award and was nominated for an Emmy. An animated television series, Stuart Little: The Animated Series (based on the film adaptations) was produced for HBO Family and aired for 13 episodes in 2003. =Video games= Three video games based on the film adaptations of the same name have been produced. Stuart Little: the Journey Home, which was released only for the Game Boy Color in 2001, is based on the 1999 film. A game based on Stuart Little 2 was released for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows in 2002. A third game, entitled Stuart Little 3: Big Photo Adventure, was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 in 2005.

Typically, a statite would use the solar sail to \\"hover\\" in a location that would not otherwise be available as a stable geosynchronous orbit. Statites have been proposed that would remain in fixed locations high over Earth's poles, using reflected sunlight to counteract the gravity pulling them down. Statites might also employ their sails to change the shape or velocity of more conventional orbits, depending upon the purpose of the particular statite. The concept of the statite was invented independently (and approximately simultaneously) by Robert L. Forward (who coined the term \\"statite\\") and Colin McInnes, who used the term \\"halo orbit\\"McInnes, C. R. and Simmons, J. F.

Subsequently, the terms \\"non-Keplerian orbit\\" and \\"artificial Lagrange point\\" have been used as a generalization of the above terms. No statites have been deployed to date, as solar sail technology remains in its infancy. NASA's cancelled Sunjammer solar sail mission had the stated objective of flying to an artificial Lagrange point near the Earth/Sun L1 point, to demonstrate the feasibility of the Geostorm geomagnetic storm warning mission concept proposed by NOAA's Patricia Mulligan.

Sabellianism is the belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of God, as opposed to a Trinitarian view of three distinct persons within the Godhead.G. T. Stokes, ‚ÄúSabellianism,‚Äù ed. William Smith and Henry Wace, A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines (London: John Murray, 1877‚Äì1887), 567. The term Sabellianism comes from Sabellius, who was a theologian and priest from the 3rd century. None of his writings have survived and so all that is known about him comes from his opponents. All evidence shows that Sabellius held Jesus to be deity while denying the plurality of persons in God and holding a belief similar to modalistic monarchianism. Modalistic monarchianism has been generally understood to have arisen during the second and third centuries, and to have been regarded as heresy after the fourth, although this is disputed by some.https://www.britannica.com/topic/Monarchianism \\"Monarchianism\\", Encyclopedia Britannica Online Sabellianism has been rejected by the majority of Christian churches in favour of Trinitarianism, which was eventually defined as three distinct, co-equal, co-eternal Persons of One Substance by the Athanasian Creed, probably dating from the late 5th or early 6th century. The Greek term homoousian or \\"consubstantial\\" () had been used before its adoption by the First Council of Nicaea. The Gnostics were the first to use the word ', while before the Gnostics there is no trace at all of its existence........... The early church theologians were probably made aware of this concept, and thus of the doctrine of emanation, taught by the Gnostics.. In Gnostic texts the word ' is used with the following meanings: * Identity of substance between generator and generated. * Identity of substance between things generated of the same substance. * Identity of substance between the partners of a syzygy. It has been noted that this Greek term homoousian (\\"same being\\" or \\"consubstantial\\"), which Athanasius of Alexandria favoured, was also a term reportedly used by Sabellius‚Äîa term that many who held with Athanasius were uneasy about. Their objection to the term homoousian was that it was considered to be un-Scriptural, suspicious, and \\"of a Sabellian tendency.\\"Select Treatises of St. Athanasius - In Controversy With the Arians - Freely Translated by John Henry Cardinal Newmann - Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911, footnote n.124 This was because Sabellius also considered the Father and the Son to be \\"one substance,\\" meaning that, to Sabellius, the Father and Son were one essential person, though operating as different manifestations or modes. Athanasius' use of the word is intended to affirm that while the Father and Son are eternally distinct in a truly personal manner (i.e. with mutual love John 3:35, 14:31), both are nevertheless One Being, Essence, Nature, or Substance, having One personal Spirit. History and development Modalism has been mainly associated with Sabellius, who taught a form of it in Rome in the 3rd century. This had come to him via the teachings of Noetus and Praxeas.A History of Christianity: Volume I: Beginnings to 1500 by Kenneth S. Latourette, Revised Edition p.144-146, published by HarperCollins, 1975: , Noetus was excommunicated from the Church after being examined by council, and Praxeas is said to have recanted his modalistic views in writing, teaching again his former faith. Sabellius likewise was excommunicated by council in Alexandria, and after complaint of this was made to Rome, a second council then assembled in Rome and also ruled against not only Sabellianism, but against Arianism, and against Tritheism, while affirming a Divine Triad as the catholic understanding of the Divine Monarchy. Hippolytus of Rome knew Sabellius personally, writing how he and others had admonished Sabellius in Refutation of All Heresies. He knew Sabellius opposed Trinitarian theology, yet he called Modal Monarchism the heresy of Noetus, not that of Sabellius. Sabellianism was embraced by Christians in Cyrenaica, to whom Dionysius, Patriarch of Alexandria (who was instrumental in the excommunication of Sabellius in Alexandria), wrote letters arguing against this belief. Hippolytus himself perceived modalism as a new and peculiar idea which was covertly gaining a following: > Some others are secretly introducing another doctrine, who have become > disciples of one Noetus, who was a native of Smyrna, (and) lived not very > long ago. This person was greatly puffed up and inflated with pride, being > inspired by the conceit of a strange spirit.  There has appeared one, > Noetus by name, and by birth a native of Smyrna. This person introduced a > heresy from the tenets of Heraclitus. Now a certain man called Epigonus > becomes his minister and pupil, and this person during his sojourn at Rome > disseminated his godless opinion. But Cleomenes, who had become his > disciple, an alien both in way of life and habits from the Church, was wont > to corroborate the (Noetian) doctrine.  But in like manner, also, Noetus, > being by birth a native of Smyrna, and a fellow addicted to reckless > babbling, as well as crafty withal, introduced (among us) this heresy which > originated from one Epigonus. It reached Rome, and was adopted by Cleomenes, > and so has continued to this day among his successors. Tertullian also perceived modalism as entering into the Church from without as a new idea, and opposing the doctrine which had been received through succession. After setting forth his understanding of the manner of faith which had been received by the Church, he then describes how the \\"simple\\" who always constitute the majority of believers are often startled at the idea that the One God exists in three and were opposed to his understanding of \\"the rule of faith.\\" Proponents of Tertullian argue that he described the \\"simple\\" as the majority, rather than those who opposed him as the majority. This is contended from Tertullian's argument that they were putting forth ideas of their own which had not been taught to them by their elders: > We, however, as we indeed always have done (and more especially since we > have been better instructed by the Paraclete, who leads men indeed into all > truth), believe that there is one only God, but under the following > dispensation, or Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ±, as it is called, that this one only God has also > a Son, His Word, who proceeded from Himself, by whom all things were made, > and without whom nothing was made. Him we believe to have been sent by the > Father into the Virgin, and to have been born of her‚Äîbeing both Man and God, > the Son of Man and the Son of God, and to have been called by the name of > Jesus Christ; we believe Him to have suffered, died, and been buried, > according to the Scriptures, and, after He had been raised again by the > Father and taken back to heaven, to be sitting at the right hand of the > Father, and that He will come to judge the quick and the dead; who sent also > from heaven from the Father, according to His own promise, the Holy Ghost, > the Paraclete, the sanctifier of the faith of those who believe in the > Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost. That this rule of faith has > come down to us from the beginning of the gospel, even before any of the > older heretics, much more before Praxeas, a pretender of yesterday, will be > apparent both from the lateness of date which marks all heresies, and also > from the absolutely novel character of our new-fangled Praxeas. In this > principle also we must henceforth find a presumption of equal force against > all heresies whatsoever‚Äîthat whatever is first is true, whereas that is > spurious which is later in date. > The simple, indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) who always > constitute the majority of believers, are startled at the dispensation (of > the Three in One), on the ground that their very rule of faith withdraws > them from the world‚Äôs plurality of gods to the one only true God; not > understanding that, although He is the one only God, He must yet be believed > in with His own Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ± . The numerical order and distribution of the > Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which > derives the Trinity out of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that > it is actually supported by it. They are constantly throwing out against us > that we are preachers of two gods and three gods, while they take to > themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the One God; > just as if the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce > heresy, and the Trinity rationally considered constitute the truth. According to modalism and Sabellianism, God is said to be only one person who reveals himself in different ways called modes, faces, aspects, roles or masks (Greek œÄœÅœåœÉœâœÄŒ± prosopa; Latin personae) of the One God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three co-eternal persons within the Godhead, or a \\"co- equal Trinity\\".pgs 51-55Vladimir Lossky The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997. () James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991. () Modalists note that the only number expressly and repeatedly ascribed to God in the Old Testament is One, do not accept interpreting this number as denoting union (i.e. Gen 2:24) when it is applied to God, and dispute the meaning or validity of related New Testament passages cited by Trinitarians.Moss, C. B., The Christian Faith: An Introduction to Dogmatic Theology, The Chaucer Press, London, 1943 The Comma Johanneum, which is generally regarded as a spurious text in First John (1 John 5:7) known primarily from the King James Version and some versions of the Textus Receptus, but not included in modern critical texts, is an instance (the only one expressly stated) of the word Three describing God.See, for example, Metzger, Bruce M., A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament [TCGNT] (2nd Edition), Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1994, pages 647-649. Many modalists point out the lack of the word \\"Trinity\\" in any canonical scripture. Passages such as Deut 6:4-5; Deut 32:12; 2Kings 19:15-19; Job 6:10; Job 31:13-15; Psalm 71:22; Psalm 83:16,18; Is 42:8; Is 45:5-7; Is 48:2,9,11-13; Mal 2:8,10; Matt 19:17; Romans 3:30; 2Cor 11:2-3; Gal 3:20; and Jude 1:25 are referenced by modalists as affirming that the Being of the One God is solidly single, and although known in several modes, precludes any concept of divine co-existence. Hippolytus described similar reasoning by Noetus and his followers saying: > Now they seek to exhibit the foundation for their dogma by citing the word > in the law, ‚ÄúI am the God of your fathers: ye shall have no other gods > beside me;‚Äù and again in another passage, ‚ÄúI am the first,‚Äù He saith, ‚Äúand > the last; and beside me there is none other.‚Äù Thus they say they prove that > God is one.... And we cannot express ourselves otherwise, he says; for the > apostle also acknowledges one God, when he says, ‚ÄúWhose are the fathers, > (and) of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God > blessed for ever.‚Äù Oneness Pentecostals, an identifier used by some modern modalists,The Oneness of GodA rebuttal to Bernard claim that Colossians 1:12-20 refers to Christ's relationship with the Father in the sense of different roles of God: > giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the > inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of > darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we > have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. He is the image of the invisible > God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in > heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or > rulers or authorities; all things were created through him and for him. And > he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the > head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the > dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness > of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all > things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his > cross.Colossians 1:12-20 (ESV) Oneness Pentecostals also cite Christ's response to Philip's query on who the Father was in John 14:10 to support this assertion: > Jesus answered: \\"Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you > such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you > say, 'Show us the Father'? Trinitarian Christians hold that verses such as Colossians 1:12-20 remove all reasonable doubt that scripture teaches the Son, Who IS the Word of God (i.e. John 1:1-3), is literally \\"living,\\" and literally Creator of everything together with God the Father and the Spirit of God. In the Trinitarian view, the above usage not only takes John 14:10 out of its immediate context, but is also resolutely contrary to the congruence of the Gospel of John as a whole, and strongly suspected of begging the question in interpretation. Trinitarians understand John 14:10 as informed by parallel verses such as John 1:14 and John 1:18, and as affirming the eternal union of the Son with His Father: > And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory > as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth... No one > has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the > Father, He has explained Him. Many doctrinal exchanges between modalists and Trinitarians are similar to the above. Passages such as Gen 1:26-27; Gen 16:11-13; Gen 32:24,30; Judg 6:11-16; Is 48:16; Zech 2:8-9; Matt 3:16-17; Mark 13:32; Luke 12:10; John 5:18-27; John 14:26-28; John 15:26; John 16:13-16; John 17:5,20-24; Acts 1:6-9; and Heb 1:1-3,8-10 are referenced by Trinitarians as affirming that the Being of the One God is an eternal, personal, and mutually indwelling communion of Father [God], Son [the Word of God], and Holy Spirit [the Spirit of God]. Addressing the fact that the word Trinity does not occur in scripture, Trinitarians attest that extra-biblical doctrinal language often summarizes our understanding scripture in a clear and concise manner‚Äîother examples being even the words modalism, mode, and role‚Äîand that use of such language does not of itself demonstrate accuracy or inaccuracy. Further, the accusative implication that the word Trinity gained common use apart from careful and pious fidelity to scripture may be associated with ad hominem argumentation. Hippolytus described his own response to Noetus' doctrine, claiming the truth to be more evident than either of the two mutually opposed views of Arianism and Sabellianism : > In this way, then, they choose to set forth these things, and they make use > only of one class of passages; just in the same one-sided manner that > Theodotus employed when he sought to prove that Christ was a mere man. But > neither has the one party nor the other understood the matter rightly, as > the Scriptures themselves confute their senselessness, and attest the truth. > See, brethren, what a rash and audacious dogma they have introduced... For > who will not say that there is one God? Yet he will not on that account deny > the economy [i.e., the number and disposition of persons in the Trinity]. > The proper way, therefore, to deal with the question is first of all to > refute the interpretation put upon these passages by these men, and then to > explain their real meaning. Tertullian said of Praxeas' followers: > For, confuted on all sides on the distinction between the Father and the > Son, which we maintain without destroying their inseparable union... they > endeavour to interpret this distinction in a way which shall nevertheless > tally with their own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish > two, Father and Son, understanding the Son to be flesh, that is man, that is > Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is God, that is Christ. Thus they, > while contending that the Father and the Son are one and the same, do in > fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them.‚Äù A comparison of the above statement by Tertullian with the following example statement made by Oneness Pentecostals today is striking: \\"Jesus is the Son of God according to the flesh... and the very God Himself according to the Spirit....\\" The form of the Lord's Name appearing in verse nineteen of the Great Commission, Matthew 28:16-20, has also historically been spoken during Christian baptism, Trinitarian Christians believing the three distinct, albeit co-inherent, persons of the Holy Trinity received witness by Jesus' baptism. Many modalists do not use this form as the Lord's Name. It is also suggested by some modern Oneness Pentecostal critics, that Matthew 28:19 is not part of the original text, because Eusebius of Caesarea quoted it by saying \\"In my name\\", and in that source there was no mention of baptism in the verse. Eusebius did, however, quote the \\"trinitarian\\" formula in his later writings. (Conybeare (Hibbert Journal i (1902-3), page 102). Matthew 28:19 is quoted also in the Didache (Didache 7:1), which dates to the late 1st Century or early 2nd Century) and in the Diatesseron (Diatesseron 55:5-7), which dates to the mid 2nd Century harmony of the Synoptic Gospels. The Shem-Tob's Hebrew Gospel of Matthew (George Howard), written during the 14th century, also has no reference of baptism or a \\"trinitarian\\" formula in Matthew 28:19. However, it is also true that no Greek manuscript of the Gospel of Matthew has ever been found which does not contain Matthew 28:19. The earliest extant copies of Matthew's Gospel date to the 3rd Century, and they contain Matthew 28:19. Therefore, scholars generally agree that Matthew 28:19 is likely part of the original Gospel of Matthew, though a minority disputes this. In passages of scripture such as Matthew 3:16-17 where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are separated in the text and witness, modalists view this phenomenon as confirming God's omnipresence, and His ability to manifest himself as he pleases. Oneness Pentecostals and Modalists attempt to dispute the traditional doctrine of eternal co-existent union, while affirming the Christian doctrine of God taking on flesh as Jesus Christ. Like Trinitarians, Oneness adherents attest that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man. However, Trinitarians believe that the \\"Word of God,\\" the eternal second Person of the Trinity, was manifest as the Son of God by taking humanity to Himself and by glorifying that Humanity to equality with God through His resurrection, in eternal union with His own Divinity. In contrast, Oneness adherents hold that the One and Only true God‚ÄîWho manifests Himself in any way He chooses, including as Father, Son and Holy Spirit (though not choosing to do so in an eternally simultaneous manner)‚Äîbecame man in the temporary role of Son. Many Oneness Pentecostals have also placed a strongly Nestorian distinction between Jesus' humanity and Divinity as in the example compared with Tertullian's statement above. Oneness Pentecostals and other modalists are regarded by Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and most other mainstream Christians as heretical for denying the literal existence of God's Beloved Son from Heaven, including His eternal Being and personal communion with the Father as High Priest, Mediator, Intercessor and Advocate; rejecting the direct succession of apostolic gifts and authority through the ordination of the Christian bishops; rejecting the identity of mainstream Christians as the God-begotten Body and Church which Christ founded; and rejecting the affirmations of the ecumenical councils such as the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople, including the Holy Trinity. These rejections are for mainstream Christendom similar to Unitarianism, in that they primarily result from Christological heresy. While many Unitarians are Arians, modalists differentiate themselves from Arian or Semi-Arian Unitarians by affirming Christ's full Godhead, whereas both the Arian and Semi-Arian views assert Christ as not of one substance (Greek: Œø·ΩêœÉŒØŒ±) with, and therefore also not equal with, God the Father. Dionysius, bishop of Rome, set forth the understanding of traditional Christianity concerning both Arianism and Sabellianism in Against the Sabellians, ca. AD 262. He, in similarity to Hippolytus, explained that the two errors are at opposite extremes in seeking to understand the Son of God, Arianism misusing that the Son is distinct respecting the Father, and Sabellianism misusing that the Son is equal respecting the Father. In fact, he also repudiated the idea of three Gods as error as well. While Arianism and Sabellianism may appear to be diametrically opposed, the former claiming Christ to be created and the latter claiming Christ is God, both in common deny the Trinitarian belief that Christ is God Eternal in His Humanity, and that this is the very basis of man's hope of salvation. \\"One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the manhood into God.\\" Hippolytus' account of the excommunication of Noetus is as follows: > When the blessed presbyters heard this, they summoned him before the Church, > and examined him. But he denied at first that he held such opinions. > Afterwards, however, taking shelter among some, and having gathered round > him some others who had embraced the same error, he wished thereafter to > uphold his dogma openly as correct. And the blessed presbyters called him > again before them, and examined him. But he stood out against them, saying, > ‚ÄúWhat evil, then, am I doing in glorifying Christ?‚Äù And the presbyters > replied to him, ‚ÄúWe too know in truth one God; we know Christ; we know that > the Son suffered even as He suffered, and died even as He died, and rose > again on the third day, and is at the right hand of the Father, and cometh > to judge the living and the dead. And these things which we have learned we > allege.‚Äù Then, after examining him, they expelled him from the Church. And > he was carried to such a pitch of pride, that he established a school. Today's Oneness Pentecostal organisations left their original organization when a council of Pentecostal leaders officially adopted Trinitarianism, and have since established schools. Epiphanius (Haeres 62) about 375 notes that the adherents of Sabellius were still to be found in great numbers, both in Mesopotamia and at Rome.Views of Sabellius, The Biblical Repository and Classical Review, American Biblical Repository The First Council of Constantinople in 381 in canon VII and the Third Council of Constantinople in 680 in canon XCV declared the baptism of Sabellius to be invalid, which indicates that Sabellianism was still extant. Patripassianism The chief critics of Sabellianism were Tertullian and Hippolytus. In his work Adversus Praxeas, Chapter I, Tertullian wrote \\"By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father.\\" Likewise Hippolytus wrote, \\"Do you see, he says, how the Scriptures proclaim one God? And as this is clearly exhibited, and these passages are testimonies to it, I am under necessity, he says, since one is acknowledged, to make this One the subject of suffering. For Christ was God, and suffered on account of us, being Himself the Father, that He might be able also to save us.... See, brethren, what a rash and audacious dogma they have introduced, when they say without shame, the Father is Himself Christ, Himself the Son, Himself was born, Himself suffered, Himself raised Himself. But it is not so.\\" From these notions came the pejorative term \\"Patripassianism\\" for the movement, from the Latin words pater for \\"father\\", and passus from the verb \\"to suffer\\" because it implied that the Father suffered on the Cross. It is important to note that our only sources extant for our understanding of Sabellianism are from their detractors. Scholars today are not in agreement as to what exactly Sabellius or Praxeas taught. It is easy to suppose that Tertullian and Hippolytus at least at times misrepresented the opinions of their opponents.Monarchians, New Advent, Catholic Encyclopedia Eastern Orthodox view The Greek Orthodox teach that God is not of a substance that is comprehensible since God the Father has no origin and is eternal and infinite. Thus it is improper to speak of things as \\"physical\\" and \\"metaphysical\\"; rather it is correct to speak of things as \\"created\\" and \\"uncreated.\\" God the Father is the origin and source of the Trinity of Whom the Son is begotten and the Spirit proceeding, all Three being Uncreated.Vladimir Lossky, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997, p.50-59.() James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991. () Therefore, the consciousness of God is not obtainable to created beings either in this life or the next (see apophatism). Through co-operation with the Holy Spirit (called theosis), Mankind can become good (God-like), not becoming uncreated, but partaker of His divine energies (). From such a perspective Mankind can be reconciled from the Knowledge of Good and the Knowledge of Evil he obtained in the Garden of Eden (see the Fall of Man), his created substance thus partaking of Uncreated God through the indwelling Presence of the eternally incarnate () Son of God and His Father by the Spirit (, ). Current adherents At the Arroyo Seco World Wide Camp Meeting, near Los Angeles, in 1913, Canadian evangelist R.E. McAlister stated at a baptismal service that the apostles had baptized in the name of Jesus only and not in the triune Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Later that night, John G. Schaeppe, a German immigrant, had a vision of Jesus and woke up the camp shouting that the name of Jesus needed to be glorified. From that point, Frank J. Ewart began requiring that anyone baptized using the Trinitarian formula needed to be rebaptized in the name of Jesus ‚Äúonly.‚Äù Support for this position began to spread, along with a belief in one Person in the Godhead, acting in different modes or offices. The General Council of the Assemblies of God convened in St. Louis, Missouri in October 1916, to confirm their belief in Trinitarian orthodoxy. The Oneness camp was faced by a majority who required acceptance of the Trinitarian baptismal formula and the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity or remove themselves from the denomination. In the end, about a quarter of the ministers withdrew.Kerry D. McRoberts, ‚ÄúThe Holy Trinity,‚Äù in Systematic Theology: Revised Edition, ed. Stanley M. Horton (Springfield, MO: Logion Press, 2007), pp. 171‚Äì172. Oneness Pentecostalism teaches that God is one Person, and that the Father (a spirit) is united with Jesus (a man) as the Son of God. However, Oneness Pentecostalism differs somewhat by rejecting sequential modalism, and by the full acceptance of the begotten humanity of the Son, not eternally begotten, who was the man Jesus and was born, crucified, and risen, and not the deity. This directly opposes the pre-existence of the Son as a pre- existent mode, which Sabellianism generally does not oppose. Oneness Pentecostals believe that Jesus was \\"Son\\" only when he became flesh on earth, but was the Father before being made man. They refer to the Father as the \\"Spirit\\" and the Son as the \\"Flesh\\", but they believe that Jesus and the Father are one essential Person, though operating as different \\"manifestations\\" or \\"modes\\". Oneness Pentecostals reject the Trinity doctrine, viewing it as pagan and nonscriptural, and hold to the Jesus' Name doctrine with respect to baptisms. They are often referred to as \\"Modalists\\" or \\"Jesus Only\\". Oneness Pentecostalism can be compared to Sabellianism, or can be described as holding to a form of Sabellianism, as both are nontrinitarian, and as both believe that Jesus was \\"Almighty God in the Flesh\\", but they do not totally identify each other. It cannot be certain whether Sabellius taught Modalism completely as it is taught today as Oneness doctrine, since only a few fragments of his writings are extant and, therefore, all we have of his teachings comes through the writing of his detractors.Louis Berkhof, The History of Christian Doctrines (Grand Rapids, MI: WM. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1949), 83.

Current opposition While Oneness Pentecostals seek to differentiate themselves from ancient Sabellianism, modern theologians such as James R. White and Robert Morey see no significant difference between the ancient heresy of Sabellianism and current Oneness doctrine. This is based on the denial by Oneness Pentecostals of the Trinity, especially of the Divinity and Eternality of the Son of God, based upon a denial of the distinction between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.James R. White, The Forgotten Trinity (Minneapolis, MN: Bethany House Publishers, 1998), 153. Sabellianism, Patripassianism, Modalistic Monarchianism, functionalism, Jesus Only, Father Only, and Oneness Pentecostalism are viewed by these theologians as being derived from a Platonic doctrine that God was an indivisible Monad and could not be differentiated as distinct Persons.Robert A. Morey, The Trinity: Evidence and Issues (Iowa Falls, IA: World Pub., 1996), 502‚Äì507.

Equivalently, a module M is simple if and only if every cyclic submodule generated by a non-zero element of M equals M. Simple modules form building blocks for the modules of finite length, and they are analogous to the simple groups in group theory. In this article, all modules will be assumed to be right unital modules over a ring R.  Examples  Z-modules are the same as abelian groups, so a simple Z-module is an abelian group which has no non-zero proper subgroups. These are the cyclic groups of prime order. If I is a right ideal of R, then I is simple as a right module if and only if I is a minimal non-zero right ideal: If M is a non-zero proper submodule of I, then it is also a right ideal, so I is not minimal. Conversely, if I is not minimal, then there is a non-zero right ideal J properly contained in I. J is a right submodule of I, so I is not simple. If I is a right ideal of R, then the quotient module R/I is simple if and only if I is a maximal right ideal: If M is a non-zero proper submodule of R/I, then the preimage of M under the quotient map is a right ideal which is not equal to R and which properly contains I. Therefore, I is not maximal. Conversely, if I is not maximal, then there is a right ideal J properly containing I. The quotient map has a non- zero kernel which is not equal to , and therefore is not simple. Every simple R-module is isomorphic to a quotient R/m where m is a maximal right ideal of R.Herstein, Non-commutative Ring Theory, Lemma 1.1.3 By the above paragraph, any quotient R/m is a simple module. Conversely, suppose that M is a simple R-module. Then, for any non-zero element x of M, the cyclic submodule xR must equal M. Fix such an x. The statement that xR = M is equivalent to the surjectivity of the homomorphism that sends r to xr. The kernel of this homomorphism is a right ideal I of R, and a standard theorem states that M is isomorphic to R/I. By the above paragraph, we find that I is a maximal right ideal. Therefore, M is isomorphic to a quotient of R by a maximal right ideal. If k is a field and G is a group, then a group representation of G is a left module over the group ring k[G] (for details, see the main page on this relationship). The simple k[G] modules are also known as irreducible representations. A major aim of representation theory is to understand the irreducible representations of groups.  Basic properties of simple modules  The simple modules are precisely the modules of length 1; this is a reformulation of the definition. Every simple module is indecomposable, but the converse is in general not true. Every simple module is cyclic, that is it is generated by one element. Not every module has a simple submodule; consider for instance the Z-module Z in light of the first example above. Let M and N be (left or right) modules over the same ring, and let be a module homomorphism. If M is simple, then f is either the zero homomorphism or injective because the kernel of f is a submodule of M. If N is simple, then f is either the zero homomorphism or surjective because the image of f is a submodule of N. If M = N, then f is an endomorphism of M, and if M is simple, then the prior two statements imply that f is either the zero homomorphism or an isomorphism. Consequently, the endomorphism ring of any simple module is a division ring. This result is known as Schur's lemma. The converse of Schur's lemma is not true in general. For example, the Z-module Q is not simple, but its endomorphism ring is isomorphic to the field Q.  Simple modules and composition series  If M is a module which has a non-zero proper submodule N, then there is a short exact sequence :0 \\\\to N \\\\to M \\\\to M/N \\\\to 0. A common approach to proving a fact about M is to show that the fact is true for the center term of a short exact sequence when it is true for the left and right terms, then to prove the fact for N and M/N. If N has a non-zero proper submodule, then this process can be repeated. This produces a chain of submodules :\\\\cdots \\\\subset M_2 \\\\subset M_1 \\\\subset M. In order to prove the fact this way, one needs conditions on this sequence and on the modules Mi/Mi + 1. One particularly useful condition is that the length of the sequence is finite and each quotient module Mi/Mi + 1 is simple. In this case the sequence is called a composition series for M. In order to prove a statement inductively using composition series, the statement is first proved for simple modules, which form the base case of the induction, and then the statement is proved to remain true under an extension of a module by a simple module. For example, the Fitting lemma shows that the endomorphism ring of a finite length indecomposable module is a local ring, so that the strong Krull-Schmidt theorem holds and the category of finite length modules is a Krull-Schmidt category. The Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem and the Schreier refinement theorem describe the relationships amongst all composition series of a single module. The Grothendieck group ignores the order in a composition series and views every finite length module as a formal sum of simple modules. Over semisimple rings, this is no loss as every module is a semisimple module and so a direct sum of simple modules. Ordinary character theory provides better arithmetic control, and uses simple CG modules to understand the structure of finite groups G. Modular representation theory uses Brauer characters to view modules as formal sums of simple modules, but is also interested in how those simple modules are joined together within composition series. This is formalized by studying the Ext functor and describing the module category in various ways including quivers (whose nodes are the simple modules and whose edges are composition series of non-semisimple modules of length 2) and Auslander‚ÄìReiten theory where the associated graph has a vertex for every indecomposable module.  The Jacobson density theorem  An important advance in the theory of simple modules was the Jacobson density theorem. The Jacobson density theorem states: :Let U be a simple right R-module and write D = EndR(U). Let A be any D-linear operator on U and let X be a finite D-linearly independent subset of U. Then there exists an element r of R such that x*A = x*r for all x in X.Isaacs, Theorem 13.14, p. 185 In particular, any primitive ring may be viewed as (that is, isomorphic to) a ring of D-linear operators on some D-space. A consequence of the Jacobson density theorem is Wedderburn's theorem; namely that any right artinian simple ring is isomorphic to a full matrix ring of n-by-n matrices over a division ring for some n. This can also be established as a corollary of the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem.

Two types of technology share the name \\"sonar\\": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of \\"targets\\" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward-looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics. The first recorded use of the technique was by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490 who used a tube inserted into the water to detect vessels by ear. It was developed during World War I to counter the growing threat of submarine warfare, with an operational passive sonar system in use by 1918. Modern active sonar systems use an acoustic transducer to generate a sound wave which is reflected from target objects.  History  Although some animals (dolphins, bats, some shrews, and others) have used sound for communication and object detection for millions of years, use by humans in the water is initially recorded by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490: a tube inserted into the water was said to be used to detect vessels by placing an ear to the tube. In the late 19th century an underwater bell was used as an ancillary to lighthouses or lightships to provide warning of hazards.Thomas Neighbors, David Bradley (ed), Applied Underwater Acoustics: Leif Bj√∏rn√∏ , Elsevier, 2017 , page 8 The use of sound to \\"echo-locate\\" underwater in the same way as bats use sound for aerial navigation seems to have been prompted by the disaster of 1912.M. A. Ainslie (2010), Principles of Sonar Performance Modeling, Springer, p10 The world's first patent for an underwater echo- ranging device was filed at the British Patent Office by English meteorologist Lewis Fry Richardson a month after the sinking of Titanic, and a German physicist Alexander Behm obtained a patent for an echo sounder in 1913.W. Hackmann (1984), Seek and Strike, pn The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden, while working for the Submarine Signal Company in Boston, Massachusetts, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. In that test, Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding, underwater communications (Morse code) and echo ranging (detecting an iceberg at a range). (quoted in a NOAA transcript by Central Library staff April, 2002 . The \\"Fessenden oscillator\\", operated at about 500 Hz frequency, was unable to determine the bearing of the iceberg due to the 3-metre wavelength and the small dimension of the transducer's radiating face (less than wavelength in diameter). The ten Montreal-built British H-class submarines launched in 1915 were equipped with Fessenden oscillators. During World War I the need to detect submarines prompted more research into the use of sound. The British made early use of underwater listening devices called hydrophones, while the French physicist Paul Langevin, working with a Russian immigrant electrical engineer Constantin Chilowsky, worked on the development of active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915. Although piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used, this work influenced future designs. Lightweight sound-sensitive plastic film and fibre optics have been used for hydrophones, while Terfenol-D and PMN (lead magnesium niobate) have been developed for projectors. = ASDIC = ASDIC display unit around 1944 In 1916, under the British Board of Invention and Research, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle took on the active sound detection project with A. B. Wood, producing a prototype for testing in mid-1917. This work, for the Anti-Submarine Division of the British Naval Staff, was undertaken in utmost secrecy, and used quartz piezoelectric crystals to produce the world's first practical underwater active sound detection apparatus. To maintain secrecy, no mention of sound experimentation or quartz was made ‚Äì the word used to describe the early work (\\"supersonics\\") was changed to \\"ASD\\"ics, and the quartz material to \\"ASD\\"ivite: \\"ASD\\" for \\"Anti-Submarine Division\\", hence the British acronym ASDIC. In 1939, in response to a question from the Oxford English Dictionary, the Admiralty made up the story that it stood for \\"Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee\\", and this is still widely believed, though no committee bearing this name has been found in the Admiralty archives.W. Hackmann, Seek & Strike: Sonar, anti-submarine warfare and the Royal Navy 1914‚Äì54 (HMSO, London, 1984). By 1918, Britain and France had built prototype active systems. The British tested their ASDIC on in 1920 and started production in 1922. The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC-equipped vessels in 1923. An anti-submarine school HMS Osprey and a training flotilla of four vessels were established on Portland in 1924. By the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines, incorporated into a complete anti-submarine system. The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hampered by the use of the depth charge as an anti-submarine weapon. This required an attacking vessel to pass over a submerged contact before dropping charges over the stern, resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack. The hunter was effectively firing blind, during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action. This situation was remedied with new tactics and new weapons. The tactical improvements developed by Frederic John Walker included the creeping attack. 2 anti-submarine ships were needed for this (usually sloops or corvettes). The \\"directing ship\\" tracked the target submarine on ASDIC from a position about 1500 to 2000 yards behind the submarine. The second ship, with her ASDIC turned off and running at 5 knots, started an attack from a position between the directing ship and the target. This attack was controlled by radio telephone from the directing ship, based on their ASDIC and the range (by rangefinder) and bearing of the attacking ship. As soon as the depth charges had been released, the attacking ship left the immediate area at full speed. The directing ship then entered the target area and also released a pattern of depth charges. The low speed of the approach meant the submarine could not predict when depth charges were going to be released. Any evasive action was detected by the directing ship and steering orders to the attacking ship given accordingly. The low speed of the attack had the advantage that the German acoustic torpedo was not effective against a warship travelling so slowly. A variation of the creeping attack was the \\"plaster\\" attack, in which 3 attacking ships working in a close line abreast were directed over the target by the directing ship. The new weapons to deal with the ASDIC blind spot were \\"ahead-throwing weapons\\", such as Hedgehogs and later Squids, which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and still in ASDIC contact. These allowed a single escort to make better aimed attacks on submarines. Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets that used several different shapes of beam, continuously covering blind spots. Later, acoustic torpedoes were used. Early in World War II (September 1940), British ASDIC technology was transferred for free to the United States. Research on ASDIC and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US. Many new types of military sound detection were developed. These included sonobuoys, first developed by the British in 1944 under the codename High Tea, dipping/dunking sonar and mine-detection sonar. This work formed the basis for post-war developments related to countering the nuclear submarine. = SONAR = During the 1930s American engineers developed their own underwater sound-detection technology, and important discoveries were made, such as the existence of thermoclines and their effects on sound waves. Americans began to use the term SONAR for their systems, coined by Frederick Hunt to be the equivalent of RADAR. = US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory = In 1917, the US Navy acquired J. Warren Horton's services for the first time. On leave from Bell Labs, he served the government as a technical expert, first at the experimental station at Nahant, Massachusetts, and later at US Naval Headquarters, in London, England. At Nahant he applied the newly developed vacuum tube, then associated with the formative stages of the field of applied science now known as electronics, to the detection of underwater signals. As a result, the carbon button microphone, which had been used in earlier detection equipment, was replaced by the precursor of the modern hydrophone. Also during this period, he experimented with methods for towing detection. This was due to the increased sensitivity of his device. The principles are still used in modern towed sonar systems. To meet the defense needs of Great Britain, he was sent to England to install in the Irish Sea bottom-mounted hydrophones connected to a shore listening post by submarine cable. While this equipment was being loaded on the cable-laying vessel, World War I ended and Horton returned home. During World War II, he continued to develop sonar systems that could detect submarines, mines, and torpedoes. He published Fundamentals of Sonar in 1957 as chief research consultant at the US Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory. He held this position until 1959 when he became technical director, a position he held until mandatory retirement in 1963.from Dr. Horton's autobiographical sketch and US Department of the Navy Undersea Warfare Center = Materials and designs in the US and Japan = There was little progress in US sonar from 1915 to 1940. In 1940, US sonars typically consisted of a magnetostrictive transducer and an array of nickel tubes connected to a 1-foot-diameter steel plate attached back-to-back to a Rochelle salt crystal in a spherical housing. This assembly penetrated the ship hull and was manually rotated to the desired angle. The piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystal had better parameters, but the magnetostrictive unit was much more reliable. High losses to US merchant supply shipping early in World War II led to large scale high priority US research in the field, pursuing both improvements in magnetostrictive transducer parameters and Rochelle salt reliability. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP), a superior alternative, was found as a replacement for Rochelle salt; the first application was a replacement of the 24 kHz Rochelle-salt transducers. Within nine months, Rochelle salt was obsolete. The ADP manufacturing facility grew from few dozen personnel in early 1940 to several thousands in 1942. One of the earliest application of ADP crystals were hydrophones for acoustic mines; the crystals were specified for low-frequency cutoff at 5 Hz, withstanding mechanical shock for deployment from aircraft from , and ability to survive neighbouring mine explosions. One of key features of ADP reliability is its zero aging characteristics; the crystal keeps its parameters even over prolonged storage. Another application was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were mounted on the torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar ‚Äì a transducer was added to the torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows. Passive sonar arrays for submarines were developed from ADP crystals. Several crystal assemblies were arranged in a steel tube, vacuum-filled with castor oil, and sealed. The tubes then were mounted in parallel arrays. The standard US Navy scanning sonar at the end of World War II operated at 18 kHz, using an array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5 kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and \\"expendable modular design\\", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.Frank Massa. Sonar Transducers: A History The Imperial Japanese Navy at the onset of World War II used projectors based on quartz. These were big and heavy, especially if designed for lower frequencies; the one for Type 91 set, operating at 9 kHz, had a diameter of and was driven by an oscillator with 5 kW power and 7 kV of output amplitude. The Type 93 projectors consisted of solid sandwiches of quartz, assembled into spherical cast iron bodies. The Type 93 sonars were later replaced with Type 3, which followed German design and used magnetostrictive projectors; the projectors consisted of two rectangular identical independent units in a cast iron rectangular body about . The exposed area was half the wavelength wide and three wavelengths high. The magnetostrictive cores were made from 4 mm stampings of nickel, and later of an iron-aluminium alloy with aluminium content between 12.7% and 12.9%. The power was provided from a 2 kW at 3.8 kV, with polarization from a 20 V, 8 A DC source. The passive hydrophones of the Imperial Japanese Navy were based on moving-coil design, Rochelle salt piezo transducers, and carbon microphones. = Later developments in transducers = Magnetostrictive transducers were pursued after World War II as an alternative to piezoelectric ones. Nickel scroll-wound ring transducers were used for high-power low-frequency operations, with size up to in diameter, probably the largest individual sonar transducers ever. The advantage of metals is their high tensile strength and low input electrical impedance, but they have electrical losses and lower coupling coefficient than PZT, whose tensile strength can be increased by prestressing. Other materials were also tried; nonmetallic ferrites were promising for their low electrical conductivity resulting in low eddy current losses, Metglas offered high coupling coefficient, but they were inferior to PZT overall. In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent of these improved magnetostrictive materials is Galfenol. Other types of transducers include variable-reluctance (or moving- armature, or electromagnetic) transducers, where magnetic force acts on the surfaces of gaps, and moving coil (or electrodynamic) transducers, similar to conventional speakers; the latter are used in underwater sound calibration, due to their very low resonance frequencies and flat broadband characteristics above them.  Active sonar  Principle of an active sonar Active sonar uses a sound transmitter (or projector) and a receiver. When the two are in the same place it is monostatic operation. When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation. When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation. Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically. Active sonar creates a pulse of sound, often called a \\"ping\\", and then listens for reflections (echo) of the pulse. This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector consisting of a signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer/array. A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals (\\"pings\\"). A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the electro-acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system. Occasionally, the acoustic pulse may be created by other means, e.g. chemically using explosives, airguns or plasma sound sources. To measure the distance to an object, the time from transmission of a pulse to reception is measured and converted into a range using the known speed of sound. To measure the bearing, several hydrophones are used, and the set measures the relative arrival time to each, or with an array of hydrophones, by measuring the relative amplitude in beams formed through a process called beamforming. Use of an array reduces the spatial response so that to provide wide cover multibeam systems are used. The target signal (if present) together with noise is then passed through various forms of signal processing, which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement. It is then presented to some form of decision device that calls the output either the required signal or noise. This decision device may be an operator with headphones or a display, or in more sophisticated sonars this function may be carried out by software. Further processes may be carried out to classify the target and localise it, as well as measuring its velocity. The pulse may be at constant frequency or a chirp of changing frequency (to allow pulse compression on reception). Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement, while more complex ones generally include the latter technique. Since digital processing became available pulse compression has usually been implemented using digital correlation techniques. Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all-round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc, although the beam may be rotated, relatively slowly, by mechanical scanning. Particularly when single frequency transmissions are used, the Doppler effect can be used to measure the radial speed of a target. The difference in frequency between the transmitted and received signal is measured and converted into a velocity. Since Doppler shifts can be introduced by either receiver or target motion, allowance has to be made for the radial speed of the searching platform. One useful small sonar is similar in appearance to a waterproof flashlight. The head is pointed into the water, a button is pressed, and the device displays the distance to the target. Another variant is a \\"fishfinder\\" that shows a small display with shoals of fish. Some civilian sonars (which are not designed for stealth) approach active military sonars in capability, with three-dimensional displays of the area near the boat. When active sonar is used to measure the distance from the transducer to the bottom, it is known as echo sounding. Similar methods may be used looking upward for wave measurement. Active sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water. In combat situations, an active pulse can be detected by an enemy and will reveal a submarine's position at twice the maximum distance that the submarine can itself detect a contact and give clues as to the submarines identity based on the characteristics of the outgoing ping. For these reasons, active sonar is not frequently used by military submarines. A very directional, but low-efficiency, type of sonar (used by fisheries, military, and for port security) makes use of a complex nonlinear feature of water known as non-linear sonar, the virtual transducer being known as a parametric array. = Project Artemis = Project Artemis was an experimental research and development project in the late 1950s to mid 1960s to examine acoustic propagation and signal processing for a low-frequency active sonar system that might be used for ocean surveillance. A secondary objective was examination of engineering problems of fixed active bottom systems. The receiving array was located on the slope of Plantagnet Bank off Bermuda. The active source array was deployed from the converted World War II tanker . Elements of Artemis were used experimentally after the main experiment was terminated. = Transponder = This is an active sonar device that receives a specific stimulus and immediately (or with a delay) retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one. Transponders can be used to remotely activate or recover subsea equipment. = Performance prediction = A sonar target is small relative to the sphere, centred around the emitter, on which it is located. Therefore, the power of the reflected signal is very low, several orders of magnitude less than the original signal. Even if the reflected signal was of the same power, the following example (using hypothetical values) shows the problem: Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10,000 W/m2 signal at 1 m, and detecting a 0.001 W/m2 signal. At 100 m the signal will be 1 W/m2 (due to the inverse-square law). If the entire signal is reflected from a 10 m2 target, it will be at 0.001 W/m2 when it reaches the emitter, i.e. just detectable. However, the original signal will remain above 0.001 W/m2 until 3000 m. Any 10 m2 target between 100 and 3000 m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse, but would not be detected by the emitter. The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes. Since the original signal is much more powerful, it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar (as in the example). Active sonar have two performance limitations: due to noise and reverberation. In general, one or other of these will dominate, so that the two effects can be initially considered separately. In noise-limited conditions at initial detection:ISO 18405:2017 Underwater acoustics - terminology. Sonar equation, entry 3.6.2.3 :SL ‚àí 2PL + TS ‚àí (NL ‚àí AG) = DT, where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss (sometimes referred to as transmission loss), TS is the target strength, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain of the receiving array (sometimes approximated by its directivity index) and DT is the detection threshold. In reverberation-limited conditions at initial detection (neglecting array gain): :SL ‚àí 2PL + TS = RL + DT, where RL is the reverberation level, and the other factors are as before. = Hand-held sonar for use by a diver = *The LIMIS (limpet mine imaging sonar) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar for use by a diver. Its name is because it was designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water. *The LUIS (lensing underwater imaging system) is another imaging sonar for use by a diver. *There is or was a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers, that merely displays range. *For the INSS (integrated navigation sonar system) Passive sonar Passive sonar listens without transmitting. It is often employed in military settings, although it is also used in science applications, e.g., detecting fish for presence/absence studies in various aquatic environments ‚Äì see also passive acoustics and passive radar. In the very broadest usage, this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound, though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment. =Identifying sound sources= Passive sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying the source of a detected sound. For example, U.S. vessels usually operate 60 Hz alternating current power systems. If transformers or generators are mounted without proper vibration insulation from the hull or become flooded, the 60 Hz sound from the windings can be emitted from the submarine or ship. This can help to identify its nationality, as all European submarines and nearly every other nation's submarine have 50 Hz power systems. Intermittent sound sources (such as a wrench being dropped), called \\"transients,\\" may also be detectable to passive sonar. Until fairly recently, an experienced, trained operator identified signals, but now computers may do this. Passive sonar systems may have large sonic databases, but the sonar operator usually finally classifies the signals manually. A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships, actions (i.e. the speed of a ship, or the type of weapon released), and even particular ships. =Noise limitations= Passive sonar on vehicles is usually severely limited because of noise generated by the vehicle. For this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles' propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound. The sonar hydrophones may be towed behind the ship or submarine in order to reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself. Towed units also combat the thermocline, as the unit may be towed above or below the thermocline. The display of most passive sonars used to be a two-dimensional waterfall display. The horizontal direction of the display is bearing. The vertical is frequency, or sometimes time. Another display technique is to color-code frequency-time information for bearing. More recent displays are generated by the computers, and mimic radar-type plan position indicator displays. =Performance prediction= Unlike active sonar, only one-way propagation is involved. Because of the different signal processing used, the minimal detectable signal-to-noise ratio will be different. The equation for determining the performance of a passive sonar isM. A. Ainslie (2010), Principles of Sonar Performance Modeling, Springer, p68 :SL ‚àí PL = NL ‚àí AG + DT, where SL is the source level, PL is the propagation loss, NL is the noise level, AG is the array gain and DT is the detection threshold. The figure of merit of a passive sonar is :FOM = SL + AG ‚àí (NL + DT).  Performance factors  The detection, classification and localisation performance of a sonar depends on the environment and the receiving equipment, as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a passive sonar. = Sound propagation = Sonar operation is affected by variations in sound speed, particularly in the vertical plane. Sound travels more slowly in fresh water than in sea water, though the difference is small. The speed is determined by the water's bulk modulus and mass density. The bulk modulus is affected by temperature, dissolved impurities (usually salinity), and pressure. The density effect is small. The speed of sound (in feet per second) is approximately: :4388 + (11.25 √ó temperature (in ¬∞F)) + (0.0182 √ó depth (in feet)) + salinity (in parts-per-thousand ). This empirically derived approximation equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths. Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make up the rest of the ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, through the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law. If the sound source is deep and the conditions are right, propagation may occur in the 'deep sound channel'. This provides extremely low propagation loss to a receiver in the channel. This is because of sound trapping in the channel with no losses at the boundaries. Similar propagation can occur in the 'surface duct' under suitable conditions. However, in this case there are reflection losses at the surface. In shallow water propagation is generally by repeated reflection at the surface and bottom, where considerable losses can occur. Sound propagation is affected by absorption in the water itself as well as at the surface and bottom. This absorption depends upon frequency, with several different mechanisms in sea water. Long-range sonar uses low frequencies to minimise absorption effects. The sea contains many sources of noise that interfere with the desired target echo or signature. The main noise sources are waves and shipping. The motion of the receiver through the water can also cause speed-dependent low frequency noise. =Scattering= When active sonar is used, scattering occurs from small objects in the sea as well as from the bottom and surface. This can be a major source of interference. This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car's headlights in fog: a high-intensity pencil beam will penetrate the fog to some extent, but broader-beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions, much of which is scattered back to the observer, overwhelming that reflected from the target (\\"white-out\\"). For analogous reasons active sonar needs to transmit in a narrow beam to minimize scattering. Bubble clouds shown under the sea. From ref. The scattering of sonar from objects (mines, pipelines, zooplankton, geological features, fish etc.) is how active sonar detects them, but this ability can be masked by strong scattering from false targets, or 'clutter'. Where they occur (under breaking waves; in ship wakes; in gas emitted from seabed seeps and leaks etc.), gas bubbles are powerful sources of clutter, and can readily hide targets. TWIPS (Twin Inverted Pulse Sonar) is currently the only sonar that can overcome this clutter problem.Comparison of Standard Sonar and TWIPS in finding a target in bubbly water. Adapted from ref. This is important as many recent conflicts have occurred in coastal waters, and the inability to detect whether mines are present or not present hazards and delays to military vessels, and also to aid convoys and merchant shipping trying to support the region long after the conflict has ceased. =Target characteristics= The sound reflection characteristics of the target of an active sonar, such as a submarine, are known as its target strength. A complication is that echoes are also obtained from other objects in the sea such as whales, wakes, schools of fish and rocks. Passive sonar detects the target's radiated noise characteristics. The radiated spectrum comprises a continuous spectrum of noise with peaks at certain frequencies which can be used for classification. =Countermeasures= Active (powered) countermeasures may be launched by a submarine under attack to raise the noise level, provide a large false target, and obscure the signature of the submarine itself. Passive (i.e., non-powered) countermeasures include: * Mounting noise-generating devices on isolating devices. * Sound-absorbent coatings on the hulls of submarines, for example anechoic tiles.  Military applications  Modern naval warfare makes extensive use of both passive and active sonar from water-borne vessels, aircraft and fixed installations. Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect. The use of active sonar by a submarine to determine bearing is extremely rare and will not necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates it is more important to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable. Since active sonar reveals the presence and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods to minimize the risk of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts. Passive sonar has several advantages, most importantly that it is silent. If the target radiated noise level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending on the level of noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar \\"sees\\" around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270¬∞, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160¬∞ on each side, and the towed array of a full 360¬∞. The invisible areas are due to the ship's own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as acoustic intelligence or ACINT. Another use of passive sonar is to determine the target's trajectory. This process is called target motion analysis (TMA), and the resultant \\"solution\\" is the target's range, course, and speed. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases. Passive sonar is stealthy and very useful. However, it requires high-tech electronic components and is costly. It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance detection. Surface ships use it to good effect; it is even better used by submarines, and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters, mostly to a \\"surprise effect\\", since submarines can hide under thermal layers. If a submarine's commander believes he is alone, he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect, or go deeper and faster, and thus make more sound. Examples of sonar applications in military use are given below. Many of the civil uses given in the following section may also be applicable to naval use. = Anti- submarine warfare = Variable depth sonar and its winch Until recently, ship sonars were usually with hull mounted arrays, either amidships or at the bow. It was soon found after their initial use that a means of reducing flow noise was required. The first were made of canvas on a framework, then steel ones were used. Now domes are usually made of reinforced plastic or pressurized rubber. Such sonars are primarily active in operation. An example of a conventional hull mounted sonar is the SQS-56. Because of the problems of ship noise, towed sonars are also used. These also have the advantage of being able to be placed deeper in the water. However, there are limitations on their use in shallow water. These are called towed arrays (linear) or variable depth sonars (VDS) with 2/3D arrays. A problem is that the winches required to deploy/recover these are large and expensive. VDS sets are primarily active in operation while towed arrays are passive. An example of a modern active- passive ship towed sonar is Sonar 2087 made by Thales Underwater Systems. = Torpedoes = Modern torpedoes are generally fitted with an active/passive sonar. This may be used to home directly on the target, but wake homing torpedoes are also used. An early example of an acoustic homer was the Mark 37 torpedo. Torpedo countermeasures can be towed or free. An early example was the German Sieglinde device while the Bold was a chemical device. A widely used US device was the towed AN/SLQ-25 Nixie while the mobile submarine simulator (MOSS) was a free device. A modern alternative to the Nixie system is the UK Royal Navy S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence system. = Mines = Mines may be fitted with a sonar to detect, localize and recognize the required target. An example is the CAPTOR mine. = Mine countermeasures = Mine countermeasure (MCM) sonar, sometimes called \\"mine and obstacle avoidance sonar (MOAS)\\", is a specialized type of sonar used for detecting small objects. Most MCM sonars are hull mounted but a few types are VDS design. An example of a hull mounted MCM sonar is the Type 2193 while the SQQ-32 mine- hunting sonar and Type 2093 systems are VDS designs. = Submarine navigation = Submarines rely on sonar to a greater extent than surface ships as they cannot use radar at depth. The sonar arrays may be hull mounted or towed. Information fitted on typical fits is given in and . = Aircraft = AN/AQS-13 Dipping sonar deployed from an H-3 Sea King Helicopters can be used for antisubmarine warfare by deploying fields of active-passive sonobuoys or can operate dipping sonar, such as the AQS-13. Fixed wing aircraft can also deploy sonobuoys and have greater endurance and capacity to deploy them. Processing from the sonobuoys or dipping sonar can be on the aircraft or on ship. Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions. Helicopters have also been used for mine countermeasure missions using towed sonars such as the AQS-20A. =Underwater communications= Dedicated sonars can be fitted to ships and submarines for underwater communication. =Ocean surveillance= The United States began a system of passive, fixed ocean surveillance systems in 1950 with the classified name Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) with American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;), with its Bell Laboratories research and Western Electric manufacturing entities being contracted for development and installation. The systems exploited the deep sound (SOFAR) channel and were based on an AT&T; sound spectrograph, which converted sound into a visual spectrogram representing a time‚Äìfrequency analysis of sound that was developed for speech analysis and modified to analyze low-frequency underwater sounds. That process was Low Frequency Analysis and Recording and the equipment was termed the Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder, both with the acronym LOFAR. LOFAR research was termed Jezebel and led to usage in air and surface systems, particularly sonobuys using the process and sometimes using \\"Jezebel\\" in their name. The proposed system offered such promise of long-range submarine detection that the Navy ordered immediate moves for implementation. Lofargram writers, one for each array beam, on a NAVFAC watch floor. Between installation of a test array followed by a full scale, forty element, prototype operational array in 1951 and 1958 systems were installed in the Atlantic and then the Pacific under the unclassified name Project Caesar. The original systems were terminated at classified shore stations designated Naval Facility (NAVFAC) explained as engaging in \\"ocean research\\" to cover their classified mission. The system was upgraded multiple times with more advanced cable allowing the arrays to be installed in ocean basins and upgraded processing. The shore stations were eliminated in a process of consolidation and rerouting the arrays to central processing centers into the 1990s. In 1985, with new mobile arrays and other systems becoming operational the collective system name was changed to Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). In 1991 the mission of the system was declassified. The year before IUSS insignia were authorized for wear. Access was granted to some systems for scientific research. A similar system is believed to have been operated by the Soviet Union. =Underwater security= Sonar can be used to detect frogmen and other scuba divers. This can be applicable around ships or at entrances to ports. Active sonar can also be used as a deterrent and/or disablement mechanism. One such device is the Cerberus system. = Hand-held sonar = AN/PQS-2A handheld sonar, shown with detachable flotation collar and magnetic compass Limpet mine imaging sonar (LIMIS) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water. The LUIS is another imaging sonar for use by a diver. Integrated navigation sonar system (INSS) is a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers that displays range. = Intercept sonar = This is a sonar designed to detect and locate the transmissions from hostile active sonars. An example of this is the Type 2082 fitted on the British s.  Civilian applications  = Fisheries = Fishing is an important industry that is seeing growing demand, but world catch tonnage is falling as a result of serious resource problems. The industry faces a future of continuing worldwide consolidation until a point of sustainability can be reached. However, the consolidation of the fishing fleets are driving increased demands for sophisticated fish finding electronics such as sensors, sounders and sonars. Historically, fishermen have used many different techniques to find and harvest fish. However, acoustic technology has been one of the most important driving forces behind the development of the modern commercial fisheries. Sound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish's air-filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition. Cabin display of a fish finder sonar Companies such as eSonar, Raymarine, Marport Canada, Wesmar, Furuno, Krupp, and Simrad make a variety of sonar and acoustic instruments for the deep sea commercial fishing industry. For example, net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel. Each sensor is equipped with one or more acoustic transducers depending on its specific function. Data is transmitted from the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone. The analog signals are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for graphical display on a high resolution monitor. =Echo sounding= Echo sounding is a process used to determine the depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return. The value of underwater acoustics to the fishing industry has led to the development of other acoustic instruments that operate in a similar fashion to echo-sounders but, because their function is slightly different from the initial model of the echo-sounder, have been given different terms. = Net location = The net sounder is an echo sounder with a transducer mounted on the headline of the net rather than on the bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable-less net-sounder ‚Äì such as Marport's Trawl Explorer ‚Äì in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver-hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver. The display on a net sounder shows the distance of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo- sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net. Modern versions of the net sounder, using multiple element transducers, function more like a sonar than an echo sounder and show slices of the area in front of the net and not merely the vertical view that the initial net sounders used. The sonar is an echo- sounder with a directional capability that can show fish or other objects around the vessel. = ROV and UUV = Small sonars have been fitted to remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) to allow their operation in murky conditions. These sonars are used for looking ahead of the vehicle. The Long-Term Mine Reconnaissance System is a UUV for MCM purposes. = Vehicle location = Sonars which act as beacons are fitted to aircraft to allow their location in the event of a crash in the sea. Short and long baseline sonars may be used for caring out the location, such as LBL. = Prosthesis for the visually impaired = In 2013 an inventor in the United States unveiled a \\"spider-sense\\" bodysuit, equipped with ultrasonic sensors and haptic feedback systems, which alerts the wearer of incoming threats; allowing them to respond to attackers even when blindfolded.  Scientific applications  = Biomass estimation = Detection of fish, and other marine and aquatic life, and estimation their individual sizes or total biomass using active sonar techniques. As the sound pulse travels through water it encounters objects that are of different density or acoustic characteristics than the surrounding medium, such as fish, that reflect sound back toward the sound source. These echoes provide information on fish size, location, abundance and behavior. Data is usually processed and analysed using a variety of software such as Echoview. = Wave measurement = An upward looking echo sounder mounted on the bottom or on a platform may be used to make measurements of wave height and period. From this statistics of the surface conditions at a location can be derived. = Water velocity measurement = Special short range sonars have been developed to allow measurements of water velocity. = Bottom type assessment = Sonars have been developed that can be used to characterise the sea bottom into, for example, mud, sand, and gravel. Relatively simple sonars such as echo sounders can be promoted to seafloor classification systems via add-on modules, converting echo parameters into sediment type. Different algorithms exist, but they are all based on changes in the energy or shape of the reflected sounder pings. Advanced substrate classification analysis can be achieved using calibrated (scientific) echosounders and parametric or fuzzy-logic analysis of the acoustic data. = Bathymetric mapping = Graphic depicting hydrographic survey ship conducting multibeam and side-scan sonar operations Side-scan sonars can be used to derive maps of seafloor topography (bathymetry) by moving the sonar across it just above the bottom. Low frequency sonars such as GLORIA have been used for continental shelf wide surveys while high frequency sonars are used for more detailed surveys of smaller areas. = Sub-bottom profiling = Powerful low frequency echo-sounders have been developed for providing profiles of the upper layers of the ocean bottom. = Gas leak detection from the seabed = Gas bubbles can leak from the seabed, or close to it, from multiple sources. These can be detected by both passive and active sonar (shown in schematic figure by yellow and red systems respectively).Active (red) and passive (yellow) sonar detection of bubbles from seabed (natural seeps and CCSF leaks) and gas pipelines, taken from ref. Natural seeps of methane and carbon dioxide occur. Gas pipelines can leak, and it is important to be able to detect whether leakage occurs from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities (CCSFs; e.g. depleted oil wells into which extracted atmospheric carbon is stored). Quantification of the amount of gas leaking is difficult, and although estimates can be made use active and passive sonar, it is important to question their accuracy because of the assumptions inherent in making such estimations from sonar data. = Synthetic aperture sonar = Various synthetic aperture sonars have been built in the laboratory and some have entered use in mine-hunting and search systems. An explanation of their operation is given in synthetic aperture sonar. = Parametric sonar = Parametric sources use the non-linearity of water to generate the difference frequency between two high frequencies. A virtual end- fire array is formed. Such a projector has advantages of broad bandwidth, narrow beamwidth, and when fully developed and carefully measured it has no obvious sidelobes: see Parametric array. Its major disadvantage is very low efficiency of only a few percent.H O Berktay, Some Finite Amplitude Effects in Underwater Acoustics in V M Albers \\"Underwater Acoustics\\" 1967 P.J. Westervelt summarizes the trends involved.Westervelt, P. J. (1963). Parametric acoustic array. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 35(4), 535-537. = Sonar in extraterrestrial contexts = Use of both passive and active sonar has been proposed for various extraterrestrial uses,. An example of the use of active sonar is in determining the depth of hydrocarbon seas on Titan,Arvelo & Lorenz (2013), J Acoust Soc Am An example of the use of passive sonar is in the detection of methanefalls on Titan, It has been noted that those proposals which suggest use of sonar without taking proper account of the difference between the Earthly (atmosphere, ocean, mineral) environments and the extraterrestrial ones, can lead to erroneous values  Effect of sonar on marine life  = Effect on marine mammals = A humpback whale Research has shown that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings of marine mammals. Beaked whales, the most common casualty of the strandings, have been shown to be highly sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar. Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee away from the source of the sonar, while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins. The US Navy, which part-funded some of the studies, said that the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm, but they \\"will evaluate the effectiveness of [their] marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings\\". A 2008 US Supreme Court ruling on the use of sonar by the US Navy noted that there had been no cases where sonar had been conclusively shown to have harmed or killed a marine mammal.Winter vs. National Resources Defense Council No. 07‚Äì1239., October term, 2008 Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation systems, sometimes called biosonar to locate predators and prey. Research on the effects of sonar on blue whales in the Southern California Bight shows that mid-frequency sonar use disrupts the whales' feeding behavior. This indicates that sonar-induced disruption of feeding and displacement from high-quality prey patches could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on baleen whale foraging ecology, individual fitness and population health. A review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used was published in 2019. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier's beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations. The review suggested the strength of response of individual animals may depend on whether they had prior exposure to sonar, and that symptoms of decompression sickness have been found in stranded whales that may be a result of such response to sonar. It noted that in the Canary Islands where multiple strandings had been previously reported, no more mass strandings had occurred once naval exercises during which sonar was used were banned in the area, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur. =Effect on fish = High-intensity sonar sounds can create a small temporary shift in the hearing threshold of some fish.  Frequencies and resolutions  The frequencies of sonars range from infrasonic to above a megahertz. Generally, the lower frequencies have longer range, while the higher frequencies offer better resolution, and smaller size for a given directionality. To achieve reasonable directionality, frequencies below 1 kHz generally require large size, usually achieved as towed arrays. Low frequency sonars are loosely defined as 1‚Äì5 kHz, albeit some navies regard 5‚Äì7 kHz also as low frequency. Medium frequency is defined as 5‚Äì15 kHz. Another style of division considers low frequency to be under 1 kHz, and medium frequency at between 1‚Äì10 kHz. American World War II era sonars operated at a relatively high frequency of 20‚Äì30 kHz, to achieve directionality with reasonably small transducers, with typical maximum operational range of 2500 yd. Postwar sonars used lower frequencies to achieve longer range; e.g. SQS-4 operated at 10 kHz with range up to 5000 yd. SQS-26 and SQS-53 operated at 3 kHz with range up to 20,000 yd; their domes had size of approx. a 60-ft personnel boat, an upper size limit for conventional hull sonars. Achieving larger sizes by conformal sonar array spread over the hull has not been effective so far, for lower frequencies linear or towed arrays are therefore used. Japanese WW2 sonars operated at a range of frequencies. The Type 91, with 30 inch quartz projector, worked at 9 kHz. The Type 93, with smaller quartz projectors, operated at 17.5 kHz (model 5 at 16 or 19 kHz magnetostrictive) at powers between 1.7 and 2.5 kilowatts, with range of up to 6 km. The later Type 3, with German-design magnetostrictive transducers, operated at 13, 14.5, 16, or 20 kHz (by model), using twin transducers (except model 1 which had three single ones), at 0.2 to 2.5 kilowatts. The simple type used 14.5 kHz magnetostrictive transducers at 0.25 kW, driven by capacitive discharge instead of oscillators, with range up to 2.5 km. The sonar's resolution is angular; objects further apart are imaged with lower resolutions than nearby ones. Another source lists ranges and resolutions vs frequencies for sidescan sonars. 30 kHz provides low resolution with range of 1000‚Äì6000 m, 100 kHz gives medium resolution at 500‚Äì1000 m, 300 kHz gives high resolution at 150‚Äì500 m, and 600 kHz gives high resolution at 75‚Äì150 m. Longer range sonars are more adversely affected by nonhomogenities of water. Some environments, typically shallow waters near the coasts, have complicated terrain with many features; higher frequencies become necessary there.

It was later sold to Intel in 1997, who continued to manufacture it before replacing it with the XScale in the early 2000s. History According to Allen Baum, the StrongARM traces its history to attempts to make a low-power version of the DEC Alpha, which DEC's engineers quickly concluded was not possible. They then became interested in designs dedicated to low-power applications which led them to the ARM family. One of the only major users of the ARM for performance-related products at that time was Apple, whose Newton device was based on the ARM platform. DEC approached Apple wondering if they might be interested in a high-performance ARM, to which the Apple engineers replied \\"Phhht, yeah. You can‚Äôt do it, but, yeah, if you could we'd use it.\\" The StrongARM was a collaborative project between DEC and Advanced RISC Machines to create a faster ARM microprocessor. The StrongARM was designed to address the upper-end of the low-power embedded market, where users needed more performance than the ARM could deliver while being able to accept more external support. Targets were devices such as newer personal digital assistants and set-top boxes.Montanaro, James et al. (1997). \\"A 160-MHz, 32-b, 0.5-W CMOS RISC Microprocessor\\". Digital Technical Journal, vol. 9, no. 1. pp. 49-62. Traditionally, the semiconductor division of DEC was located in Massachusetts. In order to gain access to the design talent in Silicon Valley, DEC opened a design center in Palo Alto, California. This design center was led by Dan Dobberpuhl and was the main design site for the StrongARM project. Another design site that worked on the project was in Austin, Texas that was created by some ex-DEC designers returning from Apple Computer and Motorola. The project was set up in 1995, and quickly delivered their first design, the SA-110. DEC agreed to sell StrongARM to Intel as part of a lawsuit settlement in 1997. Intel used the StrongARM to replace their ailing line of RISC processors, the i860 and i960. When the semiconductor division of DEC was sold to Intel, many engineers from the Palo Alto design group moved to SiByte, a start-up company designing MIPS system-on-a-chip (SoC) products for the networking market. The Austin design group spun off to become Alchemy Semiconductor, another start-up company designing MIPS SoCs for the hand-held market. A new StrongARM core was developed by Intel and introduced in 2000 as the XScale. SA-110 The SA-110 was the first microprocessor in the StrongARM family. The first versions, operating at 100, 160, and 200 MHz, were announced on 5 February 1996.Digital Equipment Corporation (5 February 1996). \\"Digital Targets Supercharged StrongARM Chip At Consumer Electronics Market\\". Press release. When announced, samples of these versions were available, with volume production slated for mid-1996. Faster 166 and 233 MHz versions were announced on 12 September 1996.Digital Equipment Corporation (12 September 1996). \\"Digital's StrongARM Chips Pull Away in Embedded Race\\". Press release. Samples of these versions were available at announcement, with volume production slated for December 1996. Throughout 1996, the SA-110 was the highest performing microprocessor for portable devices.Turley, Jim (27 January 1997). \\"Embedded Vendors Seek Differentiation\\". Microprocessor Report, pp. 16-21. Towards the end of 1996 it was a leading CPU for internet/intranet appliances and thin client systems. The SA-110's first design win was the Apple MessagePad 2000.Turley, Jim (18 November 1996). \\"Newton First Design Win for StrongARM\\". Microprocessor Report, p. 5. It was also used in a number of products including the Acorn Computers Risc PC and Eidos Optima video editing system. The SA-110's lead designers were Daniel W. Dobberpuhl, Gregory W. Hoeppner, Liam Madden, and Richard T. Witek. =Description= The SA-110 had a simple microarchitecture. It was a scalar design that executed instructions in-order with a five-stage classic RISC pipeline. The microprocessor was partitioned into several blocks, the IBOX, EBOX, IMMU, DMMU, BIU, WB and PLL. The IBOX contained hardware that operated in the first two stages of the pipeline such as the program counter. It fetched, decoded and issued instructions. Instruction fetch occurs during the first stage, decode and issue during the second. The IBOX decodes the more complex instructions in the ARM instruction set by translating them into sequences of simpler instructions. The IBOX also handled branch instructions. The SA-110 did not have branch prediction hardware, but had mechanisms for their speedy processing. Execution starts at stage three. The hardware that operates during this stage is contained in the EBOX, which comprises the register file, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), barrel shifter, multiplier and condition code logic. The register file had three read ports and two write ports. The ALU and barrel shifter executed instructions in a single cycle. The multiplier is not pipelined and has a latency of multiple cycles. The IMMU and DMMU are memory management units for instructions and data, respectively. Each MMU contained a 32-entry fully associative translation lookaside buffer (TLB) that can map 4 KB, 64 KB or 1 MB pages. The write buffer (WB) has eight 16-byte entries. It enables the pipelining of stores. The bus interface unit (BIU) provided the SA-110 with an external interface. The PLL generates the internal clock signal from an external 3.68 MHz clock signal. It was not designed by DEC, but was contracted to the Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM) located in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland. The instruction cache and data cache each have a capacity of 16 KB and are 32-way set-associative and virtually addressed. The SA-110 was designed to be used with slow (and therefore low- cost) memory and therefore the high set associativity allows a higher hit rate than competing designs, and the use of virtual addresses allows memory to be simultaneously cached and uncached. The caches are responsible for most of the transistor count and they take up half the die area. The SA-110 contained 2.5 million transistors and is 7.8 mm by 6.4 mm large (49.92 mm2). It was fabricated by DEC in its proprietary CMOS-6 process at its Fab 6 fab in Hudson, Massachusetts. CMOS-6 was DEC's sixth-generation complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. CMOS-6 has a 0.35 ¬µm feature size, a 0.25 ¬µm effective channel length but for use with the SA-110, only three levels of aluminium interconnect. It used a power supply with a variable voltage of 1.2 to 2.2 volts (V) to enable designs to find a balance between power consumption and performance (higher voltages enable higher clock rates). The SA-110 was packaged in a 144-pin thin quad flat pack (TQFP). SA-1100 The SA-1100 was a derivative of the SA-110 developed by DEC. Announced in 1997, the SA-1100 was targeted for portable applications such as PDAs and differs from the SA-110 by providing a number of features that are desirable for such applications. To accommodate these features, the data cache was reduced in size to 8 KB. The extra features are integrated memory, PCMCIA, and color LCD controllers connected to an on-die system bus, and five serial I/O channels that are connected to a peripheral bus attached to the system bus. The memory controller supported FPM and EDO DRAM, SRAM, flash, and ROM. The PCMCIA controller supports two slots. The memory address and data bus is shared with the PCMCIA interface. Glue logic is required. The serial I/O channels implement a slave USB interface, a SDLC, two UARTs, an IrDA interface, a MCP, and a synchronous serial port. The SA-1100 had a companion chip, the SA-1101. It was introduced by Intel on 7 October 1998.Intel Corporation (7 October 1998). \\"Intel Introduces StrongARM Products for PC Companions\\". Press release. The SA-1101 provided additional peripherals to complement those integrated on the SA-1100 such as a video output port, two PS/2 ports, a USB controller and a PCMCIA controller that replaces that on the SA-1100. Design of the device started by DEC, but was only partially complete when acquired by Intel, who had to finish the design. It was fabricated at DEC's former Hudson, Massachusetts fabrication plant, which was also sold to Intel. The SA-1100 contained 2.5 million transistors and measured 8.24 mm by 9.12 mm (75.15 mm2). It was fabricated in a 0.35 Œºm CMOS process with three levels of aluminium interconnect and was packaged in a 208-pin TQFP.Stephany, R. et al. (1998). \\"A 200MHz 32b 0.5W CMOS RISC Microprocessor\\". ISSCC Digest of Technical Papers, pp. 238-239, 443. One of the early recipients of this processor was-ill-fated Psion netBook and its more consumer oriented sibling Psion Series 7. SA-1110 The SA-1110 was a derivative of the SA-110 developed by Intel. It was announced on 31 March 1999, positioned as an alternative to the SA-1100.Intel Corporation (31 March 1999). \\"Intel StrongARM Processor, Companion Chip Optimized For Handheld Computing Devices\\". Press release. At announcement, samples were set for June 1999 and volume later that year. Intel discontinued the SA-1110 in early 2003.Martyn Williams (14 February 2003). \\"Intel puts StrongArm on death row\\". InfoWorld. The SA-1110 was available in 133 or 206 MHz versions. It differed from the SA-1100 by featuring support for 66 MHz (133 MHz version only) or 103 MHz (206 MHz version only) SDRAM. Its companion chip, which provided additional support for peripherals, was the SA-1111. The SA-1110 was packaged in a 256-pin micro ball grid array. It was used in mobile phones, personal data assistants (PDAs) such as the Compaq (later HP) iPAQ and HP Jornada, the Sharp SL-5x00 Linux Based Platforms and the Simputer. It was also used to run the Intel Web Tablet, a tablet device that is considered potentially the first to introduce large screen, portable web browsing. Intel dropped the product just prior to launch in 2001. SA-1500 The SA-1500 was a derivative of the SA-110 developed by DEC initially targeted for set-top boxes.Rick Boyd-Merrit; Peter Clarke (24 July 1998). \\"Intel to reveal details on StrongARM chip\\". EE Times.Prashant P. Gandhi (18 August 1998). \\"SA-1500: A 300 MHz RISC CPU with Attached Media Processor\\" . Hot Chips 10. It was designed and manufactured in low volumes by DEC but was never put into production by Intel. The SA-1500 was available at 200 to 300 MHz. The SA-1500 featured an enhanced SA-110 core, an on-chip coprocessor called the Attached Media Processor (AMP), and an on-chip SDRAM and I/O bus controller. The SDRAM controller supported 100 MHz SDRAM, and the I/O controller implemented a 32-bit I/O bus that may run at frequencies up to 50 MHz for connecting to peripherals and the SA-1501 companion chip. The AMP implemented a long instruction word instruction set containing instructions designed for multimedia, such as integer and floating-point multiply‚Äìaccumulate and SIMD arithmetic. Each long instruction word is 64 bits wide and specifies an arithmetic operation and a branch or a load/store. Instructions operate on operands from a 64-entry 36-bit register file, and on a set of control registers. The AMP communicates with the SA-110 core via an on-chip bus and it shares the data cache with the SA-110. The AMP contained an ALU with a shifter, a branch unit, a load/store unit, a multiply‚Äìaccumulate unit, and a single-precision floating-point unit. The AMP supported user- defined instructions via a 512-entry writable control store. The SA-1501 companion chip provided additional video and audio processing capabilities and various I/O functions such as PS/2 ports, a parallel port, and interfaces for various peripherals. The SA-1500 contains 3.3 million transistors and measures 60 mm2. It was fabricated in a 0.28 ¬µm CMOS process. It used a 1.5 to 2.0 V internal power supply and 3.3 V I/O, consuming less than 0.5 W at 100 MHz and 2.5 W at 300 MHz. It was packaged in a 240-pin metal quad flat package or a 256-ball plastic ball grid array.  StrongARM latch  The StrongARM latch is an electronic latch circuit topology first proposed by Toshiba engineers Tsuguo Kobayashi et al. and got significant attention after being used in StrongARM microprocessors. It is widely used as a sense amplifier, a comparator, or just a robust latch with high sensitivity. References Further reading * \\"StrongARM-1500 Grapples With MPEG-2\\". (8 December 1997).

He joined the Israel Defense Forces in 1966 and served in the Paratroopers Brigade. He fought in the Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War, and Operation Entebbe with the paratroopers and Sayeret Matkal, an elite special forces unit. In 1998 he became the sixteenth IDF's Chief of the General Staff, serving until 2002. He is of Iranian Jewish ancestry. After leaving the army, he entered politics. He was appointed Minister of Defense in 2002, holding the position until 2006 when he was elected to the Knesset on the Kadima list. He then served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transportation and Road Safety until 2009. After becoming Kadima leader in March 2012 he became Leader of the Opposition, before returning to the cabinet during a 70-day spell in which he served as Acting Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister and Minister without Portfolio. Kadima was reduced to just two seats in the 2013 elections, and Mofaz retired from politics shortly before the 2015 elections. Biography =Early life and military career= Shaul Mofaz as Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz was born ShahrƒÅm MofazzazkƒÅr () on 4 November 1948 in Tehran, to Persian Jewish parents from Isfahan. Mofaz immigrated to Israel with his parents in 1957. Upon graduating from high school in 1966, he joined the Israel Defense Forces and served in the Paratroopers Brigade. He served in the Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War, and Operation Entebbe with the paratroopers and Sayeret Matkal, an elite special forces unit. The Chief of Staff Gen. Shaul Mofaz (right foreground) meets with U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz (left), and other senior U.S. Department of Defense officials in the Pentagon Mofaz served as an infantry brigade commander during the 1982 Lebanon War. Afterwards he attended the US Marine Corps Command and Staff College in Quantico, Virginia, United States. On his return he was briefly appointed commander of the Officers School, before returning to active service as commander of the 35th Paratroopers Brigade in 1986, and led its forces during Operation Law and Order.Gal Perl Finkel, Importance of IDF Ground Forces in new army appointments, The Jerusalem Post, February 21, 2019. Mofaz served in a series of senior military posts, having been promoted to the rank of Brigadier General (1988). In 1993 he was made commander of the IDF forces in the West Bank. In 1994, he was promoted to Major General, commanding the Southern Corps. His rapid rise continued; in 1997 Mofaz was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff and in 1998 he was appointed Chief of the General Staff. His term of Chief of Staff was noted for financial and structural reforms of the Israeli Army. But the most significant event in his tenure was the eruption of the Second Intifada in September, 2000. The tough tactics undertaken by Mofaz drew widespread concern from the international community but were broadly supported by the Israeli public. Controversy erupted over the offensive in Jenin, intermittent raids in the Gaza Strip, and the continued isolation of Yasser Arafat. Mofaz foresaw the wave of violence coming early as 1999 and prepared the IDF for intense guerrilla warfare in the territories. He fortified posts at the Gaza Strip and kept Israel Defense Forces casualties low. While he was known for claiming, \\"Israel has the most moral army in the world,\\"When it comes to its morality, Israel prefers not to be tried Haaretz, 8 Jan 2015, he drew criticism from both Israeli and international human rights monitoring groups because of the methods he had undertaken, including using armored bulldozers to demolish 2,500 Palestinian civilian homes, displacing thousands, in order to create a security \\"buffer zone\\" along the Rafah border. =Political career= Following a government crisis in 2002, Shaul Mofaz was appointed Defense Minister by Ariel Sharon.Shaul Mofaz Biography at Jewish Virtual Library Although he supported an agreement with the Palestinians, he was willing to make no compromise in the war against militant groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Tanzim, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. The fact that he had only recently left his position as IDF Chief of Staff prevented him from participating in the 2003 election (by which time Mofaz had joined Sharon's Likud). Nevertheless, Sharon reappointed him as Defense Minister in the new government. On 21 November 2005, Mofaz rejected Sharon's invitation to join his new party, Kadima, and instead announced his candidacy for the leadership of Likud. But, on 11 December 2005, one day after he promised he would never leave the Likud, he withdrew from both the leadership race and the Likud to join Kadima. Following the elections in late March 2006, Mofaz was moved from the position of Defense Minister and received the Transport ministry in the new Cabinet installed on 4 May 2006. In 2008, with Israel's then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, being pressured to resign due to corruption charges, Mofaz announced that he would run for the leadership of the Kadima party. Mofaz at a Kadima rally, 2009 On 5 August 2008, Mofaz officially entered the race to be leader of Kadima. That same day he received a blessing by Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. On 17 September 2008, he lost the Kadima party election, losing to Tzipi Livni for the spot of the Prime Minister and leader of Kadima. Livni's narrow margin of 431 votes was 43.1% to Shaul Mofaz's 42.0%, a huge difference from the 10 to 12-point exit polls margins. She said the \\"national responsibility (bestowed) by the public brings me to approach this job with great reverence\\". Mofaz accepted the Kadima primary's result, despite his lawyer, Yehuda Weinstein's appeal advice, and telephoned Livni congratulating her. Livni got 16,936 votes, with 16,505 votes, for Mofaz. Public Security Minister Avi Dichter and Interior Minister Meir Sheetrit had 6.5% and 8.5% respectively. Placed second on the Kadima list, Mofaz retained his seat in the 2009 elections, but lost his cabinet position after Likud formed the government. Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 2012 On 27 March 2012, Shaul Mofaz won the Kadima party leadership primaries by a landslide, defeating party chairwoman Tzipi Livni. Mofaz became Vice Prime Minister as part of a deal reached for a government of national unity with Binyamin Netanyahu. Mofaz said during the Kadima primaries that he would not join a government led by Netanyahu. Mofaz left over Netanyahu's indecision over a draft reform law and warned that the prime minister was trying to patch together a majority for a vote to plunge the region into war.Heller, Jeffrey. In 2013 Kadima, just 4 years prior the ruling party, received 2% of the votes, barely passing to the Knesset. In the buildup to the 2015 elections Kadima was not expect to pass the threshold, as it was raised to 3.25%. Mofaz negotiated with the Zionist Union alliance to bring Kadima onto their slate, but ended negotiations when it became clear he would not be their candidate for Defense Minister. Immediately after Mofaz announced he was not joining the Zionist Union slate, it was announced the former Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel) head Amos Yadlin was appointed to the Zionist Union slate and would be their candidate for Defense Minister. Within a week of his announcement that he was not running with the Zionist Union, Mofaz announced his retirement from politics.Israel election updates / Likud: Livni wrong on Congress' Iran sanctions Haaretz, 27 January 2015 In popular culture A fictionalized version of Mofaz appeared in the 2008 drama film Lemon Tree.LEMON TREE: Q&A; with Eran Riklis.

She was the highest-paid actress in the world in 2010 and 2014. In 2015, she was chosen as People's Most Beautiful Woman and was included in Time 100 most influential people in the world in 2010. She is the recipient of several accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. After making her acting debut with a minor role in the thriller Hangmen (1987), Bullock received early attention for her supporting work in the action film Demolition Man (1993). Her breakthrough came in the action thriller Speed (1994). She established herself in the 1990s with leading roles in the romantic comedies While You Were Sleeping (1995) and Hope Floats (1998), and the thrillers The Net (1995) and A Time to Kill (1996). Bullock achieved further success in the following decades with the comedies Miss Congeniality (2000), Two Weeks Notice (2002), The Proposal (2009), The Heat (2013), and Ocean's 8 (2018), the drama Crash (2004), and the thrillers Premonition (2007) and Bird Box (2018). Bullock was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama for portraying Leigh Anne Tuohy in the biographical drama The Blind Side (2009). She was nominated in the same categories for playing an astronaut stranded in space in the science fiction thriller Gravity (2013), which was her highest- grossing live-action release. In addition to her acting career, Bullock is the founder of the production company Fortis Films. She has produced some of the films in which she has starred, including Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2005) and All About Steve (2009). She was an executive producer of the ABC sitcom George Lopez (2002‚Äì2007) and made several appearances during its run.  Early life  Bullock was born in Arlington, Virginia, on July 26, 1964, the daughter of Helga Mathilde Meyer (1942‚Äì2000), an opera singer and voice teacher from Germany, and John W. Bullock (1925‚Äì2018), an Army employee and part-time voice coach from Birmingham, Alabama. Her father, who was in charge of the Army's Military Postal Service in Europe, was stationed in Nuremberg when he met her mother. Her parents married in Germany. Bullock's maternal grandfather was a German rocket scientist from Nuremberg. The family returned to Arlington, where her father worked with the Army Materiel Command before becoming a contractor for The Pentagon. Bullock has a younger sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, who served as president of Bullock's production company Fortis Films. For twelve years, Bullock was raised in Nuremberg, Germany and Vienna and Salzburg, Austria, and grew up speaking German. She had a Waldorf education in Nuremberg. As a child, while her mother went on European opera tours, Bullock usually stayed with her aunt Christl and cousin Susanne, the latter of whom later married politician Peter Ramsauer.\\"Flash, Die Bilder des Tages ‚Äì Echt bayerisch\\". Rhein-Zeitung. July 11, 2000. Retrieved December 7, 2016. Bullock studied ballet and vocal arts as a child and frequently accompanied her mother, taking small parts in her opera productions. In Nuremberg, she sang in the opera's children's choir. Bullock has a scar above her left eye which was caused by a fall into a creek when she was a child. While she maintains her American citizenship, Bullock applied for German citizenship in 2009. Bullock attended Washington-Lee High School, where she was a cheerleader and performed in school theater productions. After graduating in 1982, she attended East Carolina University (ECU) in Greenville, North Carolina, where she received a BFA in Drama in 1987. While at ECU, she performed in multiple theater productions including Peter Pan and Three Sisters. She then moved to Manhattan, New York, where she supported herself as a bartender, cocktail waitress, and coat checker while auditioning for roles.  Career  =Beginnings (1987‚Äì1993)= While in New York, Bullock took acting classes with Sanford Meisner. She appeared in several student films, and later landed a role in an Off-Broadway play No Time Flat. Director Alan J. Levi was impressed by Bullock's performance and offered her a part in the made-for-television film Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989). This led to her being cast in a series of small roles in several independent films as well as in the lead role of the short-lived NBC television version of the film Working Girl (1990). She went on to appear in several films, such as Love Potion No. 9 (1992), The Thing Called Love (1993) and Fire on the Amazon (1993), before rising to early prominence with her supporting role in the sci-fi action film Demolition Man (1993). =Worldwide exposure (1994‚Äì1999)= Bullock's big breakthrough came in 1994, when she played Annie Porter, a passenger eventually driving the bus in the smash-hit blockbuster Speed alongside fellow actor Keanu Reeves. She was required to read for Speed to ensure that there was the right chemistry between her and Reeves. She recalls that they had to do \\"all these really physical scenes together, rolling around on the floor and stuff.\\" Speed garnered acclaim from Rotten Tomatoes which deemed it a \\"terrific popcorn thriller [with] outstanding performances from Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and Sandra Bullock\\". It took in US$350 million worldwide. After the success of Speed, Bullock established herself as a Hollywood leading actress. In the romantic comedy While You Were Sleeping (1995), she portrayed a lonely Chicago Transit Authority token collector who saves the life of a man. While the film made US$182 million globally, it received positive reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reading: \\"While You Were Sleeping is built wholly from familiar ingredients, but assembled with such skill‚Äîand with such a charming performance from Sandra Bullock‚Äîthat it gives formula a good name.\\" She received her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 1995, Bullock also starred in the thriller The Net (1995) as a computer programmer who stumbles upon a conspiracy that puts her life and the lives of those around her in great danger. Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, complimented her performance saying \\"Bullock pulls you into the movie. Her overripe smile and clear, imploring eyes are sometimes evocative of Julia Roberts\\". The Net made US$110.6 million. Bullock at the Cannes Film Festival in 1996 In the crime drama A Time to Kill (1996), Bullock portrayed a member of the defense team, in the trial for the murder of two men who raped a young girl, opposite Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey and Kevin Spacey. She received a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance. The film grossed US$152 million around the world. Bullock subsequently received US$11 million for the critically panned Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997), which she agreed to star in for financial backing for her next project, Hope Floats (1998). She has stated that she regrets making the sequel. In Hope Floats she starred as an unassuming housewife whose life is disrupted when her husband (played by Michael Par√©) reveals his infidelity to her on a talk show. While the film made US$81.4 million, critic James Berardinelli remarked that her \\"undisputed strength lies in a blend of light drama and comedy\\". Bullock starred in comedy Practical Magic (1998) with Nicole Kidman as two witch sisters who face a curse which threatens to prevent them ever finding lasting love. While the film opened atop the chart on its North American opening weekend, it flopped at the box office. The same year she provided her voice as Miriam the animated adventure film The Prince of Egypt and wrote, produced, and directed the short film Making Sandwiches. Alongside Ben Affleck, she played a free-spirited drifter who begins to talk to a writer in the 1999 romantic comedy Forces of Nature. The film was a commercial hit, grossing US$93 million worldwide, and Boxoffice Magazine remarked: \\"The combination of Affleck's deadpan by-the-book persona with the spontaneity of Bullock's character sparks with convincing chemistry, their diverse personalities causing both to grow and bring to the surface what each is running away from or can't admit.\\" =Established career (2000‚Äì2008)= Bullock took on the role of an FBI agent who must go undercover as a beauty pageant contestant in the comedy Miss Congeniality (2000). It was a financial success, grossing US$212 million worldwide and earned Bullock another Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Also in 2000 she played a newspaper columnist obliged to enter a rehabilitation program for alcoholism in the dramedy 28 Days; it was a moderate commercial success with a global gross of US$62.1 million. Bullock produced the romantic comedy Kate & Leopold, released in 2001, then starred in the psychological thriller Murder by Numbers (2002) as a seasoned homicide detective. Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of a possible four, stating: \\"Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability, creating a character you'd like to like, and could like, if she weren't so sad, strange and turned in upon herself.\\" Bullock at the left Bullock teamed up with Hugh Grant for the romantic comedy Two Weeks Notice (2002) in which she starred as a lawyer who walks out on her boss. Liz Braun, of Jam! Movies, found Bullock and Grant to be \\"perfectly paired\\", stating: \\"The script allows the two actors to be at their comedic best, even though the film as a whole is amateurish in many ways\\". Two Weeks Notice made US$199 million globally. She was presented with the Raul Julia Award for Excellence in 2002 for helping expand career openings for Hispanic talent in the media and entertainment industry as the executive producer of the sitcom George Lopez (2002‚Äì2007). She also made several appearances on the show as Accident Amy, an accident-prone employee at the factory Lopez's character manages. As part of a large ensemble cast, Bullock played the wife of a district attorney in the drama Crash (2004), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. She received positive reviews for her performance; some critics suggested that it was the best performance of her career. In 2005, she received a US$17.5 million salary for Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous and was a co- recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award. In the romantic drama The Lake House (2006), Bullock reunited with Keanu Reeves although their characters were separated throughout the film; they were only on set together for two weeks during filming. The film had a negative critical response but made US$114.8 million. In 2006 Bullock played Harper Lee in Infamous, a drama based on George Plimpton's 1997 book, Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career. Bullock headlined the supernatural thriller Premonition (2007) as a housewife who experiences the days surrounding her husband's death in non-chronological order. Despite negative reviews, several critics, including Rex Reed, commended Bullock for her performance and the film grossed US$84.1 million around the globe. In 2008 Bullock was announced as the face of the cosmetic brand Artistry. = Critical recognition (2009‚Äì2014) = The Proposal in 2009alt=Sandra Bullock Bullock had two record highs in 2009. The romantic comedy The Proposal, with Ryan Reynolds, grossed US$317 million at the box office worldwide which made it her fourth-most successful picture to date. She received her third Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy. The drama The Blind Side opened at number two behind New Moon with US$34.2 million, making it her second-highest opening weekend ever. The Blind Side grossed over US$309 million, making it her highest-grossing domestic film, her fourth-highest- grossing film worldwide, and the first one in history to pass the US$200 million mark with only one top-billed female star. Bullock had initially turned down the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy three times due to discomfort in portraying a devout Christian. She was awarded the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. The Blind Side also received an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination. Winning the Oscar also gave Bullock another unique distinction‚Äîsince she won two Razzies the day before for her performance in All About Steve (2009)‚Äîshe is the only performer ever to have been named both best and worst for the same year. Following a two-year hiatus from the screen, Bullock starred alongside Tom Hanks as a widow of the September 11 attacks in the drama Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, a film adaptation based on the novel of the same name. Despite mixed reviews, the film was nominated for numerous awards including an Academy Award for Best Picture. Bullock was nominated for Best Actress Drama by Teen Choice Awards. In 2013, Bullock starred alongside Melissa McCarthy in the comedy The Heat as an FBI Special Agent who, along with a city detective, must take down a mobster in Boston. It received positive reviews from critics, and took in US$230 million at the box office worldwide. Bullock played an astronaut stranded in space in the sci-fi thriller Gravity, opposite George Clooney, which premiered at the 70th Venice Film Festival and was released on October 4, 2013 to coincide with the beginning of World Space Week. Gravity received universal acclaim among critics and a standing ovation in Venice. The film was called \\"the most realistic and beautifully choreographed film ever set in space\\" and some critics called Bullock's performance the best work of her career. Variety wrote: Gravity took in US$716 million at the box office worldwide and made it Bullock's second-most successful picture. For her role as Dr. Ryan Stone, Bullock was nominated for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. = Later roles (2015‚Äìpresent) = alt= In 2015 Bullock provided the voice of the villainess in the animated film Minions, which became her highest-grossing film to date with over US$1.1 billion worldwide and she executive produced and starred, as a political consultant hired to help win a Bolivian presidential election, in the drama Our Brand Is Crisis based on the 2005 documentary film of the same name by Rachel Boynton. Upon the film's release, which was a critical and commercial flop, she took another sabbatical from film. Bullock returned in an all-female spin-off of the Ocean's Eleven franchise, Ocean's 8 (2018) directed by Gary Ross. Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who helps plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala in New York City. The film was a commercial success grossing US$296.9 million globally. Bullock played Malorie, a woman who must find a way to guide herself and her children to safety despite the potential threat from an unseen adversary, in the Netflix post-apocalyptic horror film Bird Box (2018), based on the novel of the same name. Bullock received universal acclaim for her work. Variety found her to be \\"wonderfully self-reliant\\" while TheWrap described her performance as \\"fascinating and terrifying to watch.\\" Bullock's films have grossed over US$5.3 billion worldwide and her total domestic gross stands at over US$2.6 billion. Bullock will next star in an untitled drama film directed by Nora Fingscheidt for Netflix. Public image Since her acting debut, Bullock has been dubbed \\"America's sweetheart\\" in the media due to her \\"friendly and direct and so unpretentious\\" nature. alt= She was selected as one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the world in 1996 and 1999 and was also ranked number 58 on Empire magazine's Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time list. On March 24, 2005, Bullock received a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood. In 2010, Time magazine included Bullock in its annual Time 100 as one of the most influential people in the world. Bullock was selected by People magazine as its 2010 Woman of the Year and ranked number 12 on Peoples Most Beautiful 2011 list. In September 2013, Bullock joined other Hollywood legends at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard in making imprints of her hands and feet in cement of the theater's forecourt. In November 2013 The Hollywood Reporter named Bullock among the most powerful women in entertainment and she was also named Entertainment Weeklys Entertainer of the Year due to her success with The Heat and Gravity. Bullock ranked number two on the 2014 Forbes list of most powerful actresses and was honored with the Decade of Hotness Award by Spike Guys' Choice Awards. She was named the Most Beautiful Woman by People in 2015. Business ventures Bullock owns the production company Fortis Films. She was an executive producer of the George Lopez sitcom (co-produced with Robert Borden and Bruce Helford), which garnered a syndication deal of US$10 million. Bullock tried to produce a film based on F.X. Toole's short story Million Dollar Baby but could not interest the studios in a female boxing drama. The story was eventually adapted and directed by Clint Eastwood as the Oscar-winning film Million Dollar Baby (2004). Fortis Films also produced All About Steve which was released in September 2009. Her father, John Bullock, was the company's CEO and her sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, is the former president. In November 2006, Bullock founded an Austin, Texas, restaurant named Bess Bistro which was located on West 6th Street. She later opened another business, Walton's Fancy and Staple, across the street in a building she extensively renovated. Walton's is a bakery, upscale restaurant, and floral shop that also offers services including event planning. After almost nine years in business, Bess Bistro closed on September 20, 2015.  Philanthropy  Bullock has been a public supporter of the American Red Cross and has donated US$1 million to the organization at least five times. Her first public donation of that amount was to the Red Cross's Liberty Disaster Relief Fund. Three years later, she sent money in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis. In 2010, she donated US$1 million to relief efforts in Haiti following the Haiti earthquake and again donated the same amount following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. She donated US$1 million in 2017 to support Red Cross relief efforts for Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Along with other stars, Bullock did a public service announcement urging people to sign a petition for clean- up efforts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Bullock backs the Texas non-profit organization The Kindred Life Foundation, Inc. (KLF) and in late 2008 joined other top celebrities in supporting the work of KLF's founder and CEO, Amos Ramirez. At a fundraising gala for the organization, Bullock said, \\"Amos has led many efforts across our nation that have helped families that are in need. Our country needs more organizations that are committed to the service that Kindred Life is.\\" In 2012, Bullock was inducted into the Warren Easton Hall of Fame for her donations to charities. She was honored in 2013 with the Favorite Humanitarian Award at the 39th People's Choice Awards for her contributions to New Orleans' Warren Easton High School, which was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina.  Personal life  =Relationships= Bullock at the alt=Sandra Bullock Bullock was once engaged to actor Tate Donovan, whom she met while filming Love Potion No. 9. Their relationship lasted three years. She previously dated football player Troy Aikman and actors Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Gosling. Bullock married motorcycle builder and Monster Garage host Jesse James on July 16, 2005. They first met when Bullock arranged for her ten-year-old godson to meet James as a Christmas present. In November 2009, Bullock and James entered into a custody battle with James' second ex-wife, former adult film actress Janine Lindemulder, with whom James had a child. Bullock and James subsequently won full legal custody of James' five-year-old daughter. A scandal arose in March 2010 when several women claimed to have had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock. Bullock canceled European promotional appearances for The Blind Side citing \\"unforeseen personal reasons\\". On March 18, 2010, James responded to the rumors of infidelity by issuing a public apology to Bullock. He stated, \\"The vast majority of the allegations reported are untrue and unfounded ... beyond that, I will not dignify these private matters with any further public comment.\\" James declared, \\"There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me.\\" He asked that Bullock and their children one day \\"find it in their hearts to forgive me\\" for their \\"pain and embarrassment\\". James' publicist subsequently announced on March 30, 2010, that James had checked into a rehabilitation facility to \\"deal with personal issues\\" and save his relationship to Bullock. However, on April 28, 2010, it was reported that Bullock had filed for divorce on April 23 in Austin, Texas. Their divorce was finalized on June 28, 2010, with \\"conflict of personalities\\" cited as the reason. =Children= Bullock announced on April 28, 2010, that she had proceeded with plans to adopt a son born in January 2010 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Bullock and James had begun an initial adoption process four months earlier. Bullock's son began living with them in January 2010, but they chose to keep the news private until after the Oscars in March 2010. However, given the couple's separation and then divorce, Bullock continued the adoption of her son as a single parent. Bullock announced in December 2015 that she had adopted a second child and appeared on the cover of People magazine with her then three-year-old new daughter. =Accidents= On December 20, 2000, Bullock was in a private jet crash on a runway from which she and the two crew escaped uninjured. The pilots were unable to activate the runway lights during a night landing at Jackson Hole Airport due to the use of out-of-date approach plates but continued the landing anyway. The aircraft landed in the airport's graded safety area between the runway and parallel taxiway and hit a snowbank. The accident caused a separation of the nose cone and landing gear, partial separation of the right wing, and a bend in the left wing. While Bullock was in Massachusetts on April 18, 2008, shooting the film The Proposal, she and her then-husband Jesse James were in a vehicle that was hit head-on by a drunk driver. They were uninjured. = Legal issues = Beginning in 2002 Bullock was stalked across several states by a man named Thomas James Weldon. Bullock obtained a restraining order against him in 2003, which was renewed in 2006. After the restraining order expired and Weldon was released from a mental institution, he again traveled across several states to find Bullock; she then obtained another restraining order. Bullock won a multimillion-dollar judgment against Benny Daneshjou, the builder of her Lake Austin, Texas, home in October 2004. The jury ruled that the house was uninhabitable. It has since been torn down and rebuilt. Daneshjou and his insurer later settled with Bullock for roughly half the awarded verdict. On April 22, 2007, a woman named Marcia Diana Valentine was found lying outside James and Bullock's home in Orange County, California. When James confronted the woman, she ran to her car, got behind the wheel, and tried to run over him. She was said to be an obsessed fan of Bullock. Valentine was charged with one felony count each of aggravated assault and stalking. Bullock obtained a restraining order to bar Valentine from \\"contacting or coming near her home, family or work for three years\\". Valentine pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and stalking. She was subsequently convicted of stalking and sentenced to three years' probation. Joshua James Corbett broke into Bullock's Los Angeles home in June 2014. Bullock locked herself in a room and dialed 911. Corbett pleaded no contest in 2017 and was sentenced to five years' probation for stalking Bullock and breaking into her residence. He was then subject to a ten-year protective order that required him to stay away from Bullock. After Corbett missed a court date the previous month, police officers went to his parents' residence on May 2, 2018, where he lived in a guest house, to arrest him. He refused to leave and threatened to shoot officers. A SWAT team was called and, after a five-hour standoff, they deployed gas canisters and entered the house where they found Corbett had committed suicide. Corbett's death was the result of \\"multiple incised wounds\\" according to the Los Angeles County coroner.

Daniel Postage (Oliver's son) and Peter Firmin working on the BBC remake as Smallfilms. It was originally a partnership between Oliver Postgate (writer, animator and narrator) and Peter Firmin (modelmaker and illustrator). Several very popular series of short films were made using stop-motion animation, including Clangers, Noggin the Nog and Ivor the Engine. Another Smallfilms production, Bagpuss, came top of a BBC poll to find the favourite British children's programme of the 20th century. Background In 1957, Postgate was appointed a stage manager with Associated-Rediffusion, the company that then held the commercial weekday television franchise for London. Attached to the children's programming section, he thought he could do better with the relatively low budgets of the then black and white television productions. He wrote Alexander the Mouse, a story about a mouse born to be king. Using an Irish-produced magnetic system‚Äîon which animated characters were magnetically attached to a painted background, then filmed using a 45 degree mirror‚Äîhe persuaded Peter Firmin, who was then teaching at the Central School of Art,Peter Firmin pages at the Dragons' Friendly Society to create the painted backgrounds. Postgate later recalled that they broadcast around 26 of these programmes live-to-air, a task made harder by the production problems encountered by the use and restrictions of using magnets. After the relative success of Alexander the Mouse, Postgate agreed a deal to make his next series on film, for a budget of ¬£175 per programme (a minuscule amount even at that time). Making a stop motion animation table in his bedroom, he wrote the Chinese serial The Journey of Master Ho: a formal Chinese epic, about a small boy and a water-buffalo.The Journey of Master Ho This was intended for deaf children, a distinct advantage in that the production required no soundtrack, which reduced production costs. He engaged a painter to produce the backgrounds, but as the painter was classically Chinese-trained he produced them in three-quarter view, rather than in the conventional Egyptian full-view manner needed for flat animation under a camera. This resulted in the Firmin- produced characters looking as if they were short in one leg, but the success of the production provided the foundation for Postgate and Firmin to start up their own company, solely producing animated children's television programmes, initially for ITV, but soon afterward with the BBC. Postgate's initial BBC career was not solely concerned with Smallfilms. To gain experience, he accepted a contract as a television director in the BBC Children's Department in 1960, on a show entitled Little Laura, another animated series made on film, written and drawn by V. H. Drummond.Little Laura, BBC, 1960 The series continued in production until 1962, with Postgate credited also as animator on the 1962 series.Little Laura and the Rocket, BBC 1962 He also wrote serials for long-running BBC children's programmes Blue PeterLittle Watha and stories for Vision On.Vision On History of Smallfilms 16 mm Bolex Camera used for all the Smallfilms programmes Setting up the business in a disused cowshed at Firmin's home in Blean near Canterbury, Kent, Postgate and Firmin made children's animation programmes, based on concepts that mostly originated from Postgate. Firmin did the artwork and built the models, whilst Postgate wrote the scripts, did the stop motion filming, and voiced many of the characters. Smallfilms was able to produce two minutes of film per day, ten times as much as a conventional animation studio, with Postgate moving the (originally cardboard) characters himself, and working his 16mm camera frame-by-frame with a home-made clicker. As Postgate voiced so many of the productions, including the WereBear story tapes, his distinctive voice became familiar to generations of children. They began in 1959 with Ivor the Engine, a series for ITV about a Welsh steam locomotive who wanted to sing in a choir, based on Postgate's wartime encounter with Welshman Denzyl Ellis, who was once a fireman on the Royal Scot. It was remade in colour for the BBC in the 1970s. This was followed, also in 1959, by Noggin the Nog, their first production for the BBC, which established Smallfilms as a safe and reliable pair of hands to produce children's entertainment, in the days when the number of UK television channels was restricted to two. In 2000, Postgate and his friend Loaf set up a small publishing company called The Dragons Friendly Society, to look after Noggin the Nog, Pogles' Wood and Pingwings. After Postgate's death in December 2008, Smallfilms was inherited by his son Daniel. Universal took the distribution rights to the works of Smallfilms. Any such agreement does not include the materials published through The Dragons Friendly Society. In 2014, Postgate's son, Daniel Postgate, collaborated with Peter Firmin on the production of a new series of Clangers, with Daniel writing many of the episodes.'Noggin rides again' An interview with Peter Firmin by Julia Raeside in The Guardian Arts 28 July 2014 Series development and philosophy Postgate and Firmin recognised that their product was not sold to children, but to commissioning television executives. Postgate described in a later interview the then \\"gentlemanly and rather innocent\\" business of programme commissioning thus: \\"We would go to the BBC once a year, show them the films we'd made, and they would say: 'Yes, lovely, now what are you going to do next?' We would tell them, and they would say: 'That sounds fine, we'll mark it in for eighteen months from now,' and we would be given praise and encouragement and some money in advance, and we'd just go away and do it.\\" The only occasion that this informal arrangement caused any real difficulty emerged in the 1965 series The Pogles, which BBC management felt was too frightening for the intended audience, and led to their asking for a change of direction: resulting in a revised show, and a change of name to Pogles' Wood. Postgate had strict views regarding storylines, which perhaps limited the possibilities for series development. When asked if the Clangers adventures were quite surreal sometimes, Postgate replied: \\"They're surreal but logical. I have a strong prejudice against fantasy for its own sake. Once one gets to a point beyond where cause-and-effect mean anything at all, then science fiction becomes science nonsense. Everything that happened was strictly logical, according to the laws of physics which happened to apply in that part of the world.\\" In June 2015, the BBC's Mark Savage reported: \\"Firmin said the Clangers surrealism had led to accusations that Postgate was taking hallucinogenic drugs\\". Firmin told Savage: \\"People used to say, 'Ooh, what's Oliver on, with all of these weird ideas?' And we used to say, 'He's on cups of tea and biscuits.'\\" The Smallfilms system was reliant on the company's two key employees, Postgate and Firmin, and was devoid of modern considerations and essentials, as Postgate pointed out: \\"[We were] excused the interference of educationalists, sociologists and other pseudo-scientists, which produces eventually a confection of formulae which have no integrity. No, the mainspring of what we did was because it was fun.\\" Recognising their commissioning audience, Smallfilms purposefully developed storylines that would engage both adults and children. While the storylines and production were remembered by children, the adult jokes, like those about the Welsh in Ivor the Engine, or the fact that the Clangers swore occasionally, gave the films an instant parental engagement, and a later nostalgic revival amongst former children re-watching their favourite programmes. Coolabi From October 2008 until 2013, production company Coolabi held the merchandising and distribution rights to a number of the Smallfilms productions. Coolabi hoped to introduce Bagpuss to a new generation, saying that there was \\"significant potential to build on the affection in which this classic brand is held\\". However, in the event it was Smallfilms itself that returned the classic shows to production, agreeing a deal with the BBC in 2014 to produce a further 52 episodes of Clangers, as a third series of that show for broadcasting in 2015, which the company also pre-sold in the United States.

One who engages in sabotage is a saboteur. Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions and to avoid invoking legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage.  Etymology  The English word derives from the French word Saboter, meaning to ‚Äúbungle, botch, wreck or sabotage‚Äù, and was originally used to refer to labour disputes, in which workers wearing wooden shoes called interrupted production through different means. A popular but incorrect account of the origin of the term's present meaning is the story that poor workers in France would throw a wooden sabot into the machines to disrupt production. One of the first appearances of Saboter and Saboteur in French literature is in the Dictionnaire du Bas- Langage ou mani√®res de parler usit√©es parmi le peuple of D'Hautel, edited in 1808. In it the literal definition is to ‚Äú make noise with sabots‚Äù as well as ‚Äúbungle, jostle, hustle, haste.‚Äù The word Sabotage only appears later. The word Sabotage is found in 1873‚Äì1874 in the Dictionnaire de la langue fran√ßaise of √âmile Littr√©. Here it is defined mainly as ‚Äú making sabots, sabot maker‚Äù.It is at the end of the 19th century that it really began to be used with the meaning of \\"deliberately and maliciously destroying property\\" or \\"working slower\\". In 1897, √âmile Pouget, a famous syndicalist and anarchist wrote \\"action de saboter un travail\\" (action of sabotaging or bungling a work) in Le P√®re Peinard and in 1911 he also wrote a book entitled Le Sabotage.  As industrial action  Unauthorized stencil urging sabotage and picketing At the inception of the Industrial Revolution, skilled workers such as the Luddites (1811‚Äì1812) used sabotage as a means of negotiation in labor disputes. Labor unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) have advocated sabotage as a means of self-defense and direct action against unfair working conditions. The IWW was shaped in part by the industrial unionism philosophy of Big Bill Haywood, and in 1910 Haywood was exposed to sabotage while touring Europe: > The experience that had the most lasting impact on Haywood was witnessing a > general strike on the French railroads. Tired of waiting for parliament to > act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the > country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the > army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried > their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. > Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for > Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic ‚Äî the French > called it \\"sabotage\\" ‚Äî won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill > Haywood.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, > 1983, page 152.Jimthor, Stablewars, May 2008 For the IWW, sabotage's meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: any withdrawal of efficiency, including the slowdown, the strike, working to rule, or creative bungling of job assignments.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 196‚Äì197. Industrial Workers of the World \\"stickerette\\" or \\"silent agitator\\" One of the most severe examples was at the construction site of the Robert-Bourassa Generating Station in 1974, in Qu√©bec, Canada, when workers used bulldozers to topple electric generators, damaged fuel tanks, and set buildings on fire. The project was delayed a year, and the direct cost of the damage estimated at $2 million CAD. The causes were not clear, but three possible factors have been cited: inter-union rivalry, poor working conditions, and the perceived arrogance of American executives of the contractor, Bechtel Corporation.Rinehart, J.W. The Tyranny of Work, Canadian Social Problems Series. Academic Press Canada (1975), pp. 78‚Äì79. .  As environmental action  Certain groups turn to the destruction of property to stop environmental destruction or to make visible arguments against forms of modern technology they consider detrimental to the environment. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term eco- terrorist when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the monkey wrench thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by Edward Abbey in the novel The Monkey Wrench Gang and has been adopted by eco- activists to describe destruction of earth damaging machinery. From 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as ELF or Earth Liberation Front engaged in a near constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wild lands and extractive industries such as logging and even the burning down of a ski resort of Vail Colorado.Earth Liberation Front ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wild lands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.  As war tactic  World War II poster from the United States In war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign agent or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or logistic routes. Prime examples of such sabotage are the events of Black Tom and the Kingsland Explosion. Like spies, saboteurs who conduct a military operation in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms behind enemy lines are subject to prosecution and criminal penalties instead of detention as prisoners of war. It is common for a government in power during war or supporters of the war policy to use the term loosely against opponents of the war. Similarly, German nationalists spoke of a stab in the back having cost them the loss of World War I.Dokumentarfilm.com A modern form of sabotage is the distribution of software intended to damage specific industrial systems. For example, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is alleged to have sabotaged a Siberian pipeline during the Cold War, using information from the Farewell Dossier. A more recent case may be the Stuxnet computer worm, which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment. Based on the equipment targeted and the location of infected machines, security experts believe it was an attack on the Iranian nuclear program by the United States, Israel or, according to the latest news, even Russia.Markoff, John, \\"Malware Aimed at Iran Hit Five Sites, Report Says\\", New York Times, 13 February 2011, p. 15. Sabotage, done well, is inherently difficult to detect and difficult to trace to its origin. During World War II, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated 19,649 cases of sabotage and concluded the enemy had not caused any of them. Sabotage in warfare, according to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) manual, varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and specially trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts that ordinary citizen-saboteurs can perform. Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. There are two main methods of sabotage; physical destruction and the \\"human element\\". While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The \\"human element\\" is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. There are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title \\"General Interference with Organizations and Production\\": * When possible, refer all matters to committees for \\"further study and consideration\\". Attempt to make the committees as large as possible‚Äînever fewer than five * Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible. * Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions. * In making work assignments, always sign out unimportant jobs first, assign important jobs to inefficient workers with poor machines. * Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those with the least flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye. * To lower morale, and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work. * Hold meetings when there is more critical work to be done. * Multiply procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, paychecks, and so on. See that multiple people must approve everything where one would do. * Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside information. From the section entitled, \\"General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion\\" comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: \\"Act stupid.\\" = Value of simple sabotage in wartime = The United States Office of Strategic Services, later renamed the CIA, noted the specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: \\"... slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.\\" To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, \\"Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police.\\" The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; \\"the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.\\" = In World War I = On 30 July 1916, the Black Tom explosion occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in Jersey City, New Jersey that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the Allies in their fight. On 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, set fire to his workbench at an ammunition assembly plant near Lyndhurst, New Jersey, causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages. Wozniak's involvement was not discovered until 1927. On 12 February 1917, Bedouins allied with the British destroyed a Turkish railroad near the port of Wajh, derailing a Turkish locomotive. The Bedouins traveled by camel and used explosives to demolish a portion of track. = Post World War I = Japanese experts inspect the scene of the \\"railway sabotage\\" on the South Manchurian Railway in 1931. The \\"railroad sabotage\\" was one of the events that led to the Mukden Incident and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria. In Ireland, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) used sabotage against the British following the Easter 1916 uprising. The IRA compromised communication lines and lines of transportation and fuel supplies. The IRA also employed passive sabotage, refusing dock and train workers to work on ships and rail cars used by the government. In 1920, agents of the IRA committed arson against at least fifteen British warehouses in Liverpool. The following year, the IRA set fire to numerous British targets again, including the Dublin Customs House, this time sabotaging most of Liverpool's firetrucks in the firehouses before lighting the matches. = In World War II = Lieutenant Colonel George T. Rheam was a British soldier, who ran Brickendonbury Manor from October 1941 to June 1945 during World War II, which was Station XVII of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which trained specialists for the SOE. Rheam innovated many sabotage techniques, and is considered by M. R. D. Foot the \\"founder of modern industrial sabotage.\\" Sabotage training for the Allies consisted of teaching would-be saboteurs key components of working machinery to destroy. \\"Saboteurs learned hundreds of small tricks to cause the Germans big trouble. The cables in a telephone junction box ... could be jumbled to make the wrong connections when numbers were dialed. A few ounces of plastique, properly placed, could bring down a bridge, cave in a mine shaft, or collapse the roof of a railroad tunnel.\\" The Polish Home Army Armia Krajowa, who commanded the majority of resistance organizations in Poland (even the National Forces, except the Military Organization Lizard Union; The Home Army also included the Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Freedom, Equality, Independence) and coordinating and aiding the Jewish Military Union as well as more reluctantly helping the Jewish Combat Organization, was responsible for the greatest number of acts of sabotage in German‚Äîoccupied Europe. The Home Army's sabotage operations Operation Garland and Operation Ribbon are just two examples. In all, the Home Army damaged 6,930 locomotives, set 443 rail transports on fire, damaged over 19,000 rail cars \\"wagony\\", and blew up 38 rail bridges, not to mention the attacks against the railroads. The Home Army was also responsible for 4,710 built-in flaws in parts for aircraft engines and 92,000 built-in flaws in artillery projectiles, among other examples of significant sabotage. In addition, over 25,000 acts of more minor sabotage were committed. It continued to fight against both the Germans and the Soviets; however, it did aid the Western Allies by collecting constant and detailed information on the German rail, wheeled, and horse transports.Home Army#Major operations As for Stalin's proxies, their actions led to a great number of the Polish and Jewish hostages, mostly civilians, being murdered in reprisal by the Germans. The Gwardia Ludowa destroyed around 200 German trains during the war, and indiscriminately threw hand grenades into places frequented by Germans. The French Resistance ran an extremely effective sabotage campaign against the Germans during World War II. Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the BBC radio or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943. From January through March 1944, sabotage accounted for three times the number of locomotives damaged by Allied air power. See also Normandy Landings for more information about sabotage on D-Day. During World War II, the Allies committed sabotage against the Peugeot truck factory. After repeated failures in Allied bombing attempts to hit the factory, a team of French Resistance fighters and Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents distracted the German guards with a game of soccer while part of their team entered the plant and destroyed machinery. In December 1944, the Germans ran a false flag sabotage infiltration, Operation Greif, which was commanded by Waffen-SS commando Otto Skorzeny during the Battle of the Bulge. German commandos, wearing US Army uniforms, carrying US Army weapons, and using US Army vehicles, penetrated US lines to spread panic and confusion among US troops and to blow up bridges, ammunition dumps, and fuel stores and to disrupt the lines of communication. Many of the commandos were captured by the Americans. Because they were wearing US uniforms, a number of the Germans were executed as spies, either summarily or after military commissions. = After World War II = Palestine Railway's K class 2-8-4T steam locomotive and freight train on the Jaffa and Jerusalem line after being sabotaged by Jewish paramilitary forces in 1946. From 1948 to 1960, the Malayan Communists committed numerous effective acts of sabotage against the British Colonial authorities, first targeting railway bridges, then hitting larger targets such as military camps. Most of their efforts were centered around crippling Malaysia's colonial economy and involved sabotage against trains, rubber trees, water pipes, and electric lines. The Communists' sabotage efforts were so successful that they caused backlash among the Malaysian population, who gradually withdrew support for the Communist movement as their livelihoods became threatened. In Mandatory Palestine from 1945 to 1948, Jewish groups opposed British control. Though that control was to end according to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1948, the groups used sabotage as an opposition tactic. The Haganah focused their efforts on camps used by the British to hold refugees and radar installations that could be used to detect illegal immigrant ships. The Stern Gang and the Irgun used terrorism and sabotage against the British government and against lines of communications. In November 1946, the Irgun and Stern Gang attacked a railroad twenty-one times in a three-week period, eventually causing shell- shocked Arab railway workers to strike. The 6th Airborne Division was called in to provide security as a means of ending the strike. = In Vietnam = The Viet Cong used swimmer saboteurs often and effectively during the Vietnam War. Between 1969 and 1970, swimmer saboteurs sunk, destroyed, or damaged 77 assets of the U.S. and its allies. Viet Cong swimmers were poorly equipped but well- trained and resourceful. The swimmers provided a low-cost/low-risk option with high payoff; possible loss to the country for failure compared to the possible gains from a successful mission led to the obvious conclusion the swimmer saboteurs were a good idea. = During the Cold War = On 1 January 1984, the Cuscatlan bridge over Lempa river in El Salvador, critical to flow of commercial and military traffic, was destroyed by guerrilla forces using explosives after using mortar fire to \\"scatter\\" the bridge's guards, causing an estimated $3.7 million in required repairs, and considerably impacting on El Salvadoran business and security. In 1982 in Honduras, a group of nine Salvadorans and Nicaraguans destroyed a main electrical power station, leaving the capital city Tegucigalpa without power for three days.  As crime  Some criminals have engaged in acts of sabotage for reasons of extortion. For example, Klaus-Peter Sabotta sabotaged German railway lines in the late 1990s in an attempt to extort DM10 million from the German railway operator Deutsche Bahn. He is now serving a sentence of life imprisonment. In 1989, ex-Scotland Yard detective Rodney Whitchelo was sentenced to 17 years in prison for spiking Heinz baby food products in supermarkets, in an extortion attempt on the food manufacturer.  As political action  The term political sabotage is sometimes used to define the acts of one political camp to disrupt, harass or damage the reputation of a political opponent, usually during an electoral campaign, such as during Watergate. Smear campaigns are a commonly used tactic. The term could also describe the actions and expenditures of private entities, corporations, and organizations against democratically approved or enacted laws, policies and programs. After the Cold War ended, the Mitrokhin Archives were declassified, which included detailed KGB plans of active measures to subvert politics in opposing nations. = In a coup d'etat = Sabotage is a crucial tool of the successful coup d'etat, which requires control of communications before, during, and after the coup is staged. Simple sabotage against physical communications platforms using semi-skilled technicians, or even those trained only for this task, could effectively silence the target government of the coup, leaving the information battle space open to the dominance of the coup's leaders. To underscore the effectiveness of sabotage, \\"A single cooperative technician will be able temporarily to put out of action a radio station which would otherwise require a full-scale assault.\\" Railroads, were strategically important to the regime the coup is against, are prime targets for sabotage‚Äîif a section of the track is damaged entire portions of the transportation network can be stopped until it is fixed.  Derivative usages  = Sabotage radio = A sabotage radio was a small two-way radio designed for use by resistance movements in World War II, and after the war often used by expeditions and similar parties. = Cybotage = Arquilla and Rondfeldt, in their work entitled Networks and Netwars, differentiate their definition of \\"netwar\\" from a list of \\"trendy synonyms\\", including \\"cybotage\\", a portmanteau from the words \\"sabotage\\" and \\"cyber\\". They dub the practitioners of cybotage \\"cyboteurs\\" and note while all cybotage is not netwar, some netwar is cybotage. = Counter-sabotage = Counter-sabotage, defined by Webster's Dictionary, is \\"counterintelligence designed to detect and counteract sabotage\\". The United States Department of Defense definition, found in the Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, is \\"action designed to detect and counteract sabotage. See also counterintelligence\\".  In World War II  During World War II, British subject Eddie Chapman, trained by the Germans in sabotage, became a double agent for the British. The German Abwehr entrusted Chapman to destroy the British de Havilland Company's main plant which manufactured the outstanding Mosquito light bomber, but required photographic proof from their agent to verify the mission's completion. A special unit of the Royal Engineers known as the Magic Gang covered the de Havilland plant with canvas panels and scattered papier-m√¢ch√© furniture and chunks of masonry around three broken and burnt giant generators. Photos of the plant taken from the air reflected devastation for the factory and a successful sabotage mission, and Chapman, as a British sabotage double-agent, fooled the Germans for the duration of the war. = Borrowed into Japanese = In Japanese, the verb saboru („Çµ„Éú„Çã) means to skip school or loaf on the job.

As well, rifles may be stored in a scabbard by horse riders. Military cavalry and cowboys had scabbards for their saddle ring carbine rifles and lever action rifles on their horses for storage and protection. Scabbards have been made of many materials over the millennia, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. Most commonly, sword scabbards were worn suspended from a sword belt or shoulder belt called a baldric. Antiquity Bronze part of scabbard fittings of a gladius, a Roman sword (40-250 AD) Wooden scabbards were usually covered in fabric or leather; the leather versions also usually bore metal fittings for added protection and carrying ease. Japanese blades typically have their sharp cutting edge protected by a wooden scabbard called a saya. Many scabbards, such as ones the Greeks and Romans used, were small and light. They were designed for holding the sword rather than protecting it. All-metal scabbards were popular items for a display of wealth among elites in the European Iron Age, and often intricately decorated. Little is known about the scabbards of the early Iron Age, due to their wooden construction. However, during the Middle and late Iron Ages, the scabbard became important especially as a vehicle for decorative elaboration. After 200 BC fully decorated scabbards became rare.How Ancient Europeans Saw The World p115,125 by Peter Wells A number of ancient scabbards have been recovered from weapons sacrifices, a few of which had a lining of fur on the inside.p266 & p282 Lars Jorgensen et al 2003 The spoils of Victory - The north in the shadow of the Roman Empire Nationalmuseet (National Museum of Denmark) The fur was probably kept oily, keeping the blade free from rust. The fur would also allow a smoother, quicker draw. Modern era Mughal sabre with jewelled scabbard A Japanese Edo period wood block print of a samurai carrying a nodachi/≈çdachi on his back Entirely metal scabbards became popular in Europe early in the 19th century and eventually superseded most other types. Metal was more durable than leather and could better withstand the rigours of field use, particularly among troops mounted on horseback. In addition, metal offered the ability to present a more military appearance, as well as the opportunity to display increased ornamentation. Nevertheless, leather scabbards never entirely lost favour among military users and were widely used as late as the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65). Some military police forces, naval shore patrols, law enforcement and other groups used leather scabbards as a kind of truncheon. Scabbards were historically, albeit rarely, worn across the back, but only by a handful of Celtic tribes, and only with very short lengths of sword. This is because drawing a long, sharp blade over one's shoulder and past one's head from a scabbard on the back is relatively awkward, especially in a hurry, and the length of the arm sets a hard upper limit on how long a blade can be drawn at all in this way. Sheathing the sword again is even harder since it has to be done effectively blind unless the scabbard is taken off first. Common depictions of long swords being drawn from the back are a modern invention, born from safety and convenience considerations on a film set and typically enabled by creative editing, and have enjoyed such great popularity in fiction and fantasy that they are widely and incorrectly believed to have been common in Medieval times. Some more well-known examples of this include the back scabbard depicted in the film Braveheart and the back scabbard seen in the video game series The Legend of Zelda. There is some limited data from woodcuts and textual fragments that Mongol light horse archers, Chinese soldiers, Japanese Samurai and European Knights wore a slung baldric over the shoulder, allowing longer blades such as greatswords/zweihanders and nodachi/≈çdachi to be strapped across the back, though these would have to be removed from the back before the sword could be unsheathed. In \\"The Ancient Celts\\" by Barry Cunliffe, Cunliffe writes, \\"All these pieces of equipment [shields, spears, swords, mail] mentioned in the texts, are reflected in the archaeological record and in the surviving iconography, though it is sometimes possible to detect regional variations (page 94). Among the Parisii of Yorkshire, for example, the \\"...sword was sometimes worn across the back and therefore had to be drawn over the shoulder from behind the head.\\" Common terms The metal fitting where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the throat, which is often part of a larger scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which, on both leather and metal scabbards, is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.

It has the formula MgAl2O4 in the cubic crystal system. Its name comes from the Latin word \\"spinella\\", which means spine in reference to its pointed crystals. Properties Cut spinel Spinel crystallizes in the isometric system; common crystal forms are octahedra, usually twinned. It has an imperfect octahedral cleavage and a conchoidal fracture. Its hardness is 8, its specific gravity is 3.5‚Äì4.1, and it is transparent to opaque with a vitreous to dull luster. It may be colorless, but is usually various shades of pink, rose, red, blue, green, yellow, brown, black, or (uncommon) violet. There is a unique natural white spinel, now lost, that surfaced briefly in what is now Sri Lanka. Some spinels are among the most famous gemstones; among them are the Black Prince's Ruby and the \\"Timur ruby\\" in the British Crown Jewels, and the \\"C√¥te de Bretagne\\", formerly from the French Crown jewels. The Samarian Spinel is the largest known spinel in the world, weighing . The transparent red spinels were called spinel-rubies or balas rubies. In the past, before the arrival of modern science, spinels and rubies were equally known as rubies. After the 18th century the word ruby was only used for the red gem variety of the mineral corundum and the word spinel came to be used. \\"Balas\\" is derived from Balascia, the ancient name for Badakhshan, a region in central Asia situated in the upper valley of the Panj River, one of the principal tributaries of the Oxus River. Mines in the Gorno Badakhshan region of Tajikistan constituted for centuries the main source for red and pink spinels. Occurrence =Geologic occurrence= Spinel is found as a metamorphic mineral, and also as a primary mineral in rare mafic igneous rocks; in these igneous rocks, the magmas are relatively deficient in alkalis relative to aluminium, and aluminium oxide may form as the mineral corundum or may combine with magnesia to form spinel. This is why spinel and ruby are often found together. The spinel petrogenesis in mafic magmatic rocks is strongly debated, but certainly results from mafic magma interaction with more evolved magma or rock (e.g. gabbro, troctolite). Spinel, (Mg,Fe)(Al,Cr)2O4, is common in peridotite in the uppermost Earth's mantle, between approximately 20 km to approximately 120 km, possibly to lower depths depending on the chromium content. At significantly shallower depths, above the Moho, calcic plagioclase is the more stable aluminous mineral in peridotite while garnet is the stable phase deeper in the mantle below the spinel stability region. Spinel, (Mg,Fe)Al2O4, is a common mineral in the Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) in some chondritic meteorites. =Geographical occurrence= Spinel has long been found in the gemstone-bearing gravel of Sri Lanka and in limestones of the Badakshan Province in modern-day Afghanistan and Tajikistan; and of Mogok in Myanmar. Over the last decades gem quality spinels are found in the marbles of L·ª•c Y√™n District (Vietnam), Mahenge and Matombo (Tanzania), Tsavo (Kenya) and in the gravels of Tunduru (Tanzania) and Ilakaka (Madagascar). Since 2000 in several locations around the world have been discovered spinels with unusual vivid pink or blue color. Such \\"glowing\\" spinels are known from Mogok (Myanmar), Mahenge plateau (Tanzania), L·ª•c Y√™n District (Vietnam) and some more localities. In 2018 bright blue spinels have been reported also in the southern part of Baffin Island (Canada). The pure blue coloration of spinel is caused by small additions of cobalt. Synthetic spinel Synthetic spinel, accidentally produced in the middle of the 18th century, has been described more recently in scientific publications in 2000 and 2004. By 2015, transparent spinel was being made in sheets and other shapes through sintering. Synthetic spinel, which looks like glass but has notably higher strength against pressure, can also have applications in military and commercial use.

It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. Some speech recognition systems require \\"training\\" (also called \\"enrollment\\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called \\"speaker independent\\" systems. Systems that use training are called \\"speaker dependent\\". Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. \\"call home\\"), call routing (e.g. \\"I would like to make a collect call\\"), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input). The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process. From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems. History The key areas of growth were: vocabulary size, speaker independence and processing speed. =Pre-1970= * 1952 ‚Äì Three Bell Labs researchers, Stephen Balashek, R. Biddulph, and K. H. Davis built a system called \\"Audrey\\" for single-speaker digit recognition. Their system located the formants in the power spectrum of each utterance. * 1960 ‚Äì Gunnar Fant developed and published the source-filter model of speech production. * 1962 ‚Äì IBM demonstrated its 16-word \\"Shoebox\\" machine's speech recognition capability at the 1962 World's Fair. * 1966 ‚Äì Linear predictive coding (LPC), a speech coding method, was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), while working on speech recognition. * 1969 ‚Äì Funding at Bell Labs dried up for several years when, in 1969, the influential John Pierce wrote an open letter that was critical of and defunded speech recognition research. This defunding lasted until Pierce retired and James L. Flanagan took over. Raj Reddy was the first person to take on continuous speech recognition as a graduate student at Stanford University in the late 1960s. Previous systems required users to pause after each word. Reddy's system issued spoken commands for playing chess. Around this time Soviet researchers invented the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and used it to create a recognizer capable of operating on a 200-word vocabulary. DTW processed speech by dividing it into short frames, e.g. 10ms segments, and processing each frame as a single unit. Although DTW would be superseded by later algorithms, the technique carried on. Achieving speaker independence remained unsolved at this time period. =1970‚Äì1990= * 1971 ‚Äì DARPA funded five years for Speech Understanding Research, speech recognition research seeking a minimum vocabulary size of 1,000 words. They thought speech understanding would be key to making progress in speech recognition, but this later proved untrue. BBN, IBM, Carnegie Mellon and Stanford Research Institute all participated in the program. This revived speech recognition research post John Pierce's letter. * 1972 - The IEEE Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing group held a conference in Newton, Massachusetts. * 1976 The first ICASSP was held in Philadelphia, which since then has been a major venue for the publication of research on speech recognition. During the late 1960s Leonard Baum developed the mathematics of Markov chains at the Institute for Defense Analysis. A decade later, at CMU, Raj Reddy's students James Baker and Janet M. Baker began using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for speech recognition. James Baker had learned about HMMs from a summer job at the Institute of Defense Analysis during his undergraduate education. The use of HMMs allowed researchers to combine different sources of knowledge, such as acoustics, language, and syntax, in a unified probabilistic model. * By the mid-1980s IBM's Fred Jelinek's team created a voice activated typewriter called Tangora, which could handle a 20,000-word vocabulary Jelinek's statistical approach put less emphasis on emulating the way the human brain processes and understands speech in favor of using statistical modeling techniques like HMMs. (Jelinek's group independently discovered the application of HMMs to speech.) This was controversial with linguists since HMMs are too simplistic to account for many common features of human languages. However, the HMM proved to be a highly useful way for modeling speech and replaced dynamic time warping to become the dominant speech recognition algorithm in the 1980s. * 1982 ‚Äì Dragon Systems, founded by James and Janet M. Baker, was one of IBM's few competitors. =Practical speech recognition= The 1980s also saw the introduction of the n-gram language model. * 1987 ‚Äì The back-off model allowed language models to use multiple length n-grams, and CSELT used HMM to recognize languages (both in software and in hardware specialized processors, e.g. RIPAC). Much of the progress in the field is owed to the rapidly increasing capabilities of computers. At the end of the DARPA program in 1976, the best computer available to researchers was the PDP-10 with 4 MB ram. It could take up to 100 minutes to decode just 30 seconds of speech. Two practical products were: * 1987 ‚Äì a recognizer from Kurzweil Applied Intelligence * 1990 ‚Äì Dragon Dictate, a consumer product released in 1990 AT&T; deployed the Voice Recognition Call Processing service in 1992 to route telephone calls without the use of a human operator. The technology was developed by Lawrence Rabiner and others at Bell Labs. By this point, the vocabulary of the typical commercial speech recognition system was larger than the average human vocabulary. Raj Reddy's former student, Xuedong Huang, developed the Sphinx-II system at CMU. The Sphinx-II system was the first to do speaker-independent, large vocabulary, continuous speech recognition and it had the best performance in DARPA's 1992 evaluation. Handling continuous speech with a large vocabulary was a major milestone in the history of speech recognition. Huang went on to found the speech recognition group at Microsoft in 1993. Raj Reddy's student Kai-Fu Lee joined Apple where, in 1992, he helped develop a speech interface prototype for the Apple computer known as Casper. Lernout & Hauspie, a Belgium-based speech recognition company, acquired several other companies, including Kurzweil Applied Intelligence in 1997 and Dragon Systems in 2000. The L&H; speech technology was used in the Windows XP operating system. L&H; was an industry leader until an accounting scandal brought an end to the company in 2001. The speech technology from L&H; was bought by ScanSoft which became Nuance in 2005. Apple originally licensed software from Nuance to provide speech recognition capability to its digital assistant Siri. 2000s In the 2000s DARPA sponsored two speech recognition programs: Effective Affordable Reusable Speech-to-Text (EARS) in 2002 and Global Autonomous Language Exploitation (GALE). Four teams participated in the EARS program: IBM, a team led by BBN with LIMSI and Univ. of Pittsburgh, Cambridge University, and a team composed of ICSI, SRI and University of Washington. EARS funded the collection of the Switchboard telephone speech corpus containing 260 hours of recorded conversations from over 500 speakers. The GALE program focused on Arabic and Mandarin broadcast news speech. Google's first effort at speech recognition came in 2007 after hiring some researchers from Nuance. The first product was GOOG-411, a telephone based directory service. The recordings from GOOG-411 produced valuable data that helped Google improve their recognition systems. Google Voice Search is now supported in over 30 languages. In the United States, the National Security Agency has made use of a type of speech recognition for keyword spotting since at least 2006. This technology allows analysts to search through large volumes of recorded conversations and isolate mentions of keywords. Recordings can be indexed and analysts can run queries over the database to find conversations of interest. Some government research programs focused on intelligence applications of speech recognition, e.g. DARPA's EARS's program and IARPA's Babel program. In the early 2000s, speech recognition was still dominated by traditional approaches such as Hidden Markov Models combined with feedforward artificial neural networks.Herve Bourlard and Nelson Morgan, Connectionist Speech Recognition: A Hybrid Approach, The Kluwer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science; v. 247, Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1994. Today, however, many aspects of speech recognition have been taken over by a deep learning method called Long short-term memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network published by Sepp Hochreiter & J√ºrgen Schmidhuber in 1997. LSTM RNNs avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn \\"Very Deep Learning\\" tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps ago, which is important for speech. Around 2007, LSTM trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)Alex Graves, Santiago Fernandez, Faustino Gomez, and J√ºrgen Schmidhuber (2006). Connectionist temporal classification: Labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural nets. Proceedings of ICML'06, pp. 369‚Äì376. started to outperform traditional speech recognition in certain applications.Santiago Fernandez, Alex Graves, and J√ºrgen Schmidhuber (2007). An application of recurrent neural networks to discriminative keyword spotting. Proceedings of ICANN (2), pp. 220‚Äì229. In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through Google Voice to all smartphone users.Ha≈üim Sak, Andrew Senior, Kanishka Rao, Fran√ßoise Beaufays and Johan Schalkwyk (September 2015): \\"Google voice search: faster and more accurate.\\" The use of deep feedforward (non-recurrent) networks for acoustic modeling was introduced during later part of 2009 by Geoffrey Hinton and his students at University of Toronto and by Li Deng and colleagues at Microsoft Research, initially in the collaborative work between Microsoft and University of Toronto which was subsequently expanded to include IBM and Google (hence \\"The shared views of four research groups\\" subtitle in their 2012 review paper).NIPS Workshop: Deep Learning for Speech Recognition and Related Applications, Whistler, BC, Canada, Dec. 2009 (Organizers: Li Deng, Geoff Hinton, D. Yu). A Microsoft research executive called this innovation \\"the most dramatic change in accuracy since 1979\\". In contrast to the steady incremental improvements of the past few decades, the application of deep learning decreased word error rate by 30%. This innovation was quickly adopted across the field. Researchers have begun to use deep learning techniques for language modeling as well. In the long history of speech recognition, both shallow form and deep form (e.g. recurrent nets) of artificial neural networks had been explored for many years during 1980s, 1990s and a few years into the 2000s.Morgan, Bourlard, Renals, Cohen, Franco (1993) \\"Hybrid neural network/hidden Markov model systems for continuous speech recognition. ICASSP/IJPRAI\\"Waibel, Hanazawa, Hinton, Shikano, Lang. (1989) \\"Phoneme recognition using time-delay neural networks. IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.\\" But these methods never won over the non- uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM- HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. A number of key difficulties had been methodologically analyzed in the 1990s, including gradient diminishingSepp Hochreiter (1991), Untersuchungen zu dynamischen neuronalen Netzen , Diploma thesis. Institut f. Informatik, Technische Univ. Munich. Advisor: J. Schmidhuber. and weak temporal correlation structure in the neural predictive models. All these difficulties were in addition to the lack of big training data and big computing power in these early days. Most speech recognition researchers who understood such barriers hence subsequently moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling approaches until the recent resurgence of deep learning starting around 2009‚Äì2010 that had overcome all these difficulties. Hinton et al. and Deng et al. reviewed part of this recent history about how their collaboration with each other and then with colleagues across four groups (University of Toronto, Microsoft, Google, and IBM) ignited a renaissance of applications of deep feedforward neural networks to speech recognition.Keynote talk: Recent Developments in Deep Neural Networks. ICASSP, 2013 (by Geoff Hinton).Keynote talk: \\"Achievements and Challenges of Deep Learning: From Speech Analysis and Recognition To Language and Multimodal Processing,\\" Interspeech, September 2014 (by Li Deng). 2010s By early 2010s speech recognition, also called voice recognition was clearly differentiated from sp _eaker_ recognition, and speaker independence was considered a major breakthrough. Until then, systems required a \\"training\\" period. A 1987 ad for a doll had carried the tagline \\"Finally, the doll that understands you.\\" ‚Äì despite the fact that it was described as \\"which children could train to respond to their voice\\". In 2017, Microsoft researchers reached a historical human parity milestone of transcribing conversational telephony speech on the widely benchmarked Switchboard task. Multiple deep learning models were used to optimize speech recognition accuracy. The speech recognition word error rate was reported to be as low as 4 professional human transcribers working together on the same benchmark, which was funded by IBM Watson speech team on the same task. Models, methods, and algorithms Both acoustic modeling and language modeling are important parts of modern statistically-based speech recognition algorithms. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in many systems. Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as document classification or statistical machine translation. =Hidden Markov models= Modern general-purpose speech recognition systems are based on Hidden Markov Models. These are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities. HMMs are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short-time stationary signal. In a short time-scale (e.g., 10 milliseconds), speech can be approximated as a stationary process. Speech can be thought of as a Markov model for many stochastic purposes. Another reason why HMMs are popular is because they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. In speech recognition, the hidden Markov model would output a sequence of n-dimensional real-valued vectors (with n being a small integer, such as 10), outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds. The vectors would consist of cepstral coefficients, which are obtained by taking a Fourier transform of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a cosine transform, then taking the first (most significant) coefficients. The hidden Markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians, which will give a likelihood for each observed vector. Each word, or (for more general speech recognition systems), each phoneme, will have a different output distribution; a hidden Markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden Markov models for the separate words and phonemes. Described above are the core elements of the most common, HMM-based approach to speech recognition. Modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above. A typical large-vocabulary system would need context dependency for the phonemes (so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as HMM states); it would use cepstral normalization to normalize for different speaker and recording conditions; for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) for male-female normalization and maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) for more general speaker adaptation. The features would have so-called delta and delta-delta coefficients to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA); or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use splicing and an LDA-based projection followed perhaps by heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis or a global semi-tied co variance transform (also known as maximum likelihood linear transform, or MLLT). Many systems use so-called discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to HMM parameter estimation and instead optimize some classification-related measure of the training data. Examples are maximum mutual information (MMI), minimum classification error (MCE) and minimum phone error (MPE). Decoding of the speech (the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence) would probably use the Viterbi algorithm to find the best path, and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden Markov model, which includes both the acoustic and language model information, and combining it statically beforehand (the finite state transducer, or FST, approach). A possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate, and to use a better scoring function (re scoring) to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score. The set of candidates can be kept either as a list (the N-best list approach) or as a subset of the models (a lattice). Re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the Bayes risk (or an approximation thereof): Instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability, we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions (i.e., we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability). The loss function is usually the Levenshtein distance, though it can be different distances for specific tasks; the set of possible transcriptions is, of course, pruned to maintain tractability. Efficient algorithms have been devised to re score lattices represented as weighted finite state transducers with edit distances represented themselves as a finite state transducer verifying certain assumptions. =Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based speech recognition= Dynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful HMM-based approach. Dynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns would be detected, even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly, or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation. DTW has been applied to video, audio, and graphics ‚Äì indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with DTW. A well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. In general, it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions. That is, the sequences are \\"warped\\" non-linearly to match each other. This sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden Markov models. =Neural networks= Neural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in ASR in the late 1980s. Since then, neural networks have been used in many aspects of speech recognition such as phoneme classification, phoneme classification through multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, isolated word recognition, audiovisual speech recognition, audiovisual speaker recognition and speaker adaptation. Neural networks make fewer explicit assumptions about feature statistical properties than HMMs and have several qualities making them attractive recognition models for speech recognition. When used to estimate the probabilities of a speech feature segment, neural networks allow discriminative training in a natural and efficient manner. However, in spite of their effectiveness in classifying short-time units such as individual phonemes and isolated words,S. A. Zahorian, A. M. Zimmer, and F. Meng, (2002) \\"Vowel Classification for Computer based Visual Feedback for Speech Training for the Hearing Impaired,\\" in ICSLP 2002 early neural networks were rarely successful for continuous recognition tasks because of their limited ability to model temporal dependencies. One approach to this limitation was to use neural networks as a pre-processing, feature transformation or dimensionality reduction, step prior to HMM based recognition. However, more recently, LSTM and related recurrent neural networks (RNNs) ICASSP 2013. and Time Delay Neural Networks(TDNN's) have demonstrated improved performance in this area. Deep feedforward and recurrent neural networks Deep Neural Networks and Denoising Autoencoders are also under investigation. A deep feedforward neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers. Similar to shallow neural networks, DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models, where extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, giving a huge learning capacity and thus the potential of modeling complex patterns of speech data. A success of DNNs in large vocabulary speech recognition occurred in 2010 by industrial researchers, in collaboration with academic researchers, where large output layers of the DNN based on context dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees were adopted. Deng L., Li, J., Huang, J., Yao, K., Yu, D., Seide, F. et al. Recent Advances in Deep Learning for Speech Research at Microsoft. ICASSP, 2013. See comprehensive reviews of this development and of the state of the art as of October 2014 in the recent Springer book from Microsoft Research. See also the related background of automatic speech recognition and the impact of various machine learning paradigms, notably including deep learning, in recent overview articles. One fundamental principle of deep learning is to do away with hand- crafted feature engineering and to use raw features. This principle was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \\"raw\\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features,L. Deng, M. Seltzer, D. Yu, A. Acero, A. Mohamed, and G. Hinton (2010) Binary Coding of Speech Spectrograms Using a Deep Auto-encoder. Interspeech. showing its superiority over the Mel- Cepstral features which contain a few stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The true \\"raw\\" features of speech, waveforms, have more recently been shown to produce excellent larger-scale speech recognition results. = End-to-end automatic speech recognition = Since 2014, there has been much research interest in \\"end-to-end\\" ASR. Traditional phonetic-based (i.e., all HMM-based model) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation, acoustic and language model. End-to-end models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer. This is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process. For example, a n-gram language model is required for all HMM-based systems, and a typical n-gram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices. Consequently, modern commercial ASR systems from Google and Apple (as of 2017) are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally. The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014. The model consisted of recurrent neural networks and a CTC layer. Jointly, the RNN-CTC model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together, however it is incapable of learning the language due to conditional independence assumptions similar to a HMM. Consequently, CTC models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to English characters, but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts. Later, Baidu expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in Chinese Mandarin and English. In 2016, University of Oxford presented LipNet, the first end-to-end sentence-level lip reading model, using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an RNN-CTC architecture, surpassing human-level performance in a restricted grammar dataset. A large-scale CNN-RNN-CTC architecture was presented in 2018 by Google DeepMind achieving 6 times better performance than human experts. An alternative approach to CTC-based models are attention-based models. Attention-based ASR models were introduced simultaneously by Chan et al. of Carnegie Mellon University and Google Brain and Bahdanau et al. of the University of Montreal in 2016. The model named \\"Listen, Attend and Spell\\" (LAS), literally \\"listens\\" to the acoustic signal, pays \\"attention\\" to different parts of the signal and \\"spells\\" out the transcript one character at a time. Unlike CTC-based models, attention-based models do not have conditional-independence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation, acoustic and language model directly. This means, during deployment, there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory. By the end of 2016, the attention-based models have seen considerable success including outperforming the CTC models (with or without an external language model). Various extensions have been proposed since the original LAS model. Latent Sequence Decompositions (LSD) was proposed by Carnegie Mellon University, MIT and Google Brain to directly emit sub-word units which are more natural than English characters; University of Oxford and Google DeepMind extended LAS to \\"Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell\\" (WLAS) to handle lip reading surpassing human-level performance. Applications =In- car systems= Typically a manual control input, for example by means of a finger control on the steering-wheel, enables the speech recognition system and this is signalled to the driver by an audio prompt. Following the audio prompt, the system has a \\"listening window\\" during which it may accept a speech input for recognition. Simple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls, select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone, MP3 player or music-loaded flash drive. Voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model. Some of the most recent car models offer natural- language speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands, allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases. With such systems there is, therefore, no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words. =Health care= Medical documentation In the health care sector, speech recognition can be implemented in front-end or back-end of the medical documentation process. Front-end speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speech-recognition engine, the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken, and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document. Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a digital dictation system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized. Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently. One of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to \\"Meaningful Use\\" standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an Electronic Health Record or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a controlled vocabulary) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse. A more significant issue is that most EHRs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voice-recognition capabilities. A large part of the clinician's interaction with the EHR involves navigation through the user interface using menus, and tab/button clicks, and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse: voice-based navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits. By contrast, many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice \\"macros\\", where the use of certain phrases ‚Äì e.g., \\"normal report\\", will automatically fill in a large number of default values and/or generate boilerplate, which will vary with the type of the exam ‚Äì e.g., a chest X-ray vs. a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system. Therapeutic use Prolonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with word processors has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in brain AVM patients who have been treated with resection. Further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs have been treated using radiologic techniques. =Military= High-performance fighter aircraft Substantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in fighter aircraft. Of particular note have been the US program in speech recognition for the Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)/F-16 aircraft (F-16 VISTA), the program in France for Mirage aircraft, and other programs in the UK dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms. In these programs, speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft, with applications including: setting radio frequencies, commanding an autopilot system, setting steer-point coordinates and weapons release parameters, and controlling flight display. Working with Swedish pilots flying in the JAS-39 Gripen cockpit, Englund (2004) found recognition deteriorated with increasing g-loads. The report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly. Contrary to what might have been expected, no effects of the broken English of the speakers were found. It was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer, as might have been expected. A restricted vocabulary, and above all, a proper syntax, could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially. The Eurofighter Typhoon, currently in service with the UK RAF, employs a speaker-dependent system, requiring each pilot to create a template. The system is not used for any safety-critical or weapon-critical tasks, such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage, but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions. Voice commands are confirmed by visual and/or aural feedback. The system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot workload, and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands. Speaker-independent systems are also being developed and are under test for the F35 Lightning II (JSF) and the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master lead-in fighter trainer. These systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of 98%. Helicopters The problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise pertain strongly to the helicopter environment as well as to the jet fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment, not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot, in general, does not wear a facemask, which would reduce acoustic noise in the microphone. Substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters, notably by the U.S. Army Avionics Research and Development Activity (AVRADA) and by the Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE) in the UK. Work in France has included speech recognition in the Puma helicopter. There has also been much useful work in Canada. Results have been encouraging, and voice applications have included: control of communication radios, setting of navigation systems, and control of an automated target handover system. As in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness. Encouraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment. Much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall speech technology in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings. Training air traffic controllers Training for air traffic controllers (ATC) represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems. Many ATC training systems currently require a person to act as a \\"pseudo-pilot\\", engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation. Speech recognition and synthesis techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support personnel. In theory, Air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible. In practice, this is rarely the case. The FAA document 7110.65 details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers. While this document gives less than 150 examples of such phrases, the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of 500,000. The USAF, USMC, US Army, US Navy, and FAA as well as a number of international ATC training organizations such as the Royal Australian Air Force and Civil Aviation Authorities in Italy, Brazil, and Canada are currently using ATC simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors. =Telephony and other domains= ASR is now commonplace in the field of telephony and is becoming more widespread in the field of computer gaming and simulation. In telephony systems, ASR is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with IVR systems. Despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing, in the field of document production, ASR has not seen the expected increases in use. The improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in smartphones. Speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface, for creating predefined or custom speech commands. = Usage in education and daily life = For language learning, speech recognition can be useful for learning a second language. It can teach proper pronunciation, in addition to helping a person develop fluency with their speaking skills. Students who are blind (see Blindness and education) or have very low vision can benefit from using the technology to convey words and then hear the computer recite them, as well as use a computer by commanding with their voice, instead of having to look at the screen and keyboard. Students who are physically disabled or suffer from Repetitive strain injury/other injuries to the upper extremities can be relieved from having to worry about handwriting, typing, or working with scribe on school assignments by using speech-to-text programs. They can also utilize speech recognition technology to freely enjoy searching the Internet or using a computer at home without having to physically operate a mouse and keyboard. Speech recognition can allow students with learning disabilities to become better writers. By saying the words aloud, they can increase the fluidity of their writing, and be alleviated of concerns regarding spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of writing. Also, see Learning disability. Use of voice recognition software, in conjunction with a digital audio recorder and a personal computer running word-processing software has proven to be positive for restoring damaged short-term-memory capacity, in stroke and craniotomy individuals. =People with disabilities= People with disabilities can benefit from speech recognition programs. For individuals that are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, speech recognition software is used to automatically generate a closed-captioning of conversations such as discussions in conference rooms, classroom lectures, and/or religious services. Speech recognition is also very useful for people who have difficulty using their hands, ranging from mild repetitive stress injuries to involve disabilities that preclude using conventional computer input devices. In fact, people who used the keyboard a lot and developed RSI became an urgent early market for speech recognition.Friends International Support Group Speech recognition is used in deaf telephony, such as voicemail to text, relay services, and captioned telephone. Individuals with learning disabilities who have problems with thought-to-paper communication (essentially they think of an idea but it is processed incorrectly causing it to end up differently on paper) can possibly benefit from the software but the technology is not bug proof. Also the whole idea of speak to text can be hard for intellectually disabled person's due to the fact that it is rare that anyone tries to learn the technology to teach the person with the disability.Forgrave, Karen E. \\"Assistive Technology: Empowering Students with Disabilities.\\" Clearing House 75.3 (2002): 122‚Äì6. Web. This type of technology can help those with dyslexia but other disabilities are still in question. The effectiveness of the product is the problem that is hindering it being effective. Although a kid may be able to say a word depending on how clear they say it the technology may think they are saying another word and input the wrong one. Giving them more work to fix, causing them to have to take more time with fixing the wrong word. =Further applications= *Aerospace (e.g. space exploration, spacecraft, etc.) NASA's Mars Polar Lander used speech recognition technology from Sensory, Inc. in the Mars Microphone on the Lander *Automatic subtitling with speech recognition *Automatic emotion recognition *Automatic translation *Court reporting (Real time Speech Writing) *eDiscovery (Legal discovery) *Hands-free computing: Speech recognition computer user interface *Home automation *Interactive voice response *Mobile telephony, including mobile email *Multimodal interaction *Pronunciation evaluation in computer-aided language learning applications *Real Time Captioning *Robotics *Speech to text (transcription of speech into text, real time video captioning, Court reporting ) *Telematics (e.g. vehicle Navigation Systems) *Transcription (digital speech-to-text) *Video games, with Tom Clancy's EndWar and Lifeline as working examples *Virtual assistant (e.g. Apple's Siri) Performance The performance of speech recognition systems is usually evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed.Ciaramella, Alberto. \\"A prototype performance evaluation report.\\" Sundial workpackage 8000 (1993). Accuracy is usually rated with word error rate (WER), whereas speed is measured with the real time factor. Other measures of accuracy include Single Word Error Rate (SWER) and Command Success Rate (CSR). Speech recognition by machine is a very complex problem, however. Vocalizations vary in terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. Accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following:National Institute of Standards and Technology. \\"The History of Automatic Speech Recognition Evaluation at NIST \\". * Vocabulary size and confusability * Speaker dependence versus independence * Isolated, discontinuous or continuous speech * Task and language constraints * Read versus spontaneous speech * Adverse conditions =Accuracy= As mentioned earlier in this article, accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors: * Error rates increase as the vocabulary size grows: ::e.g. the 10 digits \\"zero\\" to \\"nine\\" can be recognized essentially perfectly, but vocabulary sizes of 200, 5000 or 100000 may have error rates of 3%, 7% or 45% respectively. * Vocabulary is hard to recognize if it contains confusing words: ::e.g. the 26 letters of the English alphabet are difficult to discriminate because they are confusing words (most notoriously, the E-set: \\"B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z\\"); an 8% error rate is considered good for this vocabulary. * Speaker dependence vs. independence: ::A speaker-dependent system is intended for use by a single speaker. ::A speaker-independent system is intended for use by any speaker (more difficult). * Isolated, Discontinuous or continuous speech ::With isolated speech, single words are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech. With discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech. With continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used, therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech, different from both isolated and discontinuous speech. * Task and language constraints **e.g. Querying application may dismiss the hypothesis \\"The apple is red.\\" **e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting \\"The apple is angry.\\" **e.g. Syntactic; rejecting \\"Red is apple the.\\" Constraints are often represented by a grammar. * Read vs. Spontaneous Speech ‚Äì When a person reads it's usually in a context that has been previously prepared, but when a person uses spontaneous speech, it is difficult to recognize the speech because of the disfluencies (like \\"uh\\" and \\"um\\", false starts, incomplete sentences, stuttering, coughing, and laughter) and limited vocabulary. * Adverse conditions ‚Äì Environmental noise (e.g. Noise in a car or a factory). Acoustical distortions (e.g. echoes, room acoustics) Speech recognition is a multi-leveled pattern recognition task. * Acoustical signals are structured into a hierarchy of units, e.g. Phonemes, Words, Phrases, and Sentences; * Each level provides additional constraints; e.g. Known word pronunciations or legal word sequences, which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at lower level; * This hierarchy of constraints are exploited. By combining decisions probabilistically at all lower levels, and making more deterministic decisions only at the highest level, speech recognition by a machine is a process broken into several phases. Computationally, it is a problem in which a sound pattern has to be recognized or classified into a category that represents a meaning to a human. Every acoustic signal can be broken in smaller more basic sub-signals. As the more complex sound signal is broken into the smaller sub-sounds, different levels are created, where at the top level we have complex sounds, which are made of simpler sounds on lower level, and going to lower levels even more, we create more basic and shorter and simpler sounds. The lowest level, where the sounds are the most fundamental, a machine would check for simple and more probabilistic rules of what sound should represent. Once these sounds are put together into more complex sound on upper level, a new set of more deterministic rules should predict what new complex sound should represent. The most upper level of a deterministic rule should figure out the meaning of complex expressions. In order to expand our knowledge about speech recognition we need to take into a consideration neural networks. There are four steps of neural network approaches: * Digitize the speech that we want to recognize For telephone speech the sampling rate is 8000 samples per second; * Compute features of spectral-domain of the speech (with Fourier transform); computed every 10 ms, with one 10 ms section called a frame; Analysis of four-step neural network approaches can be explained by further information. Sound is produced by air (or some other medium) vibration, which we register by ears, but machines by receivers. Basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions: amplitude (how strong is it), and frequency (how often it vibrates per second). Accuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate (WER). Word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment. The problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of recognized word and referenced word. Let S be the number of substitutions, D be the number of deletions, I be the number of insertions, N be the number of word references. The formula to compute the word error rate(WER) is WER = (S+D+I)√∑N While computing the word recognition rate (WRR) word error rate (WER) is used and the formula is WRR = 1- WER = (N-S-D-I)√∑ N = (H-I)√∑N Here H is the number of correctly recognized words. H= N-(S+D). =Security concerns= Speech recognition can become a means of attack, theft, or accidental operation. For example, activation words like \\"Alexa\\" spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately, or possibly take an unwanted action. Voice-controlled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building, or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside. Attackers may be able to gain access to personal information, like calendar, address book contents, private messages, and documents. They may also be able to impersonate the user to send messages or make online purchases. Two attacks have been demonstrated that use artificial sounds. One transmits ultrasound and attempt to send commands without nearby people noticing. The other adds small, inaudible distortions to other speech or music that are specially crafted to confuse the specific speech recognition system into recognizing music as speech, or to make what sounds like one command to a human sound like a different command to the system. Further information = Conferences and journals = Popular speech recognition conferences held each year or two include SpeechTEK and SpeechTEK Europe, ICASSP, Interspeech/Eurospeech, and the IEEE ASRU. Conferences in the field of natural language processing, such as ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and HLT, are beginning to include papers on speech processing. Important journals include the IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing (later renamed IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing and since Sept 2014 renamed IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing‚Äîafter merging with an ACM publication), Computer Speech and Language, and Speech Communication. = Books = Books like \\"Fundamentals of Speech Recognition\\" by Lawrence Rabiner can be useful to acquire basic knowledge but may not be fully up to date (1993). Another good source can be \\"Statistical Methods for Speech Recognition\\" by Frederick Jelinek and \\"Spoken Language Processing (2001)\\" by Xuedong Huang etc., \\"Computer Speech\\", by Manfred R. Schroeder, second edition published in 2004, and \\"Speech Processing: A Dynamic and Optimization-Oriented Approach\\" published in 2003 by Li Deng and Doug O'Shaughnessey. The updated textbook Speech and Language Processing (2008) by Jurafsky and Martin presents the basics and the state of the art for ASR. Speaker recognition also uses the same features, most of the same front-end processing, and classification techniques as is done in speech recognition. A comprehensive textbook, \\"Fundamentals of Speaker Recognition\\" is an in depth source for up to date details on the theory and practice. A good insight into the techniques used in the best modern systems can be gained by paying attention to government sponsored evaluations such as those organised by DARPA (the largest speech recognition-related project ongoing as of 2007 is the GALE project, which involves both speech recognition and translation components). A good and accessible introduction to speech recognition technology and its history is provided by the general audience book \\"The Voice in the Machine. Building Computers That Understand Speech\\" by Roberto Pieraccini (2012). The most recent book on speech recognition is Automatic Speech Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach (Publisher: Springer) written by Microsoft researchers D. Yu and L. Deng and published near the end of 2014, with highly mathematically oriented technical detail on how deep learning methods are derived and implemented in modern speech recognition systems based on DNNs and related deep learning methods. A related book, published earlier in 2014, \\"Deep Learning: Methods and Applications\\" by L. Deng and D. Yu provides a less technical but more methodology-focused overview of DNN-based speech recognition during 2009‚Äì2014, placed within the more general context of deep learning applications including not only speech recognition but also image recognition, natural language processing, information retrieval, multimodal processing, and multitask learning. = Software = In terms of freely available resources, Carnegie Mellon University's Sphinx toolkit is one place to start to both learn about speech recognition and to start experimenting. Another resource (free but copyrighted) is the HTK book (and the accompanying HTK toolkit). For more recent and state-of-the-art techniques, Kaldi toolkit can be used. In 2017 Mozilla launched the open source project called Common Voice to gather big database of voices that would help build free speech recognition project DeepSpeech (available free at GitHub) using Google open source platform TensorFlow.

Such sounds are often referred to informally as lenis or half-voiced in the case of consonants. In some Chinese varieties, such as Wu, and in a few Austronesian languages, the 'intermediate' phonation of slack stops confuses listeners of languages without these distinctions, so that different transcription systems may use or for the same consonant. In Xhosa, slack-voiced consonants have usually been transcribed as breathy voice. Although the IPA has no dedicated diacritic for slack voice, the voiceless diacritic (the under-ring) may be used with a voiced consonant letter, though this convention is also used for partially voiced consonants in languages such as English.

In religion and theology, salvation generally refers to the deliverance of the soul from sin and its consequences.\\"Salvation.\\" Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed.). Oxford University Press. 1989. \\"The saving of the soul; the deliverance from sin and its consequences.\\" The academic study of salvation is called soteriology.  Meaning  In religion and theology, salvation is the saving of the soul from sin and its consequences. It may also be called deliverance or redemption from sin and its effects.Graves Jr., Wilfred. 2011. In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God's Salvation for the Total Person. Shippensburg, PA: Destiny Image. pp. 9, 22, 74‚Äì5. Depending on the religion or even denomination, salvation is considered to be caused either only by the grace of God (i.e. unmerited and unearned), or by faith, good deeds (works), or a combination thereof. Religions often emphasize that man is a sinner by nature and that the penalty of sin is death (physical death, spiritual death: spiritual separation from God and eternal punishment in hell). Judaism In contemporary Judaism, redemption (Hebrew: ), refers to God redeeming the people of Israel from their various exiles. This includes the final redemption from the present exile.Brandon, Samuel G. F. [1999] 2012. \\"Salvation, Judaism.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Accessed 25 June 2020. Judaism holds that adherents do not need personal salvation as Christians believe. Jews do not subscribe to the doctrine of original sin.\\"How Does a Jew Attain Salvation?\\" Accessed 4 May 2013. Instead, they place a high value on individual morality as defined in the law of God‚Äîembodied in what Jews know as the Torah or The Law, given to Moses by God on biblical Mount Sinai. In Judaism, salvation is closely related to the idea of redemption, a saving from the states or circumstances that destroy the value of human existence. God, as the universal spirit and Creator of the World, is the source of all salvation for humanity, provided an individual honours God by observing his precepts. So redemption or salvation depends on the individual. Judaism stresses that salvation cannot be obtained through anyone else or by just invoking a deity or believing in any outside power or influence.Malekar, Ezekiel Isaac. 20 November 2004. \\"The Speaking Tree: Concept of Salvation In Judaism.\\" The Times of India. Accessed: 4 May 2013 When examining Jewish intellectual sources throughout history, there is clearly a spectrum of opinions regarding death versus the afterlife. Possibly an over-simplification, one source says salvation can be achieved in the following manner: Live a holy and righteous life dedicated to Yahweh, the God of Creation. Fast, worship, and celebrate during the appropriate holidays.\\"How do I achieve salvation according to Judaism?\\" Accessed: 4 May 2013 By origin and nature, Judaism is an ethnic religion. Therefore, salvation has been primarily conceived in terms of the destiny of Israel as the elect people of Yahweh (often referred to as ‚Äúthe Lord‚Äù), the God of Israel. In the biblical text of Psalms, there is a description of death, when people go into the earth or the \\"realm of the dead\\" and cannot praise God. The first reference to resurrection is collective in Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones, when all the Israelites in exile will be resurrected. There is a reference to individual resurrection in the Book of Daniel (165 BCE), the last book of the Hebrew Bible.Krell, Marc A. \\"Afterlife and Salvation\\". Religion Library: Judaism. Accessed 4 May 2013 It was not until the 2nd century BCE that there arose a belief in an afterlife, in which the dead would be resurrected and undergo divine judgment. Before that time, the individual had to be content that his posterity continued within the holy nation. The salvation of the individual Jew was connected to the salvation of the entire people. This belief stemmed directly from the teachings of the Torah. In the Torah, God taught his people sanctification of the individual. However, he also expected them to function together (spiritually) and be accountable to one another. The concept of salvation was tied to that of restoration for Israel.  Christianity  Allegory of Salvation by Antonius Heusler (ca. 1555), National Museum in Warsaw. Christianity's primary premise is that the incarnation and death of Jesus Christ formed the climax of a divine plan for humanity's salvation. This plan was conceived by God before the creation of the world, achieved at the cross, and it would be completed at the Last Judgment, when the Second Coming of Christ would mark the catastrophic end of the world.Stefon, Matt. [1999] 2019. \\"Christianity.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Accessed 25 July 2020. For Christianity, salvation is only possible through Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus' death on the cross was the once-for-all sacrifice that atoned for the sin of humanity. The Christian religion, though not the exclusive possessor of the idea of redemption, has given to it a special definiteness and a dominant position. Taken in its widest sense, as deliverance from dangers and ills in general, most religions teach some form of it. It assumes an important position, however, only when the ills in question form part of a great system against which human power is helpless.\\"Redemption.\\" Christian Classics Ethereal Library. Calvin College. 2 July 2009. Allegory of Salvation by Wolf Huber (ca. 1543), Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna According to Christian belief, sin as the human predicament is considered to be universal. For example, in the Apostle Paul declared everyone to be under sin‚ÄîJew and Gentile alike. Salvation is made possible by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, which in the context of salvation is referred to as the \\"atonement\\".\\"Christian Doctrines of Salvation\\".

While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agrees that salvation is made possible by the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, dying on the cross. Variant views on salvation are among the main fault lines dividing the various Christian denominations, both between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism and within Protestantism, notably in the Calvinist‚ÄìArminian debate, and the fault lines include conflicting definitions of depravity, predestination, atonement, but most pointedly justification. A bumper sticker asking if one has found salvation Salvation, according to most denominations, is believed to be a process that begins when a person first becomes a Christian, continues through that person's life, and is completed when they stand before Christ in judgment. Therefore, according to Catholic apologist James Akin, the faithful Christian can say in faith and hope, \\"I have been saved; I am being saved; and I will be saved.\\"Akin, James. October 2001. \\"The Salvation Controversy.\\" Catholic Answers. Christian salvation concepts are varied and complicated by certain theological concepts, traditional beliefs, and dogmas. Scripture is subject to individual and ecclesiastical interpretations. While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agrees that salvation is made possible by the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, dying on the cross. The purpose of salvation is debated, but in general most Christian theologians agree that God devised and implemented his plan of salvation because he loves them and regards human beings as his children. Since human existence on Earth is said to be \\"given to sin,\\" salvation also has connotations that deal with the liberation of human beings from sin, and the suffering associated with the punishment of sin‚Äîi.e., \\"the wages of sin are death.\\" Christians believe that salvation depends on the grace of God. Stagg writes that a fact assumed throughout the Bible is that humanity is in, \\"serious trouble from which we need deliverance‚Ä¶. The fact of sin as the human predicament is implied in the mission of Jesus, and it is explicitly affirmed in that connection.\\" By its nature, salvation must answer to the plight of humankind as it actually is. Each individual's plight as sinner is the result of a fatal choice involving the whole person in bondage, guilt, estrangement, and death. Therefore, salvation must be concerned with the total person. \\"It must offer redemption from bondage, forgiveness for guilt, reconciliation for estrangement, renewal for the marred image of God.\\"Stagg, Frank. 1962. New Testament Theology. Broadman Press. . pp.11‚Äì13, 80 =Mormonism= According to doctrine of the Latter Day Saint movement, the plan of salvation is a plan that God created to save, redeem, and exalt humankind. The elements of this plan are drawn from various sources, including the Bible,See for example , ,, , , , , , , , and Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and numerous statements made by the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The first appearance of the graphical representation of the plan of salvation is in the 1952 missionary manual entitled A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel.https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/go-ye-all- world/missionary-training-and-practices/5-missionary-materials-and- methods#_edn69 Islam In Islam, salvation refers to the eventual entrance to Paradise. Islam teaches that people who die disbelieving in God do not receive salvation. It also teaches that non-Muslims who die believing in the God but disbelieving in his message (Islam), are left to his will. Those who die believing in the One God and his message (Islam) receive salvation.The Facts On Islam, By John Ankerberg, John Weldon, Dillon Burroughs, p.37 Narrated Anas that Muhammad said: Islam teaches that all who enter into Islam must remain so in order to receive salvation. For those who have not been granted Islam or to whom the message has not been brought: =Tawhid= Belief in the ‚ÄúOne God‚Äù, also known as the Tawhid () in Arabic, consists of two parts (or principles): # Taw·∏•ƒ´du r-Rub≈´biyya (): Believing in the attributes of God and attributing them to no other but God. Such attributes include Creation, having no beginning, and having no end. These attributes are what make a God. Islam also teaches 99 names for God, and each of these names defines one attribute. One breaks this principle, for example, by believing in an Idol as an intercessor to God. The idol, in this case, is thought of having powers that only God should have, thereby breaking this part of Tawheed. No intercession is required to communicate with, or worship, God. # Taw·∏•ƒ´du l-'ul≈´hiyya (): Directing worship, prayer, or deed to God, and God only. For example, worshiping an idol or any saint or prophet is also considered Shirk. =Sin and repentance= Islam also stresses that in order to gain salvation, one must also avoid sinning along with performing good deeds. Islam acknowledges the inclination of humanity towards sin. Therefore, Muslims are constantly commanded to seek God's forgiveness and repent. Islam teaches that no one can gain salvation simply by virtue of their belief or deeds, instead it is the Mercy of God, which merits them salvation.Answering Islam: The Crescent in Light of the Cross, by Norman L. Geisler, Abdul Saleeb, p.128 However, this repentance must not be used to sin any further. Islam teaches that God is Merciful. Islam describes a true believer to have Love of God and Fear of God. Islam also teaches that every person is responsible for their own sins. The Quran states; Al-Agharr al-Muzani, a companion of Mohammad, reported that Ibn 'Umar stated to him that Mohammad said, Sin in Islam is not a state, but an action (a bad deed); Islam teaches that a child is born sinless, regardless of the belief of his parents, dies a Muslim; he enters heaven, and does not enter hell. =Five Pillars= Islam is built on five principles, acts of worship that Islam teaches to be mandatory. Not performing the mandatory acts of worship may deprive Muslims of the chance of salvation. According to Ibn 'Umar, Muhammad said that Islam is based on the following five principles: # To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Apostle. # To offer the compulsory prayers dutifully and perfectly. # To pay Zakat to poor and needy (i.e. obligatory charity of 2.5% annually of surplus wealth). # To perform Hajj. (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca) # To observe fast during the month of Ramadhan.  Indian religions  Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism share certain key concepts, which are interpreted differently by different groups and individuals. In these religions one is not liberated from sin and its consequences, but from the sa·πÉsƒÅra (cycle of rebirth) perpetuated by passions and delusions and its resulting karma. They differ however on the exact nature of this liberation. Salvation is always self-attained in Dharmic traditions, and a more appropriate term would be moksha ('liberation') or mukti ('release'). This state and the conditions considered necessary for its realization is described in early texts of Indian religion such as the Upanishads and the PƒÅli Canon, and later texts such the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Vedanta tradition. Moksha can be attained by sƒÅdhanƒÅ, literally 'means of accomplishing something'.V. S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary. p. 979. It includes a variety of disciplines, such as yoga and meditation. Nirvana is the profound peace of mind that is acquired with moksha. In Buddhism and Jainism, it is the state of being free from suffering. In Hindu philosophy, it is union with the Brahman (Supreme Being). The word literally means 'blown out' (as in a candle) and refers, in the Buddhist context, to the blowing out of the fires of desire, aversion, and delusion, and the imperturbable stillness of mind acquired thereafter.Richard Gombrich, Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient BenƒÅres to Modern Colombo. Routledge In Theravada Buddhism the emphasis is on one's own liberation from samsara. The Mahayana traditions emphasize the bodhisattva path, in which \\"each Buddha and Bodhisattva is a redeemer,\\" assisting the Buddhist in seeking to achieve the redemptive state.Joseph Edkins, Chinese Buddhism (1893), p. 364. The assistance rendered is a form of self-sacrifice on the part of the teachers, who would presumably be able to achieve total detachment from worldly concerns, but have instead chosen to remain engaged in the material world to the degree that this is necessary to assist others in achieving such detachment. =Jainism= In Jainism, salvation, moksha, and nirvana are one and the same.: \\"Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism\\". p.168Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society Cambridge University Press. : \\"Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa.\\" p.297 When a soul (atman) achieves moksha, it is released from the cycle of births and deaths, and achieves its pure self. It then becomes a siddha ('one who has accomplished his ultimate objective'). Attaining Moksha requires annihilation of all karmas, good and bad, because if karma is left, it must bear fruit.

In the late 1990s, the S-3B's mission focus shifted to surface warfare and aerial refueling. The Viking also provided electronic warfare and surface surveillance capabilities to a carrier battle group. A carrier-based, subsonic, all-weather, long-range, multi-mission aircraft, it carried automated weapon systems and was capable of extended missions with in-flight refueling. Because of its characteristic sound, it was nicknamed the \\"War Hoover\\" after the vacuum cleaner brand. The S-3 was phased out from front-line fleet service aboard aircraft carriers in January 2009, with its missions taken over by aircraft like the P-3C Orion, P-8 Poseidon, Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Several aircraft were flown by Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Thirty (VX-30) at Naval Base Ventura County / NAS Point Mugu, California, for range clearance and surveillance operations\\"S-3B Viking re-enters USN service in test range surveillance role.\\" Janes.com.

Development YS-3A prototype S-3 escape system testing In the mid-1960s, the USN developed the VSX (Heavier-than-air, Anti-submarine, Experimental) requirement for a replacement for the piston- engined Grumman S-2 Tracker as an anti-submarine aircraft to fly off aircraft carriers. In August 1968, a team led by Lockheed and a Convair/Grumman team were asked to further develop their proposals to meet this requirement.Francillon 1982, pp. 455‚Äì456. Lockheed recognised that it had little experience in designing carrier based aircraft, so Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) was brought into the team, being responsible for the folding wings and tail, the engine nacelles, and the landing gear, which was derived from LTV A-7 Corsair II (nose) and Vought F-8 Crusader (main). Sperry Univac Federal Systems was assigned the task of developing the aircraft's onboard computers which integrated input from sensors and sonobuoys.Godfrey 1974, p. 6.Goebel, Greg. \\"The Lockheed S-3 Viking.\\" Air Vectors, 1 May 2005. Retrieved: 21 April 2010. On 4 August 1969, Lockheed's design was selected as the winner of the contest and 8 prototypes, designated YS-3A were ordered.Francillon 1982, p. 457. The first prototype was flown on 21 January 1972 by military test pilot John Christiansen,Francillon, Ren√© J. (1987). Lockheed Aircraft Since 1913. Naval Institute Press. p. 467. . and the S-3 entered service in 1974. During the production run from 1974 to 1978, a total of 186 S-3As have been built. The majority of the surviving S-3As were later upgraded to the S-3B variant, with 16 aircraft converted into ES-3A Shadow electronic intelligence (ELINT) collection aircraft. Design The S-3 is a conventional monoplane with a cantilever shoulder wing,Taylor, John W. R.: Jane's All The World's Aircraft, 1977‚Äì78. Jane's Yearbooks, London 1977, p. 329. very slightly swept with a leading edge angle of 15¬∞ and an almost straight trailing edge. Its 2 GE TF-34 high-bypass turbofan engines mounted in nacelles under the wings provide excellent fuel efficiency, giving the Viking the required long range and endurance,Elward 1998, pp. 54‚Äì55. while maintaining docile engine-out characteristics.Elward 1998, p. 69. S-3A with extended MAD-sensor The aircraft can seat 4 crew members (3 officers and 1 enlisted) with pilot and copilot/tactical coordinator (COTAC) in the front of the cockpit and the tactical coordinator (TACCO) and sensor operator (SENSO) in the back. Entry is via a hatch/ladder folding down out of the lower starboard side of the fuselage behind the cockpit, in between the rear and front seats on the starboard side. When the aircraft's anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role ended in the late 1990s, the enlisted SENSOs were removed from the crew. In tanker crew configuration, the S-3B typically flew with a pilot and co-pilot/COTAC. The wing is fitted with leading edge and Fowler flaps. Spoilers are fitted to both the upper and the lower surfaces of the wings. All control surfaces are actuated by dual hydraulically boosted irreversible systems. In the event of dual hydraulic failures, an Emergency Flight Control System (EFCS) permits manual control with greatly increased stick forces and reduced control authority.Taylor 1976, pp. 315‚Äì316. Unlike many tactical jets which required ground service equipment, the S-3 was equipped with an auxiliary power unit (APU) and capable of unassisted starts. The aircraft's original APU could provide only minimal electric power and pressurized air for both aircraft cooling and for the engines' pneumatic starters. A newer, more powerful APU could provide full electrical service to the aircraft. The APU itself was started from a hydraulic accumulator by pulling a handle in the cockpit. The APU accumulator was fed from the primary hydraulic system, but could also be pumped up manually (with much effort) from the cockpit. All crew members sit on forward-facing, upward-firing Douglas Escapac zero-zero ejection seats. In \\"group eject\\" mode, initiating ejection from either of the front seat ejects the entire crew in sequence, with the back seats ejecting 0.5 seconds before the front in order to provide safe separation (this was to prevent the pilots, who were more aware of what was happening outside the aircraft from ejecting without the rest of the crew, or being forced to delay ejection to order the crew to eject in an emergency; ejection from either rear seat would not eject the pilots, who had to initiate their own ejections, to prevent loss of the aircraft if a rear crewmember ejected prematurely. If a pilot ejected prematurely, the plane was lost anyway, and automatic ejection prevented the crew from crashing with a pilot-less aircraft before they were aware of what had happened). The rear seats are capable of self ejection and the ejection sequence includes a pyrotechnic charge that stows the rear keyboard trays out of the occupants' way immediately before ejection. Safe ejection requires the seats to be weighted in pairs and when flying with a single crewman in the back the unoccupied seat is fitted with ballast. At the time it entered the fleet, the S-3 introduced an unprecedented level of systems integration. Previous ASW aircraft like the Lockheed P-3 Orion and S-3's predecessor, the Grumman S-2 Tracker, featured separate instrumentation and controls for each sensor system. Sensor operators often monitored paper traces, using mechanical calipers to make precise measurements and annotating data by writing on the scrolling paper. Beginning with the S-3, all sensor systems were integrated through a single General Purpose Digital Computer (GPDC). Each crew station had its own display, the co-pilot/COTAC, TACCO and SENSO displays were Multi- Purpose Displays (MPD) capable of displaying data from any of a number of systems. This new level of integration allowed the crew to consult with each other by examining the same data at multiple stations simultaneously, to manage workload by assigning responsibility for a given sensor from one station to another and to easily combine clues from each sensor to classify faint targets. Because of this, the 4-crew S-3 was considered roughly equivalent in capability to the much larger P-3 with a crew of 12. The aircraft has two underwing hardpoints that can be used to carry fuel tanks, general purpose and cluster bombs, missiles, rockets, and storage pods. It also has four internal bomb bay stations that can be used to carry general- purpose bombs, aerial torpedoes, and special stores (B57 and B61 nuclear weapons). Fifty-nine sonobuoys are carried, as well as a dedicated Search and Rescue (SAR) chute. The S-3 is fitted with the ALE-39 countermeasure system and can carry up to 90 rounds of chaff, flares, and expendable jammers (or a combination of all) in three dispensers. A retractable magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) Boom is fitted in the tail. In the late 1990s, the S-3B's role was changed from anti-submarine warfare (ASW) to anti-surface warfare (ASuW). At that time, the MAD Boom was removed, along with several hundred pounds of submarine detection electronics. With no remaining sonobuoy processing capability, most of the sonobuoy chutes were faired over with a blanking plate. Operational history S-3A replaced the outdated S-2 Tracker in 1975 On 20 February 1974, the S-3A officially became operational with the Air Antisubmarine Squadron FORTY-ONE (VS-41), the \\"Shamrocks,\\" at NAS North Island, California, which served as the initial S-3 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets until a separate Atlantic Fleet FRS, VS-27, was established in the 1980s. The first operational cruise of the S-3A took place in 1975 with the VS-21 \\"Fighting Redtails\\" aboard . Starting in 1987, some S-3As were upgraded to S-3B standard with the addition of a number of new sensors, avionics, and weapons systems, including the capability to launch the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile. The S-3B could also be fitted with \\"buddy stores\\", external fuel tanks that allowed the Viking to refuel other aircraft. In July 1988, VS-30 became the first fleet squadron to receive the enhanced capability Harpoon/ISAR equipped S-3B, based at NAS Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida. 16 S-3As were converted to ES-3A Shadows for carrier-based electronic intelligence (ELINT) duties. Six aircraft, designated US-3A, were converted for a specialized utility and limited cargo Carrier onboard delivery (COD) requirement. Plans were also made to develop the KS-3A carrier-based tanker aircraft, but this program was ultimately cancelled after the conversion of just one early development S-3A.Air International July 1986, pp. 44‚Äì45. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakup of the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-Russian submarine threat was perceived as much reduced, and the Vikings had the majority of their antisubmarine warfare equipment removed. The aircraft's mission subsequently changed to sea surface search, sea and ground attack, over-the-horizon targeting, and aircraft refueling. As a result, the S-3B after 1997 was typically crewed by one pilot and one copilot [NFO]; the additional seats in the S-3B could still support additional crew members for certain missions. To reflect these new missions the Viking squadrons were redesignated from \\"Air Antisubmarine Warfare Squadrons\\" to \\"Sea Control Squadrons.\\" During the Cold War, the S-3's main task was anti- submarine warfare, like this VS-32 S-3A Prior to the aircraft's retirement from front-line fleet use aboard US aircraft carriers, a number of upgrade programs were implemented. These include the Carrier Airborne Inertial Navigation System II (CAINS II) upgrade, which replaced older inertial navigation hardware with ring laser gyroscopes with a Honeywell EGI (Enhanced GPS Inertial Navigation System) and added digital electronic flight instruments (EFI). The Maverick Plus System (MPS) added the capability to employ the AGM-65E laser-guided or AGM-65F infrared-guided air-to-surface missile, and the AGM-84H/K Stand-off Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM/ER). The SLAM/ER is a GPS/inertial/infrared guided cruise missile derived from the AGM-84 Harpoon that can be controlled by the aircrew in the terminal phase of flight if an AWW-13 data link pod is carried by the aircraft. The S-3B saw extensive service during the 1991 Gulf War, performing attack, tanker, and ELINT duties, and launching ADM-141 TALD decoys. This was the first time an S-3B was employed overland during an offensive air strike. The first mission occurred when an aircraft from VS-24, from the , attacked an Iraqi Silkworm missile site. The aircraft also participated in the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s and in Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001. The first ES-3A was delivered in 1991, entering service after two years of testing. The Navy established two squadrons of eight ES-3A aircraft each in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets to provide detachments of typically two aircraft, ten officers, and 55 enlisted aircrew, maintenance and support personnel (which comprised/supported four complete aircrews) to deploying carrier air wings. The Pacific Fleet squadron, Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron FIVE (VQ-5), the \\"Sea Shadows,\\" was originally based at the former NAS Agana, Guam but later relocated to NAS North Island in San Diego, California, with the Pacific Fleet S-3 Viking squadrons when NAS Agana closed in 1995 as a result of a 1993 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision. The Atlantic Fleet squadron, the VQ-6 \\"Black Ravens,\\" were originally based with all Atlantic Fleet S-3 Vikings at the former NAS Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida, but later moved to NAS Jacksonville, approximately to the east, when NAS Cecil Field was closed in 1999 as a result of the same 1993 BRAC decision that closed NAS Agana. KA-6D retirement the S-3B became the main aerial refueling aircraft The ES-3A operated primarily with carrier battle groups, providing organic 'Indications and Warning' support to the group and joint theater commanders. In addition to their warning and reconnaissance roles, and their extraordinarily stable handling characteristics and range, Shadows were a preferred recovery tanker (aircraft that provide refueling for returning aircraft). They averaged over 100 flight hours per month while deployed. Excessive utilization caused earlier than expected equipment replacement when Naval aviation funds were limited, making them an easy target for budget-driven decision makers. In 1999, both ES-3A squadrons and all 16 aircraft were decommissioned and the ES-3A inventory placed in Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. =Iraq War= In March 2003, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, an S-3B Viking from Sea Control Squadron 38 (The \\"Red Griffins\\") piloted by Richard McGrath Jr. launched from . The crew successfully executed a time sensitive strike and fired a laser-guided Maverick missile to neutralize a significant Iraqi naval and leadership target in the port city of Basra, Iraq. This was one of the few times in its operational history that the S-3B Viking had been employed overland on an offensive combat air strike and the first time it launched a laser-guided Maverick missile in combat. S-3B Viking \\"Navy One\\" on , May 2003 On 1 May 2003, US President George W. Bush flew in the co-pilot seat of a VS-35 Viking from NAS North Island, California, to off the California coast. There, he delivered his \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech announcing the end of major combat in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the flight, the aircraft used the customary presidential callsign of \\"Navy One\\". The aircraft that President Bush flew in was retired shortly thereafter and on 15 July 2003 was accepted as an exhibit at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Between July and December 2008 the VS-22 Checkmates, the last sea control squadron, operated a detachment of four S-3Bs from the Al Asad Airbase in Al Anbar Province, west of Baghdad. The planes were fitted with LANTIRN pods and they performed non-traditional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (NTISR). After more than 350 missions, the Checkmates returned to NAS Jacksonville, Florida, on 15 December 2008, prior to disestablishing on 29 January 2009. =Retirement= VX-30's S-3B, callsign \\"Bloodhound 700\\", in 2010. S-3B N601NA has been operated by NASA since 2009. Though a proposed airframe known as the Common Support Aircraft was once advanced as a successor to the S-3, E-2 and C-2, this plan failed to materialize. As the surviving S-3 airframes were forced into sundown retirement, a Lockheed Martin full scale fatigue test was performed and extended the service life of the aircraft by approximately 11,000 flight-hours. This supported Navy plans to retire all Vikings from front-line fleet service by 2009 so new strike fighter and multi- mission aircraft could be introduced to recapitalize the aging fleet inventory, with former Viking missions assumed by other fixed-wing and rotary- wing aircraft. The final carrier based S-3B Squadron, VS-22 was decommissioned at NAS Jacksonville on 29 January 2009. Sea Control Wing Atlantic was decommissioned the following day on 30 January 2009, concurrent with the U.S. Navy retiring the last S-3B Viking from front-line Fleet service.\\"U.S. Navy retires last Lockheed Martin S-3B Viking from fleet service.\\" Lockheed Martin, 30 January 2009.

By late 2015, the U.S. Navy had three Vikings remaining operational in support roles. One was moved to The Boneyard in November 2015, and the final two were retired, one stored and the other transferred to NASA, on 11 January 2016, officially retiring the S-3 from Navy service.US Navy retires its last S-3B Vikings ‚Äì Flightglobal.com, 14 January 2016 Naval analysts have suggested returning the stored S-3s to service with the U.S. Navy to fill gaps it left in the carrier air wing when it was retired. This is in response to the realization that the Chinese navy is producing new weapons that can threaten carriers beyond the range their aircraft can strike them. Against the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, carrier-based F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-35C Lightning IIs have about half the unrefueled strike range, so bringing the S-3 back to aerial tanking duties would extend their range against it, as well as free up more Super Hornets that were forced to fill the role. Against submarines armed with anti-ship cruise missiles like the Klub and YJ-18, the S-3 would restore area coverage for ASW duties. Bringing the S-3 out of retirement could at least be a stop-gap measure to increase the survivability and capabilities of aircraft carriers until new aircraft can be developed for such purposes.U.S. Navy: Time to Bring Back the S-3 Viking? ‚Äì Thediplomet.com, 9 November 2015 =Potential interest= In October 2013, the Republic of Korea Navy expressed an interest in acquiring up to 18 ex-USN S-3s to augment their fleet of 16 Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft.Sung-Ki, Jung \\"S.

The ES-3A carried an extensive suite of electronic sensors and communications gear, replacing the S-3's submarine detection, armament, and maritime surveillance equipment with avionics racks accommodating the ES-3A's sensors. These modifications had minor impact on airspeed, reducing its top rated speed from 450 KTAS to 405 KTAS but had no noticeable impact on the aircraft's range and actually increased its rated loiter time. Because these aircraft were standoff indications and warnings platforms and were never intended to be part of an ingress strike package, this new speed limitation was considered insignificant. ;KS-3A :Proposed dedicated air tanker with fuel capacity of 4,382 US gal (16,600 l), one converted from YS-3A, later converted to US-3A. ;KS-3B :Proposed air tanker based on S-3B and utilizing the buddy refueling system, not built. ;US-3A :S-3A modified for carrier onboard delivery, capacity for six passengers or 4,680 lb (2,120 kg) of cargo, retired in 1998. ;Aladdin Viking :Conversion of six aircraft for overland surveillance and Elint missions.

It has been typically used as a compact and fast-moving rotorcraft for utility and anti- submarine warfare missions. Development of the Seasprite had been initiated during the late 1950s in response to a request from the United States Navy, calling for a suitably fast and compact naval helicopter for utility missions. Kaman's submission, internally designated as the K-20, was favourably evaluated, leading to the issuing of a contract for the construction of four prototypes and an initial batch of 12 production helicopters, designated as the HU2K-1. Under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, the HU2K was redesignated H-2, the HU2K-1 becoming the UH-2A. Beyond the U.S. Navy, the company had also made efforts to acquire other customers for export sales, in particular the Royal Canadian Navy; however, the initial interest of the Canadians was quelled as a result of Kaman's demand for price increases and the Seasprite performing below company projections during its sea trials. Due to its unsatisfactory performance, from 1968 onwards, the U.S. Navy's existing UH-2s were remanufactured from their originally-delivered single-engine arrangement to a more powerful twin-engine configuration. In October 1970, the Seasprite was selected by the U.S. Navy as the platform for the interim Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter, which resulted in greatly enhanced anti-submarine and anti-surface threat capabilities being developed and installed upon a new variant of the type, designated as the SH-2D/F. Accordingly, during the 1970s and 1980s, the majority of the existing UH-2 helicopters were remanufactured into the improved SH-2F model. In this configuration, the Seasprite extended and increased shipboard sensor and weapon capabilities against several types of enemy threats, including submarines of all types, surface ships and patrol craft that may be armed with anti-ship missiles. The Seasprite served for many decades with the U.S. Navy. Highlights of its service life included operations during the lengthy Vietnam War, in which the type was primarily used to rescue downed friendly aircrews within the theatre of operations, and its deployment during the Gulf War, where Seasprites conducted combat support and surface warfare operations against hostile Iraqi forces. In more routine operations, the Seasprite was operated in a number of roles, including anti-submarine warfare (ASW), search and rescue (SAR), utility and plane guard (the latter being performed when on attachment to aircraft carriers). The type was finally withdrawn in 2001 when the last examples of the final variant, known as the SH-2G Super Seasprite were retired. During the 1990s and 2000s, ex-U.S. Navy Seasprites were offered to various nations as a form of foreign aid, which typically met with mixed interest and a limited uptake. Design and development =Origins= A YUH-2A during ditching trials, 1963 In 1956, the U.S. Navy launched a new competition with the intent of meeting its requirements for a compact, all-weather multipurpose naval helicopter, encouraging private companies to submit their proposals.Donald, David ed. \\"Kaman H-2 Seasprite\\", The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. Barnes & Noble Books, 1997. . American manufacturer Kaman Aircraft Corporation decided to produce its own response for the competition, their submitted design, which was given the internal company designation of K-20, was of a relatively conventional helicopter powered by a single General Electric T58-8F turboshaft engine which drove a 44-foot four-bladed main rotor and a four-bladed tail rotor.McGowen 2005, p. 60. Following an evaluation of the designs that had been bid in response, the U.S. Navy decided to select the submission by Kaman to proceed with further development.Apostolo, G. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters. Bonanza Books, 1984. .Pattillo 2001, p. 211. Accordingly, in late 1957, Kaman was promptly awarded with a contract calling for the construction of four prototypes and an initial batch of 12 production helicopters, designated as the HU2K-1. In 1960, the Royal Canadian Navy announced that the HU2K has been identified as the frontrunner for their own requirement for an anti-submarine warfare helicopter; this choice was confirmed when the Treasury Board of the Canadian government gave its approval for the initial procurement of 12 rotorcraft from Kaman at a price of $14.5 million.Soward 1995, pp. 169‚Äì171. However, the Canadian purchase was disrupted by multiple factors, including Kaman's decision to abruptly raise the estimated price of the initial batch to $23 million; as the same time, there were concerns amongst officials that the manufacturer's projections of both the weight and performance criteria has been overly optimistic. In response, the Canadian Naval Board decided to hold off on issuing its approval to proceed with the HU2K purchase until after the US Navy had conducted sea trials with the type.Soward 1995, pp. 244‚Äì246. During these sea trials, it was revealed that the HU2K was indeed overweight and underpowered; in light of this inferior performance, the HU2K was deemed to be incapable of meeting the Canadian requirements. Accordingly, during late 1961, the competing Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King was selected to fulfil the intended role instead.Soward 1995, pp. 261‚Äì262. Having been unable to achieve any follow-on orders for the type, Kaman decided in the late 1960s to terminate production following the completion of the delivery of 184 H-2s to the U.S. Navy. However, in 1971, production was restarted by Kaman in order to manufacture an improved variant of the helicopter, designated as the SH-2F.Pattillo 2001, p. 312. A significant factor in the reopening of the production line was that the Navy's Sikorsky SH-60 Sea Hawk, which was both newer and more capable in anti- submarine operations, had been determined to be too large to allow it to be safely operated from the smaller flight decks present upon the older frigates then in service.Lehman 2001, p. 183. =Further development= Upon the enactment of the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, the HU2K-1 had been redesignated as the UH-2A, while the HU2K-1U model was redesignated as the UH-2B. During its service, the UH-2 Seasprite would be subject to several modifications and improvements, such as the addition of fixtures for the mounting of external stores. Beginning in 1968, the Navy's remaining UH-2s were extensively remanufactured; perhaps the most extensive alteration performance was the replacement of their original single-engine arrangement with a more powerful twin-engine configuration.Frawley 2002, p. 100. A UH-2C aboard USS Hancock between July 1968 and March 1969 In October 1970, the UH-2 was selected to be the platform to function as the interim Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopter. During the course of the 1960s, LAMPS had evolved out of an urgent requirement to develop a manned helicopter that would be capable of supporting a non-aviation vessel and serve as its tactical Anti-Submarine Warfare arm. Widely referred to as LAMPS Mark I, the advanced sensors, processors, and display capabilities aboard the helicopter enabled such equipped ships to extend their situational awareness beyond the line-of-sight limitations that unavoidably hampered the performance of shipboard radars, as well as the short distances involved in the acoustic detection and prosecution of underwater threats associated with hull-mounted sonars. Those H-2s that were reconfigured to perform the LAMPS mission were accordingly re-designated as SH-2Ds. On 16 March 1971, the first SH-2D LAMPS prototype conducted its first flight.Pattillo 2001, pp. 312‚Äì313. Beginning in 1973, production deliveries of the latest variant of the rotorcraft, designated as the SH-2F, commenced. Amongst the features of the SH-2F model was the full suite of LAMPS I equipment, along with various other improvements, such as upgraded engines, an extended life main rotor, and an elevated take-off weight. During 1981, the Navy placed an order for 60 production SH-2Fs. From 1987 onwards, a total of 16 SH-2Fs were upgraded with a chin-mounted forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor, chaff/flare launchers, dual rear-mounted infrared countermeasures, and missile/mine detecting equipment.Eden 2004, p. 219. Eventually, all but two H-2s that were then in the U.S. Navy inventory were remanufactured into the SH-2F configuration. The final production procurement of the SH-2F was in Fiscal Year 1986. The final six orders for production SH-2Fs were converted to the more extensive and newer SH-2G Super Seasprite variant. Operational history =United States= UH-2 in flight over the Tonkin Gulf, 1970 In 1962, the initial UH-2 model commenced its operational service with the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy quickly determined that the helicopter's capabilities were greatly restricted by its single engine; thus, the service ordered Kaman to retrofit all of its Seasprites into a more capable twin-engine arrangement instead; when furnished with a pair of engines, the Seasprite was capable of attaining an airspeed of 130 knots and operating at a range of up to 411 nautical miles. The U.S. Navy would operate a total fleet of nearly 200 Seasprites to perform a variety of missions, ranging from anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations, search and rescue (SAR) and utility transport. Under typical operational conditions, several UH-2s would be deployed upon each of the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers in order to perform plane guard and SAR missions. The UH-2 was introduced in time to see action in the Tonkin Gulf incident in August 1964. The Seasprite's principal contribution to what would escalate into the lengthy Vietnam War between the Soviet-backed North Vietnamese and the United States-backed South Vietnamese, was the retrieval of downed aircrews, both from the sea and from inside enemy territory. The type was increasingly relied upon to perform the retrieval mission as the conflict intensified, such as during Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965.Dunstan 2003, p. 152. During October 1966 alone, out of 269 downed pilots, helicopter-based SAR teams were recorded as having enabled the recovery of 103 men.Hearn 2005, p. 255. A UH-2A on plane guard duty hovers over the USS Kitty Hawk in March 1966 During the 1970s, the conversion of UH-2s to the SH-2 anti-submarine configuration provided the U.S. Navy with its first dedicated ASW helicopter capable of operating from vessels other than its aircraft carriers. The compact size of the SH-2 allowed the type to be operated from flight decks that were too small for the majority of helicopters; this factor would later play a role in the U.S. Navy's decision to acquire the improved SH-2F during the early 1980s.Boyne 2002, p. 343. The SH-2F fleet was utilized to enforce and support Operation Earnest Will in July 1987, Operation Praying Mantis in April 1988, and Operation Desert Storm during January 1991 in the Persian Gulf region.Chant 2001, p. 54. The countermeasures and additional equipment present upon the SH-2F allowed the type to conduct combat support and surface warfare missions within these hostile environments, which had an often-minimal submarine threat. In April 1994, the SH-2F was retired from active service with the U.S. Navy; the timing corresponded with the retirement of the last of the Vietnam-era Knox Class Frigates that were unable to accommodate the new and larger SH-60 Sea Hawks, which were used to replace the aging Seasprites. In 1991, the U.S. Navy had begun to receive deliveries of the new SH-2G Super Seasprite; a total of 18 converted SH-2Fs and 6 new-built SH-2Gs were produced.Endres and Gething 2005, p. 492. These were assigned to Naval Reserve squadrons, the SH-2G entered service with HSL-84 in 1993.Jane's Aircraft Upgrades. Jane's Information Group, 2009. (subscription article) posted 20 March 2009. The SH-2 served in some 600 deployments and flew 1.5 million flight hours before the last of the type were finally retired in mid-2001.Stephens, Ernie. \\"Putting the \\"Super\\" in the Kaman Super Seasprite\\". Rotor & Wing, 1 October 2009. =New Zealand= The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) replaced its Westland Wasps with an initial batch of four interim SH-2F Seasprites (formerly operated by the U.S. Navy), operated and maintained by a mix of Navy and Air Force personnel known as No. 3 Squadron RNZAF Naval Support Flight, to operate with ANZAC class frigates until the fleet of five new SH-2G(NZ) Super Seasprites were delivered. In October 2005, the Navy air element was transferred to No. 6 Squadron RNZAF at RNZAF Base Auckland in Whenuapai. RNZN Seasprites have seen service in East Timor. 10 of the 11 SH-2G(A)s rejected by the Royal Australian Navy were purchased in 2014 to replace the five RNZN SH-2G(NZ) Seasprites that had required either a MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) or replacement due to corrosion issues, maintenance problems and obsolescence. Kaman modified the ex- Australian aircraft and renamed them SH-2G(I), with the last one being delivered to New Zealand in early 2016. Eight of the aircraft are flying with the ninth and tenth aircraft being attritional aircraft used for spares etc. The 11th aircraft is held by Kaman as a prototype and test aircraft. The five SH-2G(NZ) have been sold to Peru. A SH-2F (ex-RNZN, NZ3442) is preserved in the Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum, donated to the museum by Kaman Aircraft Corporation after an accident while in service with the RNZN. =Exports= During the late 1990s, the United States decided to offer the surplus U.S. Navy SH-2Fs as foreign aid to a number of overseas countries. Among those to be offered the type included Greece, which had been offered six, and Turkey, which had been offered 14, but they rejected the offer. Egypt opted to acquire four SH-2F under this aid program, they were mainly used for spares in to support of their existing fleet of ten SH-2Gs. Poland chose to acquire the later SH-2G variant.

Saks & Co., is an American chain of luxury department stores, with its origins in Andrew Saks' A. Saks & Co. store opened in Washington, D.C.'s F Street shopping district in 1867. Saks' flagship store is located on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The 1924 New York store on Fifth Avenue lent its street name to the chain which would be known by what was originally the moniker of its flagship store, Saks Fifth Avenue. Since 2013, Saks Fifth Avenue has been owned by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), along with HBC's namesake Canadian department stores. Spinoff Saks Off 5th, originally a clearance store for Saks Fifth Avenue, is now a large off-price retailer in its own right managed independently from Saks Fifth Avenue under HBC. History =Origins: A. Saks & Co.= Saks and Co.‚Äôs new store, Washington D.C. 1887. Demolished. Saks and Co., next to Kann's, NW corner of Pennsylvania and 7th, Washington, D.C., 1920. Demolished. The Equestrian statue of Winfield Scott Hancock in front still exists in what is now the United States Navy Memorial park. Andrew Saks was born to a German Jewish family, in Baltimore. He worked as a peddler and paper boy before moving to Washington, D.C. where at the age of only 20, and in the still- chaotic and tough economic times of 1867, only two years after the United States prevailed in the American Civil War, he established a men's clothing store with his brother Isadore A. Saks & Co. occupied a storefront in the Avenue House Hotel building at 517 (300-308) 7th Street, N.W., in what is still Washington's downtown shopping district. Saks offered his goods at one price only, no bargaining, and offered refunds on merchandise returns, neither of which were the more common practice at that place and time. Saks was also known for its \\"forceful and interesting, but strictly truthful\\" newspaper advertising, according to the Washington Evening Star, including a two-page spread, large for that time, in that newspaper on April 4, 1898. Saks annexed the store next door, and in 1887 started building a large new store on the site of the old Avenue Hotel Building at 7th and Market Space (now United States Navy Memorial Plaza). In 1896 Saks opened a branch store in Indianapolis in Ingall's Block, which was a success. then they expanded to Norfolk, Virginia, and by 1897 had six stores: Washington, D.C., Richmond, Virginia, Norfolk, Virginia, Indianapolis, and two stores as well as a clothing factory in New York City. Saks called itself \\"Washington's Wonderful Store\\". =Saks on Fifth Avenue, New York City= Saks opened a very large store in 1902 in New York City's Herald Square on 34th Street and Broadway. Andrew Saks ran the New York store as a family affair with his brother Isadore, and his sons Horace and William. Andrew Saks died in 1912 and his son Horace took over the company's management. In 1923, Saks & Co. merged with Gimbel Brothers, Inc., which was owned by a cousin of Horace Saks, Bernard Gimbel, operating as a separate autonomous subsidiary. On September 15, 1924, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel opened in the Saks Fifth Avenue Building in New York City, with a full-block avenue frontage south of St. Patrick's Cathedral, facing what would become Rockefeller Center. The architects were Starrett & van Vleck, who developed a design derived from classical architecture. When Bernard's brother, Adam Gimbel, became president of Saks Fifth Avenue in 1926 after Horace Saks's sudden passing, the company expanded, opening seasonal resort branches in Palm Beach, Florida, and Southampton, New York, in 1928. The first full-line year-round Saks store opened in Chicago, in 1929, followed by another resort store in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1938, Saks expanded to the West Coast, opening in Beverly Hills, California. By the end of the 1930s, Saks Fifth Avenue had a total of 10 stores, including resort locations such as Sun Valley, Idaho, Mount Stowe, and Newport, Rhode Island. More full-line stores followed with Detroit, Michigan, in 1940 and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1949. In Downtown Pittsburgh, the company moved to its own freestanding location approximately one block from its former home on the fourth floor in the downtown Gimbel's flagship. The San Francisco location opened in 1952, competing locally with I. Magnin. BATUS Inc. acquired Gimbel Bros., Inc. and its Saks Fifth Avenue subsidiary in 1973 as part of its diversification strategy. More expansion followed from the 1960s through the 1990s including the Midwest, and the South, particularly in Texas. In 1990, BATUS sold Saks to Investcorp S.A., which took Saks public in 1996 as Saks Holdings, Inc. In 1990, the company launched \\"Saks Off 5th\\", an outlet store offshoot of the main brand, with 107 stores worldwide by 2016. =Under Proffitt's and Saks, Inc.= In 1998, Proffitt's, Inc. the parent company of Proffitt's and other department stores, acquired Saks Holdings Inc. Upon completing the acquisition, Proffitt's, Inc. changed its name to Saks, Inc. Since 2000 Saks has opened international locations in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Canada, and Mexico City. In August 2007, the United States Postal Service began an experimental program selling the plus zip code extension to businesses. The first company to do so was Saks Fifth Avenue, which received the zip code of 10022-7463 (\\"SHOE\\") for the eighth-floor shoe department in its flagship Fifth Avenue store. During the 2007‚Äì2009 recession, Saks Fifth Avenue had to close some stores and to cut prices and profit margins, thus according to Reuters \\"training shoppers to expect discounts. It took three years before it could start selling at closer to full price\\". In the following years, the company closed stores in locations including Orange County (2010), Denver (2011), Pittsburgh (2012), Highland Park, Illinois (2012/13) and in June 2013 its last Dallas store to implement the \\"strategy of employing our resources in our most productive locations\\". As of 2013, the New York flagship store, whose real estate value was estimated between $800 million and over $1 billion at the time, generated around 20% of Saks' annual sales at $620 million, with other stores being less profitable according to analysts. =Under Hudson's Bay Company= 2013 - present Interior entrance of the Saks Fifth Avenue store at Toronto Eaton Center in Toronto, Ontario (2016) On July 29, 2013, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), the oldest commercial corporation in North America and owner of the competing chain Lord & Taylor, announced it would acquire Saks Fifth Avenue's parent company for US$2.9 billion. Plans called for up to seven Saks Fifth Avenues to open in major Canadian markets. In January 2014, HBC announced the first Saks store in Canada would occupy in its flagship Queen Street building in downtown Toronto, connected to the Toronto Eaton Centre via sky bridge. The store opened in February 2016 with a second Toronto area location in the Sherway Gardens shopping center opening in spring 2016. On February 22, 2018, Saks Fifth Avenue opened its third Canadian store in Calgary, Alberta. In 2015 Saks began a $250 million, three-year restoration of its Fifth Avenue flagship store. In October 2015, Saks announced a new location in Greenwich, Connecticut. In autumn 2015, Saks announced it would replace its existing store at the Houston Galleria with a new store.  Legal controversies  In 2005, vendors filed against Saks alleging unlawful chargebacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated the complaint for years and, according to the New York Times, \\"exposed a tangle of illicit tactics that let Saks... keep money it owed to clothing makers\\", inflating Saks' yearly earnings up to 43% and abusively collecting around $30 million from suppliers over seven years. Saks settled with the SEC in 2007, after firing three or more executives involved in the fraudulent activities. In 2014, Saks fired transgender employee Leyth Jamal after she was allegedly \\"belittled by coworkers, forced to use the men's room and repeatedly referred to by male pronouns (he and him)\\". After Jamal submitted a lawsuit for unfair dismissal, the company stated in a motion to dismiss that \\"it is well settled that transsexuals are not protected by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\" In a court filing, the United States Department of Justice rebuked Saks' argument, stating that \\"discrimination against an individual based on gender identity is discrimination because of sex.\\" The Human Rights Campaign removed the company from its list of \\"allies\\" during the controversy. The lawsuit was later settled amicably, with undisclosed terms. In 2017, following the events of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, Saks's San Juan store located in Mall of San Juan suffered major damages along with its neighboring anchor store Nordstrom. Taubman Centers, the company which owns the mall, filed a lawsuit against Saks for failing to provide an estimated reopening date and failing to restore damages after the hurricane due to a binding contract. Although Nordstrom reopened on November 9, 2018, on October 30, 2018, Saks Fifth Avenue announced that it would officially vacate The Mall Of San Juan. Notable locations =Saks-34th Street= thumb Saks-34th Street was a fashion-focused middle market department store that was spun off from Saks & Company when that upscale retailer moved to Fifth Avenue, a location that Saks Fifth Avenue maintains to this day.\\"Streetscapes: Saks - the giant leap from Sixth Avenue\\". The New York Times. April 16, 1995. Saks-34th Street became a part of the New York division of Gimbels (later Manhattan Mall), and a sky bridge across 33rd Street connected the second floors of both flagship buildings.\\"Herald Center, former Saks 34th Street\\". Wikimapia.org. In the 1947 movie Miracle on 34th Street the facade of Saks-34th Street is shown in a scene that focuses on the Gimbel's flagship store. Branch locations were opened around the greater New York area. After Gimbels decided to close the division, the first floor of the building was used as a Christmas season annex for Gimbel's before being sold to the E. J. Korvettes chain.\\"Retailing: Discounter on 34th Street\\". Time magazine.

TheRealDeal.com. December 14, 2010. After the demise of the Korvette's chain the building was remodeled into the Herald Center. the primary tenant is H&M.; =Beverly Hills= Saks Fifth Avenue at 9600 Wilshire Boulevard is a department store in Beverly Hills, California. It is part of the Saks Fifth Avenue company. It was designed by the architectural firm Parkinson and Parkinson, with interiors by Paul R. Williams. The store opened in 1938. The exterior of the building was designed by the Parkinsons, with the interior completed by Williams in the Hollywood Regency style. David Gebhard and Robert Winter, writing in Los Angeles: An Architectural Guide described the building as having \\"enough curved surface to suggest that the thirties Streamline Moderne could be elegant\\". The store was expanded and redesigned by Williams in 1940 and 1948. The store was immediately successful upon opening and it would subsequently expand to almost and employ 500 people. Williams's designs for the store marked a departure from traditional department stores by reducing the emphasis on commerciality that foresaw the rise of boutique stores in the 1980s and 1990s. Only a few examples of merchandise were displayed in hidden recesses. The President of Saks Fifth Avenue, Adam Gimbel, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that \\"Each room attempts to create a mood which is in keeping with the merchandise sold there. For example, a Pompeian room done in cool green with appropriate frieze is used for beach and swimming pool costumes and a French provincial room houses informal sports and country clothes The accessories are carried in an oval room done in a Regency spirit\\". The individual shipping areas of the store were semi-enclosed which prevented distraction for customers. Williams created an interior reminiscences of his designs for luxurious private residences, with rooms lit by indirect lamps and footlights focused on the clothes. New departments for furs, corsets, gifts and debutante dresses were added in the 1940 expansion. The Terrace Restaurant, a rooftop restaurant run by Perino's, served customers for several years. It was expanded in the 1940s renovations to provide cover during inclement weather. The store featured in the 2005 film Shopgirl. The story had originally been set in Neiman Marcus but Saks Fifth Avenue lobbied the film makers to portray their store instead.

United States Naval Construction Battalions, better known as the Navy Seabees, form the U.S. Naval Construction Force (NCF). The Seabee nickname is a heterograph of the first letters \\"C B\\" from the words Construction Battalion. Depending upon how the word is used \\"Seabee\\" can refer to one of three things: all enlisted personnel in the USN's occupational field 7 (OF-7), all officers and enlisted assigned to the Naval Construction Force (NCF), or Construction Battalions. Seabees serve outside the NCF as well. During WWII they served in both the Naval Combat Demolition Units and the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs). In addition, they served as elements of Cubs, Lions, Acorns and the United States Marine Corps.U.S. Marine Corps WWII Order of Battle, Gordon L. Rottman, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 2002, p. 32 They also provided the manpower for the top secret CWS Flame Tank Group. Today they have many special task assignments starting with Camp David and the Naval Support Unit at the Department of State. Seabees serve under both Commanders of the Naval Surface Forces Atlantic/Pacific fleets as well as on many base Public Works and USN diving commands. Naval Construction Battalions were conceived as a replacement for civilian construction companies on contract to the Navy after the U.S. was attacked at Pearl Harbor. At that time civilian contractors had roughly 70,000 men working on U.S. bases overseas. International law made it illegal for civilian workers to resist an attack. To do so would classify them as guerrillas and could lead to summary execution. That is exactly what happened when the Japanese invaded Wake IslandTraining the Fighting Seabees of WWII at Camp Peary, Daily Press, E-newspaper 3 Dec 2017, Mark St. John Erickson, Newport News, VA. and would serve as the backstory to the WWII movie \\"The Fighting Seabees\\". Adm. Moreell's concept model CB was a USMC trained battalion of construction tradesmen: A military equivalent of those civilian companies, capable of any type of construction, anywhere needed, under any conditions or circumstances. It was realized that CBs were flexible, adaptable and could be utilized in every theater of operations. The use of USMC organization allowed for smooth co-ordination, integration or interface between NCF and Marine Corps elements. Additionally, CBs could be deployed individually or in multiples as the project scope and scale dictated. What distinguishes Seabees from Combat Engineers are the skill sets. Combat Engineering is but a sub-set in the Seabee toolbox. They have a storied legacy of creative field ingenuity,Coca-Cola and the Art of Seabee Acquisition, Seabee Museum, Seabee Museum website, Port Hueneme, CA. stretching from Normandy and Okinawa to Iraq and Afghanistan. Adm. Ernest King wrote to the Seabees on their second anniversary, \\"Your ingenuity and fortitude have become a legend in the naval service.\\" Seabees believe that anything they are tasked with, they \\"Can Do\\". They were unique at conception and remain unchanged from Adm. Moreell's model today. In the October 1944 issue of Flying, the Seabees are described as \\"a phenomenon of World War II\\". Since their creation, all Seabee advanced military training has been under USMC instruction. Even so, they always bring their toolbox. One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced. They gained fame for their application of it during WWII. The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Postwar they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.  Naval construction history  CB Conceptual Formation Pre-WWII, the concept pioneered in 1917 by the Twelfth Regiment had not been forgotten by the Navy's Civil Engineers. Planning at Bureau of Yards and Docks (BuDocks) began providing for \\"Navy Construction Battalions\\" (CB) in contingency war plans. In 1934, Capt. Carl Carlson's version of the CB was approved by Chief of Naval OperationsSeabee History: Introduction, Naval History, and Heritage Command official U.S. Navy web site, Published: Fri Feb 17 06:36:45 EST 2017 In 1935, RADM. Norman Smith, head of BuDocks, selected Captain Walter Allen, War Plans Officer, to represent BuDocks on the War Plans Board. Capt. Allen presented the bureau's Construction Battalion concept and the Board included it in the Rainbow war plans. The Seabees named their first training center for Capt. Allen. The proposal was criticized because the Seabees would have a dual command; military control administrated by fleet line Officers while construction operations would be administrated by Civil Engineer Corps officers. Another issue was no provision for the military organization or military training necessary to provide unit structure, discipline, and esprit de corps. In December 1937, RADM. Ben Moreell became BuDocks Chief and the lead proponent of the CB proposal. In 1941 civilian contractors were working on numerous projects for the Navy and BuDocks decided to improve project oversight by creating \\"Headquarters Construction Companies\\". These companies would have 2 officers and 99 enlisted, but would do no actual construction. On 31 October 1941, RADM. Chester Nimitz, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, authorized the formation of the 1st Headquarters Construction Company. Recruitment began in November and boot training began 7 December at Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. By 16 December, four additional companies had been authorized, but Pearl Harbor had changed all the plans.  World War II  The Naval Infantry Battalion Flag was mandated by Naval Regulation as the military colors for the Construction Battalions.Flags, Pennants & Customs, NTP 13 (B), Naval Computer And Telecommunications Command, Washington, DC, section 17.11, p. 17-5 USMC- directed fixed bayonet drill at Camp Peary NTC, VA in 1943 On 28 December 1941, RADM Moreell requested authority to commission three Naval Construction Battalions. His request was approved on 5 January 1942 by Admiral Nimitz. The 1st HQ Construction Company was used to commission the 1st Naval Construction Detachment, which was assigned to Operation Bobcat. They were sent to Bora Bora and are known in Seabee history as \\"Bobcats\\". Concurrently, the other four requested HQ Construction Companies had been approved. BuDocks took Companies 2 & 3 to form the 1st Naval Construction Battalion at Charleston, South Carolina. HQ Companies 4 & 5 were used for the 2nd CB. All four deployed as independent units. CBs 3, 4, & 5 were all deployed similarly. CB 6 was the first battalion to deploy full complement to the same deployment site. Before all this could happen, BuDocks had to address the dual command issue. Naval regs stated unit command was strictly limited to line officers. BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by CEC officers trained in construction. The Bureau of Naval Personnel (BuPers) strongly opposed this. Adm. Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox. On 19 March 1942, Knox gave the Civil Engineer Corps complete command of all Naval Construction units. Almost 11,400 would become CEC during WWII with 7,960 doing CB service. Two weeks prior, on 5 March all construction battalion personnel were officially named \\"Seabees\\". The first volunteers were construction tradesmen who were given advanced rank for their trade skills. This would result in them being the highest-paid group in uniform. To recruit these men, age and physical standards were waived up to age 50. Until November 1942 the average recruit age was 37, even so all received the same physical training. In December, FDR ordered the Selective Service System to provide CB recruits. Enlistees could request CB service with a written statement certifying that they were trade qualified. This lasted until October 1943 when voluntary enlistment in the Seabees ceased until December 1944. By war's end, 258,872 officers and enlisted had served in the Seabees. They never reached the Navy's authorized quota of 321,056.The King Bee, Capt. A. N. Olsen (CEC), Trafford Publishing, 2007 The King Bee In 1942 initial CB boot was Camp Allen,VA., which moved to Camp Bradford, which moved to Camp Peary and finally moved to Camp Endicott, Rhode Island. CBs 1-5 were sent directly overseas for urgent projects. CBs that followed were sent to Advance Base Depots (ABDs) for deployment. Camp Rousseau at Port Hueneme became operational first and was the ABD to the Pacific. The Davisville ABD became operational in June with NTC Camp Endicott commissioned that August. Other CB Camps were Camp Parks, Livermore, Ca., and Camp Lee-Stephenson, Quoddy Village, Eastport, Maine and Camp Holliday, Gulfport, Ms. CBs sent to the Pacific were attached to one of the four Amphibious Corps: I, III, and V were USMC. The VII Amphibious Force was under General Douglas MacArthur, Supereme Commander. Advance Bases The Office of Naval Operations created a code identifying Advance Base (AB) construction as a numbered metaphor for the size/type of base. That code was also used to identify the \\"unit\\" that would be the administration for that base. These were Lion, Cub, Oak and Acorn with a Lion being a main Fleet Base (numbered 1‚Äì6). Cubs were Secondary Fleet Bases 1/4 the size of a Lion (numbered 1‚Äì12). Oak and Acorn were the names given air installations, new or captured (airfield or airstrip). Cubs quickly gained status. The speed with which the Seabees could make one operational led the Marines to consider them a tactical component. Camp Bedilion shared a common fence-line with Camp Rousseau at Port Hueneme and was home to the Acorn Assembly and Training Detachment (AATD)Camp Bedilion, Historic California Posts, NCBC, Port Hueneme, CA., State Military Museums, 2814 B Street, Sacramento, CA., 95816 As the war progressed, BuDocks realized that logistics required that Advance Base Construction Depots (ABCDs) be built and CBs built seven. When the code was first created, BuDocks foresaw two CBs constructing a Lion. By 1944 an entire Regiment was being used. The invasion of Okinawa took four Construction Brigades of 55,000 men. The Seabees built the infrastructure needed to take the war to Japan. By war's end CBs had, served on six continents, constructed over 300 bases on as many islands.Seabees, U.S. Navy Official website, 12 August 2009 They built everything: airfields, airstrips, piers, wharves, breakwaters, PT & seaplane bases, bridges, roads, com-centers, fuel farms, hospitals, barracks and anything else. Atlantic In the Atlantic Seabees biggest job was the preparations for the Normandy landing. Months later CBMUs 627, 628, and 629 were tasked to facilitate the crossing of the Rhine. For CBMU 629 it was front-line work.Seabees at the Rhine Crossing, Building the Navy's Bases in WWII, Volume II (Part III), Part III: The Advance Bases, U.S. Navy official website, published: Nov. 2018, p. 118 Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia for Seabees and Corpsmen. 53rd Construction Battalion sign 19th CB Plaque from when battalion was designated 3rd Battalion 17th Marines CB insignia worn on USMC issue garrison cap.Photo of a vet wearing CB insignia on USMC issue, U.S. Militaria Forum webpage  Marine Corps, Seabees outside the NCF  USMC historian Gordon L. Rottman wrote \\"that one of the biggest contributions the Navy made to the Marine Corps during WWII was the creation of the Seabees\\". As part of that contribution the Corps would be influential upon the CB organization and its history. After the experience of Guadalcanal the Department of War decided that the Marines and Seabees would make all subsequent landings together.The U.S. Navy‚Äôs Seabees: Bulldozing a Road to Victory, Glenn Barnett, Warfare History Network website, 2020, Sovereign Media, 6731 Whittier Ave, Suite C-100 McLean, VA. The Order of battle would show the Seabees as being attached to the Marine Corps. That arrangement lead to numerous good-natured claims by the Seabees that they had landed first and signs left on the beach saying \\"What took you so long?\\" The Seabees in the UDTs made an effort of this. When the first three battalions were formed the Seabees did not have a fully functional base of their own. Upon leaving navy boot camp the first recruits were sent to National Youth Administration camps in Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia to receive military training from the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps listed CBs on their Table of organization: \\"D-Series Division\\" for 1942,Rottman (2002), Fig. 4.2. \\"E-Series Division\\" for 1943,Rottman (2002), Fig. 4.3.U.S .

That did not keep early Seabee units from having close contact with the Marine Corps The 1st Naval Construction Detachment (Bobcats) together with and A Co CB 3 was transferred to the Marines and redesignated 3rd Battalion 22nd Marines. The Bobcats had deployed without receiving advanced military training. The 22nd Marines took care of that.Bobcats-Bora bora, Chapter XXIV Bases in the South Pacific, Building the Navy's Bases in World War II, History of the BuDocks and the CEC, 1940‚Äì1946, Volume II. U.S GPO, Washington, DC, 1947, p. 202 The 4th Construction Detachment was attached to the 5th Marine Defense Battalion for two years. By autumn, actual CBs, the 18th, 19th and 25th had been transferred to the Corps as combat engineers.Rottman (2002), pp. 218‚Äì220. Each was attached to a composite engineer regiment and redesignated as 3rd Bn of that Regiment: 17th Marine Regiment, 18th Marine Regiment, 19th Marine Regiment, and 20th Marine Regiment. Along with that came the standard USMC issue. The 18th and 19th CBs both claim to have been the first CB authorized to wear the USMC uniform. Both received their military training and USMC issue at MTC New River, NC. There is no record of how many CBs received USMC issue. It is known that the 31st, 43rd, 76th, 121st and 133rd NCBs received partial or complete issues. There were numerous USMC/Seabee pairings. The first one in combat was the 6th CB with the 1st Marine Division. The 18th CB was sent as their relief from Fleet Marine Force depot Norfolk. Many more would follow. The 6th Special CB was tasked to the 4th Marines Advance Depot in the Russells. In November, the 14th CB was tasked to the 2nd Raider Bn on Guadalcanal. Earlier in June, the 24th CB was tasked to the 9th Marine Defense Bn on Rendova. The 33rd and 73rd Seabees had a detachment tasked to the 1st Pioneers as shore party for the 5th Marines on Peleliu. Also attached was the 17th Special CB colored. At Enogi Inlet on Munda, the 47th had a detachment support the 1st and 4th Marine Raiders. On Bougainville, the 3rd Marine Div. made the Commander of the 71st CB shore party commander. The 71st was supported by detachments from the 25th, 53rd, and the 75th CBs. At Cape Torokina the 75th had 100 men volunteer to support the assault of the 3rd Marines. Also at Bougainville, the 53rd provided shore parties to the 2nd Raiders on green beach and the 3rd Raiders on Puruata Island.Home World War II, Other WWII Unit Stories And Info: Bougainville Seabees by Thurman, 2006 The 121st was formed at the CB Training Center of MTC Camp Lejuene as 3rd Bn 20th Marines. They would be shore party to the 23rd Marines on Roi-Namur, Saipan, and Tinian. In 1944 the Marine Engineer Regiments were inactivated. Even so, Marine Divisions still had a CB tasked to them. For Iwo Jima, the 133rd and 31st CBs were attached to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions. The 133rd was tasked to the 23rd Marines as their shore party.

From Iwo Jima the 5th Marine Div. returned to Camp Tarawa to have the 116th CB attached. When Japan fell the 116th CB was part of the occupation force. V-J day found thousands of Japanese troops still in China and the III Marine Amphibious Corps was sent there to get them home. The 33rd NCR was assigned to III Marine Amphib. Corps for this mission. Seabee Battalions were also tasked individually to the four Amphibious Corps. The 19th CB started out with the I MAC prior to joining the 17th Marines. The 53rd CB was attached to I MAC as Naval Construction Battalion I M.A.C. When I MAC was redesignated III Amphibious Corps the battalion became an element of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. For Guam, III Amphibious Corps had the 2nd Special CB, 25th, and 53rd CBs. The CO 3/19 Marines (25 CB) was shore party commander for the 3rd Marines on beaches Red 1 and Red 2. The 3rd Marines would award 25's shore party 17 bronze stars.25th Naval Construction Battalion Cruisebook, p. 97 [file:///C:/Users/cbuser01/Downloads/25%20NCB%201942-45.pdf] V Amphibious Corps (VAC) had the 23rd Special and 62nd CBs on Iwo Jima.

Seabee historian William Bradford Huie wrote \\"that the two have a camaraderie unknown else-wheres in the U.S. military\\". Even though they are \\"Navy\\" the Seabees adopted USMC fatigues with a Seabee insignia in place of the EGA. At least nine WWII Seabee units incorporated USMC insignia into theirs. Admiral Moreell wrote that the Marines were the best fighting men in the Pacific. Even-so, a leatherneck had to serve 90 days with the Seabees to qualify to as a Junior Seabee.The King Bee Pens Foreword for Book on World War II Seabees, The Navy Civil Engineer, Sept. 1963, Vol. 4, No 9, Admiral Moreell, p. 4 see Notes  Naval Combat Demolition Units (NCDU)s, Seabees outside the NCF  \\"NCDU 45\\", Ensign Karnowski (CEC), Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C.

In early May 1943, a two-phase \\"Naval Demolition Project\\" was ordered by the Chief of Naval Operations \\"to meet a present and urgent requirement\\" for the invasion of Sicily. Phase-1 began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Solomons, Maryland with the creation of Operational Naval Demolition Unit # 1. Six Officers lead by Lt. Fred Wise CEC and eighteen enlisted reported from Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school. Seabees called them \\"Demolitioneers\\".

After that first group had been trained Lt. Commander Draper Kauffman was selected to command the program. It had been set up in Camp Peary's \\"Area E\\"(explosives) at the dynamiting and demolition school. Between May and mid- July, the first six NCDU classes graduated at Camp Peary. From there the program moved to Fort Pierce where the first class began mid-July. Despite the move, Camp Peary remained Kauffman's primary recruit center. \\"He would go back to the dynamite school, assemble the (Seabees) in the auditorium and say, \\"I need volunteers for hazardous, prolonged and distant duty.\\" Fort Pierce had two Seabee units assigned, CBD 1011 and CBMU 570. They were tasked with the construction and maintenance of obstacles needed for demolition training. Thirty four NCDUs were assigned to the Invasion of Normandy. When the first 10 units arrived in England they had no commander. So Lt. Smith(CEC) assumed the role and split them into 3 groups to train with the 146th, 277th and 299th Combat Engineers. As more units arrived they were assigned to these groups plus had 5 army engineers attached to them.Navy Divers, Bureau of Naval Personnel Information Bulletin, All Hands, September 1944, p. 23, Evansville Vanderburgh Public Library, Indiana Group III(Lt. Smith) did research and development and is credited with developing the Hagensen Pack. NCDUs saw a 53 percent casualty rate at Normandy. Four from Utah beach later took part in Operation Dragoon. With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the UDTs for the Pacific. That requisition order netted Admiral Turner 20 NCDUs that had received Presidential Unit Citations and another 11 that had gotten Navy Unit Commendations at Normandy. Before Normandy 30 NCDUs had been sent to the Pacific while three had gone to the Mediterranean. NCDUs 1‚Äì10 were staged at Turner City, Florida Island in the Solomons during January 1944.World War II US Navy Special Warfare Units, Eugene Lipak, Osprey Publishing, New York, 2014, p. 25 NCDU 1 went briefly to the Aleutians in 1943.Navy SEAL History Part One, A Glance at the Origins of Naval Special Warfare, 1 August 2018 By MC2 Taylor Stinson, Defense Media Activity, All Hands Magazine, Defense Media Activity, U.S. DOD NCDUs 4 and 5 were the first to see combat with the 4th Marines at Green island and Emirau Island.

Lt. Crist confiscated this sign. However, Team 4 was able to leave theirs on the beach for the Marines to see that the Seabees had been there first. Lt. Crist(CEC), Lt. Cmdr. Kaufmann, and Lt. Carberry right to left at awards ceremony Prior to Operation Galvanic and Tarawa, V Amphibious Corps had identified coral as an issue for future amphibious operations. RADM. Kelly Turner, commander V Amphibious Corps had ordered a review to get a grip on the problem. VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions. Lt. Thomas C. Crist, of CB 10, was in Pearl Harbor from Canton IslandLt Crist, \\"The MOCK-UP\\", Fort Pierce ATB Newspaper, 20 July 1945 , p. 4, Fort Pierce SEAL Archives, Fort Pierce, FLUDTs 1 & 2, The Marshall Islands, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Eniwetok, U. S. Naval Special Warfare Archives where he had been in charge of clearing coral heads. His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in UDT history. While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and met with him. The Admiral tasked Lt. Crist to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it. Lt. Crist started by getting men from CB 10. By 1 December 1943 he had close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted at Waipio Amphibious Operating Base on Oahu. In November the Navy had a hard lesson with coral and tides at Tarawa. It prompted Adm. Turner to request the creation of nine Underwater Demolition Teams to address those issues.The Underwater Demolition Teams of the Pacific, Pearl Harbor Visitors Bureau, Six teams for VAC in the Central Pacific while the other three would go to III Amphibious Corps in the South Pacific. Adm. Turner chose the term \\"underwater\\" to distinguish from the Fort Pierce program. UDTs 1 & 2 were formed from the 180 Seabees Lt Crist had staged. Seabees make up the majority of the men in teams 1‚Äì9, 13 and 15. How many Seabees were in UDT 10 is not cited in the records nor is anything stated for UDT 12. Seabees were roughly 20% of UDT 11.Interview with Wright S.

Parks and Service Abroad in World War II, Catoctin Mountain Park, Prince William Forest Park, August, 2017, Nat. Park Service, Washington, DC but, the OSS was not allowed to operate in the Pacific Theater. Adm. Nimitz needed swimmers and approved their transfer from the OSS to his control. The MU men brought with the swimfins they had trained with and the Seabees made them a part of UDT attire as quickly as the Supply dept. could get them. In the Seabee dominated teams the next largest group of UDT volunteers came from the joint Army-Navy Scouts and Raiders school that was also in Fort Pierce. Additional volunteers came from the Navy's Bomb disposal School, Marine Corps and U.S. Fleet. The first team commanders were Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) UDT 1 and Lt. Crist (CEC) UDT 2. Both Teams were \\"provisional\\" totaling the 180 men Lt Crist had put together. Seven different CBs made up UDT 2. They wore fatigues, life-vests and were expected to stay in boats like the NCDUs. However, at Kwajalein Fort Pierce protocol was changed. Adm.Turner ordered daylight recon, and Ensign Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief Bill Acheson wore swim trunks under their fatigues. They stripped down, spent 45 minutes in the water in broad daylight. Still wet and in their trunks they were taken directly to Adm. Turner to report. He concluded individual swimmers were the only way to get accurate intel on underwater obstacles, reporting as much to Adm. Nimitz. At Engebi Cmdr. Brewster was wounded and all the men with Ens. Luehrs wore trunks under their fatigues. The success of those UDT 1 Seabees not following Fort Pierce protocol rewrote the UDT mission model and training regimen. Ens. Luehrs and Chief Acheson were each awarded a Silver Star for their exploitThe Water is Never Cold), James Douglas O'Dell, Brassey's, Dulles, VA, 2001, p. 136 while unintentionally creating the UDT \\"naked warrior\\" image.

A fortuitous observation by one of the men spotted a magazine advertisement for diving masks. A priority dispatch was made to the States that appropriated the store's entire stock. Adm. Turner also requested the formation of a \\"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\\" at Kihei. It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce. Lt. Crist was briefly the first training officer until when he was made Commander of UDT 3. When UDT 3 returned from Leyte in November 1944 the team became school instructors and Lt. Crist was again OIC of training. Under Lt. Crist the training course was changed with an emphasis on swimming and recon. Also covered were: night ops, weapons, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting. The team instructed until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there. Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii. Team 3 would train teams 12‚Äì22. UDT 14 is called the first \\"all fleet team\\" even though Seabees from Team Able were attached and the Commander and XO were both CEC (Ltjg. A.B. Onderdonk and Ltjg. C.E. Emery). UDT 15 was the last team formed of NCDUs. Four teams were sent to Iwo Jima. Three were sent to clear the shoreline for five days, D+2 - D+7. After July 1944 new UDTs were only USN.

Team 8 turned to the CBs on the island to appropriate everything they needed. The coral paving got placed the night before Admiral Nimitz made an inspection. The Admiral gave the base and teams 8 & 10 a glowing review. By V-J day 34 teams had been formed. Teams 1‚Äì21 saw actual deployment with the Seabees providing over half of the men in those teams. The Navy did not publicize the existence of the UDTs until post-war and when they did they gave credit to Lt. Cmdr. Kauffman and the Seabees.Underwater Demolition, \\"All Hands\\", The Bureau of Naval Personal Information Bulletin, October 1945, NAVPERS-0 Number 343 pp. 12‚Äì15 During WWII the Navy did not have a rating for the UDTs nor did they have an insignia.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two CBs that were \\"colored\\" units, the 34th and 80th. Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers. The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made national news. The Commander of the 80th had 19 enlisted dishonorably discharged for sedition. The NAACP and Thurgood Marshall got 14 of those reversed. In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored. The proposal was approved, but not acted on. The lack of stevedores in combat zones was a huge issue for the Navy.

The 14th Naval District felt they deserved proper shelter with at least separate but equal barracks. Manana Barracks and Waiawa Gulch became the United States' largest colored military installation with over 4,000 Seabee stevedores housed there. It was the site of racial strife to the point that the camp was fenced in and placed under armed guard. The Seabees would be trucked back and forth to the docks in cattle trucks.

In December the 96th started airfields at Tsingtao and Chinwangtao in support of III Marine Amphibious Corps operations. On 20 May 1946 orders were issued for CB III Marine Amphibious Corps to inactivate 96 CB on 1 August. Prior, the 6th Marine Division was renamed the 3rd Marine Brigade for a short period. The 96th CB was transferred to the 4th Marines, 1st Marine Division and deactivated from them in August.

Seabees leveled a mountain that civilian contractors said could not be done. (USN) Suspension bridge built by NMCB 5 CCAD in Timor-Leste 2015 (Seabee Museum) The outbreak of the Korean War led to a call-up of 10,000 from the Seabee Reserve. Seabees landed at Inchon during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs. During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII. During the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. Cubi Point in the Philippines was selected. Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the Zambales Mountains and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. MCB 3 arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth- moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the Panama Canal. Seabees there moved of dry fill plus another 15 million that was hydraulic fill. The $100 million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. Adjusted-for-inflation, today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53. Seabee Teams The WWII precursor to Seabee teams was the PT Advance base Detachment of the 113th CB. Each man was cross-trained in at least three trades with some qualified as corpsmen and divers.The Forgotten Fifty Five, NCB93: 113RD Seabees detachment assigned to PT Squadrons, Seabees93.net The first Seabees to be actually be referred to as \\"Seabee Teams\\" were CBD 1802 and CBD 1803.Construction Battalion Detachments 1802, 1803, NHHC, Seabee Museum, Port Hueneme Ca They were followed by Detachments Able and Baker. Then someone in the U.S. State Department learned of these teams and had an idea for making \\"good use\\" of the Seabees in the Cold War. Teams could be sent as \\"U.S. Good Will Ambassadors\\" to third world nations as a means to combat the spread of Communism and promote \\"Good Will\\", a military version of the Peace Corps. These 13-man teams would construct schools, drill wells or build clinics creating a positive image or rapport for the U.S. They were utilized by the United States Agency for International Development and were in S.E. Asia by the mid 1950s. Then in the early sixties the U.S. Army Special Forces were being sent into rural areas of South Vietnam to develop a self-defense force to counter the Communist threat and making use of the Seabee teams at these same places made sense\\"Seabee History: South east Asia\\", Naval History and Heritage Command Online reading room, published 16 Apr 2015 to the CIA.

There were two types of sleds: 10 ton or 20 ton that could be hitched in multiples. (U.S. Navy). In 1955, Seabees were assigned to Operation Deep Freeze making Antarctica an annual deployment site. Their task was the construction and maintenance of scientific bases for the National Science Foundation. The first \\"wintering over\\" crew included 200 Seabees. They cleared an ice runway at Mcmurdo for the advance party of Deep Freeze II to fly to South Pole Station. MCB 1 was assigned for Deep Freeze II.

(USN) Vietnam era EO3 ‚Äì EO1 collar devices Seabees deployed to Vietnam twice in the 1950s. First in June 1954 as elements of Operation Passage to Freedom and then two years later to map and survey the nation's roads. Seabee teams 501 and 502 arrived on 25 January 1963 and are regarded as the first Seabees of the Vietnam War. They were sent to Dam Pau and Tri Ton to build camps for the Special Forces. In 1964 ACB 1 was the first CB in the theatre. Beginning in 1965 Naval Construction Regiments deployed to the theater. Seabees supported the Marines at Khe Sanh and Chu Lai combat base in addition to building numerous aircraft- support facilities, roads, and bridges. They also worked with and taught construction skills to the Vietnamese. In June 1965, Construction Mechanic 3rd Class Marvin G. Shields of Seabee Team 1104 was at the Battle of Dong Xoai. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor and is the only Seabee to be awarded the medal. Seabee Teams continued to be deployed throughout the Vietnam War and often engaging enemy forces alongside Marines and Army special forces. Teams typically built schools, clinics, or drilled wells. In 1966 Seabees repaired the airfield at Khe Sahn in four days, with 3,900 feet of 60-foot-wide aluminum matting. General Westmoreland \\"called it one of the most outstanding military engineering feats in Vietnam.\\"The Largest Military Construction Project in History, Vietnam '67, The New York Times, Mel Schenck, Vietnam, January 16, 2018 MCB 4 had a det at Con Thien whose actions were a near repeat of Dong Xoai. In 1968 the Marine Corps requested that the Navy make a name change to the CBs to reduce confusion. The Marines were using \\"MCB\\" for Marine Corps Base while the Navy was using \\"MCB\\" for Mobile Construction Battalions. The Navy added \\"Naval\\" to MCB creating the NMCBs that now exist. During that year the 30th Naval Construction Regiment had five battalions in the Da Nang area and two at Chu Lai. The 32nd NCR had three battalions tasked near Phu Bai and one at Dong Ha. In May 1968 two reserve battalions RNMCB 12 and 22 were activated, bring the total number of battalions in Vietnam to 21. Both ACBs were in theater as well as Construction Battalion Maintenance Units (CBMUs) 301 and 302. In 1968 NMCB 10 had an unusual \\"tasking\\" supporting the 101st Airborne. During 1969 the Seabees deployed topped out at 29,000, from there their draw-down began. The last battalion withdrew late 1971 with the last Seabee teams out a year later.

Those chosen can be assigned to the Regional Security Officer of a specific embassy or be part of a team traveling from one embassy to the next. Duties include the installation of alarm systems, CCTV cameras, electromagnetic locks, safes, vehicle barriers, and securing compounds. They can also assist with the security engineering in sweeping embassies (electronic counter-intelligence). They are tasked with new construction or renovations in security sensitive areas and supervise private contractors in non-sensitive areas.US Navy Basic Military Requirements for Seabees, Chapter 1, p. 11 Due to Diplomatic protocol the Support Unit is required to wear civilian clothes most of the time they are on duty and receive a supplemental clothing allowance for this. The information regarding this assignment is very scant, but State Department records in 1985 indicate Department security had 800 employees, plus 1,200 Marines and 115 Seabees. That Seabee number is roughly the same today.\\"From bugs to bombs, little-known Seabee unit protects US embassies from threats\\", Stars and Stripes, 26 April 2018, see Notes  Cold War winds down  As the Cold War wound down, new challenges and changes came for the Seabees starting with the increased incidence of terrorism. This was in addition to ongoing Seabee support missions for USN/USMC bases worldwide. Even though the Cold war had wound down Cold War Facilities still required support like the Polaris and Poseidon submarines at Holy Loch, Rota. In 1971, the Seabees began their huge peacetime construction project on Diego GarciaSeabee History: After Vietnam, Published: 16 Apr 2015, NHHC, Official U.S. Navy web site in the Indian Ocean. That project began in 1971 and was completed in 1987 at a cost of $200 million. With the extended construction timeline, it is difficult to inflation-adjust that cost into today's dollars. The complex accommodates the Navy's largest ships and cargo planes. The base served as a staging facility for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Seabee construction was responsible for the upgrade and expansion of Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, making it a major base for the United States Sixth Fleet. There were combat related assignments as well. In 1983, a truck bomb demolished the Marine's barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. From the Beirut International Airport Druze militia artillery harassed the Marines. After consultations, NMCB-1 in Rota sent in a 70-man AirDet to construct secure bunkers for the Marines.

CBs 5 and 133 have drawn these assignments.  Persian Gulf War  During the Persian Gulf War, more than 5,000 Seabees served in the Middle East. In August 1990 the First Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) was initially assigned NMCBs 4, 5, 7, and 40.Seabee History: After Vietnam, Published: Thu Apr 16 13:53:14 EDT 2015, NHHC, Official U.S. Navy web site The first Seabees in theater were a Det from ABC 1 that was soon joined by a Det from ACB 2. Shortly after them CBUs 411 and 415 arrived in Saudi Arabia. Mid September the Air-Dets for the four CBs arrived to build air fields for Marine Air Groups (MAG) 11, 13, 16, and 25 of the 3rd Marine Air Wing. NMCB 7 was the first battalion to arrive. Camps were constructed for both the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions as well as Hq complexes for MEF I and II. Overall, in Saudi Arabia, Seabees built numerous camps and galleys. They laid millions of square feet of runways, aprons as well as over 200 helo zones. They built and maintained two 500-bed Fleet Hospitals near Al-Jubayl. The 3rd NCR was activated to provide a command echelon. NMCBs 24 and 74 were also deployed in support of the Marine Corps. A desert camp was constructed at Ras Al Mishab, near the Kuwaiti border named \\"Camp Nomad\\" which supported MAG 26.  Iraq, Afghanistan, and the War on Terror  NMCB 15 Seabee mans a machine gun while travelling through Al Hillah, Iraq in May 2003. Seabees were deployed in the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. All active and reserve NMCBs and NCRs were sent to repair infrastructure in both countries.Seabee History: The US Navy in Operation Enduring Freedom, 2001‚Äì2002: 18 Aug. 2017, NHHC, Official U.S. Navy web site NMCB 133 deployed to FOB Camp Rhino and Kandahar Airfield where a detention facility was constructed. One of the Seabees most visible tasks was the removal of statues of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. In Afghanistan, the Seabees' main task was the construction of multiple forward operating bases. Since 2002, Seabees have provided vital construction skills for civic action programs in the Philippines. Their efforts have had an effect in the southern Philippines, most notably near Abu Sayyaf's jungle training area. Seabees work with Army, Marines, and Air Force under Joint Special Operations Task Force- Philippines. see Notes  Disaster Relief and Recovery  NMCB 5 attached to Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Horn of Africa set tents for displaced flood victims in Ethiopia.

Detachment: A construction crew that is \\"detached\\" from the battalion's \\"main body\\" deployment site. The size is determined by the project scale and completion date. Battalion: The battalion is the basic NCF unit with a HQ Company plus four Construction Companies: A, B, C, & D. CBs are organized to function as independent self sufficient units. Regiment: Naval Construction Regiments (NCRs) purpose is to provide a higher echelon command to three or four CBs operating on close proximity. Division: 1st Naval Construction Division was in service from August 2002 until May 2013 when it was decommissioned. Naval Construction Groups: In 2013, Seabee Readiness Groups (SRGs) were decommissioned, and re-organized as Naval Construction Groups 1 and 2. They are regimental-level command groups tasked with administrative and operational control of CBs, as well as conducting pre deployment training for all assigned units. Naval Construction Group 2 (NCG-2) is based at CBC Gulfport, and Naval Construction Group 1 (NCG-1) is at CBC Port Hueneme. Seabee Engineer Reconnaissance Team (SERTs) Seabee Engineer Reconnaissance Team from NMCB 40 making an assessment of a bridge to determine its structural capacity to support movements during a field exercise. SERTs are the Special operations capable element of the NCF developed by the First Naval Construction Division (1st NCD) in Operation Iraqi Freedom. They are intended to provide engineering assessments in the field in support of the United States Marine Corps Reconnaissance Battalions. A team has two CEC officers and eight enlisted Seabees, augmented by additional personnel as needed.SERT, Seabee Engineer Reconnaissance Team, Andrew G. Wright, Engineering News- Record, Seabee Magazine Special Commemorative Double Issue 2003, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), Attn: SEABEE Online (Code PA), Washington Navy Yard, DC, p. 69. A team has three elements: liaison, security, and reconnaissance. The liaison (LNO) element has an officer and two communications specialists responsible for communicating the assessments and intelligence. Reconnaissance has the other officer, who is the Officer-in- Charge (OIC), a BU or SW cpo with bridge construction experience. The team has a corpsman or medically-trained member, the remainder are selected for being the most qualified in their trade. All are required to have the Seabee Warfare pin. In 2013, 1st Naval Construction Division along with SERT‚Äôs were decommissioned. Today, UCTs performance demonstrate the SERT concept for NECC.  Seabees outside the NCF  Amphibious Construction Battalions (PHIBCBs) US Navy 030404-N-1050K-023U.S. Seabees from ACBs 1 and 2 place a deck section in the assembly of the Elevated Causeway System-Modular (ELCAS (M)) at Camp Patriot, Kuwait (Apr 2003). ACBs (or PHIBCB) were preceded by the pontoon assembly CBs formed during World War II. On 31 October 1950, MCBs 104 and 105 were re-designated ACB 1 and ACB 2, and assigned to Naval Beach Groups. ACBs report to surface TYCOMs. Additionally, in an ACB half the enlisted are a construction rate while the other half are fleet. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units: When during World War II these units had 1/4 the personnel of a CB. Their task was to assume maintenance of bases once CBs had completed construction. Today, CBMU's provide public works support at Naval Support Activities, Forward Operating Bases, and Fleet Hospital/Expeditionary Medical Facilities during wartime or contingency operations for a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), Marine Expeditionary Group (MEG), or NSW. They also provide disaster recovery support to Naval Regional Commanders in CONUS. * CBMU 202CBMU 202, Official website of the Naval Construction Force, CLF_GLFP_WebMaster@navy.mil Naval Base Little Creek, VA **det Jacksonville * CBMU 303CBMU 303,Official website of the Naval Construction Force, CLF_GLFP_WebMaster@navy.mil Navy Expeditionary Combat Force, Naval Base San Diego, Ca. **det Port Hueneme **det Pearl Harbor NAVFAC Engineering & Expeditionary Warfare Center Ocean Facilities Department.

They maintain a capability to support a Fleet Marine Force amphibious assault, subsequent combat service support ashore, and advanced self-defense training for their camp and facilities under construction. Teams have support personnel such as Dive Medical Technicians and Dive Warrant Officers. UCT1 is home ported at Little Creek, Virginia, while UCT2 is at Port Hueneme, California.U.S. Navy Diving, Lesson N2b.v2, United States Naval Academy, Spring 2012, Seabee Diver/CEC Underwater Construction Technician: Once the Seabee goes through their own unique training pipeline they are deemed a Basic Underwater Construction Technician/or NEC 5932 and are a qualified (2nd Class Diver). Unlike a regular Navy Diver where their dive school training is only 15 weeks long. A UCT‚Äôs training consist of a 26 week long Dive school in Panama City, Florida. As well as a tactical training phase which teaches advanced expeditionary combat skills and demolitions. UCT‚Äôs can do advanced techniques in diving such as Seafloor excavation, hydrographic surveys, object search and recovery; Engineering reconnaissance; and precision demolitions. Supervisory roles must estimate the material, manpower and supervise the execution of underwater projects. Supervise diving and demolition operations as designated by the Commanding Officer. UCT's are members of the Naval Special Operations (NSO) community, they are NOT our nation‚Äôs first choice when it comes to the execution of tactical combat operations. There are other units that constantly train for combat related missions. However, history shows that Seabees need in wartime can adapt but a UCT simply cannot execute construction tasking, be it on land or underwater, if they are lost, wounded, killed, or captured on the job site. If need be UCT‚Äôs are capable of taking on the secondary fight role of a Seabee. Due to their unique skills sets they can deploy in support of Naval Special Warfare Command either with SEAL teams, Special Boat Teams, Navy EOD Teams, or support of other dive elements. They also can apply for selection to support Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Public Works: U.S. Naval Bases: These units have CEC officers leading them and enlisted Seabees for the various crews. About one-third of new Seabees are assigned to Public Works Departments (PWD) at naval installations both within the United States and overseas. While stationed at a Public Works Department, a Seabee has the opportunity to get specialized training and extensive experience in one or more facets of their rating. Some bases have civilians that augment the Seabees, but the department is a military organization.  Combat Service Support Detachments (CSSD) / Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Combat Service Support Detachments (CSSD) have several hundred Seabees assigned in support of Naval Special Warfare (NSW) units based out of Coronado, CA, and Virginia Beach, VA. Seabees provide the field support for power generation/distribution, logistical movement, vehicle repair, construction/maintenance of encampments, water purification or facilities. Seabees assigned to support NSW receive extra training in first aid, small arms, driving, and specialized equipment. and are expected to qualify as Expeditionary Warfare Specialists. Seabees assigned to NSW are eligible to receive the following Naval Enlisted Classifications upon filling the requirements: 5306 ‚Äì Naval Special Warfare (Combat Service Support) or 5307 ‚Äì Naval Special Warfare (Combat Support). They also can apply for selection to support the Naval Special Warfare Development Group.  Training and Rates  USMC barracks inspection during NMCB 74's military training at Camp Lejeune in March 1968 Trainees begin \\"A\\" School (trade school) upon completion of boot: 4 weeks classroom, 8 weeks hands-on. From \\"A\\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. There recruits go through four- weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills (ECS) which is also required for those who report to a Navy Expeditionary Combat Command. ECS is basic training in: map reading, combat first aid, recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent on basic marksmanship to qualify with a M16 rifle and the M9 service pistol. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: MK 19 40mm grenade launcher, the .50-caliber machine gun, or the M240 machine gun. Many reserve units still field the M60 machine gun. Seabees were last U.S. military to wear the U.S. Woodland camouflage uniform or the Desert Camouflage Uniform. They now have the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III and use ALICE field gear. Some units, with the Marines, will use USMC-issue Improved Load Bearing Equipment (ILBE). Current rates: The current ratings were adopted by the Navy in 1948. * BU : Builder * CE : Construction Electrician * CM : Construction Mechanic * EA : Engineering aide * EO : Equipment operator * SW : Steelworker * UT : Utilitiesman The Seabee \\"constructionman\\" ranks of E-1 through E-3 are designated by sky-blue stripes on uniforms. The color was adopted in 1899 as a uniform trim color designating the Civil Engineer Corps, but was later given up. Its continued use is a bit of Naval Heritage in the NCF. At paygrade E-8, the Builder, Steelworker, and Engineering Aide rates combine into a single rate: Senior Chief Constructionman (CUCS). At the E-9 paygrade they are referred to as a Master Chief Constructionman (CUCM). The remaining Seabee rates combine only at the E-9 paygrade: * Master Chief Equipmentman (EQCM) for Equipment Operator and Construction Mechanic. * Master Chief Utilitiesman (UCCM) for Construction Electrician and Utilitiesman. Diver : is a qualification that the various rates can obtain with three grades: Basic Underwater Construction Technician/ NEC 5932 (2nd Class Diver), Advanced Underwater Construction Technician/ NEC 5931 (1st Class Diver), and Master Underwater Construction Technician/ NEC 5933 (Master diver).

It was not intended for uniforms. Frank J. Iafrate, a civilian file clerk at Quonset Point Advance Naval Base, Davisville, Rhode Island, who created the original \\"Disney Style\\" Seabee. In early 1942 his design was sent to RADM Moreell who made a single request. That the Seabee being set inside a letter Q, for Quonset Point, be changed to a hawser rope and it would officially adopted. The Seabees had a second Logo. It was of a shirtless constructionman holding a sledge hammer with a rifle strapped across his back standing upon the words \\"Construimus Batuimus USN\\". The figure was on a shield with a blue field across the top and vertical red and white stripes. A small CEC logo is left of the figure and a small anchor is to the right. This logo was incorporated into many CB Unit insignias. During World War II, artists working for Disney Onsignia Department designed logos for about ten Seabee units including the: 60th NCB, 78th NCB 112th NCB, and the 133rd NCB.133 Naval Construction Battalion Log, 1946, p.6, Seabee Museum Archives, Port Hueneme, CA 133 NCB Cruisebook NHHC: Seabee Museum There are two Disney published Seabee logos that are not identified with any unit.Disney Don's Dogtags, Walton Rawls, Abbeville Press, 1992 The end of WWII brought the decommissioning of nearly all of the CBs. They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF. So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.  Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award  SCW insignia: officer and enlisted The military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW). It was created in 1993 for both officers and enlisted personnel. Only members attached to a qualifying NCF unit are eligible for the SCW pin. The qualifying units include: NMCBs, ACBs, NCF Support Units (NCFSU), UCTs, and NCRs. Fleet Marine Force insignia authorized for US Naval personnel: Officer, Enlisted, and Chaplain The Fleet Marine Force Insignia or Fleet Marine Force pin (FMF pin), are for issue to those USN officers and enlisted trained and qualified to support the U. S. Marine Corps. Those Seabees assigned with the Fleet Marine Force can earn the FMF pin. The FMF pin comes in three classes : enlisted, officer, and chaplain. For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per OPNAV Instruction 1414.4B. The Peltier Award is given to the \\"best of type\\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions. It was instituted by Rear Admiral Eugene J. Peltier CEC and has been given annually since 1960. He is a former head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (1959‚Äì1962).

The other three of were operated by Lykes Brothers Steamship Company and were originally the SS Doctor Lykes, the SS Tillie Lykes, and the SS Almeria Lykes. The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges . Barges with a 2.5' draft are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel. Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers. A barges measures 97'x35'.Doctor Lykes, Marad, U.S. Dept of Transportation, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC A barge carrier also has storage tanks of nearly 36000 m¬≥(9,510,194 gal.) volume built in its sides and double hull, allowing it to be used also as a tanker. The ships were purchased by Military Sealift Command.

The sagas of Icelanders (), also known as family sagas, are one genre of Icelandic sagas. They are prose narratives mostly based on historical events that mostly took place in Iceland in the ninth, tenth, and early eleventh centuries, during the so-called Saga Age. They are the best- known specimens of Icelandic literature. They are focused on history, especially genealogical and family history. They reflect the struggle and conflict that arose within the societies of the early generations of Icelandic settlers. Eventually many of these Icelandic sagas were recorded, mostly in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The 'authors', or rather recorders of these sagas are largely unknown.

The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Aaron Lewis, lead guitarist Mike Mushok, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki. The lineup has been stable outside of the 2011 departure of Wysocki, who was replaced by Sal Giancarelli. Staind has recorded seven studio albums: Tormented (1996), Dysfunction (1999), Break the Cycle (2001), 14 Shades of Grey (2003), Chapter V (2005), The Illusion of Progress (2008), and Staind (2011). The band's activity became more sporadic after their self-titled release, with Lewis pursuing a solo country music career and Mushok subsequently joining the band Saint Asonia, but they have continued to tour on and off in the following years. In 2016, Lewis reiterated that the band had not broken up, and would possibly create another album, but that his then-current focus was on his solo career. The band reunited more permanently in 2019 for several shows, continuing with live appearances in 2020. Many of their singles have reached high positions on US rock and all-format charts as well, including \\"It's Been Awhile\\", \\"Fade\\", \\"Price to Play\\", \\"So Far Away\\", and \\"Right Here\\". History =Early years and Tormented (1995‚Äì1998)= In 1993, vocalist Aaron Lewis and guitarist Mike Mushok met at a Christmas party in Springfield, Massachusetts. Mushok introduced drummer Jon Wysocki while Lewis brought in bassist Johnny April to form the band in 1995. Their first public performance was in February 1995, playing a heavy, dark, and introspective style of metal. Extensive touring in the Northeast helped Staind acquire a regional following over the next few years. The band started covering Korn, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Tool, and Alice in Chains, among others, and played at local clubs (most commonly playing at Club Infinity) for a year and a half. Staind self-released their debut album, Tormented, in November 1996, citing Tool, Faith No More, and Pantera as their influences. In October 1997, Staind acquired a concert slot through Aaron's cousin Justin Cantor with Limp Bizkit. Just prior to the performance, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst was appalled by Staind's grotesque album cover and unsuccessfully attempted to remove them from the bill. Durst thought that Staind were Theistic Satanists. After being persuaded to let them perform, however, Durst was so impressed that he signed them to Flip Records by February 1998. =Dysfunction (1999‚Äì2000)= On April 13, 1999, Staind released their major label debut Dysfunction on Flip Records. The album, which was co-produced by Fred Durst and Terry Date (who also produced acts like Soundgarden, Deftones, and Pantera), received comparisons to alternative metal giants Tool and Korn. In particular, Aaron Lewis was lauded for his vocals, which were likened to those of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. The album achieved slow success, reaching the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Heatseeker Charts almost six months after its debut. In the same week, the record jumped to No. 74 on Billboard's Top 200 Album Charts. The nine-track LP (with one hidden track, \\"Excess Baggage\\") produced three singles, \\"Just Go\\", \\"Mudshovel\\", and \\"Home\\". \\"Mudshovel\\" and \\"Home\\" both received radio play, cracking the Top 20 of Billboard's Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. In promotion of Dysfunction, Staind went on several tours, including the Family Values Tour with acts like Limp Bizkit and The Crystal Method, as well as opening for Sevendust's headlining tour.Limp Bizkit Talks \\"Real\\" Lineup As Family Values Tour Kicks Off MTV News.

Staind released their third studio album, Break the Cycle, on May 22, 2001. Propelled by the success of the first single, \\"It's Been Awhile\\", the album debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top 200 Album charts, selling 716,000 copies in its first week.Staind Score Third Straight Billboard Win With Chapter V MTV News. August 17, 2005. The record's first-week sales were the second highest of any album that year, behind Creed's Weathered.Pop Albums; A Prolonged Spin 'Cycle' for Staind LA Times. June 7, 2001. Break the Cycle saw the band retaining the nu metal sound from their previous album. Despite this, the album saw the band going further into a post-grunge sound which is evident in the smash hit song \\"It's Been Awhile\\", and the song led critics to compare the band to several other post-grunge bands at the time. The record spawned the singles \\"It's Been Awhile\\" (which hit the Billboard Top 10), \\"Fade\\", \\"Outside\\", \\"For You\\", and the acoustic ballad \\"Epiphany\\". \\"It's Been Awhile\\" spent a total of 16 and 14 weeks on top of the modern and mainstream rock charts respectively, making it one of the highest joint numbers of all time. In 2001, Break the Cycle sold four million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums that year. Break the Cycle would go on to sell seven million copies worldwide, making this Staind's bestselling album. =14 Shades of Grey (2003‚Äì2004)= In early 2003, Staind embarked on a worldwide tour to promote the release of the follow-up to Break the Cycle, 14 Shades of Grey, which sold two million copies and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. The album saw a departure from their previous nu metal sound as it mostly contained a lighter and more melodic post-grunge sound. 14 Shades of Grey produced two mainstream hits, \\"Price to Play\\" and \\"So Far Away\\", which spent 14 weeks on top of the rock chart. In addition, two other singles were released: \\"How About You\\" and \\"Zoe Jane\\". The band's appearance at the Reading Festival during their 2003 tour had another impromptu acoustic set, this time due to equipment failure. The singles \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Price to Play\\" came with two unreleased tracks, \\"Novocaine\\" and \\"Let It Out\\", which were released for the special edition of the group's subsequent album Chapter V, which came out in late 2005. In 2003, Staind unsuccessfully sued their logo designer Jon Stainbrook in New York Federal Court for attempting to re-use the logo he had sold to the band. They re-opened the case in mid-2005. =Chapter V and The Singles (2005‚Äì2007)= Staind concert with the title Chapter V in the background Staind's fifth album, titled Chapter V, was released on August 9, 2005, and became their third consecutive album to top the Billboard 200. The album opened to sales of 185,000 and has since been certified platinum in the U.S. The first single, \\"Right Here\\", was the biggest success from the album, garnering much mainstream radio play and peaking at number 1 on the mainstream rock chart. \\"Falling\\" was released as the second single, followed by \\"Everything Changes\\" and \\"King of All Excuses\\". Staind went on the road when the album came out, doing live shows and promoting it for a full year, including participating in the Fall Brawl tour with P.O.D., Taproot, and Flyleaf; they also had a solo tour across Europe and a mini-promotional tour in Australia for the first time. Other live shows included a cover of Pantera's \\"This Love\\", a tribute to Dimebag Darrell. Staind appeared on The Howard Stern Show on August 10, 2005 to promote Chapter V. They performed acoustic renditions of the single \\"Right Here\\" and Beetlejuice's song \\"This is Beetle\\". In early November 2005, Staind released the limited edition 2-CD/DVD set of Chapter V. On September 6, 2006, they performed an acoustic show in the Hiro Ballroom, New York City, that was recorded for their singles collection. The band played sixteen songs, including three covers: Tool's \\"Sober\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb\\", and Alice in Chains's \\"Nutshell\\". The collection The Singles: 1996‚Äì2006 was released on November 14, 2006. It included all the band's singles, the three covers performed at the New York show, and a remastered version of \\"Come Again\\" from Staind's first independent release Tormented. =The Illusion of Progress (2008‚Äì2009)= On August 19, 2008, Staind released their sixth album, The Illusion of Progress. Prior to the album's release, the track \\"This Is It\\" was available for download on the iTunes Store, as well as for Rock Band. The album debuted at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, No. 1 on the Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums Chart, No. 1 on the Top Digital Albums Chart, and also No. 1 on the Top Internet Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 91,800 units. The first single on the album, \\"Believe\\", topped Billboard's Top 10 Modern Rock Tracks on September 5, 2008. The band also supported Nickelback on their 2008 European tour. The second single was \\"All I Want\\", and came out on November 24. The single also became Staind's 13th top 20 hit on the rock charts. In Europe, the second single was \\"The Way I Am\\", released on January 26, 2009. The final single released from the album, \\"This Is It\\", was sent to radio stations across the country on May 4, 2009. The track was also included on the successful Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ‚Äì The Album released in late June 2009. The same year, Staind embarked on a fall tour with the newly reunited Creed. =Staind and departure of Jon Wysocki (2010‚Äì2012)= Staind at Uproar Festival 2012In March 2010, Aaron Lewis stated the band would start working on their seventh studio album by the end of the year. Lewis had finished recording his country music solo EP and had started a nonprofit organization to reopen his daughter's elementary school in Worthington, Massachusetts. Guitarist Mike Mushok stated in a Q&A; session with fans that the band was looking to make a heavy record, but still \\"explore some of the things we did on the last record and take them somewhere new for us\\". In a webisode posted on the band's website, Lewis stated that eight songs were written and that \\"every one of them is as heavy or heavier than the heaviest song on the last record\\". In December 2010, Staind posted three webisodes from the studio, which featured the band members discussing the writing and recording process of their new album. They announced that as of April 20, they had completed the recording of their seventh and would release it later that year. On May 20, 2011, Staind announced that original drummer Jon Wysocki had left the band. Drummer Will Hunt filled in for a few dates, while Wysocki's drum tech Sal Giancarelli filled in for the rest of the tour. Three days later, it was reported that Staind's new album would be a self-titled release. It was released on September 13, 2011. The first single, \\"Not Again\\", was released to active radio stations on July 18. The song \\"The Bottom\\" appeared on the Transformers: Dark of the Moon soundtrack. On June 30, Staind released a song called \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" from their new record. \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" would later be released on November 29 as the album's second single. In November 2011, the band announced through their YouTube page that Sal Giancarelli was now an official member. The band continued to perform into 2012, embarking on an April and May tour with Godsmack and Halestorm, and they played the Uproar Festival in August and September with Shinedown and a number of other artists. It was announced in July 2012 that the band was to be taking a hiatus. In an interview with Billboard, Aaron Lewis stated that \\"We're not breaking up. We're not gonna stop making music. We're just going to take a little hiatus that really hasn't ever been taken in our career. We put out seven records in 14 years. We've been pretty busy.\\" Lewis also had plans to release his first solo album The Road. During this time, Mike Mushok auditioned, and was selected, to play guitar for former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted's new band Newsted. He featured on their debut album Heavy Metal Music. =Hiatus and limited activity (2013‚Äìpresent)= Staind played their first show in two years at the Welcome To Rockville Festival on April 27, 2014. They also played the Carolina Rebellion and Rock on the Range festivals in May 2014. In late 2014, the band went on a hiatus. Aaron Lewis continued to play solo shows and work on his next solo album. He also confirmed that the hiatus would last \\"for a while\\". Mike Mushok teamed up with former Three Days Grace singer Adam Gontier, former Finger Eleven drummer Rich Beddoe, and Eye Empire bassist Corey Lowery to form Saint Asonia. On August 4, 2017, the band performed for the first time since November 2014 for an acoustic performance at Aaron Lewis' 6th annual charity golf tournament and concert when bassist Johnny April and drummer Sal Giancarelli joined Aaron Lewis and Mike Mushok to perform \\"Outside\\", \\"Something to Remind You\\", and \\"It's Been Awhile\\". Three days later, Lewis announced that Staind would never tour extensively again, with Lewis explaining: In April 2019, the band announced they would reform in September 2019 for some live performances. The band was scheduled to play at Epicenter Festival on May 3rd 2020 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Musical style, influences, and lyrical themes The topics of Staind's lyrics cover issues of depression, relationships, death, addiction, finding one's self, betrayal, and Lewis' thoughts about becoming a father in the song \\"Zoe Jane\\" from 14 Shades of Grey, as well as reflecting on his upbringing in the song \\"The Corner\\" from The Illusion of Progress. Also from 14 Shades of Grey, the track titled \\"Layne\\" was written about Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley in response to his death in 2002. The song is also about Staley's legacy and the effect his music had on the members of Staind, especially Aaron Lewis.

Nevertheless, these same unreliable computer models underpin the Global Climate Treaty.\\" * In preparing its 1995 report, the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change unfairly marginalized scientific views which do not support the conclusion that human activity is causing climate change. * The Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated various regulations (pertaining to e.g. smog, ozone, environmental toxins, and particulate matter) which significantly harm the economy with negligible environmental benefit. * No detectable increase in ultraviolet radiation has been demonstrated from thinning of the ozone layer. The ban on CFCs in developed countries is economically harmful and ineffective, because they are still produced in developing countries. * In general, science has been misused to promote \\"politically correct\\" views, and the mechanisms of science funding contribute to a systemic bias. * Natural resources are best managed by free-market mechanisms in the context of clearly established property rights. * The U.S. space program should focus on manned exploration of Mars (as opposed to unmanned problems, or manned exploration of low earth orbit), with the Moon as a stepping stone. * Efforts to protect the Earth from asteroid impact have been neglected. On September 2, 1997, Singer said that \\"The possibility that global temperatures could rise because of an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a concern that needs to be monitored...But there has been no indication in the last century that we've seen anything other than natural climate fluctuations.

As of mid-2007, the rise is between 0.14 and 0.184 degree Celsius per decade, depending on which satellite record is used. (See Satellite temperature measurements.) * Computer climate models have predicted 20th century temperature trends accurately. * Scientific evidence indicates that recent global warming is caused by human activity. Patrick Michaels, a well- known denier, has said that it is \\"proven humans are warming the atmosphere\\" . (See Attribution of recent climate change.) * The ban on CFCs did not cause any substantial economic harm, and has been effective. Increases in surface UV are inferred (see ozone depletion). * Primary scientific data was collected in Punta Arenas, Chile, using a Brewer spectro-photometer, and \\"These results indicate that during the time when ozone depletion in the Antarctica takes place, an increase in UV-B radiation reaching the Earth surface affected the American continent at latitudes about parallel 50¬∞ S.\\" * In response to NASA research confirming 2010 tied for the warmest year on record, James Hanson, Chief Climate Scientist and Director, Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA, stated: \\"if the warming trend continues, as is expected, if greenhouse gases continue to increase, the 2010 record will not stand for long.\\" NASA Research Finds 2010 Tied for Warmest Year on Record, January 12, 2011 NIPCC In 2008, The Science and Environmental Policy Project completed the organization of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) as the culmination of a process that began in 2003.

The Carolingian-era monastery has existed since 719 and became an independent principality between 9th and 13th centuries, and was for many centuries one of the chief Benedictine abbeys in Europe. It was founded by Saint Othmar on the spot where Saint Gall had erected his hermitage. The library of the Abbey is one of the richest medieval libraries in the world.Codices Electronici Sangallenses-Description The city of St. Gallen originated as an adjoining settlement of the abbey. Following the secularization of the abbey around 1800 the former Abbey church became a Cathedral in 1848. Since 1983 the whole remaining abbey precinct has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History =Foundation= Around 613 Gallus, according to tradition an Irish monk and disciple and companion of Saint Columbanus, established a hermitage on the site that would become the monastery. He lived in his cell until his death in 646, and was buried there in Arbon. Afterwards, the people venerated him as a saint and prayed at his tomb for his intercession in times of danger. Following Gallus' death, Charles Martel appointed Otmar as custodian of St Gall's relics. Several different dates are given for the foundation of the monastery, including 719, 720, 747 and the middle of the 8th century. During the reign of Pepin the Short, in the 8th century, Othmar founded the Carolingian style Abbey of St Gall, where arts, letters and sciences flourished. The abbey grew fast and many Alemannic noblemen became monks. At the end of abbot Otmar's reign, the Professbuch mentions 53 names. Two monks of the Abbey of St Gall, Magnus von F√ºssen and Theodor, founded the monasteries in Kempten and F√ºssen in the Allg√§u. With the increase in the number of monks the abbey grew stronger also economically. Much land in Thurgau, Z√ºrichgau and in the rest of Alemannia as far as the Neckar was transferred to the abbey due to Stiftungen. Under abbot Waldo of Reichenau (740‚Äì814) copying of manuscripts was undertaken and a famous library was gathered. Numerous Anglo-Saxon and Irish monks came to copy manuscripts. At Charlemagne's request Pope Adrian I sent distinguished chanters from Rome, who propagated the use of the Gregorian chant. In 744, the Alemannic nobleman Beata sells several properties to the abbey in order to finance his journey to Rome. =Golden Age= In the subsequent century, St Gall came into conflict with the nearby Bishopric of Constance which had recently acquired jurisdiction over the Abbey of Reichenau on Lake Constance. It was not until Emperor Louis the Pious (ruled 814‚Äì840) confirmed in 813 the imperial immediacy (Reichsunmittelbarkeit) of the abbey, that this conflict ceased. The abbey became an Imperial Abbey (Reichsabtei). King Louis the German confirmed in 833 the immunity of the abbey and allowed the monks the free choice of their abbot. In 854 finally, the Abbey of St Gall reached its full autonomy by King Louis the German releasing the abbey from the obligation to pay tithes to the Bishop of Constance. From this time until the 10th century, the abbey flourished. It was home to several famous scholars, including Notker of Li√®ge, Notker the Stammerer, Notker Labeo and Hartker (who developed the antiphonal liturgical books for the abbey). During the 9th century a new, larger church was built and the library was expanded. Manuscripts on a wide variety of topics were purchased by the abbey and copies were made. Over 400 manuscripts from this time have survived and are still in the library today. =Silver Age= Between 924 and 933 the Magyars threatened the abbey and the books had to be removed to Reichenau for safety. Not all the books were returned. On 26 April 937 a fire broke out and destroyed much of the abbey and the adjoining settlement, though the library was undamaged. About 954 they started to protect the monastery and buildings by a surrounding wall. Around 971/974 abbot Notker (about whom almost nothing is known; nephew of Notker Physicus) finalized the walling and the adjoining settlements started to become the town of St Gall. In 1006, the abbey was the northernmost place where a sighting of the 1006 supernova was recorded. The death of abbot Ulrich II on 9 December 1076 terminated the cultural silver age of the monastery. =Under the Prince- Abbots= The territories of the Abbey of St. Gall from the mid-15th century to 1798 In 1207, abbot Ulrich von Sax becomes a Prince (Reichsf√ºrst, or simply F√ºrst) of the Holy Roman Empire by King Philip of Germany. The abbey became a Princely Abbey (Reichsabtei). As the abbey became more involved in local politics, it entered a period of decline. The city of St. Gallen proper progressively freed itself from the rule of the abbot, acquiring Imperial immediacy, and by the late 15th century was recognized as a Free imperial city. By about 1353 the guilds, headed by the cloth-weavers guild, gained control of the civic government. In 1415 the city bought its liberty from the German king King Sigismund. During the 14th century Humanists were allowed to carry off some of the rare texts from the abbey library. In the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the farmers of the abbot's personal estates (known as Appenzell, from meaning \\"cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot\\") began seeking independence. In 1401, the first of the Appenzell Wars broke out, and following the Appenzell victory at Stoss in 1405 they became allies of the Swiss Confederation in 1411. During the Appenzell Wars, the town of St. Gallen often sided with Appenzell against the abbey. So when Appenzell allied with the Swiss, the town of St. Gallen followed just a few months later. The abbot became an ally of several members of the Swiss Confederation (Z√ºrich, Lucerne, Schwyz and Glarus) in 1451. While Appenzell and St. Gallen became full members of the Swiss Confederation in 1454. Then, in 1457 the town of St. Gallen became officially free from the abbot. In 1468 the abbot, Ulrich R√∂sch, bought the County of Toggenburg from the representatives of its counts, after the family died out in 1436. In 1487 he built a monastery at Rorschach on Lake Constance, to which he planned to move. However, he encountered stiff resistance from the St. Gallen citizenry, other clerics, and the Appenzell nobility in the Rhine Valley who were concerned about their holdings. The town of St. Gallen wanted to restrict the increase of power in the abbey and simultaneously increase the power of the town. The mayor of St. Gallen, Ulrich Varnb√ºler, established contact with farmers and Appenzell residents (led by the fanatical Hermann Schwendiner) who were seeking an opportunity to weaken the abbot. Initially, he protested to the abbot and the representatives of the four sponsoring Confederate cantons (Z√ºrich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus) against the construction of the new abbey in Rorschach. Then on July 28, 1489 he had armed troops from St. Gallen and Appenzell destroy the buildings already under construction. When the abbot complained to the Confederates about the damages and demanded full compensation, Varnb√ºler responded with a counter suit and in cooperation with Schwendiner rejected the arbitration efforts of the non-partisan Confederates. He motivated the clerics from Wil to Rorschach to discard their loyalty to the abbey and spoke against the abbey at the town meeting at Waldkirch, where the popular league was formed. He was confident that the four sponsoring cantons would not intervene with force, due to the prevailing tensions between the Confederation and the Swabian League. He was strengthened in his resolve by the fact that the people of St. Gallen elected him again to the highest magistrate in 1490. An associate of the Swiss Confederation However, in early 1490 the four cantons decided to carry out their duty to the abbey and to invade the St. Gallen canton with an armed force. The people of Appenzell and the local clerics submitted to this force without noteworthy resistance, while the city of St. Gallen braced for a fight to the finish. However, when they learned that their compatriots had given up the fight, they lost confidence; the end result was that they concluded a peace pact that greatly restricted the city's powers and burdened the city with serious penalties and reparations payments. Varnb√ºler and Schwendiner fled to the court of King Maximilian and lost all their property in St. Gallen and Appenzell. However, the abbot's reliance on the Swiss to support him reduced his position almost to that of a \\"subject district\\". The town adopted the Reformation in 1524, while the abbey remained Catholic, which damaged relations between the town and abbey. Both the abbot and a representative of the town were admitted to the Swiss Tagsatzung or Diet as the closest associates of the Confederation. In the 16th century the abbey was raided by Calvinist groups, which scattered many of the old books. In 1530, abbot Diethelm began a restoration that stopped the decline and led to an expansion of the schools and library. The interior of the Cathedral is one of the most important baroque monuments in Switzerland Under abbot Pius (1630‚Äì74) a printing press was started. In 1712 during the Toggenburg war, also called the second war of Villmergen, the Abbey of St. Gall was pillaged by the Swiss. They took most of the books and manuscripts to Z√ºrich and Bern. For security, the abbey was forced to request the protection of the townspeople of St. Gallen. Until 1457 the townspeople had been serfs of the abbey, but they had grown in power until they were protecting the abbey. End of the Prince- Abbots Following the disturbances, the abbey was still the largest religious city-state in Switzerland, with over 77,000 inhabitants. A final attempt to expand the abbey resulted in the demolition of most of the medieval monastery. The new structures, including the cathedral by architect Peter Thumb (1681-1766),Hempel, Eberhard. 1965. Baroque art and architecture in central Europe: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland. Painting and sculpture: seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; architecture: sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Baltimore: Penguin Books, p. 163. were designed in the late Baroque style and constructed between 1755 and 1768. The large and ornate new abbey did not remain a monastery for very long. In 1798 the Prince-Abbot's secular power was suppressed, and the abbey was secularized. The monks were driven out and moved into other abbeys. The abbey became a separate See in 1846, with the abbey church as its cathedral and a portion of the monastic buildings for the bishop. Cultural treasures The Plan of St Gall, the only surviving major architectural drawing from the Early Middle Ages The diagram version of the Plan The Abbey library of Saint Gall is recognized as one of the richest medieval libraries in the world. It is home to one of the most comprehensive collections of early medieval books in the German-speaking part of Europe. , the library consists of over 160,000 books, of which 2100 are handwritten. Nearly half of the handwritten books are from the Middle Ages and 400 are over 1000 years old. Lately the Stiftsbibliothek has launched a project for the digitisation of the priceless manuscript collection, which currently (December 2009) contains 355 documents that are available on the Codices Electronici Sangallenses webpage. The library interior is exquisitely realised in the Rococo style with carved polished wood, stucco and paint used to achieve its overall effect. It was designed by the architect Peter Thumb and is open to the public. In addition it holds exhibitions as well as concerts and other events.St. Gall Library website (limited English information) One of the more interesting documents in the Stiftsbibliothek is a copy of Priscian's Institutiones grammaticae which contains the poem Is acher in ga√≠th in-nocht... written in Old Irish. The library also preserves a unique 9th-century document, known as the Plan of St. Gall, the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the 13th century. The Plan drawn was never actually built, and was so named because it was kept at the famous medieval monastery library, where it remains to this day. The plan was an ideal of what a well-designed and well-supplied monastery should have, as envisioned by one of the synods held at Aachen for the reform of monasticism in the Frankish empire during the early years of emperor Louis the Pious (between 814 and 817). A late 9th-century drawing of St. Paul lecturing an agitated crowd of Jews and gentiles, part of a copy of a Pauline epistles produced at and still held by the monastery, was included in a medieval- drawing show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York the summer of 2009. A reviewer noted that the artist had \\"a special talent for depicting hair, ... with the saint's beard ending in curling droplets of ink.\\"\\"Those Medieval Monks Could Draw\\" Review by Roberta Smith, The New York Times, June 18, 2009 (6/19/09, p. C25 of the NY ed.). Retrieved 6/19/09. \\"Pen and Parchment: Drawing in the Middle Ages\\" runs through August 23, 2009. St. Gall is noted for its early use of the neume, the basic element of Western and Eastern systems of musical notation prior to the invention of five-line staff notation. The earliest extant manuscripts are from the 9th or 10th century. In 1983, the Convent of St. Gall was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \\"a perfect example of a great Carolingian monastery\\".UNESCO website accessed 30 December 2009 People of the abbey =List of abbots= There were a total of 73 ruling abbots (including six anti-abbots) between 719 and 1805.

Level 2 or lower secondary education (less common junior secondary education) is considered the second and final phase of basic education, and level 3 (upper) secondary education is the stage before tertiary education. Every country aims to provide basic education, but the systems and terminology remain unique to them. Secondary education typically takes place after six years of primary education and is followed by higher education, vocational education or employment. In most countries secondary education is compulsory, at least until the age of 16. Children typically enter the lower secondary phase around age 11. Compulsory education sometimes extends to age 19. Since 1989, education has been seen as a basic human right for a child; Article 28, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that primary education should be free and compulsory while different forms of secondary education, including general and vocational education, should be available and accessible to every child. The terminology has proved difficult, and there was no universal definition before ISCED divided the period between primary education and university into junior secondary education and upper secondary education. In classical and medieval times secondary education was provided by the church for the sons of nobility and to boys preparing for universities and the priesthood. As trade required navigational and scientific skills the church reluctantly expanded the curriculum and widened the intake. With the Reformation the state wrestled the control of learning from the church, and with Comenius and John Locke education changed from being repetition of Latin text to building up knowledge in the child. Education was for the few. Up to the middle of the 19th century, secondary schools were organised to satisfy the needs of different social classes with the labouring classes getting 4 years, the merchant class 5 years and the elite getting 7 years. The rights to a secondary education were codified after 1945, and countries are still working to achieve the goal of mandatory and free secondary education for all youth under 19. Definition The 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) describes seven levels that can be used to compare education internationally. Within a country these can be implemented in different ways, with different age levels and local denominations. The seven levels are: * Level 0 ‚Äì Pre-primary education * Level 1 ‚Äì Primary education or first stage of basic education * Level 2 ‚Äì Lower secondary or second stage of basic education * Level 3 ‚Äì (Upper) secondary education * Level 4 ‚Äì Post- secondary non-tertiary education * Level 5 ‚Äì First stage of tertiary education * Level 6 ‚Äì Second stage of tertiary education Within this system, Levels 1 and 2 ‚Äì that is, primary education and lower secondary ‚Äì together form basic education. Beyond that, national governments may attach the label of secondary education to Levels 2 through 4 together, Levels 2 and 3 together, or Level 2 alone. These level definitions were put together for statistical purposes, and to allow the gathering of comparative data nationally and internationally. They were approved by the UNESCO General Conference at its 29th session in November 1997. Though they may be dated, they do provide a universal set of definitions and remain unchanged in the 2011 update. The start of lower secondary education is characterised by the transition from the single-class- teacher, who delivers all content to a cohort of pupils, to one where content is delivered by a series of subject specialists. Its educational aim is to complete provision of basic education (thereby completing the delivery of basic skills) and to lay the foundations for lifelong learning. Lower secondary education is likely to show these criteria: *entry after some 6 years of primary education *the requirement for more highly qualified teachers teaching only within their specialism *exit to Level 3 courses, or vocational education, or employment after 9 or more total years of education. The end of lower secondary education often coincides with the end of compulsory education in countries where that exists. (Upper) secondary education starts on the completion of basic education, which also is defined as completion of lower secondary education. The educational focus is varied according to the student's interests and future direction. Education at this level is usually voluntary. (Upper) secondary education is likely to show these criteria: *entry after some 9 years of basic education *typical age at entry is between 14 and 16 years *all teachers have level 5 qualifications in the subject they are teaching *exit to Level 4 or 5 courses or to direct employment. More subjects may be dropped, and increased specialism occurs. Completion of (upper) secondary education provides the entry requirements to Level 5 tertiary education, the entry requirements to technical or vocational education (Level 4, non tertiary course), or direct entry into the workplace. In 2012 the ISCED published further work on education levels where it codified particular paths and redefined the tertiary levels. Lower secondary education and (upper) secondary education could last between 2 and 5 years, and the transition between two often would be when students were allowed some subject choice. Terminology for secondary schools varies by country, and the exact meaning of any of these varies. Secondary schools may also be called academies, colleges, gymnasiums, high schools, lyceums, middle schools, preparatory schools, sixth-form colleges, upper schools, or vocational schools, among other names. For further information about nomenclature, see the section below by country. History A form of education for adolescents became necessary in all societies that had an alphabet and engaged in commerce. In Western Europe, formal secondary education can be traced back to the Athenian educational reforms of 320BC. Though their civilisation was eclipsed and they were enslaved, Hellenistic Athenian teachers were valued in the Roman system. The Roman and Hellenistic schools of rhetoric taught the seven liberal arts and sciences ‚Äì grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy ‚Äì which were regarded as a preparation for the study at a tertiary level of theology, law and medicine. Boys would have been prepared to enter these schools by private tutors at home. Girls would have only received tuition at home. When the Romans retreated, all traces of civilisation were erased. England provides a good case study. When Augustine of Canterbury brought Christianity there in 597, no schools existed. He needed trained priests to conduct church services and boys to sing in the choir. He had to create both the grammar schools that taught Latin, to enable the English to study for the priesthood, and song schools (choir schools) that trained the 'sons of gentlefolk' to sing in cathedral choirs. In the case of Canterbury (597) and Rochester (604), both still exist. Bede in his Ecclesiastical history (732) tells that the Canterbury school taught more than the 'intended reading and understanding of Latin', but 'the rules of metric, astronomy and the computus as well as the works of the saints' Even at this stage, there was tension, as the church was worried that knowledge of Latin would give the student access to non-Christian texts that it would not wish them to read. Over the centuries leading to the renaissance and reformation the church was the main provider of secondary education. Various invasions and schisms within the controlling church challenged the focus of the schools, and the curriculum and language of instruction waxed and waned. From 1100, With the growth of the towns, grammar schools 'free' of the church were founded, and some church grammar schools were handed over to the la√Øty. Universities were founded that didn't just train students for the priesthood. =Renaissance and reformation= Whereas in mainland Europe the renaissance preceded the reformation, local conditions in England caused the reformation to come first. The reformation was about allowing the la√Øty to interpret the Bible in their own way without the intervention of priests, and preferably in the vernacular. This stimulated the foundation of free Grammar schools- who searched for a less constrained curriculum. Colonialisation required navigation, mensuration, languages and administrative skills. The la√Øty wanted these taught to their sons. After Gutenberg1455 had mastered moveable metal type printing and Tyndale had translated the Bible into English (1525),. Latin became a skill reserved for the catholic church and sons conservative nobility. Schools started to be set up for the sons of merchants in Europe and the colonies too- for example Boston Latin Grammar School (1635). Comenius (1592‚Äì1670),Daniel Murphy, Comenius: A Critical Reassessment of his Life and Works (1995), p. 8 and p. 43. a Moravian protestant proposed a new model of education- where ideas were developed from the familiar to the theoretical rather than through repetition, where languages were taught in the vernacular and supported universal education. In his Didactica Magna (Great Didactic), he outlined a system of schools that is the exact counterpart of many western school systems: kindergarten, elementary school, secondary school, six-form college, university. Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693) stressed the importance of a broader intellectual training, moral development and physical hardening. . The grammar schools of the period can be categorised in three groups: the nine leading schools, seven of them boarding institutions which maintained the traditional curriculum of the classics, and mostly served 'the aristocracy and the squirearchy' ; most of the old endowed grammar schools serving a broad social base in their immediate localities which also stuck to the old curriculum; the grammar schools situated in the larger cities, serving the families of merchants and tradesmen who embraced change. =Industrialisation= During the 18th century their social base widened and their curriculum developed, particularly in mathematics and the natural sciences. But this was not universal education and was self-selecting by wealth The industrial revolution changed that. Industry required an educated workforce where all workers needed to have completed a basic education. In France, Louis XIV, wrestled the control of education from the Jesuits, Condorcet set up Coll√®ges for universal lower secondary education throughout the country, then Napoleon set up a regulated system of Lycee. In England, Robert Peel's Factory Act of 1802 required an employer to provide instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic during at least the first four years of the seven years of apprenticeship. The state had accepted responsibility for the basic education of the poor. The provision of school places remained inadequate, so an Order in Council dated 10 April 1839 created the Committee of the Privy Council on Education. =Universal Education= There was considerable opposition to the idea that children of all classes should receive basic education, all the initiatives such as industrial schools and Sunday schools were initially a private or church initiative. With the Great Exhibition of 1851, it became clear just how far behind the English education system had fallen. Three reports were commissioned to examine the education of upper, middle and labouring class children. The Clarendon Commission sought to improve the nine Great Public Schools. The Taunton Commission looked at the 782 endowed grammar schools (private and public). They found varying quality and a patchy geographical coverage, with two thirds of all towns not having any secondary school. There was no clear conception of the purpose of secondary education. There were only thirteen girls' schools and their tuition was superficial, unorganised and unscientific. They recommended a system of first-grade schools targeted at a leaving age of 18 as preparation for upper and upper-middle class boys entering university, second-grade targeted at a leaving age of 16 for boys preparing for the army or the newer professions, and third-grade targeted at a leaving age of 14 for boys of small tenant farmers, small tradesmen, and superior artisans. This resulted in the 1869 Endowed Schools Act which advocated that girls should enjoy the same education as boys. The Newcastle Commission inquired \\"into the state of public education in England and to consider and report what measures, if any, are required for the extension of sound and cheap elementary instruction to all classes of the people\\". It produced 1861 Newcastle Report and this led to the 1870 Elementary Education Act (Forster Act). The school boards set up by the 1870 Elementary Education Act (Forster Act) and were stopped from providing secondary education by the Cockerton Judgement of 1899. The school leaving age at this time was 10. The Judgement prompted the 1902 Education Act (Balfour Act). Compulsory education was extended to 12. The new Local Education Authorities (LEA)s that were formed from the school boards; started to open Higher Grade Elementary Schools (ISCED Level2) or county schools to supplement the endowed grammar schools. These LEAs were allowed to build second-grade secondary schools that in the main became the future secondary modern schools. In the \\"1904 Regulations for Secondary Schools\\", the Board of Education determined that secondary schools should offer a: > a four year subject-based course leading to a certificate in English > language and literature, geography, history, a foreign language, > mathematics, science, drawing, manual work, physical training, and, for > girls, housewifery. The Education Act 1918 (Fisher Act) extended compulsory full-time education to 14, and recommended compulsory part-time education from 14‚Äì18. The Hadlow report, \\"Education the Adolescent\\" (1926) proposed that there should be a break point at eleven, establishing primary schools and secondary schools. The United Nations, founded in 1947, was committed to education for all but the definition was difficult to formulate. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) declared that elementary and fundamental education, which it didn't define, was a right to be enjoyed by all. The Education Act 1944 (Butler Act) made sweeping changes to the funding of state education using the tripartite system, but wasn't allowed to tackle private schools. It introduced the GCE 'O'level at 16, and the 'A' at 18, but only raised the school leaving age until 15, making the exam inaccessible to the majority. But one year of ISCED Level 3 (Upper) secondary education was mandatory and free. In 1972 the school leaving was raised to 16. The Education and Skills Act 2008, when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation in some form of education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015.Raising the Participation Age ‚Äì Timeline HMSO, 24 August 2012 This was referred to as raising the \\"participation age\\"Raising the Participation Age (RPA) ‚Äì Myth Buster for Young People HMSO, 29 July 2013 to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16.School leaving age HMSO, 19 November 2014 Thus the UK is following the ISCED Level 3 (Upper) secondary education guideline. Right to a secondary education Schoolgirls in their school uniform in Delhi, 2016. The United Nations was strong in its commitment to education for all but fell into linguistic difficulty defining that right. > ‚ÄúArticle I: Purposes and functions 1\\\\. The purpose of the Organization is to > contribute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among the > nations through education, science and culture in order to further universal > respect for justice, for the rule of law and for the human rights and > fundamental freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the world, > without distinction of race, sex, language or religion, by the Charter of > the United Nations.‚Äù The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) declared that elementary and fundamental education was a right to be enjoyed by all, but again could not define either elementary and fundamental education. > Article 26 :(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be > free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary > education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be > made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to > all on the basis of merit. It was assumed that elementary education was basic education, the entitlement for children- and fundamental education was a right for the working man, but for a lawyer the definition is neither qualitative (stating what education means) or quantitative saying when it starts and when it is completed. The term secondary is not defined or mentioned. Together this has enabled countries to terminate free, compulsory, basic education at 11 or only continue education past eleven to boys. Article 28, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) stated that primary education should be free and compulsory while different forms of secondary education, including general and vocational education, should be available and accessible to every child. Free education should be provided and financial assistance offered in case of need. In 1990, at Jomtien again tried to define the content basic education and how it should be delivered. ‚ÄòBasic education‚Äô is defined as ‚Äòaction designed to meet ‚Äòbasic learning needs‚Äô. ‚Äòprimary schooling‚Äô is considered as ‚Äòthe main delivery system of basic education‚Äô. Which is explained in Principals for Action that: > addressing the basic learning needs of all means: early childhood care and > development opportunities; relevant, quality primary schooling or equivalent > out-of-school education for children; and literacy, basic knowledge and life > skills training for youth and adults.‚Äô The assumption being made that basic knowledge and life skills training for youth was the function of secondary education. This was codified by the ISCED documents. The Dakar Framework for Action 2010 goal 2 states: Ensuring that by 2015 all children, particularly girls, children in difficult circumstances and those belonging to ethnic minorities, have access to and complete free and compulsory (primary in the sense basic) education of good quality. The Dakar Framework for Action 2010 goal 5 states: Eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and achieving gender equality in education by 2015, with a focus on ensuring girls‚Äô full and equal access to and achievement in basic education of good quality. Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize winner in a said in a 2017 interview that: > ‚ÄúMy goal is to make sure every child, girl and boy, they get the opportunity > to go to school.\\" ‚ÄúIt is their basic human right, so I will be working on > that and I will never stop until I see the last child going to school.‚Äù Future directions for secondary education UNESCO believes that in order to prepare young people for life and work in a rapidly changing world, secondary- level education systems need to be re-oriented to impart a broad repertoire of life-skills. These skills should include the key generic competencies, non occupation-specific practical capabilities, ICT, the ability to learn independently, to work in teams, entrepreneurship and civic responsibility. GCED for the rule of law learning outcomes at the secondary level They may be best instilled through a shared foundational learning period and by deferring the directing of students into academic and vocational streams for as long as possible, and then there should be flexibility to ensure the free movement of students between the streams depending on their aptitudes and inclinations. Accreditation in one stream should have equal recognition in the other as well as for access to higher education. This will equip young people with multiple skills so that they are prepared to enter and re-enter the workforce several times in their working lives, as wage employees or self-employed entrepreneurs, and to re-train themselves when their skills become obsolete. It recognizes that there is no single model that will suit all countries, or even all communities in a given country. Secondary-level education policy should be under continuous review to keep in step with scientific and technological, economic and societal change. = Promoting the Rule of Law = Adolescence is associated with a time of significant growth where identity, belongingness, and socialization, especially among peer groups is particularly important. Secondary schools play an important role in youth's socialization, development and forming their ideas and approach to justice, democracy and human rights. Education systems that promote education for justice, that is, respect for the rule of law (RoL) together with international human rights and fundamental freedoms strengthen the relationship between learners and public institutions with the objective of empowering young people to become champions of peace and justice. Teachers are on the front line of this work and, along with families, play a formative role in shaping the future of youth's attitudes and behaviours. By country Each country has developed the form of education most appropriate for them. There is an attempt to compare the effectiveness by using the results from the PISA that, each third year, assesses the scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading of a representative sample of 5000 fifteen year olds from each country.

Many famous scientists, including Albert Einstein, have contributed articles to it. It is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States (though it only became monthly in 1921). History Scientific American was founded by inventor and publisher Rufus M. Porter in 1845 as a four-page weekly newspaper. Throughout its early years, much emphasis was placed on reports of what was going on at the U.S. Patent Office. It also reported on a broad range of inventions including perpetual motion machines, an 1860 device for buoying vessels by Abraham Lincoln, and the universal joint which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured. Current issues include a \\"this date in history\\" section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier. Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology. It started as a weekly publication in August 1845 before turning into monthly in November 1921. Porter sold the publication to Alfred Ely Beach and Orson Desaix Munn a mere ten months after founding it. Until 1948, it remained owned by Munn & Company. Under Munn's grandson, Orson Desaix Munn III, it had evolved into something of a \\"workbench\\" publication, similar to the twentieth-century incarnation of Popular Science. In the years after World War II, the magazine fell into decline. In 1948, three partners who were planning on starting a new popular science magazine, to be called The Sciences, purchased the assets of the old Scientific American instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new magazine. Thus the partnerspublisher Gerard Piel, editor Dennis Flanagan, and general manager Donald H. Miller, Jr.essentially created a new magazine. Miller retired in 1979, Flanagan and Piel in 1984, when Gerard Piel's son Jonathan became president and editor; circulation had grown fifteen-fold since 1948. In 1986, it was sold to the Holtzbrinck group of Germany, which has owned it since. In the fall of 2008, Scientific American was put under the control of Nature Publishing Group, a division of Holtzbrinck. Donald Miller died in December 1998, Gerard Piel in September 2004 and Dennis Flanagan in January 2005. Mariette DiChristina became editor- in-chief after John Rennie stepped down in June 2009, and stepped down herself in September 2019. On April 13, 2020, Laura Helmuth assumed the role of Editor-in-chief. International editions Scientific American published its first foreign edition in 1890, the Spanish-language La America Cientifica. Publication was suspended in 1905, and another 63 years would pass before another foreign-language edition appeared: In 1968, an Italian edition, Le Scienze, was launched, and a Japanese edition, ', followed three years later. A new Spanish edition, Investigaci√≥n y Ciencia was launched in Spain in 1976, followed by a French edition, ', in France in 1977, and a German edition, ', in Germany in 1978. A Russian edition V Mire Nauki was launched in the Soviet Union in 1983, and continues in the present-day Russian Federation. Kexue (ÁßëÂ≠¶, \\"Science\\" in Chinese), a simplified Chinese edition launched in 1979, was the first Western magazine published in the People's Republic of China. Founded in Chongqing, the simplified Chinese magazine was transferred to Beijing in 2001. Later in 2005, a newer edition, Global Science (ÁéØÁêÉÁßëÂ≠¶), was published instead of Kexue, which shut down due to financial problems. A traditional Chinese edition, known as ', was introduced to Taiwan in 2002. The Hungarian edition Tudom√°ny existed between 1984 and 1992. In 1986, an Arabic edition, ', was published. In 2002, a Portuguese edition was launched in Brazil. Today, Scientific American publishes 18 foreign-language editions around the globe: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian (discontinued after 15 issues), Polish, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. From 1902 to 1911, Scientific American supervised the publication of the Encyclopedia Americana, which during some of that period was known as The Americana. First issue PDF of first issue: Scientific American Vol. 1, No. 01 published August 28, 1845Cover of the September 1848 issue It originally styled itself \\"The Advocate of Industry and Enterprise\\" and \\"Journal of Mechanical and other Improvements\\".

The complete list of each year's winners appear in the December issue of the magazine, as well as on the magazine's web site. Website In March 1996, Scientific American launched its own website that included articles from current and past issues, online-only features, daily news, special reports, and trivia, among other things. The website introduced a paywall in April 2019, with readers able to view a few articles for free each month. Columns Mesopotamian Campaign of World War I Notable features have included: * Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column * Douglas Hofstadter's Metamagical Themas * The Amateur Scientist column * A.K. Dewdney's Computer Recreations column * Michael Shermer's Skeptic column Television From 1990 to 2005 Scientific American produced a television program on PBS called Scientific American Frontiers with hosts Woodie Flowers and Alan Alda. Books Canet naval guns for the Greek ironclads From 1983 to 1997, Scientific American has produced an encyclopedia set of volumes from their publishing division, the Scientific American Library. These books were not sold in retail stores, but as a Book of the Month Club selection priced from $24.95 to $32.95. Topics covered dozens of areas of scientific knowledge and included in-depth essays on: The Animal Mind; Atmosphere, Climate, and Change; Beyond the Third Dimension; Cosmic Clouds; Cycles of Life ‚Ä¢ Civilization and the Biosphere; The Discovery Of Subatomic Particles; Diversity and the Tropical Rain Forest; Earthquakes and Geological Discovery; Exploring Planetary Worlds; Gravity's Fatal Attraction; Fire; Fossils And The History Of Life; From Quarks to the Cosmos; A Guided Tour Of The Living Cell; Human Diversity; Perception; The Solar System; Sun and Earth; The Science of Words (Linguistics); The Science Of Musical Sound; The Second Law (of Thermodynamics); Stars; Supercomputing and the Transformation of Science. Scientific American launched a publishing imprint in 2010 in partnership with Farrar, Straus and Giroux. * A \\"collection of updated or adapted Scientific American articles and shorter pieces... \\". According to editor Andrea Gawrylewski 'The reader will quickly notice a common theme. ... there really is no debate where the science is concerned'\\". Contributors include Seth Shostak, Paul Offit, Richard Dawkins and Harriet Hall. Scientific and political debate In April 1950, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission ordered Scientific American to cease publication of an issue containing an article by Hans Bethe that appeared to reveal classified information about the thermonuclear hydrogen bomb. Subsequent review of the material determined that the AEC had overreacted. The incident was important for the \\"new\\" Scientific American's history, as the AEC's decision to burn 3000 copies of an early press-run of the magazine containing the offending material appeared to be \\"book burning in a free society\\" when publisher Gerard Piel leaked the incident to the press.Lewenstein, B. V. (1987). 'Public Understanding of Science' in America, 1945‚Äì1965. Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, pp. 280‚Äì284 In its January 2002 issue, Scientific American published a series of criticisms of the Bj√∏rn Lomborg book The Skeptical Environmentalist. Cato Institute fellow Patrick J. Michaels said the attacks came because the book \\"threatens billions of taxpayer dollars that go into the global change kitty every year.\\"Who Let the Dogs Out at Scientific American? , Patrick J. Michaels, January 17, 2002 Journalist Ronald Bailey called the criticism \\"disturbing\\" and \\"dishonest\\", writing, \\"The subhead of the review section, 'Science defends itself against The Skeptical Environmentalist,' gives the show away: Religious and political views need to defend themselves against criticism, but science is supposed to be a process for determining the facts.\\"Green with Ideology, Ronald Bailey, Reason, May 2002 The May 2007 issue featured a column by Michael Shermer calling for a United States pullout from the Iraq War.Bush's Mistake and Kennedy's Error, Michael Shermer, Scientific American, May 2007 In response, Wall Street Journal online columnist James Taranto jokingly called Scientific American \\"a liberal political magazine\\".Sunk or Bunk?, James Taranto, Best of the Web Today, May 18, 2007 The publisher was criticized in 2009 when it notified collegiate libraries that yearly subscription prices for the magazine would increase by nearly 500% for print and 50% for online access to $1500 yearly. An editorial in the September 2016 issue of Scientific American attacked U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump for \\"anti-science\\" attitudes and rhetoric. This marked the first time that the publication forayed into commenting on U.S. presidential politics. Presidential candidate endorsement In the October 2020 issue of the magazine, Scientific American endorsed Joe Biden for the 2020 presidential election, citing Donald Trump's rejection of scientific evidence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In the column reporting the endorsement, the magazine's editors said, \\"Scientific American has never endorsed a presidential candidate in its 175-year history. This year we are compelled to do so. We do not do this lightly.\\" Awards * 2010: IQ Award for the German edition Spektrum der Wissenschaft Top 10 Science Stories of the Year *2011: The Japan Tsunami and Nuclear Crisis **Technology Fuels the Arab Spring **Faster-Than-Light Neutrinos? **Record-Setting Extreme Weather **A Hint of Higgs **The End of the Space Shuttle Program **The Death of Steve Jobs **Gene Therapy Makes a Comeback **The Sun Sets on Solyndra **IBM's Watson Computer Wins on Jeopardy! *2012: Sandy Devastates the U.S. Northeastern Coast **The Higgs Boson Is Detected **NASA's Curiosity Rover Lands on Mars **Publication of the ENCODE Encyclopedia: A Milestone in Genome Research **\\"Obamacare\\" (Mostly) Upheld by Supreme Court **Record Meltdown of Arctic Sea Ice **Pandemic Avian Flu Genes Made Public **Bold, Private Efforts Step into Roles Vacated by NASA **Starvation Diet Fails to Boost Longevity **Daredevils Reach New Highs and Lows *2013: U.S. Sequestration: A Body Blow to Science **Atmospheric CO2 Reaches a Historical High: 400 Parts per Million **Meteor Explodes over Chelyabinsk, Russia **Typhoon Haiyan, the Strongest Storm Known to Make Landfall **Recovery of Oldest Human DNA **The First Neutrinos from Outside the Solar System **Confirmed: Fracking and Related Operations Cause Earthquakes **Gene Therapy Achieves Major Success **Drones Fly Toward Wide Commercial Use, Raising New Concerns **Moon Shot to the Head: Global Initiatives Target the Brain *2014: The Ebola Outbreak **First Touchdown on a Comet **U.S. and China in Historic Climate Deal **Big Bang Gravitational Waves‚Äîor Not **Worst Drought in Millennium Hits California **Catastrophes Tarnish Commercial Spaceflight **Botched Handling of Deadly Germs at U.S. Labs **First Synthetic Chromosome of Yeast Made **Cyber Attacks Spell the End of Magnetic-Stripe Credit Cards **Symbolic Thought Shown to Exist in Other Human Species *2015: Year of the Dwarf Planets and New Views of Mars **The CRISPR Revolution Gains Momentum **Massive Data Breach Highlights Widespread Cybersecurity **Record Climate Change **Newly Discovered Human Raises Questions about our Past **Advances in Concussion Science **Volkswagen Sabotages \\"Clean\\" Diesel **A Century of General Relativity **Drones Fly onto Regulators' Radar **New Discoveries about The Immune System Impacts the Brain (Tie) **The Uncharted Territory of Ebola (Tie) Controversy In 2013, Danielle N. Lee, a female scientist who blogged at Scientific American, was called a \\"whore\\" in an email by an editor at the science website Biology Online after refusing to write professional content without compensation. When Lee, outraged about the email, wrote a rebuttal on her Scientific American blog, the editor-in-chief of Scientific American, Mariette DiChristina, removed the post, sparking an outrage by supporters of Lee. While DiChristina cited legal reasons for removing the blog, others criticized her for censoring Lee. The editor at Biology Online was fired after the incident. The controversy widened in the ensuing days. The magazine's blog editor, Bora Zivkovic, was the subject of allegations of sexual harassment by another blogger, Monica Byrne.Byrne, Monica. Zivkovic said of the meeting, \\"within five minutes, it was clear that SciAm wasn't a good match for her professional goals. [He] stayed for the coffee out of politeness, but found her offputting and uninteresting as a person. So much emphasis has been put on the subject matter of their conversation, but for [Zivkovic] this was no different than talking to an entomologist about insects: all the writing samples she sent we're related to sex and relationships. I was mortified to hear that she understood the conversation as inappropriate, and I did apologize, but not for harassment (there was none), for causing her any discomfort. As a naturalized American, I wasn't raised with all the subtleties that the American madonna/whore culture expouses. And I didn't understand how she could write and talk so freely about sex and yet be offended by our conversation, which was mild in comparison. My interest in her, sexually or otherwise, was zero.\\"\\"This Happened\\", October 14, 2013. Retrieved on 24 October 2013. Although the alleged incident had occurred about a year earlier, editor Mariette DiChristina informed readers that the incident had been investigated and resolved to Ms. Byrne's satisfaction. However, the incident involving Dr. Lee had prompted Ms. Byrne to reveal the identity of Zivkovic, following the latter's support of Dr. Lee. Zivkovic responded on Twitter and his own blog, admitting the incident with Ms. Byrne had taken place. His blog post apologized to Ms. Byrne, and referred to the incident as \\"singular\\", stating that his behavior was not \\"engaged in before or since.\\" Zivkovic resigned from the board of Science Online, the popular science blogging conference that he co-founded with Anton Zuiker. Following Zivkovic's admission, several prominent female bloggers, including other bloggers for the magazine, wrote their own accounts, alleging additional incidents of sexual harassment, although none of these accounts have been independently investigated yet, nor do they meet either the legal or ethical definition of sexual harassment. A day after these new revelations, Zivkovic resigned his position at Scientific American, according to a press release from the magazine.

They have been widely influential, both over their contemporaries and with later acts. Q included John McKay's guitar playing on \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" in their list of \\"100 Greatest Guitar Track Ever\\", while Mojo rated guitarist John McGeoch in their list of \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" for his work on \\"Spellbound\\". The Times cited the group as \\"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\\". Initially associated with the punk scene, the band rapidly evolved to create \\"a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation\\". Their debut album The Scream was released in 1978 to widespread critical acclaim. In 1980, they changed their musical direction and became \\"almost a different band\\" with Kaleidoscope, which peaked at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart. With Juju (1981) which also reached the top 10, they became an influence on the emerging gothic scene. In 1988, the band made a breakthrough in North America with the multifaceted album Peepshow, which received critical praise. With substantial support from alternative rock radio stations,The singles \\"Peek-a-Boo\\" (1988) and \\"Kiss Them For Me\\" were both number 1 for several weeks in the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, which listed the most played songs on alternative radio stations in the US. \\"Kiss Them for Me\\" stayed at the top of this chart for six weeks in a row from 6 July 1991. See they achieved a mainstream hit in the US in 1991 with the single \\"Kiss Them for Me\\". During their career, Siouxsie and the Banshees released 11 studio albums and 30 singles. The band experienced several line-up changes, with Siouxsie and Severin being the only constant members. They disbanded in 1996, with Siouxsie and drummer Budgie continuing to record music as the Creatures, a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career.  History  = Formation (1976‚Äì1977) = Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin met at a Roxy Music concert in September 1975, at a time when glam rock had faded and there was nothing new coming through with which they could identify. From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the \\"Bromley Contingent\\", as most of them came from the Bromley region of South London, a label Severin came to despise. \\"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\\". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \\"The Lord's Prayer\\". While the band intended to split up after the gig, they were asked to play again. Two months later, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer Kenny Morris and guitarist Pete Fenton. After playing several gigs in early 1977, they realised that Fenton did not fit in because he was \\"a real rock guitarist\\". John McKay finally took his place in July. Their first live appearance on television took place in November on Manchester's Granada, on Tony Wilson's TV show So It Goes. They then recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio in which they premiered a new song \\"Metal Postcard\\", introducing a \\"motorik austerity\\" in the drums patterns.. The band described their music as \\"cold, machine-like and passionate at the same time\\". Appearing on the front cover of UK weekly Sounds magazine, Vivien Goldman wrote: \\"they sound like a 21st century industrial plant\\". = The Scream and Join Hands (1978‚Äì1979) = While the band sold out venues in London in early 1978, they still had problems getting the right recording contract that could give them \\"complete artistic control\\". Polydor finally offered this guarantee and signed them in June. Their first single, \\"Hong Kong Garden\\", featuring a xylophone motif, reached the top 10 in the UK shortly after. A NME review hailed it as \\"a bright, vivid narrative, something like snapshots from the window of a speeding Japanese train, power charged by the most original, intoxicating guitar playing I heard in a long, long time\\". The band released their debut album, The Scream, in November 1978. Nick Kent of NME said of the record: \\"The band sounds like some unique hybrid of the Velvet Underground mated with much of the ingenuity of Tago Mago-era Can, if any parallel can be drawn\\". At the end of the article, he added this remark: \\"Certainly, the traditional three-piece sound has never been used in a more unorthodox fashion with such stunning results\\". The Banshees' second album, Join Hands, was released in 1979. In Melody Maker, Jon Savage described \\"Poppy Day\\" as \\"a short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards\\", and Record Mirror described the whole record as a dangerous work that \\"should be heard\\". The Banshees embarked on a major tour to promote the album. A few dates into the tour in September, Morris and McKay left an in-store signing after an argument and quit the band. In need of replacements to fulfill tour dates, the Banshees' manager called drummer Budgie, formerly with the Slits, and asked him to audition. Budgie was hired, but Siouxsie and Severin had no success auditioning guitarists. Robert Smith of the Cure offered his services in case they could not find a guitarist (his group were already the support band on the tour), so the band held him to it after seeing too many \\"rock virtuosos\\". The tour resumed in September and after the last concert, Smith returned to the Cure. = Kaleidoscope, Juju and A Kiss in the Dreamhouse (1980‚Äì1982) = Drummer Budgie became a permanent member, and the band entered the studios to record the single \\"Happy House\\" with guitarist John McGeoch, then still a member of Magazine. Their third album, Kaleidoscope, released in 1980, saw the Banshees exploring new musical territories with the use of other instruments like synthesizers, sitars and drum machines. The group initially had a concept of making each song sound completely different, without regard to whether or not the material could be performed in concert. Melody Maker described the result as \\"a kaleidoscope of sound and imagery, new forms, and content, flashing before our eyes\\". Kaleidoscope was a commercial success, peaking at number 5 in the UK albums chart. This lineup, featuring McGeoch on guitar, toured the United States for the first time in support of the album, playing their first shows in New York City in November 1980. Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1981, left to right: Budgie, Siouxsie, Steven Severin and John McGeoch For Juju (1981), the band took a different approach and practised the songs in concert first before recording them. Juju, according to Severin, became an unintentional concept album that \\"drew on darker elements\\". Sounds hailed it as \\"intriguing, intense, brooding and powerfully atmospheric\\". The album later peaked at number 7 in the UK albums chart and became one of their biggest sellers. McGeoch's guitar contributions on Juju would be later praised by Johnny Marr of the Smiths. During the 1981 accompanying tour, Siouxsie and Budgie secretly became a couple. At the same time, they also began a drum-and- voice duo called the Creatures, releasing their first EP, Wild Things. The Banshees followed in 1982 with the psychedelic A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The record, featuring strings on several numbers, was an intentional contrast to their previous work, with Severin later describing it as a \\"sexy album\\". The British press greeted it enthusiastically. Richard Cook finished his NME review with this sentence: \\"I promise...this music will take your breath away\\". At that time, McGeoch was struggling with alcohol problems, and was hospitalised on his return to a promotional trip from Madrid. The band fired him shortly thereafter. Severin asked Robert Smith to take over guitarist duties again; Smith accepted and rejoined the group in November 1982. = Hy√¶na, Tinderbox and Through the Looking Glass (1983‚Äì1987) = During 1983, the band members worked on several side projects; Siouxsie and Budgie composed the first Creatures album, Feast, while Severin and Smith recorded as the Glove. Smith then insisted on documenting his time with the Banshees, so the group released a cover version of the Beatles' \\"Dear Prudence\\" in September 1983. It became their biggest hit, reaching number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. They also released a live album, Nocturne, and completed their sixth studio album, Hy√¶na. Shortly before its release in May 1984, Smith left the group, citing health issues due to an overloaded schedule, being in two bands at once. Ex-Clock DVA guitarist John Valentine Carruthers replaced him. The Banshees then reworked four numbers from their repertoire, augmented by a string section, for The Thorn EP. NME praised the project at its release: \\"The power of a classical orchestra is the perfect foil for the band's grindingly insistent sounds\\". The new Banshees lineup spent much of 1985 working on a new record, Tinderbox. The group finished the song \\"Cities in Dust\\" before the album, so they rushed its release as a single prior to their longest tour of the UK. Tinderbox was finally released in April 1986. Sounds magazine noted: \\"Tinderbox is a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette\\". Due to the length of time spent working on Tinderbox, the group desired spontaneity and decided to record an album of cover songs, Through the Looking Glass, in 1987. Mojo magazine later praised their version of \\"Strange Fruit\\". After the album's release, the band realised Carruthers was no longer fitting in and decided to work on new material as a trio. = Peepshow (1988‚Äì1990) = Following a lengthy break, the band recruited multi-instrumentalist Martin McCarrick and guitarist Jon Klein. The quintet recorded Peepshow in 1988, with non- traditional rock instrumentation including cello and accordion. Q magazine praised the album in its 5-star review: \\"Peepshow takes place in some distorted fairground of the mind where weird and wonderful shapes loom\\". The first single, \\"Peek-a-Boo\\", was seen by critics as a \\"brave move\\" with horns and dance elements. Sounds wrote: \\"The snare gets slapped, Siouxsie's voice meanders all around your head and it all comes magically together\\". \\"Peek-a- Boo\\" was their first real breakthrough in the United States. After the tour, the band decided to take a break, with Siouxsie and Budgie recording as the Creatures and releasing their most critically acclaimed album to date, Boomerang, and Severin and McCarrick working on material together. = Superstition, The Rapture and break-up (1991‚Äì1999) = In 1991, Siouxsie and the Banshees returned with the single \\"Kiss Them for Me\\", mixing strings over a dance rhythm laced with exotica. The group collaborated with the then unknown Asian Tabla player Talvin Singh, who also sang during the bridge. The single received glowing reviews and later peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 23, allowing them to reach a new audience. The album Superstition followed shortly afterwards, and the group toured the US as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour. The following year, the Banshees were asked to compose \\"Face to Face\\" as a single for the film Batman Returns, at director Tim Burton's request. In 1993, the Banshees recorded new songs based on string arrangements, but quickly stopped the sessions to play festivals abroad. On their return home, they hired former Velvet Underground member John Cale to produce the rest of the record. At its release, 1995's The Rapture was described by Melody Maker as \\"a fascinating, transcontinental journey through danger and exotica\\". A few weeks after its release, Polydor dropped the band from its roster and Klein was replaced on the band's last tour in 1995 by ex- Psychedelic Furs guitarist Knox Chandler. In April 1996, the Banshees disbanded after 20 years of working together. Siouxsie and Budgie announced that they would carry on recording as the Creatures. In 1999, they released the album Anima Animus to critical acclaim. = 2000s‚Äìpresent = In 2002, Universal Music kicked off the band's remastered back catalogue by releasing The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees. In April, Siouxsie, Severin, Budgie and Chandler reunited briefly for the Seven Year Itch tour, which spawned the Seven Year Itch live album and DVD in 2003. The day after their last concert in Tokyo, Japan, Siouxsie and Budgie stayed in town on their own and entered into a recording studio as the Creatures. Their fourth and final studio album, H√°i!, came out a few months later. In 2004, Downside Up, a box set that collected all of the Banshees' B-sides and The Thorn EP, was released. The Times wrote in its review: \\"for here is a group that never filled B-sides with inferior, throwaway tracks. Rather they saw them as an outlet for some of their most radical and challenging work\\". In 2006, the band's first four records were remastered and compiled with previously unreleased bonus tracks. Several recordings made for the John Peel radio show from 1978 to 1986 were also compiled on Voices on the Air: The Peel Sessions. AllMusic described the first session as \\"a fiery statement of intent\\" and qualified the other performances as \\"excellent\\". The second batch of remasters, concerning the 1982‚Äì1986 era, was issued in April 2009. It included four other reissues (including their highly regarded A Kiss in the Dreamhouse from 1982). The At the BBC box set, containing a DVD with all of the band's UK live television performances and three CDs with in-concert recordings, was also released in June of the same year. In April 2014, their debut single \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" was reissued on double 7-inch vinyl. It was announced that this would be part of a three-year plan with Universal. In late October, their last four studio albums (1987's Through the Looking Glass, 1988's Peepshow, 1991's Superstition and 1995's The Rapture) were reissued on CD in remastered versions with bonus tracks. Siouxsie and Severin curated a compilation CD called It's a Wonderfull Life for the monthly magazine Mojo, issued in September with Siouxsie on the front cover. On this CD, the pair honoured several composers of film music and classical music that had inspired them. In 2015, after releasing another compilation called Spellbound: The Collection, which included singles, album tracks and B-sides, the band reissued 1979's Join Hands on vinyl for Record Store Day, with different cover artwork. A CD box set titled Classic Album Selection Volume One was released in January 2016, containing their first six albums newly remastered by Kevin Metcalfe. Classic Album Selection Volume Two, including the other last six albums, followed in April. A vinyl picture disc edition of The Scream was released in November. A vinyl reissue series on Polydor of all of the band's albums, remastered from the original ¬º\\" tapes in 2018 by Miles Showell and cut at half speed at Abbey Road Studios, began in August with Tinderbox, Juju, Through the Looking Glass and Join Hands. The second batch of vinyl reissues, released in September, included Superstition, A Kiss in the Dreamhouse and The Scream. The third batch, arriving in December, contained The Rapture, Peepshow, Kaleidoscope and Hy√¶na. A blue vinyl edition of The Scream, limited to 1,000 copies, was also released in November for the 40th anniversary of the album, on indie only record stores' websites. In late 2020, their first compilation Once Upon a Time: The Singles was reissued on clear vinyl with poster. Musical style Siouxsie and the Banshees have been described as developing \\"a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation\\". The Times wrote that \\"The Banshees stand proudly [... as] one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\\". With some of their darkest material, the band also helped spawn the gothic scene. The band is also considered a new wave act. They were also one of the first alternative bands; music historian Peter Buckley pointed out that they were at \\"the very front of the alternative-rock scene\\". In 1988, \\"Peek-a-Boo\\" was the very first track to top the US Modern Rock chart after Billboard launched this chart in the first week of September to list the most played songs on alternative and college radio stations. Simon Goddard wrote that the \\"Banshees - Mk II would become one of the biggest alternative pop groups of the 1980s\\". Spin described them as \\"alternative rockers\\" in 1991 when referring to their presence in the top 40 chart. Noting the band's participation in the first Lollapalooza festival, journalist Jim Gerr saw them as one of the \\"elements of the alternative rock community\\". Mojo retrospectively presented them as one of \\"alternative rock's iconic groups\\".  Legacy  Siouxsie and the Banshees have had an impact on many later genres including post-punk, new wave, synth pop, gothic rock, alternative music, shoegazing and trip-hop, influencing a wide range of musicians including Joy Division, the Cure, the Smiths, Depeche Mode, PJ Harvey, Radiohead, Tricky and LCD Soundsystem. Joy Division's Peter Hook, who saw the group in concert in Manchester in 1977, said: \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of our big influences [...] The Banshees first LP was one of my favourite ever records, the way the guitarist and the drummer played was a really unusual way of playing and this album showcases a landmark performance\\". Drummer Stephen Morris said about the Banshees Mk1, their \\"first drummer Kenny Morris played mostly toms\\" and \\"the sound of cymbals was forbidden\\". Joy Division producer Martin Hannett saw a difference between the Banshees' first main lineup and the other bands of 1977: \\"Any harmonies you got were stark, to say the least, except for the odd exception, like Siouxsie. They were interesting\\". The Cure's leader, Robert Smith, declared in 2003: \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something.\\" He also pinpointed what the 1979 Join Hands tour brought him musically. \\"On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing\\". The two songwriters of the Smiths cited the band; singer Morrissey said that \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent\\", and that \\"they were one of the great groups of the late 1970s, early 1980s\\". He also said in 1994, \\"If you study modern groups, those who gain press coverage and chart action, none of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That's not dusty nostalgia, that's fact\\". When asked \\"who do you regret not going to see live\\", guitarist Johnny Marr replied \\"Siouxsie and the Banshees mk 1. But mk 2 were even better\\". Marr mentioned his liking for John McGeoch and his contribution to the single \\"Spellbound\\". Marr qualified it as \\"clever\\" with a \\"really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock'n'roll\\".Mitchell, Pete. \\"Spellbound : the story of John McGeoch\\" BBC2. February 2008.

In December 1981, Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode named the Banshees as one of his three favourite bands along with Sparks and Roxy Music. Gahan later hailed the single \\"Candyman\\" at its release, saying, \\"This is a great Banshees record[...], I like their sound\\". Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain selected \\"Jigsaw Feeling\\" from The Scream as being among his favourite songs. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth cited \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" in his top 25 all-time favourite songs, and Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine also mentioned them as being among his early influences. Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction once noted a parallel between his band and the Banshees: \\"There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane's Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees\\". Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie liked the group's ability to produce pop songs while transmitting something subversive. He said, \\"They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream. We‚Äôre not trying to rip off the Banshees, but that's kind of where we‚Äôre coming from\\". The Banshees have been hailed by other acts. Thom Yorke related that seeing Siouxsie on stage in concert in 1985 inspired him to become a performer.

Syntactically, it is a fairly faithful superset of ALGOL 60, also influenced by the design of Simscript. Simula 67 introduced objects, classes, inheritance and subclasses, virtual procedures, coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and features garbage collection. Also other forms of subtyping (besides inheriting subclasses) were introduced in Simula derivatives. Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. As its name suggests, the first Simula version by 1962 was designed for doing simulations; Simula 67 though was designed to be a general-purpose programming languageKristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl. 1978. The development of the SIMULA languages. History of programming languages. Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 439‚Äì480. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/800025.1198392 and provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today. Simula has been used in a wide range of applications such as simulating very-large-scale integration (VLSI) designs, process modeling, communication protocols, algorithms, and other applications such as typesetting, computer graphics, and education. The influence of Simula is often understated, and Simula-type objects are reimplemented in C++, Object Pascal, Java, C#, and many other languages. Computer scientists such as Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, and James Gosling, creator of Java, have acknowledged Simula as a major influence.  History  The following account is based on Jan Rune Holmevik's historical essay. Kristen Nygaard started writing computer simulation programs in 1957. Nygaard saw a need for a better way to describe the heterogeneity and the operation of a system. To go further with his ideas on a formal computer language for describing a system, Nygaard realized that he needed someone with more computer programming skills than he had. Ole-Johan Dahl joined him on his work January 1962. The decision of linking the language up to ALGOL 60 was made shortly after. By May 1962, the main concepts for a simulation language were set. SIMULA I was born, a special purpose programming language for simulating discrete event systems. Kristen Nygaard was invited to visit the Eckert‚ÄìMauchly Computer Corporation late May 1962 in connection with the marketing of their new UNIVAC 1107 computer. At that visit, Nygaard presented the ideas of Simula to Robert Bemer, the director of systems programming at Univac. Bemer was a great ALGOL fan and found the Simula project compelling. Bemer was also chairperson of a session at the second international conference on information processing hosted by International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP). He invited Nygaard, who presented the paper \\"SIMULA ‚Äì An Extension of ALGOL to the Description of Discrete-Event Networks\\". The Norwegian Computing Center got a UNIVAC 1107 in August 1963 at a considerable discount, on which Dahl implemented the SIMULA I under contract with UNIVAC. The implementation was based on the UNIVAC ALGOL 60 compiler. SIMULA I was fully operational on the UNIVAC 1107 by January 1965. In the following few years, Dahl and Nygaard spent a lot of time teaching Simula. Simula spread to several countries around the world and SIMULA I was later implemented on other computers including the Burroughs B5500 and the Russian Ural-16. In 1966 C. A. R. Hoare introduced the concept of record class construct, which Dahl and Nygaard extended with the concept of prefixing and other features to meet their requirements for a generalized process concept. Dahl and Nygaard presented their paper on Class and Subclass declarations at the IFIP Working Conference on simulation languages in Oslo, May 1967. This paper became the first formal definition of Simula 67. In June 1967, a conference was held to standardize the language and initiate a number of implementations. Dahl proposed to unify the type and the class concept. This led to serious discussions, and the proposal was rejected by the board. Simula 67 was formally standardized on the first meeting of the Simula Standards Group (SSG) in February 1968. Simula was influential in the development of Smalltalk and later object-oriented programming languages. It also helped inspire the actor model of concurrent computation although Simula only supports coroutines and not true concurrency. In the late sixties and the early seventies, there were four main implementations of Simula: * UNIVAC 1100 by Norwegian Computing Center (NCC) * System/360 and System/370 by NCC * CDC 3000 by University of Oslo's Joint Computer Installation at Kjeller * TOPS-10 by Swedish National Defence Research Institute (FOA) These implementations were ported to a wide range of platforms. The TOPS-10 implemented the concept of public, protected, and private member variables and procedures, that later was integrated into Simula 87. Simula 87 is the latest standard and is ported to a wide range of platforms. There are mainly four implementations: * Simula AS * Lund Simula * GNU Cim * Portable Simula Revisited In November 2001, Dahl and Nygaard were awarded the IEEE John von Neumann Medal by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \\"For the introduction of the concepts underlying object- oriented programming through the design and implementation of SIMULA 67\\". In April 2002, they received the 2001 A. M. Turing Award by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), with the citation: \\"For ideas fundamental to the emergence of object oriented programming, through their design of the programming languages Simula I and Simula 67.\\" Unfortunately neither Dahl nor Nygaard could make it to the ACM Turing Award Lecture, scheduled to be delivered at the November 2002 OOPSLA conference in Seattle, as they died in June and August of that year, respectively. Simula Research Laboratory is a research institute named after the Simula language, and Nygaard held a part- time position there from the opening in 2001. The new Computer Science building at the University of Oslo is named Ole Johan Dahl's House, in Dahl's honour, and the main auditorium is named Simula.  Sample code  = Minimal program = The empty computer file is the minimal program in Simula, measured by the size of the source code. It consists of one thing only; a dummy statement. However, the minimal program is more conveniently represented as an empty block: Begin End; It begins executing and immediately terminates. The language lacks any return value from the program. = Classic Hello world = An example of a Hello world program in Simula: Begin OutText (\\"Hello, World!\\"); Outimage; End; Simula is case-insensitive. = Classes, subclasses and virtual procedures = A more realistic example with use of classes, subclasses and virtual procedures: Begin Class Glyph; Virtual: Procedure print Is Procedure print;; Begin End; Glyph Class Char (c); Character c; Begin Procedure print; OutChar(c); End; Glyph Class Line (elements); Ref (Glyph) Array elements; Begin Procedure print; Begin Integer i; For i:= 1 Step 1 Until UpperBound (elements, 1) Do elements (i).print; OutImage; End; End; Ref (Glyph) rg; Ref (Glyph) Array rgs (1 : 4); ! Main program; rgs (1):- New Char ('A'); rgs (2):- New Char ('b'); rgs (3):- New Char ('b'); rgs (4):- New Char ('a'); rg:- New Line (rgs); rg.print; End; The above example has one super class (Glyph) with two subclasses (\`Char\` and \`Line\`). There is one virtual procedure with two implementations. The execution starts by executing the main program. Simula lacks the concept of abstract classes, since classes with pure virtual procedures can be instantiated. This means that in the above example, all classes can be instantiated. Calling a pure virtual procedure will however produce a run-time error. = Call by name = Simula supports call by name so the Jensen's Device can easily be implemented. However, the default transmission mode for simple parameter is call by value, contrary to ALGOL which used call by name. The source code for the Jensen's Device must therefore specify call by name for the parameters when compiled by a Simula compiler. Another much simpler example is the summation function \\\\sum which can be implemented as follows: Real Procedure Sigma (k, m, n, u); Name k, u; Integer k, m, n; Real u; Begin Real s; k:= m; While k <= n Do Begin s:= s + u; k:= k + 1; End; Sigma:= s; End; The above code uses call by name for the controlling variable (k) and the expression (u). This allows the controlling variable to be used in the expression. Note that the Simula standard allows for certain restrictions on the controlling variable in a for loop. The above code therefore uses a while loop for maximum portability. The following: Z = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{100}{1 \\\\over (i + a)^2} can then be implemented as follows: Z:= Sigma (i, 1, 100, 1 / (i + a) ** 2); = Simulation = Simula includes a simulation package for doing discrete event simulations. This simulation package is based on Simula's object-oriented features and its coroutine concept. Sam, Sally, and Andy are shopping for clothes. They must share one fitting room. Each one of them is browsing the store for about 12 minutes and then uses the fitting room exclusively for about three minutes, each following a normal distribution. A simulation of their fitting room experience is as follows: Simulation Begin Class FittingRoom; Begin Ref (Head) door; Boolean inUse; Procedure request; Begin If inUse Then Begin Wait (door); door.First.Out; End; inUse:= True; End; Procedure leave; Begin inUse:= False; Activate door.First; End; door:- New Head; End; Procedure report (message); Text message; Begin OutFix (Time, 2, 0); OutText (\\": \\" & message); OutImage; End; Process Class Person (pname); Text pname; Begin While True Do Begin Hold (Normal (12, 4, u)); report (pname & \\" is requesting the fitting room\\"); fittingroom1.request; report (pname & \\" has entered the fitting room\\"); Hold (Normal (3, 1, u)); fittingroom1.leave; report (pname & \\" has left the fitting room\\"); End; End; Integer u; Ref (FittingRoom) fittingRoom1; fittingRoom1:- New FittingRoom; Activate New Person (\\"Sam\\"); Activate New Person (\\"Sally\\"); Activate New Person (\\"Andy\\"); Hold (100); End; The main block is prefixed with \`Simulation\` for enabling simulation. The simulation package can be used on any block and simulations can even be nested when simulating someone doing simulations. The fitting room object uses a queue (\`door\`) for getting access to the fitting room. When someone requests the fitting room and it's in use they must wait in this queue (\`Wait (door)\`). When someone leaves the fitting room the first one (if any) is released from the queue (\`Activate door.first\`) and accordingly removed from the door queue (\`door.First.Out\`). Person is a subclass of \`Process\` and its activity is described using hold (time for browsing the store and time spent in the fitting room) and calls procedures in the fitting room object for requesting and leaving the fitting room. The main program creates all the objects and activates all the person objects to put them into the event queue. The main program holds for 100 minutes of simulated time before the program terminates.

Farber, Ralph E. Griswold and Ivan P. Polonsky, culminating in SNOBOL4. It was one of a number of text-string-oriented languages developed during the 1950s and 1960s; others included COMIT and TRAC. SNOBOL4 stands apart from most programming languages of its era by having patterns as a first-class data type (i.e. a data type whose values can be manipulated in all ways permitted to any other data type in the programming language) and by providing operators for pattern concatenation and alternation. SNOBOL4 patterns are a type of object and admit various manipulations, much like later object-oriented languages such as JavaScript whose patterns are known as regular expressions. In addition SNOBOL4 strings generated during execution can be treated as programs and either interpreted or compiled and executed (as in the eval function of other languages). SNOBOL4 was quite widely taught in larger US universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s as a text manipulation language in the humanities. In the 1980s and 1990s its use faded as newer languages such as AWK and Perl made string manipulation by means of regular expressions fashionable. SNOBOL4 patterns subsume BNF grammars, which are equivalent to context-free grammars and more powerful than regular expressions.Gimpel, J. F. 1973. A theory of discrete patterns and their implementation in SNOBOL4. Commun. ACM 16, 2 (Feb. 1973), 91-100. DOI=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/361952.361960 The \\"regular expressions\\" in current versions of AWK and Perl are in fact extensions of regular expressions in the traditional sense, but regular expressions, unlike SNOBOL4 patterns, are not recursive, which gives a distinct computational advantage to SNOBOL4 patterns. (Recursive expressions did appear in Perl 5.10, though, released in December 2007.) The later SL5 (1977)Ralph E. Griswold, David R. Hanson, \\"An Overview of SL5\\", SIGPLAN Notices 12:4:40-50 (April 1977) and Icon (1978) languages were designed by Griswold to combine the backtracking of SNOBOL4 pattern matching with more standard ALGOL-like structuring.  Development  = SNOBOL1 = The initial SNOBOL language was created as a tool to be used by its authors to work with the symbolic manipulation of polynomials. It was written in assembly language for the IBM 7090. It had a simple syntax, only one datatype, the string, no functions, and no declarations and very little error control. However, despite its simplicity and its \\"personal\\" nature its use began to spread to other groups. As a result, the authors decided to extend it and tidy it up. = SNOBOL2 = SNOBOL2 did exist but it was a short-lived intermediate development version without user-defined functions and was never released. = SNOBOL3 = They rewrote SNOBOL1 and added functions, both standard and user-defined, and released the result as SNOBOL3. SNOBOL3 became quite popular and was rewritten for other computers than the IBM 7090 by other programmers. As a result, several incompatible dialects arose. = SNOBOL4 = As SNOBOL3 became more popular the authors received more and more requests for extensions to the language. They also began to receive complaints about incompatibility and bugs in versions that they hadn't written. To address this and to take advantage of the new computers being introduced in the late 1960s, the decision was taken to develop SNOBOL4 with many extra datatypes and features but based on a virtual machine to allow improved portability across computers.See Chapter 1 of The Macro Implementation of SNOBOL4 The SNOBOL4 language translator was still written in assembly language. However the macro features of the assembler were used to define the virtual machine instructions of the SNOBOL Implementation Language, the SIL. This very much improved the portability of the language by making it relatively easy to port the virtual machine which hosted the translator by recreating its virtual instructions on any machine which included a macro assembler or indeed a high level language.SNOBOL4 has been implemented using C to recreate the virtual machine instructions. The machine-independent language SIL arose as a generalization of string manipulation macros by Douglas McIlroy, which were used extensively in the initial SNOBOL implementation. In 1969, McIlroy influenced the language again by insisting on addition of the table type to SNOBOL4.  SNOBOL4 features  SNOBOL is distinctive in format and programming style, which are radically different from contemporary procedural languages such as Fortran and Algol. SNOBOL4 supports a number of built-in data types, such as integers and limited precision real numbers, strings, patterns, arrays, and tables (associative arrays), and also allows the programmer to define additional data types and new functions. SNOBOL4's programmer-defined data type facility was advanced at the time--it is similar to the records of the earlier COBOL and the later Pascal programming languages. All SNOBOL command lines are of the form :label subject pattern = object : transfer Each of the five elements is optional. In general, the subject is matched against the pattern. If the object is present, any matched portion is replaced by the object via rules for replacement. The transfer can be an absolute branch or a conditional branch dependent upon the success or failure of the subject evaluation, the pattern evaluation, the pattern match, the object evaluation or the final assignment. It can also be a transfer to code created and compiled by the program itself during a run. A SNOBOL pattern can be very simple or extremely complex. A simple pattern is just a text string (e.g. \\"ABCD\\"), but a complex pattern may be a large structure describing, for example, the complete grammar of a computer language. It is possible to implement a language interpreter in SNOBOL almost directly from a Backus‚ÄìNaur form expression of it, with few changes. Creating a macro assembler and an interpreter for a completely theoretical piece of hardware could take as little as a few hundred lines, with a new instruction being added with a single line. Complex SNOBOL patterns can do things that would be impractical or impossible using the more primitive regular expressions used in most other pattern-matching languages. Some of this power derives from the so-called \\"SPITBOL extensions\\" (which have since been incorporated in basically all modern implementations of the original SNOBOL 4 language too), although it is possible to achieve the same power without them. Part of this power comes from the side effects that it is possible to produce during the pattern matching operation, including saving numerous intermediate/tentative matching results and the ability to invoke user-written functions during the pattern match which can perform nearly any desired processing, and then influence the ongoing direction the interrupted pattern match takes, or even to indeed change the pattern itself during the matching operation. Patterns can be saved like any other first-class data item, and can be concatenated, used within other patterns, and used to create very complex and sophisticated pattern expressions. It is possible to write, for example, a SNOBOL4 pattern which matches \\"a complete name and international postal mailing address\\", which is well beyond anything that is practical to even attempt using regular expressions. SNOBOL4 pattern-matching uses a backtracking algorithm similar to that used in the logic programming language Prolog, which provides pattern-like constructs via DCGs. This algorithm makes it easier to use SNOBOL as a logic programming language than is the case for most languages. SNOBOL stores variables, strings and data structures in a single garbage-collected heap.  Example programs  The \\"Hello, World!\\" program might be as follows... OUTPUT = \\"Hello, World!\\" END A simple program to ask for a user's name and then use it in an output sentence... OUTPUT = \\"What is your name?\\" Username = INPUT OUTPUT = \\"Thank you, \\" Username END To choose between three possible outputs... OUTPUT = \\"What is your name?\\" Username = INPUT Username \\"J\\" :S(LOVE) Username \\"K\\" :S(HATE) MEH OUTPUT = \\"Hi, \\" Username :(END) LOVE OUTPUT = \\"How nice to meet you, \\" Username :(END) HATE OUTPUT = \\"Oh. It's you, \\" Username END To continue requesting input until no more is forthcoming... OUTPUT = \\"This program will ask you for personal names\\" OUTPUT = \\"until you press return without giving it one\\" NameCount = 0 :(GETINPUT) AGAIN NameCount = NameCount + 1 OUTPUT = \\"Name \\" NameCount \\": \\" PersonalName GETINPUT OUTPUT = \\"Please give me name \\" NameCount + 1 PersonalName = INPUT PersonalName LEN(1) :S(AGAIN) OUTPUT = \\"Finished. \\" NameCount \\" names requested.\\" END  Implementations  The classic implementation was on the PDP-10; it has been used to study compilers, formal grammars, and artificial intelligence, especially machine translation and machine comprehension of natural languages. The original implementation was on an IBM 7090 at Bell Labs, Holmdel, N.J. SNOBOL4 was specifically designed for portability; the first implementation was started on an IBM 7094 in 1966 but completed on an IBM 360 in 1967. It was rapidly ported to many other platforms. It is normally implemented as an interpreter because of the difficulty in implementing some of its very high-level features, but there is a compiler, the SPITBOL compiler, which provides nearly all the facilities that the interpreter provides. The Gnat Ada Compiler comes with a package (GNAT.Spitbol) which implements all of the Spitbol string manipulation semantics. This can be called from within an Ada program. The file editor for the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) provided pattern matching based on SNOBOL4 patterns.Introduction to the MTS file editor, University of Michigan Computing Center, 1986. Several implementations are currently available. Macro SNOBOL4 in C written by Phil Budne is a free, open source implementation, capable of running on almost any platform.http://www.snobol4.org/ Catspaw, Inc provided a commercial implementation of the SNOBOL4 language for many different computer platforms, including DOS, Macintosh, Sun, RS/6000, and others, and these implementations are now available free from Catspaw. Minnesota SNOBOL4, by Viktors Berstis, the closest PC implementation to the original IBM mainframe version (even including Fortran-like FORMAT statement support) is also free.http://www.berstis.com/snobol4.htm Although SNOBOL itself has no structured programming features, a SNOBOL preprocessor called Snostorm was designed and implemented during the 1970s by Fred G. Swartz for use under the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) at the University of Michigan.\\"SNOSTORM\\", MTS Volume 9: SNOBOL4 in MTS, Computing Center, University of Michigan, June 1979, pages 99-120. Retrieved 1 September 2014. Snostorm was used at the eight to fifteen sites that ran MTS. It was also available at University College London (UCL) between 1982 and 1984. Snocone by Andrew Koenig adds block-structured constructs to the SNOBOL4 language. Snocone is a self-contained programming language, rather than a proper superset of SNOBOL4.\\"The Snocone Programming Language\\", Andrew Koenig, USENIX (Portland, Oregon), June 1985. Retrieved 2 September 2014. The SPITBOL implementation also introduced a number of features which, while not using traditional structured programming keywords, nevertheless can be used to provide many of the equivalent capabilities normally thought of as \\"structured programming\\", most notably nested if/then/else type constructs. These features have since been added to most recent SNOBOL4 implementations. After many years as a commercial product, in April 2009 SPITBOL was released as free software under the GNU General Public License.

Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion. Statistical mechanics develops the phenomenological results of thermodynamics from a probabilistic examination of the underlying microscopic systems. Historically, one of the first topics in physics where statistical methods were applied was the field of classical mechanics, which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force. Statistical mechanics Statistical mechanics provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life, therefore explaining thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics at the microscopic level. Because of this history, statistical physics is often considered synonymous with statistical mechanics or statistical thermodynamics.This article presents a broader sense of the definition of statistical physics. One of the most important equations in statistical mechanics (akin to F=ma in Newtonian mechanics, or the Schr√∂dinger equation in quantum mechanics) is the definition of the partition function Z, which is essentially a weighted sum of all possible states q available to a system. : Z = \\\\sum_q \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}} where k_B is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature and E(q) is energy of state q. Furthermore, the probability of a given state, q, occurring is given by : P(q) = \\\\frac{ {\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\frac{E(q)}{k_BT}}}}{Z} Here we see that very-high- energy states have little probability of occurring, a result that is consistent with intuition. A statistical approach can work well in classical systems when the number of degrees of freedom (and so the number of variables) is so large that the exact solution is not possible, or not really useful. Statistical mechanics can also describe work in non-linear dynamics, chaos theory, thermal physics, fluid dynamics (particularly at high Knudsen numbers), or plasma physics. =Quantum statistical mechanics= Quantum statistical mechanics is statistical mechanics applied to quantum mechanical systems. In quantum mechanics a statistical ensemble (probability distribution over possible quantum states) is described by a density operator S, which is a non-negative, self-adjoint, trace-class operator of trace 1 on the Hilbert space H describing the quantum system. This can be shown under various mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics. One such formalism is provided by quantum logic. Monte Carlo method Although some problems in statistical physics can be solved analytically using approximations and expansions, most current research utilizes the large processing power of modern computers to simulate or approximate solutions. A common approach to statistical problems is to use a Monte Carlo simulation to yield insight into the properties of a complex system. Monte Carlo methods are important in computational physics, physical chemistry, and related fields, and have diverse applications including medical physics, where they are used to model radiation transport for radiation dosimetry calculations. Scientists and universities A significant contribution (at different times) in development of statistical physics was given by Satyendra Nath Bose, James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, J. Willard Gibbs, Marian Smoluchowski, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Lev Landau, Vladimir Fock, Werner Heisenberg, Nikolay Bogolyubov, Benjamin Widom, Lars Onsager, and others. Statistical physics is studied in the nuclear center at Los Alamos. Also, Pentagon has organized a large department for the study of turbulence at Princeton University. Work in this area is also being conducted by Saclay (Paris), Max Planck Institute, Netherlands Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics and other research centers. Achievements Statistical physics allowed us to explain and quantitatively describe superconductivity, superfluidity, turbulence, collective phenomena in solids and plasma, and the structural features of liquid. It underlies the modern astrophysics. It is statistical physics that helped us to create such intensively developing study of liquid crystals and to construct a theory of phase transition and critical phenomena. Many experimental studies of matter are entirely based on the statistical description of a system. These include the scattering of cold neutrons, X-ray, visible light, and more. Statistical physics plays a major role in Physics of Solid State Physics, Materials Science, Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics, Chemistry, Biology and Medicine (e.g. study of the spread of infectious diseases), Information Theory and Technique but also in those areas of technology owing to their development in the evolution of Modern Physics. It still has important applications in theoretical sciences such as Sociology and Linguistics and is useful for researchers in higher education, corporate governance, and industry.

State data updated \\"outside\\" of the operation may be maintained \\"inside\\" a stateful object or a wider stateful system within which the operation is performed. Example side effects include modifying a non-local variable, modifying a static local variable, modifying a mutable argument passed by reference, performing I/O or calling other side-effect functions. In the presence of side effects, a program's behaviour may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the context and its possible histories.‚ÄúResearch Topics in Functional Programming‚Äù ed. D. Turner, Addison-Wesley, 1990, pp 17‚Äì42. Retrieved from: The degree to which side effects are used depends on the programming paradigm. Imperative programming is commonly used to produce side effects, to update a system's state. By contrast, Declarative programming is commonly used to report on the state of system, without side effects. In functional programming, side effects are rarely used. The lack of side effects makes it easier to do formal verifications of a program. Functional languages such as Standard ML, Scheme and Scala do not restrict side effects, but it is customary for programmers to avoid them.Matthias Felleisen et al., How To Design Programs, MIT Press The functional language Haskell expresses side effects such as I/O and other stateful computations using monadic actions.Haskell 98 report, http://www.haskell.org.Imperative Functional Programming, Simon Peyton Jones and Phil Wadler, Conference Record of the 20th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, pages 71-84, 1993 Assembly language programmers must be aware of hidden side effects‚Äîinstructions that modify parts of the processor state which are not mentioned in the instruction's mnemonic. A classic example of a hidden side effect is an arithmetic instruction that implicitly modifies condition codes (a hidden side effect) while it explicitly modifies a register (the overt effect). One potential drawback of an instruction set with hidden side effects is that, if many instructions have side effects on a single piece of state, like condition codes, then the logic required to update that state sequentially may become a performance bottleneck. The problem is particularly acute on some processors designed with pipelining (since 1990) or with out-of- order execution. Such a processor may require additional control circuitry to detect hidden side effects and stall the pipeline if the next instruction depends on the results of those effects.  Referential transparency  Absence of side effects is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for referential transparency. Referential transparency means that an expression (such as a function call) can be replaced with its value. This requires that the expression is pure, that is to say the expression must be deterministic (always give the same value for the same input) and side-effect free.  Temporal side effects  Side effects caused by the time taken for an operation to execute are usually ignored when discussing side effects and referential transparency. There are some cases, such as with hardware timing or testing, where operations are inserted specifically for their temporal side effects e.g. \`sleep(5000)\` or \`for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {}\`. These instructions do not change state other than taking an amount of time to complete.  Idempotence  A function \`f\` with side effects is said to be idempotent under sequential composition \`f; f\` if, when called twice with the same list of arguments, the second call has no side effects (assuming no other procedures were called between the end of the first call and the start of the second call). For instance, consider the following Python code: x = 0 def setx(n): global x x = n setx(5) setx(5) Here, \`setx\` is idempotent because the second call to \`setx\` (with the same argument) does not change the visible program state: \`x\` was already set to 5 in the first call, and is again set to 5 in the second call, thus keeping the same value. Note that this is distinct from idempotence under function composition \`f ‚àò f\`. For example, the absolute value is idempotent under function composition: def abs(n): if n < 0: return -n else: return n abs(-5)  abs(abs(-5))  abs(5)  5  Example  One common demonstration of side effect behavior is that of the assignment operator in C++. For example, assignment returns the right operand and has the side effect of assigning that value to a variable. This allows for syntactically clean multiple assignment: int i, j; i = j = 3; Because the operator right associates, this equates to int i, j; i = (j = 3); // j = 3 returns 3, which then gets assigned to i Where the result of assigning 3 into \`j\` then gets assigned into \`i\`. This presents a potential hangup for novice programmers who may confuse while (b  10) {} // tests if b evaluates to 10 with while (b = 10) {} // = returns 10 which automatically casts to true so the test is always true  See also  * Sequence point * Action at a distance (computer science) * Don't-care term * Side channel * Side channel attack  References  Category:Computer programming Category:Programming language theory Category:Functional programming Category:Articles with example code ","title":"Side effect (computer science)"},{"id":"29523","text":"This is a list of science fiction editors, editors working for book and magazine publishing companies who have edited science fiction.

They are typically depicted as antagonists to the X-Men. The Sentinels played a large role in the 1990s X-Men animated series and have been featured in several X-Men video games. The Sentinels are featured prominently in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past while simulated versions made brief appearances in the 2006 film X-Men: The Last Stand and the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse. In 2009, The Sentinels was ranked as IGN's 38th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. Publication history The X-Men #14 (November 1965). Art by Jack Kirby. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, they first appeared in The X-Men #14 (November 1965). Sentinels are programmed to locate mutants and capture or kill them. Though several types of Sentinels have been introduced, the typical Sentinel is three stories tall, is capable of flight, projects energy blasts, and can detect mutants. Pursuing genocide as the means of dealing with a threat has made the Sentinels an analogy for racial hatred in Marvel stories. Characteristics Sentinels are designed to hunt mutants. While many are capable of tactical thought, only a handful are self-aware. Sentinels are technologically advanced, and have exhibited a wide variety of abilities. They are armed (primarily with energy weapons and restraining devices), capable of flight, and can detect mutants at long range. They possess vast physical strength, and their bodies are highly resistant to damage. Some are able to alter their physical forms or re-assemble and reactivate themselves after they have been destroyed. Some Sentinel variants have the ability to learn from their experiences, developing their defenses during an engagement. Several groups of Sentinels have been created and/or led by a single massive Sentinel called Master Mold. Some Sentinels are also equipped with an inconspicuous logic loop in case they should go rogue to convince them that they are mutants as demonstrated in the Tri-Sentinel. Types of Sentinels Sentinels in Astonishing X-Men vol. 3, #1 (July 2004). Art by John Cassaday. There are different types of Sentinels that appear in the comics: * Mark I and Master Mold - Created by Bolivar Trask. First appeared in X-Men (vol. 1) #14. Bolivar Trask sacrificed himself to destroy the Master Mold. * Mark II - Created by Larry Trask. This model was capable of adapting to and counteracting superpowers almost instantly. First appeared in X-Men (vol. 1) #57. **No.2, the robotic leader of Larry's Sentinels, later \\"mutated\\" with the capability of creating space warps.The Avengers #102 & 104 * Composite - Created by merging the remaining portions of five Sentinels destroyed by the X-Men and came under control of Ashley Martin. It was destroyed by her when it rebelled against her. * Mark III - Created by Stephen Lang and Project: Armageddon, secretly funded by Edward Buckman and the Council of the Chosen. First appeared in X-Men (vol. 1) #98. ** X-Sentinels - Created by Stephen Lang. They are androids who were duplicates of the original X-Men. First appeared in X-Men (vol. 1) #99. * Mark IV - Created by Sebastian Shaw. First appeared in X-Men (vol. 1) #151. * Mark V - Created by Sebastian Shaw for U.S. government's Project Wideawake. First appeared in New Mutants (vol. 1) #2. * Mark VI - Created by Shaw Industries for Project Wideawake and used by Onslaught. Also incorporated parts of Project Nimrod. * Mark VII - Created by Shaw Industries. They were experimental and remote controlled. * Nimrod (later Bastion) - A prototype Super Sentinel that arrived from the \\"Days of Future Past\\" timeline and was later reactivated by Reverend William Stryker. ** Project Nimrod - Created by an offshoot of Project Wideawake and was in the experimental stage, Project Nimrod was actually a self-awareness program that Nimrod implanted before its demise into the base's military computer cybernet, the program served as a sleeper virus that awaited the opportunity to access a Sentinel development program so it could use it to re-create Nimrod itself. Cancelled after X-Force interfered. * Prime Sentinels - Created by Bastion and Operation: Zero Tolerance. They were at first disabled humans infected with Nano-Sentinel technology at Prospero Clinic under the believe that they were being equipped with cybernetic nanotech implants to replace their lost limbs. Unbeknownst to many of them, they became sleeper agents for Operation: Zero Tolerance, as they would, upon activation by a mutant attack or near the presence of one, transformed into armored beings with powerful weapons systems. ** Omega Prime Sentinels - The second generation of Prime Sentinels. Often simply called Omega Sentinels, their nanotechnology is far afield's in advancement to their brethren. Omega's have an 8 step cycle of transformation they undergo before transmuting from full organic to complete machine entities; which are Infection, Nesting, Replication, Dormancy, Activation, Union, Adaptation and finally Omega.House of X #3 Karima Shapandar is one of them. * Wild Sentinels - Built in secret by a new Master Mold in Ecuador, activated by Donald Trask III and used by Cassandra Nova. New units are produced based on the currently available resources ‚Äì salvaged parts, weapons and sometimes even entire vehicles ‚Äì which give this particular type of Sentinel a very diverse, rag-tag appearance. Due to both this and their design flexibility, a wide variety of different shapes and forms have been observed. The Mega-Sentinels used to destroy Genosha and Nanosentinels both belong to this kind of Sentinel. The technology used in Nano-Sentinels is also employed by Weapon Plus for their artificial evolution experiments and the creation of their Super-Sentinels. * Mark VIII - Sentinel Squad O*N*E, designed by Stark Enterprises. Unlike other Sentinels, the Mark VIII requires a human pilot. ** T.O. Sentinels - An intended upgrade to the Squad O*N*E sentinels conceived of by director Robert Callahan, who sought to use techno-organic substance to increase the effectiveness of his Sentinel program.Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 #9-10 Failing in his first attempt he would get a second chance after obtaining the Warlock infected New Mutants to use as experimental fodder for further technoforming augmentation to his Sentinel Squad Armor unit.New Mutants: Dead Souls #6Uncanny X-Men vol. 5 #19 * Bio-Sentinels - Human mutant corpse infected by a technological virus created by Kaga,Astonishing X-Men Vol. 3 #31 They come with the innate capacity of weaponizing bio-technological apparati such as Brood designed missiles as a means of offense.Astonishing X-Men Vol. 3 #32 * Stark Sentinels - The Stark Sentinels debuted during the AXIS storyline. Under the influence of the Red Skull (who also had erased from him any memory of their construction), Tony Stark created a model of Adamantium constructed Sentinels outfitted with Pym Particle technology with databases withholding knowledge of different super heroes he acquired after the 1st Civil War storyline.Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #1 When Red Skull became the Red Onslaught, and the Avengers arrived to Genosha to stop him, he deployed the Stark Sentinels.Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #3 * Mother Mold - A self- aware and capable of adaptation Master Mold variant head designed to create \\"Master Molds\\" which in turn create Sentinels. Built in secrecy near the sun by a human group called Project Orchis which is made up of various members of human organizations such as A.I.M., S.H.I.E.L.D., Hydra, Alpha Flight and others, once coming online, Mother Mold will lead directly to the creation of Nimrod, the ultimate nanotechnological Sentinel form.Powers of X #2 =Related mutant-hunting creations= The X-Men battle Sentinels in X-Men: Schism #1 (July 2011). Art by Carlos Pacheco and Cam Smith. * Tri-Sentinel - A giant- sized, six-armed, three-faced combination of three fairly standard Sentinels (created by Shaw Industries) bonded together by Loki as retribution for losing the Acts of Vengeance ploy, and defeated by Spider-Man at the peak of his cosmic (Captain Universe) powers. Later revived by The Life Foundation, only to be destroyed again by Spider-Man and Nova. Mendel Stromm later obtained another one from the bunker of the bankrupt Life Foundation and was later approached by a mysterious benefactor who prepared to give him a Master Mold that specializes in creating Tri-Sentinels. * Soviet Sentinels - Created by the Soviet Union and later purchased by Cuban government officials.Mystique #3-6 * Super-Sentinels - Using Nano-Sentinel technology, Weapon Plus created artificially evolved superhumans at The World. Three of the creations were chosen to form the mutant-hunting Super-Sentinels: Huntsman, Fantomex and Ultimaton, who were intended to be presented to the public as superheroes in order to make the extermination of mutantkind look \\"like a Saturday morning cartoon\\". * Colcord's Sentinels - Some of the Boxbots created by Madison Jeffries (aka Box) to serve the Weapon X Program, run by Malcolm Colcord. In one variation of the Days of Future Past timeline seen in the Weapon X: Days of Future Now limited series, one of the Boxbots evolves into a new Master Mold and a new breed of Sentinels. * Hardaway - A cyborg created at Camp Hayden, killed by the Mutant Liberation Front, who called himself a Bio- Sentinel. * X-51 (Machine Man) - Captured by Bastion and \\"infected\\" with Prime Sentinel nano-bots which reconfigured and reconstructed his systems thereby giving him similar capabilities to Nimrod,Cable and Machine Man Annual Vol 1 1998Machine Man & Bastion Annual Vol 1 1998 #3 such as adapting to almost any situation and programming that at times forced him to attack mutants.X-51 Vol 1 1999 #1-2 * Juston Seyfert's Sentinel: First appearing in Sentinel #1, this is a rebuilt Sentinel (likely a Mark V or Mark VI), reprogrammed to obey Juston Seyfert. Initially, Seyfert controlled the Sentinel by riding on its shoulder; he now has built a cockpit into it. Seyfert and his Sentinel are former members of Avengers Academy and featured in Avengers Arena. * Sentinaughts - One of the types of sentient robots who live in the free robot city of The Core,Secret Avengers vol. 1 #26 Sentinaughts are apparently based on the Sentinel design. They vary in size from roughly human to the large stature of traditional Sentinels. * Nano-Sentinel - Microscopic sentinel type of tech created by Cassandra Nova and implemented in various ways by other users.New X-Men #123 Moving within the body and attaching themselves to the brains of humans and mutants alike, turning them into mutant-hating assault drones with no self control. Ready to take down any mutant who so much as looks at them.X-Men: Red #5 ** and unknown form of human made sentinels created by Simon Trask using a nanite based Sentinel Tech virus. The victims become anti-mutant activists who later, at Trask's command, are fully transformed into lifeless robotic Sentinels mindlessly following Trask's orders.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 1 #500 * Adamantium Cyborgs - Near-fully mechanical mutant hunter killers refitted by Weapon X with the titular metal as an endoskeleton using sentinel based nanotech. Coming in numerous alphabetical categorical batches, these bionic weapons can shed their skin revealing a murderous automaton with the abilities of various X-Men heroes & villains integrated into them.Weapon X Vol. 3 #1 * Core/Central Command - A biotech Master Mold variant behind the design parameters of the new Prime Sentinel's.Uncanny X-Men vol. 4 #15 Other versions The following are alternative versions of the Sentinels, which appear outside of regular Marvel canon. =Age of Apocalypse= In the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" timeline, Bolivar Trask created the Sentinels with his wife Moira. These Sentinels are equipped with several body-mounted gun turrets, and their primary directive is to protect humans rather than to hunt mutants. They are capable of cooperating with mutants in order to further this mission.Amazing X-Men #2 Later, the Sentinels are adapted by Weapon Omega to serve a reverse purpose, and now aid in the hunting of the human race.Uncanny X-Force #11 =Days of Future Past= In the \\"Days of Future Past\\" timeline, which takes place in an alternate future, the \\"Omega Sentinels\\" have advanced technologically and become the de facto rulers of the United States. The most powerful among them is Nimrod. =Hembeck= In the joke comic Fred Hembeck Destroys the Marvel Universe, the X-Men are killed by silent, black, man-sized \\"Ninja Sentinels\\". =Here Comes Tomorrow= In the \\"Here Comes Tomorrow\\" future timeline, a Sentinel named Rover is Tom Skylark's companion and protector. After more than 150 years of being active, Rover has become self-aware and, possibly, capable of emotion. =House of M= In the House of M storyline, Magneto is victorious in a mutant/human war. The Sentinels are adapted by Sebastian Shaw, now the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., to serve a reverse purpose, and now aid in the hunting of sapien rebels. =MC2= In the MC2 timeline, Wild Thing encounters a Prime Sentinel that has accidentally been activated by a faulty microwave. =Ronin= In the alternate reality of X-Men: Ronin, the story is played out in Japan. A police unit called \\"Sentinel Force\\" designs, builds and pilots the robots. These are aesthetically similar to regular Sentinels, but each is subtly different from the others. =Star Trek= In the comic crossover X-Men/Star Trek: Second Contact, the X-Men work with the crew of the Enterprise-E to battle Kang the Conqueror. An away team composed of Captain Picard, Deanna Troi, Nightcrawler and Colossus encounter an approximation of the \\"Days of Future Past\\" timeline, in which the Sentinels have merged with the Borg. =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Sentinels were created by Bolivar Trask, were already in action in the Ultimate X-Men story arc, hunting down and killing mutants on the streets, in a program apparently openly and publicly acknowledged by the U.S. government. Later on, there were also the New Sentinels that were sixty of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top agents in Sentinel battle armor and they were described to have enough hardware to take on a fleet of the old Sentinel models. A new breed of Sentinel robots, created by Trask under the Fenris twins' orders, was later created. After the events of the Ultimatum Wave, Nimrod Sentinels was deployed to hunt, capture or kill mutants that refused to turn themselves in. William Stryker, Jr., using Sentinel tech, later displayed an ability to summon a fleet of Sentinels after being attacked by the Shroud.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #3-4 =What If?= * In What If... Starring Cannonball's little brother Josh‚Äîand his pet Sentinel\\", shows Josh (who would, in normal continuity, later become Icarus) finding and adopting a Sentinel.What If? (vol. 2) #92 * In \\"What if... Starring Secret Wars: 25 Years Later\\", the children of Marvel heroes are teleported back to Earth where, sometime in the last 25 years, a variation of \\"Days of Future Past\\" is shown when the group is attacked by Sentinels.What If? (vol. 2) #114 * In \\"What if... Starring Juggernaut: The Kingdom of Cain\\", Juggernaut has killed the X-Men, and as a result there is no one to oppose the Sentinels, so the world is ravaged by them until they are destroyed by Juggernaut.What If? (vol. 2) #94 In other media =Television= * A Sentinel appeared in Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends. In the episode \\"A Firestar Is Born\\", Its seen in a flashback, fighting the X-Men back when Firestar was a member. * The Sentinels appeared a number of times on the X-Men animated series, voiced by David Fox. They were season one's main antagonists. The Sentinels first hunt down Jubilee. The Sentinel program, controlled by Bolivar Trask and Henry Peter Gyrich, was cancelled but was moved overseas to Genosha. Master Mold was constructed as the Sentinels' leader/mass-production while on Genosha, but it was apparently destroyed when Storm flooded the complex. Sentinels are later seen in Bishop's future timeline where they had taken over the world and mutants were on the verge of extinction. In the season one finale, the Sentinels, acting under Trask's orders, rescued Senator Robert Kelly from Magneto, but Master Mold was then \\"giving the orders now\\" in Trask's and Gyrich's secret base in the United States. As Master Mold plans to kidnap world leaders from around the world and replace their brains with computers so that the world would fall under its control, the X-Men managed to fight through a seemingly endless wave of Sentinels until Professor X flew the explosive-filled Blackbird into Master Mold and escaped at the last minute with Magneto's help. However, the Sentinels had sporadic appearances in season four. * The Sentinels appeared in Spider-Man: The Animated Series. In the episode \\"The Mutant Agenda\\", they are seen in a simulation when Spider-Man accidentally activated the Danger Room when visiting the X-Mansion. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men: Evolution. This version is much more powerful and heavily armed than their comic book counterparts. There was originally only a prototype created by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Bolivar Trask, however, released in public by Magneto to force the X-Men to fight the prototype and reveal mutant existence to the media. The prototype alone was a dangerous challenge, even for the combined might of the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. Three upgraded models are later used by S.H.I.E.L.D. against Apocalypse and prove a difficult fight for the ancient mutant. Professor X's future visions in the series finale hinted at Nimrod appearing later in the show's timeline leading a fleet of Sentinels. * Sentinels appear in the Wolverine and the X-Men animated series, voiced by Jim Ward. There are several types: Sentinel Prowler, the Mark I Sentinel, a more futuristic Sentinel, and Sentinel Hounds. The Sentinels are controlled by Master Mold. * Sentinels appear in The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Tom Kenny. This version were created in an alternate reality's future to defend a superhero-less city. They are seen in the episode \\"Days, Nights and Weekends of Future Past! (Six Against Infinity Part 2)\\". * A Sentinel appeared in a Danger Room simulation in Marvel Anime: X-Men. * A Sentinel appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series. In the episode \\"Game Over\\", a Sentinel is included in Arcade's Madland game which Spider-Man takes control of, using its firepower to cheat through one of Arcade's levels. * A Sentinel appears in the Toei anime series Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers. * The Gifted television series, which is connected to the X-Men cinematic universe, features a modern-day government agency called Sentinel Services under the control of Agents Jace Turner and Edward Weeks. After failing to capture the Mutant Underground, and Weeks is killed by Esme Frost, the determined Turner quit Sentinel Services. Turner allied with Trask Industries (the Sentinels' creator) under Dr. Roderick Campbell is revealed to have been responsible for the Hound Program, which reprograms mutants. Sentinels in this universe are small spider-like robots with a rotating red eye in the center. They are extremely durable and can withstand intense physical assaults and intense heat, capable of quickly adapting to damage to continue functioning. They capture mutants by latching onto them with immense grip, even Thunderbird could not break free from a Sentinel until the mutant Eclipse assisted with an intense heat blast and even then the Sentinel continued to function and hunt them. With their spider-like design, they can crawl and maneuver on walls and ceilings. =Films= The Sentinels as they appear in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014); the Mark I model in 1973 (left) and the Mark X model in 2023 (right) * The Sentinels were originally to appear in X-Men (2000). In an early draft written by Andrew Kevin Walker and turned in during June 1994, Henry Gyrich and Bolivar Trask use three 8 feet (2.4 m) tall Sentinels to attack the X-Men. Following a rewrite by Laeta Kalogridis, as well as various other rewrites and new scripts, the Sentinels were eventually dropped from the film. * A Sentinel was seen in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). During a training simulation for the mutants at Professor X's school, Colossus throws Wolverine at the robot which results in its beheading; the Sentinel's body is shrouded in fog with the only part ever made visible to the viewer is a severed head. * The Sentinels are featured in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) as a secondary threat to mutants. In 1973, Bolivar Trask pitches the Sentinel concept to the US Congress but declines so Trask attempts pitching to foreign powers. Mystique hunts down and kills Trask in revenge for the murder of mutants that were experimented on during the Sentinels' conception to accelerate research and is captured soon after. Inspired by the fear of Trask's death, the US government approves the Sentinel program, and experimentation on Mystique captured soon after Trask's murder leads to the creation of Sentinels that can adapt to and use mutant powers. The Sentinels eventually expand their targets beyond mutants to baseline humans based on the logic to have the potential to produce mutant descendants, culminating in a dystopian future where most of humanity and mutantkind have been wiped out. With Kitty Pryde's new ability to project the minds of others into their past selves, the X-Men project Wolverine - the only person capable of surviving the time-travel's psychological strain - back into his own past version in 1973 to rally the younger versions of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr to stop Trask's assassination, setting into motion the film's events. The storyline concludes with Mystique defeating Magneto and then deciding not to kill Trask on Xavier's and Beast's encouragement, resulting in the government witnessing clear evidence that not all mutants are a threat to normal humans and deciding to abandon the Sentinel program. The original prototypes from 1973 were similar in appearance to their comic counterparts being three times the size of a human, possessed gatling guns on one arm capable of firing 3000 rounds per minute, sensors that allow to track X-Gene carriers and could fly using the vent-like systems on their chest, and were built out of a space-age polymer to be immune to Magneto's powers to which Magneto infuses the prototypes with metal bars to control in the film's climax. In contrast, the future iterations were smaller and sleeker, with a body built out of adaptive mechanical scales, and has Mystique's adaptive powers which can reshape their hands into stabbing blades. The Sentinels were designed by Legacy Effects with Digital Domain building digital models based on their full-scale practical model while the future variant were all computer graphics made by Moving Picture Company. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). After Apocalypse's defeat, the 1973 versions were used when the new X-Men team begin a training simulation. =Video games= Sentinels have appeared as major antagonists in almost every video game to feature the X-Men: * The Sentinels appeared in the X-Men arcade game as the bulk of enemies. * The Sentinels were featured as enemies in Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge in Cyclops' levels. * The Sentinels appear as bosses in X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse in Genosha with varying sizes. * A robot resembling a Sentinel also appears in both the arcade and SNES versions of Captain America and the Avengers; it is not called a Sentinel, but instead is referred to simply as Robot. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men 2: Clone Wars in the second level (the first level after the title screen) as it is set in a high-tech factory that produces Sentinels.Sentinel (right) fighting Wolverine in the 1994's X-Men: Children of the Atom. * A non-standard 10' tall Sentinel is a playable character in X-Men: Children of the Atom, made another appearance as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, and was also featured as a secret partner assist in Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men: Mutant Academy in Cyclops's intro. They hunt for mutants in the streets of New York City. One nearly kills a baby by stepping on it, but Cyclops tears off one of its legs, making the robot fall. * The Sentinels are seen in X-Men: Mutant Academy 2 in Cyclops/Spider- Man's level. They are shown in the background, patrolling the skies of New York City, hunting for mutants. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men: Next Dimension. A male Prime Sentinel and a female Prime Sentinel are both available as playable characters. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men Legends as the primary antagonists (voiced by Scott MacDonald. There are several versions in this game: ** Sentinel Alpha uses rockets, gas, stomp, and a palm beam ** A Sentinel with rockets, eye beams, stomp, and a bomb (this version has shoulder pads like Sentinel Squad ONE) ** A Sentinel Controller with eye beams, stomp, an enhanced version of the palm beam, rockets, and a wave that nullifies mutant powers (this version has a blue head and its body is blue and purple) ** A Sentinel Weapons Platform in the shape of a purple spider with green blasters, which can bash and use a green wave that reverses the controls ** A Sentinel Advanced (based on the Prime Sentinel) with freeze beam, orange blasters, punch, groundquake (with fist), and a rush. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse, assisting with the evacuation after Apocalypse devastates New York City. Bastion later turns the Sentinels on the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. After Bastion is defeated, the Sentinels resume their evacuation duties. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men: The Official Game as part of William Stryker's back-up plan to eliminate all mutants. Stryker would have the mutant-hunting robots track down and kill all mutants they could find. The Sentinels featured in the game appear to be similar to those from X-Men: Children of the Atom. There are two types of Sentinels: one is a smaller, aerial model, and the other is a giant walking behemoth. * The Sentinels appear in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

It is a tropical preserve hidden in Antarctica. It has appeared in many story arcs in Uncanny X-Men as well as related books. Publication history The Savage Land first appeared as The Land Where Time Stands Still in Marvel Mystery Comics #22 (August 1941), in the tale \\"Khor, the Black Sorcerer\\" by Joe Simon, Jack Kirby, and Syd Shores. It gained its familiar form and moniker in X-Men #10 (March 1965) courtesy of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional history The Savage Land was created by the alien Nuwali at the behest of the other-dimensional, nigh-omnipotent aliens known as the Beyonders who sought to observe the process of evolution under relatively controlled conditions and had the Nuwali set up a number of game preserves on several planets. One of these planets was Earth during the Triassic period where the Nuwali chose a valley in Antarctica surrounded by active volcanoes, where they installed a number of advanced technological devices in order to maintain a tropical climate. The aliens then stocked the area with all manner of Earth life over the following several millennia. They also brought over the Man-Apes, earlier hominid ancestors of Homo sapiens. The Beyonders eventually grew bored with the experiment, and the Nuwali stopped maintaining the Savage Land during the Late Pleistocene (the Ice Age era). However, the self- maintaining technology that allowed the pocket of tropical climate was left running, and many species which became extinct in other areas of the Earth continued to thrive within the Savage Land. Later on, a group of human survivors from Atlantis sailed to Antarctica before the \\"Great Cataclysm\\" which sank Atlantis into the ocean. There, they discovered a cavern where they found an immense climate-controlling device and harnessed the technology used to keep the Savage Land's volcanoes working. They named their location \\"Pangea\\", which is Atlantean for \\"paradise\\". They mastered genetic engineering, which had been used on the Man-Apes when the Nuwali were still maintaining the Savage Land area. They used their genetic engineering techniques to transform other Savage Land inhabitants like the Golden People, the Lizard Men, the Reptile Men, the Tubantis, and others. The Atlanteans then forced them to work for them until these animal people revolted. After a time of war, the animal people demanded civil rights and the Atlanteans used technology to expand the Savage Land's surface area for the animal people to live in. When the Great Cataclysm struck, the Atlantean empire fell and thanks to the machines, the Savage Land locations were spared from sinking into the sea. In more recent years, the Savage Land was rediscovered by Lord Robert Plunder, who took back a sample of the metal known as \\"anti-metal\\" or \\"Antarctic vibranium\\" with him. This mysterious metal had the ability to produce vibrations which would liquefy all other metals. Fleeing from those who sought to steal this discovery, Plunder took his eldest son Kevin with him for a second trip into the Savage Land. Unfortunately, the elder Plunder was killed by a local tribe of Man-Apes. Kevin survived, thanks to the timely intervention of the orphaned sabretooth tiger later known as Zabu. He grew to adulthood in the Savage Land, becoming the adventurer known as Ka-Zar. Ka-Zar had many team-ups with the X-Men, who first revealed the Savage Land's existence, Spider-Man, and many other superheroes who had visited the Savage Land. He later met and married Shanna the She-Devil. The Savage Land's existence is common knowledge throughout the world. At one time, there were press junkets, sponsored by the oil company Roxxon. Daily Bugle photographer Peter Parker was sent and helped uncover Roxxon's unethical and dangerous manipulation of the local resources. At one point, Spider-Man teamed up with Ka-Zar to save Gwen Stacy from Kraven the Hunter and Gog at the time when her class and J. Jonah Jameson were visiting the Savage Land.Amazing Spider-Man #103-104. Marvel Comics. Many villains have threatened the Savage Land, including Sauron, Garokk, Magneto, and Thanos. The Savage Land was decimated by an evil alien named Terminus (or one of his pawns) when he destroyed the machines that maintained the tropical climate. Many of the Savage Land's native people were saved from the ensuing destruction by M'rin: The Warlord of The Skies who took them into her own native dimension to safety. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu wandered until the High Evolutionary (with help from the X-Men, M'rin, and Garokk) restored the region and its creatures, allowing them to return to the Savage Land with their newborn son. The other natives who had taken refuge in M'rin's dimension returned as well.Avengers #257. Marvel Comics.

The team only survived thanks to Iron Man's force field. The Savage Land is featured in the limited series Claws, serving as a place of revenge for Wolverine and Black Cat on Arcade and White Rabbit.

Although the Sun People were depicted as green-skinned in Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #19 (December 1987), they are in fact indistinguishable from ordinary Caucasians (see Zaladane). The cited Handbook entry in fact erroneously depicted a Sheenarian, member of an extradimensional race who once invaded the Savage Land (first seen in Ka-Zar: Lord of the Hidden Jungle #14). During the \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline, the Sun People were depicted among Ka-Zar's allies in his fight against the Skrulls, presumably as a result of the aforementioned error being used as reference. * Swamp Men ‚Äì The Swamp Men are humanoids covered head to toe in hair that live in the swamplands of the Savage Land.

Marvel Comics. * Tree People ‚Äì The Tree People are a race that looks much like humans though they have long, prehensile monkey-like tails. They live in Botor (a treetop village in Pangea) and are a hunter-gatherer society. Shanna the She-Devil was briefly married to one of the Tree People named Mele. During the \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline, some of the Tree People joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #13. Marvel Comics. * Tribe of Fire ‚Äì The Tribe of Fire is a tribe of humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society. Some of the tribe members were used in an experiment conducted by an Apocalypse robot until it was destroyed by Wolverine. The cyborgs from these experiments joined the Tribe of Fire.Wolverine: Jungle Adventures #1. Marvel Comics. * Tubanti ‚Äì The Tubantis are a race of fish people that dwell in Pangea's inland Gorahn Sea. They briefly served the demon Belasco when he tried to conquer the Savage Land. The Tubantis are allies with the Lemurans and the other races of the Savage Land.Ka-Zar Vol. 3 #30. Marvel Comics. * Uruburians ‚Äì The Uruburians are a race of unspecified humanoid beasts with fangs that live in the Savage Land as a hunter-gatherer tribe. The Uruburians are long-time enemies of the Gorankians. Ka-Zar helped settle their dispute by having them play different games which includes baseball in order to prevent an all-out war. * Waidians ‚Äì The Waidians are a race of green-skinned Saurians that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society and are very peaceful. When Ka-Zar was a teenager, he was trained by the wise Waidian sage named Benazu. * Water People ‚Äì The Water People are a tribe of humans that live in the Savage Land. They are a hunter-gatherer society that live close to the rivers where they survive by fishing.X-Men #62. Marvel Comics. * Zebra People ‚Äì The Zebra People are swamp dwellers and are also known as the Swamp Tribe. They are a racially integrated society made of up both white and black people, who wear makeup over their body in the form of zebra-like stripes. White Zebra People wear black stripes and black Zebra People wear white stripes. The Zebra People are known to ride dinosaurs that they have domesticated. During the \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline, some of the Zebra People joined Ka-Zar in his fight against the Skrulls.Ka-Zar Vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics. ** Lizard People ‚Äì There is also a rogue faction of the Zebra People called the Lizard People which wore reptilian armor and worked for Zaur and Sheeas the Witch. Zaur and those that were members of the Lizard People returned to the Zebra People after the death of Sheeas the Witch. Of course some of them may have preserved the traditions of the Lizard People. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse reality, the Savage Land houses Avalon, a secret haven for humans and mutants. A method to reach it exists, but it will only cost the refugee everything they own and even then, there is no guarantee of arriving alive. It is led by Destiny, a pacifist Juggernaut and Douglas Ramsey, the latter of whom provides a field that allows everybody to understand each other despite speaking different languages. Avalon was eventually found by Apocalypse forces and destroyed by the Shadow King who mind-controlled its inhabitants into killing each other. He was defeated, but casualties were high. =Age of Ultron= During the \\"Age of Ultron\\" storyline, the superhero resistance against Ultron had relocated to the Savage Land to come up with a plan to defeat Ultron.Age of Ultron #4. Marvel Comics. =Marvel Zombies Return= In Marvel Zombies Return, the Savage Land, like everywhere else on Earth, has been eaten by the superhuman zombies, with the surviving zombies musing that the Savage Land was their 'number one' meal in the aftermath, as it contained such an abundance of food that they were actually full for a full hour after eating there, as opposed to the usual ravenous hunger they feel. It is also the location of the final battle between the zombies and 'New Avengers'- three zombies who have beaten their hunger and the cyborg James Rhodes- at the storyline's conclusion, with Rhodes using one of his fingers to lure the zombies into an ambush. =Earth X= In the Earth X universe, the Savage Land is where Magneto built his sanctuary called Sentinel City. =House of M= In the House of M reality created by an insane Scarlet Witch, the Savage Land was known as \\"Pangea.\\" It is also known that Kevin Plunder has been granted political asylum in the United States for his human rights activism in this prehistoric land. =Marvel 2099= In the alternate future depicted in Marvel 2099, an alien attack floods much of the earth rendering the Savage Land the only habitable space. Thousands of refugees (including Miguel O'Hara and most of X-Nation and X-Men) make new homes here. It is not without its own dangers. =The Transformers= In the Transformers Marvel comics continuity, shortly after the Ark' spacecraft crashed on Earth 4 million years before the present day, the computer aboard the Ark detected Shockwave landing on the prehistoric Savage Land. The Ark used the last of its capabilities to revive the five Autobot warriors by scanning the Savage Land's dominant lifeform: dinosaurs, and rebuild them into the Dinobots. The Dinobots fought Shockwave, a battle that ended in permanent stalemate when Snarl brought down the mountain that Shockwave stood upon, knocking all of them into a tar pit. They remained deactivated until the year 1984. Since the Dinobots' alt-mode forms resemble creatures that were long-extinct by 4 million years ago, the Savage Land provided author Bob Budiansky a way to explain this within the canon timeline. =Spider-Geddon= During the \\"Spider-Geddon\\" storyline, an alternate unidentified Earth has a version of Spider-Man that lives in the Savage Land and was raised by a tribe of giant spiders following an airplane crash. It was mentioned by Ka-Zar the Hunter to Wilson Fisk that his father killed the last of the Man-Apes.Vault of Spiders #1. Marvel Comics. =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel universe, the Savage Land is a large island somewhere in the southern hemisphere. It was originally said to have been created by Magneto, using theories and methods developed by Professor X, as the site for genetic experiments. Magneto's goal there was to create a new human race who would be less trouble to rule than the current one, that he decided to restart evolution from scratch, and control the process to his own specifications. As a result of this, at its current level of advancement, it has dinosaurs and that Magneto has shown no further interest in advancing the evolution of the Savage Land. It has remained in its dinosaur state since the departure of Professor X. This story is later revealed as false (see below). Magneto's original base was on the Savage Land. When it was destroyed in the first arc of Ultimate X-Men, the computer controlling the base gained self-awareness, and hijacked the genetic experiment project to create an army of nanotech-enhanced, zombie-like thralls. It planned to take over the world, but was stopped by Wolverine, Cyclops, and Kitty Pryde. The Savage Land is now the home of Longshot, who managed to get there in a small boat which launched from Genosha. Longshot recently aided Magneto in breaking out of prison, and the two may be planning something. In Ultimates 3, it is revealed that the dinosaurs were conjured by Scarlet Witch as a result of her reality warping abilities and not by Magneto's creation. The aboriginal inhabitants were wiped out and only a small tribe of survivors including Ka-Zar and Shanna remain. The inhabitants help the Ultimates remove the last of Magneto's forces as of Ultimatum. =What If?= The Savage Land appears in a What If story where the Savage Land was terraforming and has taken over New York. Both Ka-Zar and Parnival sacrifice themselves to return New York to normal, with Shanna the only survivor of his \\"family.\\"What If? Vol. 2 #112. Marvel Comics. Additionally, in the What If issues involving alternative outcomes to the Age of Ultron, a group composed of Wolverine, the Hulk, Peter Parker and a Ghost Rider venture to the Savage Land in order to prevent a Master Mold under the control of a future version of Ezekiel Stane from unleashing a wave of Stark armors on the world.What If? Age of Ultron #2. Marvel Comics. In other media =Television= * Although not officially named, The Savage Land appears to be the setting in the 1967 Spider-Man episode, \\"Neptune's Nose Cone\\". J. Jonah Jameson Sends both Peter and a pilot named Penny Jones down to Antarctica to cover a downed space probe, But they are caught in a blizzard and were forced down into a tropical area. Peter then had to rescue Penny from being sacrificed, along with the titular probe, down a volcano while dealing with both the bizarre wildlife and the angry natives. * The Savage Land appeared in the 1981 Spider- Man episode \\"The Hunter and the Hunted.\\" J. Jonah Jameson hires Kraven the Hunter to capture the last smilodon located there who turned out to be Zabu. After Kraven the Hunter is defeated, Ka-Zar and Zabu returned to the Savage Land. * The Savage Land was referenced in the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends episode \\"The Crime of All Centuries.\\" It was where Kraven the Hunter had the dinosaurs he hunted exported to New York as part of a special exhibit which served as a cover-up for his plans to raise a dinosaur army. After Kraven the Hunter's defeat, the dinosaurs he captured were returned to the Savage Land. * The Savage Land appeared in some episodes of the X-Men TV series. It served as the location of Mister Sinister's base. A prominent feature about it was a device designed by Sinister that negated the powers of any mutant in the Savage Land save for Sinister's own forces, rendering the X-Men powerless while fighting him (with the exception of Wolverine's claws as they were a 'bonus' of the Weapon X process, although they would thus cause damage to his hands when used) until the machinery was destroyed. Magneto and Professor X spent much of the show's second season trapped in the Savage Land (Xavier's legs having fortunately been restored as a result of the loss of his powers) until Mister Sinister used them as bait to lure the X-Men into a trap in the season finale, Sinister's forces subsequently being defeated when Wolverine escaped capture and teamed up with Ka-Zar to infiltrate the base and destroy the equipment keeping the other X-Men powerless. In \\"Savage Land, Savage Heart\\", the X-Men return to the Savage Land to help Ka-Zar and Shanna fight the threat of Garokk. * The Savage Land is referenced in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Stranger From a Savage Land.\\" A scientist proves to his colleagues that the Savage Land exists by showing them Zabu of whom he caught. In the episode \\"Brouhaha at the World's Bottom,\\" Captain America, Ms. Marvel, and Ka-Zar defend on the S.H.I.E.L.D. outposts in the Savage Land from Baron Strucker and HYDRA when they plan to make use of the dimensional transporter there to go to another dimension ever since the Dark Surfer moved Earth out of its orbit. * In an episode of Iron Man: Armored Adventures, Obadiah Stane offered Tony water from the Savage Lands, hinting that they are able to enter and escape the lands at will. * The Savage Land appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode \\"Savage Land.\\" The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. head to the Savage Land when they trace the source of the volcanic eruptions there as Sauron and his Lizard Men allies are trying to cause a super-volcano to erupt. Near the end of the episode \\"Days of Future Smash Pt. 1: The Dino Era,\\" Hulk moves the remaining dinosaurs to where the Savage Land would be established. * The Savage Land appears in the Avengers Assemble episode \\"Savage.\\" In order to improve on Captain America's no technology challenge, Tony Stark leads Captain America, Hawkeye and Falcon on a 24-hour no technology survival trip to the Savage Land. While there, they discover a plot by Justin Hammer to mine the Savage Land's vibranium in order to get into the Cabal. Justin Hammer even used mind-controlled Velociraptors with lasers on them in order to protect their operation. With the help of some primitive devices that he made with the pacifist Rock Tribe, Tony Stark was able to free the Velociraptors from Justin Hammer's control and halt Justin Hammer's mining operation. * The Savage Land appears in Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"The Savage Spider-Man.\\" Spider-Man goes there with Wolverine in search of Ka-Zar and to stop a plan by Taskmaster and Kraven the Hunter where they planned to capture Zabu as part of a ritual that Kraven the Hunter plans to perform in order to become immortal. =Film= * The Savage Land is mentioned in Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow. * X-Men film series producer Hutch Parker stated that either Marvel or Fox may have Ka-Zar and the Savage Land in their film series. =Video games= * The Savage Land is Wolverine's stage in the arcade and console- imported game X-Men: Children of the Atom. It is also the first stage of the Sega Genesis X-Men game, and the fifth stage of X-Men 2: Clone Wars. * The Savage Land appears as one of the arenas in X-Men: Next Dimension. * In the X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse (which is loosely based on the Age of Apocalypse storyline), Avalon is Magneto's base in the Savage Land. The X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants use Avalon as their headquarters during their stay in the Savage Land. At Avalon, the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants can interact with Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil as well as Garokk when he is placed in a stasis cell upon his defeat. * The Savage Land appears in Marvel Super Hero Squad. It is shown as the second mission and as a round in Battle Mode. * The Savage Land was referenced in Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions. In the opening moments of Kraven the Hunter's level when Amazing Spider-Man is investigating Kraven's trophy room, there were several stuffed and mounted heads of Dinosaurs in the trophy room. This was a referenced to Kraven the Hunter's multiple trips to Savage Land. * The Savage Land appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance. It is the setting of Special Operations 21 which details a power struggle in the Savage Land between Sauron, Stegron, Mister Sinister, the High Evolutionary, and A.I.M. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent and the superheroes had to fight Iso-Saurs (a race of dinosaurs evolved by the Iso-8) which were created by the High Evolutionary. * The Savage Land was briefly referenced in Lego Marvel Super Heroes. When Thing, Captain America, and Storm visit an island where Asteroid M is being launched where they fight Rhino, Magneto, and the Acolytes, they also encounter and fight Velociraptors that were imported from the Savage Land.

Schneider served as a consultant to federal agencies and White House staff in the Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Schneider's research included modeling of the atmosphere, climate change, and the effect of global climate change on biological systems. Schneider was the founder and editor of the journal Climatic Change and authored or co-authored over 450 scientific papers and other publications. He was a Coordinating Lead Author in Working Group II Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report and was engaged as a co-anchor of the Key Vulnerabilities Cross-Cutting Theme for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) at the time of his death. During the 1980s, Schneider emerged as a leading public advocate of sharp reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming. In 2006 Professor Schneider was an Adelaide Thinker in Residence advising the South Australian Government of Premier Mike Rann on climate change and renewable energy policies. In ten years South Australia went from zero to 31% of its electricity generation coming from renewables. An annual award for outstanding climate science communication was created in Schneider's honor after his death, by the Commonwealth Club of California. The Stephen Schneider Memorial Lecture of the American Geophysical Union honors Schneider's life and work. Early work Schneider grew up on Long Island, New York. He studied engineering at Columbia University, receiving his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1966. In 1971, he earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and plasma physics. Schneider studied the role of greenhouse gases and suspended particulate material on climate as a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Schneider was awarded the Marshall Scholarship. In 1971, Schneider was second author on a Science paper with S. Ichtiaque Rasool titled \\"Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate\\" (Science 173, 138‚Äì141). This paper used a one-dimensional radiative transfer model to examine the competing effects of cooling from aerosols and warming from CO2. The paper concluded that: Carbon dioxide was predicted to have only a minor role. However, the model was very simple and the calculation of the CO2 effect was lower than other estimates by a factor of about three, as noted in a footnote to the paper. The story made headlines in the New York Times. Shortly afterwards, Schneider became aware that he had overestimated the cooling effect of aerosols, and underestimated the warming effect of CO2 by a factor of about three. He had mistakenly assumed that measurements of air particles he had taken near the source of pollution applied worldwide. He also found that much of the effect was due to natural aerosols which would not be affected by human activities, so the cooling effect of changes in industrial pollution would be much less than he had calculated. Having found that recalculation showed that global warming was the more likely outcome, he published a retraction of his earlier findings in 1974.Pearce, Fred, The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming, (2010) Guardian Books, , pp. 24‚Äì27. \\"When he redid the maths, the balance between warming and cooling now tipped strongly towards warming.\\" In a 1976 book The Genesis Strategy he discusses both long-term warming due to carbon dioxide and short- term cooling due to aerosols,Stephen H. Schneider and Lynne E. Mesirow, The Genesis Strategy: Climate and Global Survival, Plenum, April 1976. Quotes (accessed 22 October 2014) and advocated for adopting policies that are resilient to future changes in climate.The reference is to the story of Joseph, in Genesis 41-42, who advises the Pharaoh to store harvest from years of abundant harvest to prepare for years of famine. Media contributions Schneider was a frequent contributor to commercial and noncommercial print and broadcast media on climate and environmental issues, e.g., Nova, Planet Earth, Nightline, Today Show, The Tonight Show, Bill Maher's shows, Good Morning America, Dateline, The Discovery Channel, as well as appearances on the British, Canadian and Australian Broadcasting Corporations.Santer, B. and Ehrlich, P. 2014. Stephen Schneider: a biographical essay. Washington D.C.: National Academy of Sciences. Schneider commented about the frustrations and difficulties involved with assessing and communicating scientific ideas. In a January 2002 Scientific American article, he wrote: In 1989, Schneider addressed the challenge scientists face trying to communicate complex, important issues without adequate time during media interviews. This citation sometimes was used by his critics to accuse him of supporting misuse of science for political goals: For the original, together with Schneider's commentary on its misrepresentation, see also American Physical Society, APS News August/September 1996.

A Lancet review on Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries provides the following sample definitions,reproduced in The COPE report 1999: * Danish definition: \\"Intention or gross negligence leading to fabrication of the scientific message or a false credit or emphasis given to a scientist\\" * Swedish definition: \\"Intention[al] distortion of the research process by fabrication of data, text, hypothesis, or methods from another researcher's manuscript form or publication; or distortion of the research process in other ways.\\" The consequences of scientific misconduct can be damaging for perpetrators and journal audience and for any individual who exposes it. In addition there are public health implications attached to the promotion of medical or other interventions based on false or fabricated research findings. Three percent of the 3,475 research institutions that report to the US Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Research Integrity, indicate some form of scientific misconduct. However the ORI will only investigate allegations of impropriety where research was funded by federal grants. They routinely monitor such research publication for red flags and their investigation is subject to a statute of limitations. Other private organizations like the Committee of Medical Journal Editors (COJE) can only police their own members. The validity of the methods and results of scientific papers are often scrutinized in journal clubs. In this venue, members can decide amongst themselves with the help of peers if a scientific paper's ethical standards are met. Motivation to commit scientific misconduct According to David Goodstein of Caltech, there are motivators for scientists to commit misconduct, which are briefly summarised here. ; Career pressure :Science is still a very strongly career-driven discipline. Scientists depend on a good reputation to receive ongoing support and funding, and a good reputation relies largely on the publication of high-profile scientific papers. Hence, there is a strong imperative to \\"publish or perish\\". Clearly, this may motivate desperate (or fame-hungry) scientists to fabricate results. ; Ease of fabrication : In many scientific fields, results are often difficult to reproduce accurately, being obscured by noise, artifacts, and other extraneous data. That means that even if a scientist does falsify data, they can expect to get away with it ‚Äì or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field. There are no \\"scientific police\\" who are trained to fight scientific crimes; all investigations are made by experts in science but amateurs in dealing with criminals. It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data. ;Monetary Gain : In many scientific fields, professionals make the most money by selling their expert opinions. Corporations can pay experts to support products directly or indirectly through conferences. Psychologist can make money by repeatedly acting as an expert witness in custody proceedings for the same law firms. Forms of scientific misconduct The U.S. National Science Foundation defines three types of research misconduct: fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism.45 CFR Part 689 * Fabrication is making up results and recording or reporting them. This is sometimes referred to as \\"drylabbing\\". A more minor form of fabrication is where references are included to give arguments the appearance of widespread acceptance, but are actually fake, or do not support the argument.Emmeche, slide 5 * Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. * Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. One form is the appropriation of the ideas and results of others, and publishing as to make it appear the author had performed all the work under which the data was obtained. A subset is citation plagiarism ‚Äì willful or negligent failure to appropriately credit other or prior discoverers, so as to give an improper impression of priority. This is also known as, \\"citation amnesia\\", the \\"disregard syndrome\\" and \\"bibliographic negligence\\". Arguably, this is the most common type of scientific misconduct. Sometimes it is difficult to guess whether authors intentionally ignored a highly relevant cite or lacked knowledge of the prior work. Discovery credit can also be inadvertently reassigned from the original discoverer to a better- known researcher. This is a special case of the Matthew effect.Emmeche, slide 3, who refers to the phenomenon as Dulbecco's law. ** Plagiarism-fabrication ‚Äì the act of taking an unrelated figure from an unrelated publication and reproducing it exactly in a new publication, claiming that it represents new data. ** Self-plagiarism ‚Äì or multiple publication of the same content with different titles or in different journals is sometimes also considered misconduct; scientific journals explicitly ask authors not to do this. It is referred to as \\"salami\\" (i.e. many identical slices) in the jargon of medical journal editors. According to some editors this includes publishing the same article in a different language. Other types of research misconduct are also recognized: * Ghostwriting ‚Äì the phenomenon where someone other than the named author(s) makes a major contribution. Typically, this is done to mask contributions from authors with a conflict of interest. * Conversely, research misconduct is not limited to not listing authorship, but also includes the act of conferring authorship on those that have not made substantial contributions to the research. This is done by senior researchers who muscle their way onto the papers of inexperienced junior researchers as well as others that stack authorship in an effort to guarantee publication. This is much harder to prove due to a lack of consistency in defining \\"authorship\\" or \\"substantial contribution\\". * Scientific misconduct can also occur during the peer-review process by a reviewer or editor with a conflict of interest. Coercive citation citation can also inflate the perceived Citation impact of a researcher's work and their reputation in the scientific community , similar to excessive self- citation. Reviewers are expected to be impartial and assess the quality of their work. They are expected to declare a conflict of interest to the editors if they are colleagues or competitors of the authors. A rarer case of scientific misconduct is editorial misconduct, where an editor does not declare conflicts of interest, creates pseudonyms to review papers, gives strongly worded editorial decisions to support reviews suggesting to add excessive citations to their own unrelated works or to add themselves as a co- author or their name to the title of the manuscript. = Photo manipulation = Compared to other forms of scientific misconduct, image fraud (manipulation of images to distort their meaning) is of particular interest since it can frequently be detected by external parties. In 2006, the Journal of Cell Biology gained publicity for instituting tests to detect photo manipulation in papers that were being considered for publication. This was in response to the increased usage of programs such as Adobe Photoshop by scientists, which facilitate photo manipulation. Since then more publishers, including the Nature Publishing Group, have instituted similar tests and require authors to minimize and specify the extent of photo manipulation when a manuscript is submitted for publication. However, there is little evidence to indicate that such tests are applied rigorously. One Nature paper published in 2009 has subsequently been reported to contain around 20 separate instances of image fraud. Although the type of manipulation that is allowed can depend greatly on the type of experiment that is presented and also differ from one journal to another, in general the following manipulations are not allowed: * splicing together different images to represent a single experiment * changing brightness and contrast of only a part of the image * any change that conceals information, even when it is considered to be aspecific, which includes: ** changing brightness and contrast to leave only the most intense signal ** using clone tools to hide information * showing only a very small part of the photograph so that additional information is not visible Image manipulations are typically done on visually repetitive images such as those of western blots, histologies or data visualisations like graphs. =Helicopter research= Helicopter research is an unethical conduct carried out by researchers from wealthier countries, who fly to a developing country, collect information, travel back to their country, analyse the data and samples, and publish the results with no or little involvement of local researchers. At best, local colleagues are only used to provide logistics. Overall, helicopter research produces scientific papers that contribute to the career of scientists from rich countries, but do not contribute much to local science.Budiman Minasny, Dian Fiantis, Budi Mulyanto, Yiyi Sulaeman, Wirastuti Widyatmanti, 2020. \\"Global soil science research collaboration in the 21st century: Time to end helicopter research\\". Geoderma, Volume 373, 114299 Authorship responsibility All authors of a scientific publication are expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted to academic journals for publication. Simultaneous submission of scientific findings to more than one journal or duplicate publication of findings is usually regarded as misconduct, under what is known as the Ingelfinger rule, named after the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine 1967‚Äì1977, Franz Ingelfinger.Toy, Jennifer (December 2002) \\"The Ingelfinger Rule\\" (PDF) Science Editor ‚Ä¢ Vol. 25 ‚Ä¢ No. 6 ‚Ä¢ p. 195. Retrieved 20 December 2014 Guest authorship (where there is stated authorship in the absence of involvement, also known as gift authorship) and ghost authorship (where the real author is not listed as an author) are commonly regarded as forms of research misconduct. In some cases coauthors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of Gerald Schatten who co- authored with Hwang Woo-Suk, the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce, (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce's deception) ‚Äì and the coauthors with Jan Hendrik Sch√∂n at Bell Laboratories. More recent cases include that of Charles Nemeroff, then the editor-in-chief of Neuropsychopharmacology, and a well- documented case involving the drug Actonel.http://www.thejabberwock.org/wiki/index.php?title=Actonel_Case_Media_Reports Authors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. The failure to keep data may be regarded as misconduct. Some scientific journals require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors might have commercial or non-commercial conflicts of interest. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about ethical aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies.  Research institution responsibility  In general, defining whether an individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, the more likely it is that conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation. Well publicised cases illustrate the potential role that senior academics in research institutions play in concealing scientific misconduct. A King's College (London) internal investigation showed research findings from one of their researchers to be 'at best unreliable, and in many cases spurious' but the college took no action, such as retracting relevant published research or preventing further episodes from occurring. It was only 10 years later, when an entirely separate form of misconduct by the same individual was being investigated by the General Medical Council, that the internal report came to light. In a more recent case an internal investigation at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune determined that there was evidence of misconduct by Dr. Gopal Kundu, but an external committee was then organised which dismissed the allegation, and the NCCS issued a memorandum exonerating the authors of all charges of misconduct. Undeterred by the NCCS exoneration, the relevant journal (Journal of Biological Chemistry) withdrew the paper based on its own analysis. If there was clear evidence of misconduct, the impacted journal can conduct and conclude investigation independent of the author's corresponding research institution. In 2019, the Optical Society of America retracted a research paper by Julia Zhu and Baisong Xie based on its own investigation. The corresponding institutions are Phillips Academy Andover and Beijing Normal University. Zhu, Julia & Xie, Baisong, \\"Thomson backscattering in combined uniform magnetic and envelope modulating circularly polarized laser fields: retraction\\" Journal of the Optical Society of America Vol. 36. No 10/October, 2019 Scientific peer responsibility Some academics believe that scientific colleagues who suspect scientific misconduct should consider taking informal action themselves, or reporting their concerns.See and (with Joan Sieber) Responding to Research Wrongdoing: A User Friendly Guide, July 2010. This question is of great importance since much research suggests that it is very difficult for people to act or come forward when they see unacceptable behavior, unless they have help from their organizations. A \\"User-friendly Guide,\\" and the existence of a confidential organizational ombudsman may help people who are uncertain about what to do, or afraid of bad consequences for their speaking up.See Mary Rowe, Linda Wilcox and Howard Gadlin, \\"Dealing with ‚Äì or Reporting ‚Äì 'Unacceptable' Behavior ‚Äì with additional thoughts about the 'Bystander Effect'\\", JIOA, vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 52‚Äì62. Responsibility of journals Journals are responsible for safeguarding the research record and hence have a critical role in dealing with suspected misconduct. This is recognised by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) which has issued clear guidelinesRetraction Guidelines (PDF) on the form (e.g. retraction) that concerns over the research record should take. * The COPE guidelines state that journal editors should consider retracting a publication if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error). Retraction is also appropriate in cases of redundant publication, plagiarism and unethical research. * Journal editors should consider issuing an expression of concern if they receive inconclusive evidence of research or publication misconduct by the authors, there is evidence that the findings are unreliable but the authors' institution will not investigate the case, they believe that an investigation into alleged misconduct related to the publication either has not been, or would not be, fair and impartial or conclusive, or an investigation is underway but a judgement will not be available for a considerable time. * Journal editors should consider issuing a correction if a small portion of an otherwise reliable publication proves to be misleading (especially because of honest error), or the author / contributor list is incorrect (i.e. a deserving author has been omitted or somebody who does not meet authorship criteria has been included). Evidence emerged in 2012 that journals learning of cases where there is strong evidence of possible misconduct, with issues potentially affecting a large portion of the findings, frequently fail to issue an expression of concern or correspond with the host institution so that an investigation can be undertaken. In one case the Journal of Clinical Oncology issued a Correction despite strong evidence that the original paper was invalid. In another case, Nature allowed a Corrigendum to be published despite clear evidence of image fraud. Subsequent Retraction of the paper required the actions of an independent whistleblower. The cases of Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii in anaesthesiology focussed attention on the role that journals play in perpetuating scientific fraud as well as how they can deal with it. In the Boldt case, the Editors-in-Chief of 18 specialist journals (generally anaesthesia and intensive care) made a joint statement regarding 88 published clinical trials conducted without Ethics Committee approval. In the Fujii case, involving nearly 200 papers, the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia, which published 24 of Fujii's papers, has accepted that its handling of the issue was inadequate. Following publication of a Letter to the Editor from Kranke and colleagues in April 2000, along with a non-specific response from Dr. Fujii, there was no follow-up on the allegation of data manipulation and no request for an institutional review of Dr. Fujii's research. Anesthesia & Analgesia went on to publish 11 additional manuscripts by Dr. Fujii following the 2000 allegations of research fraud, with Editor Steven Shafer statingFujii Statement of Concern (PDF) in March 2012 that subsequent submissions to the Journal by Dr. Fujii should not have been published without first vetting the allegations of fraud. In April 2012 Shafer led a group of editors to write a joint statement,Fujii Join EIC Statement (PDF) in the form of an ultimatum made available to the public, to a large number of academic institutions where Fujii had been employed, offering these institutions the chance to attest to the integrity of the bulk of the allegedly fraudulent papers. Consequences for science The consequences of scientific fraud vary based on the severity of the fraud, the level of notice it receives, and how long it goes undetected. For cases of fabricated evidence, the consequences can be wide- ranging, with others working to confirm (or refute) the false finding, or with research agendas being distorted to address the fraudulent evidence. The Piltdown Man fraud is a case in point: The significance of the bona-fide fossils that were being found was muted for decades because they disagreed with Piltdown Man and the preconceived notions that those faked fossils supported. In addition, the prominent paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward spent time at Piltdown each year until he died, trying to find more Piltdown Man remains. The misdirection of resources kept others from taking the real fossils more seriously and delayed the reaching of a correct understanding of human evolution. (The Taung Child, which should have been the death knell for the view that the human brain evolved first, was instead treated very critically because of its disagreement with the Piltdown Man evidence.) In the case of Prof Don Poldermans, the misconduct occurred in reports of trials of treatment to prevent death and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing operations. The trial reports were relied upon to issue guidelines that applied for many years across North America and Europe. In the case of Dr Alfred Steinschneider, two decades and tens of millions of research dollars were lost trying to find the elusive link between infant sleep apnea, which Steinschneider said he had observed and recorded in his laboratory, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), of which he stated it was a precursor. The cover was blown in 1994, 22 years after Steinschneider's 1972 Pediatrics paper claiming such an association, when Waneta Hoyt, the mother of the patients in the paper, was arrested, indicted and convicted on five counts of second- degree murder for the smothering deaths of her five children. While that in itself was bad enough, the paper, presumably written as an attempt to save infants' lives, ironically was ultimately used as a defense by parents suspected in multiple deaths of their own children in cases of M√ºnchausen syndrome by proxy. The 1972 Pediatrics paper was cited in 404 papers in the interim and is still listed on Pubmed without comment. Consequences for those who expose misconduct The potentially severe consequences for individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research. This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct. Persons who expose such cases, commonly called whistleblowers, find themselves open to retaliation by a number of different means. These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters ‚Äì designed to protect those who raise concerns. Exposure of fraudulent data With the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of plagiarism and multiple publication within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Dr. Harold Garner's laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas is D√©j√† vu, an open- access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication. All of the entries in the database were discovered through the use of text data mining algorithm eTBLAST, also created in Dr. Garner's laboratory. The creation of D√©j√† vu and the subsequent classification of several hundred articles contained therein have ignited much discussion in the scientific community concerning issues such as ethical behavior, journal standards, and intellectual copyright. Studies on this database have been published in journals such as Nature and Science, among others. Other tools which may be used to detect fraudulent data include error analysis. Measurements generally have a small amount of error, and repeated measurements of the same item will generally result in slight differences in readings. These differences can be analyzed, and follow certain known mathematical and statistical properties. Should a set of data appear to be too faithful to the hypothesis, i.e., the amount of error that would normally be in such measurements does not appear, a conclusion can be drawn that the data may have been forged. Error analysis alone is typically not sufficient to prove that data have been falsified or fabricated, but it may provide the supporting evidence necessary to confirm suspicions of misconduct. Data sharing Kirby Lee and Lisa Bero suggest, \\"Although reviewing raw data can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, having such a policy would hold authors more accountable for the accuracy of their data and potentially reduce scientific fraud or misconduct.\\" Notable individual cases Andrew Wakefield, who claimed links between the MMR vaccine, autism and inflammatory bowel disease, was found guilty of dishonesty in his research and banned from medicine by the UK General Medical Council following an investigation by Brian Deer of the London Sunday Times.

These cards each have a unique number, symbol, shading, and color, and are thus a \\"set\\". Set (stylized as SET) is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple). Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with [three] [striped] [green] [diamonds]) appears as a card precisely once in the deck. In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a set. For each one of the four categories of features ‚Äî color, number, shape, and shading ‚Äî the three cards must display that feature as a) either all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version. For example, 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid green squiggles, and 1 solid purple oval form a set, because the shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the shapes among the three cards are all different. For any \\"set\\", the number of features that are all the same and the number of features that are all different may break down as 0 the same + 4 different; or 1 the same + 3 different; or 2 the same + 2 different; or 3 the same + 1 different. (It cannot break down as 4 features the same + 0 different as the cards would be identical, and there are no identical cards in the Set deck.) History The game evolved out of a coding system that the designer used in her job as a geneticist. Set won American Mensa's Mensa Select award in 1991 and placed 9th in the 1995 Deutscher Spiele Preis. Games Playing Set Several games can be played with these cards, all involving the concept of a set. A set consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions: *They all have the same number or have three different numbers. *They all have the same shape or have three different shapes. *They all have the same shading or have three different shadings. *They all have the same color or have three different colors. The rules of Set are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into \\"two of ____ and one of ____\\", then it is not a set. For example, these three cards form a set: *One red striped diamond *Two red solid diamonds *Three red open diamonds Given any two cards from the deck, there is one and only one other cards that form a set with them. In the standard Set game, the dealer lays out cards on the table until either twelve are laid down or someone sees a set and calls \\"Set!\\". The player who called \\"Set\\" takes the cards in the set, and the dealer continues to deal out cards until twelve are on the table. A player who sees a set among the twelve cards calls \\"Set\\" and takes the three cards, and the dealer lays three more cards on the table. (To call out \\"set\\" and not pick one up quickly enough results in a penalty.) There may be no set among the twelve cards; in this case, the dealer deals out three more cards to make fifteen dealt cards, or eighteen or more, as necessary. This process of dealing by threes and finding sets continues until the deck is exhausted and there are no more sets on the table. At this point, whoever has collected the most sets wins. Variants were included with the Set game that involves different mechanics to find sets, as well as different player interaction. Additional variants continue to be created by avid players of the game.http://magliery.com/Set/SetVariants.htmlhttp://www.thegamesjournal.com/rules/GetSet.shtml Basic combinatorics of Set * Given any two cards, there is exactly one card that forms a set with those two cards. Therefore, the probability of producing a Set from 3 randomly drawn cards from a complete deck is 1/79. * A Cap set is a mathematical structure describing a Set layout in which no set may be taken. The largest group of cards that can be put together without creating a set is 20.. Such a group is called a maximal cap set . Donald Knuth found in 2001 that there are 682344 such cap sets of size 20 for the 81-card version of Set; under affine transformations on 4-dimensional finite space, they all reduce to essentially one cap set. * There are \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{3} = \\\\frac{81 \\\\times 80}{2 \\\\times 3} = 1080 unique sets. * The probability that a set will have d features different and 4 - d features the same is \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{{4 \\\\choose d}2^d}{80}. (Note: The case where d = 0 is impossible, since no two cards are identical.) Thus, 10% of possible sets differ in one feature, 30% in two features, 40% in three features, and 20% in all four features. * The number of different 12-card deals is \\\\textstyle{81 \\\\choose 12} = \\\\frac{81!}{12! 69!} = 70\\\\,724\\\\,320\\\\,184\\\\,700 \\\\approx 7.07 \\\\times 10^{13}. * The odds against there being no Set in 12 cards when playing a game of Set start off at 30:1 for the first round. Then they quickly fall, and after about the 4th round they are 14:1 and for the next 20 rounds, they slowly fall towards 13:1. So for most of the rounds played, the odds are between 14:1 and 13:1. * The odds against there being no Set in 15 cards when playing a game are 88:1. (This is different from the odds against there being no Set in any 15 cards (which is 2700:1) since during play, 15 cards are only shown when a group of 12 cards has no Set.) * Around 30% of all games always have a Set among the 12 cards, and thus never need to go to 15 cards. * The average number of available Sets among 12 cards is \\\\textstyle{12 \\\\choose 3} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{79} \\\\approx 2.78 and among 15 cards \\\\textstyle{15 \\\\choose 3} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{79} \\\\approx 5.76. However, in play the numbers are smaller. * If there were 26 sets picked from the deck, the last three cards would necessarily form another 27th set. Complexity Using a natural generalization of Set, where the number of properties and values vary, it was shown that determining whether a set exists from a collection of dealt cards is NP-complete.http://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/papers/set.pdf References External links *Set Enterprises website *A (2002?) mathematic exploration of the game Set .

The Silver Star Medal is the United States Armed Forces' third-highest personal decoration for valor in combat. The Silver Star Medal is awarded primarily to members of the United States Armed Forces for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States. History The Silver Star Medal (SSM) is the successor award to the \\"Citation Star\\" ( silver star) which was established by an Act of Congress on July 9, 1918, during World War I. On July 19, 1932, the Secretary of War approved the conversion of the \\"Citation Star\\" to the SSM with the original \\"Citation Star\\" incorporated into the center of the medal. Authorization for the Silver Star Medal was placed into law by an Act of Congress for the U.S. Navy on August 7, 1942, and an Act of Congress for the U.S. Army on December 15, 1942. The current statutory authorization for the medal is Title 10 of the United States Code, for the U.S. Army, for the U.S. Air Force, and for the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Army and Air Force award the medal as the \\"Silver Star\\". The U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard continue to award the medal as the \\"Silver Star Medal\\". Since 21 December 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) refers to the decoration as the Silver Star Medal. Award criteria The Silver Star Medal is awarded for gallantry, so long as the action does not justify the award of one of the next higher valor awards: the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, the Air Force Cross, or the Coast Guard Cross. The gallantry displayed must have taken place while in action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The Silver Star Medal is awarded for singular acts of valor or heroism over a brief period, such as one or two days of a battle. Air Force pilots and combat systems officers and Navy/Marine Corps naval aviators and flight officers flying fighter aircraft, are often considered eligible to receive the Silver Star upon becoming an ace (i.e., having five or more confirmed aerial kills), which entails the pilot and, in multi-seat fighters, the weapons system officer or radar intercept officer, intentionally and successfully risking his life multiple times under combat conditions and emerging victorious.Korean War pilot receives Silver Star 56 years later . Retrieved 2009-03-10. However, during the Vietnam War, the last conflict to produce U.S. fighter aces: an Air Force pilot and two navigators/weapon systems officers (who were later retrained as Air Force pilots), a naval aviator and a naval flight officer/radar intercept officer who had achieved this distinction, were eventually awarded the Air Force Cross and Navy Cross, respectively, in addition to SSMs previously awarded for earlier aerial kills. ;Unit award equivalent * Air Force ‚Äì Gallant Unit Citation * Army ‚Äì Valorous Unit Award * Coast Guard ‚Äì Coast Guard Unit Commendation * Navy-Marine Corps ‚Äì Navy Unit Commendation Appearance The Silver Star Medal is a gold five-pointed star, in circumscribing diameter with a laurel wreath encircling rays from the center and a diameter silver star superimposed in the center.

Colonel David Hackworth who was awarded ten SSMs while serving in the Army during the Korean War and Vietnam War, is likely to be the person awarded the most SSMs. Donald H. Russell, a civilian Vought F4U Corsair technical support engineer attached to a Marine Corps fighter wing, received the SSM for his actions aboard after the carrier was attacked by a Japanese dive bomber in March 1945. In the fall of 1944, President Roosevelt‚Äôs close adviser Harry Hopkins, the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow W. Averell Harriman and a military attach√© presented the SSM to Soviet Red Army artillery officer Alexei Voloshin, who was the first to cross the Dnieper with his battery and was one of four junior Red Army officers who received the award. Wyatt Waldron was a Marine with 3rd Battalion 4th Marines and received the SSM, the Purple Heart and two other medals of Valor during his three combat deployments in Iraq. =Female recipients= Three Army nurses that served in World War I were cited in 1919 and 1920 with Citation Stars for gallantry in attending to the wounded while under artillery fire in July 1918. In 2007, it was discovered that they had never been awarded their Citation Stars. The three nurses (Army nurses served without rank until 1920) were awarded the Silver Star Medal posthumously: * Jane Rignel ‚Äì Mobile Hospital No. 2, 42nd Division, for gallantry in \\"giving aid to the wounded under heavy fire\\" in France on July 15, 1918 * Linnie Leckrone ‚Äì Shock Team No. 134, Field Hospital No. 127, 32nd Division, for gallantry while \\"attending to the wounded during an artillery bombardment\\" in France on July 29, 1918 * Irene Robar ‚Äì Shock Team No. 134, Field Hospital No. 127, 32nd Division, for gallantry while \\"attending to the wounded during an artillery bombardment\\" in France on July 29, 1918 An unknown number of servicewomen received the award in World War II. Four Army nurses serving in Italy during the war‚ÄîFirst Lieutenant Mary Roberts, Second Lieutenant Elaine Roe, Second Lieutenant Rita Virginia Rourke, and Second Lieutenant Ellen Ainsworth (posthumous)‚Äîbecame the first women recipients of the Silver Star, all cited for their bravery in evacuating the 33rd Field Hospital at Anzio on February 10, 1944. Later that same year, Corporal Magdalena Leones, a Filipino American, received the medal for clandestine activities on Luzon; , she is the only female Asian American to receive a Silver Star. The next known servicewomen to receive the Silver Star is Army National Guard Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester in 2005, for gallantry during an insurgent ambush on a convoy in Iraq and Army Specialist Monica Lin Brown in March 2008, for extraordinary heroism as a combat medic in the War in Afghanistan. =Notable recipients= Notable recipients include: *John Adair *Joseph H.

Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Pr. Hannam, p. 342 The Scientific Revolution took place in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and continued through the late 18th century, influencing the intellectual social movement known as the Enlightenment. While its dates are debated, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. The concept of a scientific revolution taking place over an extended period emerged in the eighteenth century in the work of Jean Sylvain Bailly, who saw a two-stage process of sweeping away the old and establishing the new. The beginning of the Scientific Revolution, the 'Scientific Renaissance', was focused on the recovery of the knowledge of the ancients; this is generally considered to have ended in 1632 with publication of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The completion of the Scientific Revolution is attributed to the \\"grand synthesis\\" of Isaac Newton's 1687 Principia. The work formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, thereby completing the synthesis of a new cosmology. By the end of the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment that followed the Scientific Revolution had given way to the \\"Age of Reflection\\". Introduction Great advances in science have been termed \\"revolutions\\" since the 18th century. In 1747, the French mathematician Alexis Clairaut wrote that \\"Newton was said in his own life to have created a revolution\\". The word was also used in the preface to Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 work announcing the discovery of oxygen. \\"Few revolutions in science have immediately excited so much general notice as the introduction of the theory of oxygen ... Lavoisier saw his theory accepted by all the most eminent men of his time, and established over a great part of Europe within a few years from its first promulgation.\\" In the 19th century, William Whewell described the revolution in science itself ‚Äì the scientific method ‚Äì that had taken place in the 15th-16th century. \\"Among the most conspicuous of the revolutions which opinions on this subject have undergone, is the transition from an implicit trust in the internal powers of man's mind to a professed dependence upon external observation; and from an unbounded reverence for the wisdom of the past, to a fervid expectation of change and improvement.\\" This gave rise to the common view of the Scientific Revolution today: Portrait of Galileo Galilei by Leoni The Scientific Revolution is traditionally assumed to start with the Copernican Revolution (initiated in 1543) and to be complete in the \\"grand synthesis\\" of Isaac Newton's 1687 Principia. Much of the change of attitude came from Francis Bacon whose \\"confident and emphatic announcement\\" in the modern progress of science inspired the creation of scientific societies such as the Royal Society, and Galileo who championed Copernicus and developed the science of motion. In the 20th century, Alexandre Koyr√© introduced the term \\"scientific revolution\\", centering his analysis on Galileo. The term was popularized by Butterfield in his Origins of Modern Science. Thomas Kuhn's 1962 work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions emphasized that different theoretical frameworks‚Äîsuch as Einstein's theory of relativity and Newton's theory of gravity, which it replaced‚Äîcannot be directly compared without meaning loss. =Significance= The period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across mathematics, physics, astronomy, and biology in institutions supporting scientific investigation and in the more widely held picture of the universe. The Scientific Revolution led to the establishment of several modern sciences. In 1984, Joseph Ben-David wrote: Many contemporary writers and modern historians claim that there was a revolutionary change in world view. In 1611 the English poet, John Donne, wrote: Mid-20th-century historian Herbert Butterfield was less disconcerted, but nevertheless saw the change as fundamental: The history professor Peter Harrison attributes Christianity to having contributed to the rise of the Scientific Revolution: Ancient and medieval background Ptolemaic model of the spheres for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Georg von Peuerbach, Theoricae novae planetarum, 1474. The Scientific Revolution was built upon the foundation of ancient Greek learning and science in the Middle Ages, as it had been elaborated and further developed by Roman/Byzantine science and medieval Islamic science.Grant, pp. 29‚Äì30, 42‚Äì47. Some scholars have noted a direct tie between \\"particular aspects of traditional Christianity\\" and the rise of science. The \\"Aristotelian tradition\\" was still an important intellectual framework in the 17th century, although by that time natural philosophers had moved away from much of it. Key scientific ideas dating back to classical antiquity had changed drastically over the years, and in many cases been discredited. The ideas that remained, which were transformed fundamentally during the Scientific Revolution, include: * Aristotle's cosmology that placed the Earth at the center of a spherical hierarchic cosmos. The terrestrial and celestial regions were made up of different elements which had different kinds of natural movement. ** The terrestrial region, according to Aristotle, consisted of concentric spheres of the four elements‚Äîearth, water, air, and fire. All bodies naturally moved in straight lines until they reached the sphere appropriate to their elemental composition‚Äîtheir natural place. All other terrestrial motions were non-natural, or violent.Grant, pp. 55‚Äì63, 87‚Äì104Pedersen, pp. 106‚Äì10. ** The celestial region was made up of the fifth element, aether, which was unchanging and moved naturally with uniform circular motion.Grant, pp. 63‚Äì68, 104‚Äì16. In the Aristotelian tradition, astronomical theories sought to explain the observed irregular motion of celestial objects through the combined effects of multiple uniform circular motions.Pedersen, p. 25 * The Ptolemaic model of planetary motion: based on the geometrical model of Eudoxus of Cnidus, Ptolemy's Almagest, demonstrated that calculations could compute the exact positions of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets in the future and in the past, and showed how these computational models were derived from astronomical observations. As such they formed the model for later astronomical developments. The physical basis for Ptolemaic models invoked layers of spherical shells, though the most complex models were inconsistent with this physical explanation.Pedersen, pp. 86‚Äì89. It is important to note that ancient precedent existed for alternative theories and developments which prefigured later discoveries in the area of physics and mechanics; but in light of the limited number of works to survive translation in a period when many books were lost to warfare, such developments remained obscure for centuries and are traditionally held to have had little effect on the re-discovery of such phenomena; whereas the invention of the printing press made the wide dissemination of such incremental advances of knowledge commonplace. Meanwhile, however, significant progress in geometry, mathematics, and astronomy was made in medieval times. It is also true that many of the important figures of the Scientific Revolution shared in the general Renaissance respect for ancient learning and cited ancient pedigrees for their innovations. Nicolaus Copernicus (1473‚Äì1543),Kuhn, Thomas (1957) The Copernican Revolution. Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr. p. 142. Galileo Galilei (1564‚Äì1642), Johannes Kepler (1571‚Äì1630) reprinted in Eastwood, B.S. (1989) Astronomy and Optics from Pliny to Descartes, London: Variorum Reprints. and Isaac Newton (1642‚Äì1727) all traced different ancient and medieval ancestries for the heliocentric system. In the Axioms Scholium of his Principia, Newton said its axiomatic three laws of motion were already accepted by mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695), Wallace, Wren and others. While preparing a revised edition of his Principia, Newton attributed his law of gravity and his first law of motion to a range of historical figures. Despite these qualifications, the standard theory of the history of the Scientific Revolution claims that the 17th century was a period of revolutionary scientific changes. Not only were there revolutionary theoretical and experimental developments, but that even more importantly, the way in which scientists worked was radically changed. For instance, although intimations of the concept of inertia are suggested sporadically in ancient discussion of motion,Heath, Thomas L. (1949) Mathematics in Aristotle. Oxford: Clarendon Press. pp. 115‚Äì16. the salient point is that Newton's theory differed from ancient understandings in key ways, such as an external force being a requirement for violent motion in Aristotle's theory. Scientific method Under the scientific method as conceived in the 17th century, natural and artificial circumstances were set aside as a research tradition of systematic experimentation was slowly accepted by the scientific community. The philosophy of using an inductive approach to obtain knowledge‚Äîto abandon assumption and to attempt to observe with an open mind‚Äîwas in contrast with the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding. In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed‚Äîthe willingness to question assumptions, yet also to interpret observations assumed to have some degree of validity. By the end of the Scientific Revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research. Though it is certainly not true that Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways. Many of the hallmarks of modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century. =Empiricism= The Aristotelian scientific tradition's primary mode of interacting with the world was through observation and searching for \\"natural\\" circumstances through reasoning. Coupled with this approach was the belief that rare events which seemed to contradict theoretical models were aberrations, telling nothing about nature as it \\"naturally\\" was. During the Scientific Revolution, changing perceptions about the role of the scientist in respect to nature, the value of evidence, experimental or observed, led towards a scientific methodology in which empiricism played a large, but not absolute, role. By the start of the Scientific Revolution, empiricism had already become an important component of science and natural philosophy. Prior thinkers, including the early-14th-century nominalist philosopher William of Ockham, had begun the intellectual movement toward empiricism.Hannam, p. 162 The term British empiricism came into use to describe philosophical differences perceived between two of its founders Francis Bacon, described as empiricist, and Ren√© Descartes, who was described as a rationalist. Thomas Hobbes, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the philosophy's primary exponents, who developed a sophisticated empirical tradition as the basis of human knowledge. An influential formulation of empiricism was John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), in which he maintained that the only true knowledge that could be accessible to the human mind was that which was based on experience. He wrote that the human mind was created as a tabula rasa, a \\"blank tablet,\\" upon which sensory impressions were recorded and built up knowledge through a process of reflection. =Baconian science= Francis Bacon was a pivotal figure in establishing the scientific method of investigation. Portrait by Frans Pourbus the Younger (1617). The philosophical underpinnings of the Scientific Revolution were laid out by Francis Bacon, who has been called the father of empiricism. His works established and popularised inductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method, or simply the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today. Bacon proposed a great reformation of all process of knowledge for the advancement of learning divine and human, which he called Instauratio Magna (The Great Instauration). For Bacon, this reformation would lead to a great advancement in science and a progeny of new inventions that would relieve mankind's miseries and needs. His Novum Organum was published in 1620. He argued that man is \\"the minister and interpreter of nature\\", that \\"knowledge and human power are synonymous\\", that \\"effects are produced by the means of instruments and helps\\", and that \\"man while operating can only apply or withdraw natural bodies; nature internally performs the rest\\", and later that \\"nature can only be commanded by obeying her\\". Here is an abstract of the philosophy of this work, that by the knowledge of nature and the using of instruments, man can govern or direct the natural work of nature to produce definite results. Therefore, that man, by seeking knowledge of nature, can reach power over it‚Äîand thus reestablish the \\"Empire of Man over creation\\", which had been lost by the Fall together with man's original purity. In this way, he believed, would mankind be raised above conditions of helplessness, poverty and misery, while coming into a condition of peace, prosperity and security.. For this purpose of obtaining knowledge of and power over nature, Bacon outlined in this work a new system of logic he believed to be superior to the old ways of syllogism, developing his scientific method, consisting of procedures for isolating the formal cause of a phenomenon (heat, for example) through eliminative induction. For him, the philosopher should proceed through inductive reasoning from fact to axiom to physical law. Before beginning this induction, though, the enquirer must free his or her mind from certain false notions or tendencies which distort the truth. In particular, he found that philosophy was too preoccupied with words, particularly discourse and debate, rather than actually observing the material world: \\"For while men believe their reason governs words, in fact, words turn back and reflect their power upon the understanding, and so render philosophy and science sophistical and inactive.\\" Bacon considered that it is of greatest importance to science not to keep doing intellectual discussions or seeking merely contemplative aims, but that it should work for the bettering of mankind's life by bringing forth new inventions, having even stated that \\"inventions are also, as it were, new creations and imitations of divine works\\". He explored the far-reaching and world-changing character of inventions, such as the printing press, gunpowder and the compass. Despite his influence on scientific methodology, he himself rejected correct novel theories such as William Gilbert's magnetism, Copernicus's heliocentrism, and Kepler's laws of planetary motion. =Scientific experimentation= Bacon first described the experimental method. William Gilbert was an early advocate of this method. He passionately rejected both the prevailing Aristotelian philosophy and the Scholastic method of university teaching. His book De Magnete was written in 1600, and he is regarded by some as the father of electricity and magnetism.Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, 2000, CD-ROM, version 2.5. In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the terrella. From these experiments, he concluded that the Earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses point north. William Gilbert's De Magnete, a pioneering work of experimental science De Magnete was influential not only because of the inherent interest of its subject matter, but also for the rigorous way in which Gilbert described his experiments and his rejection of ancient theories of magnetism.Gimpel, Jean (1976) The Medieval Machine: The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages. New York, Penguin. . p. 194. According to Thomas Thomson, \\"Gilbert['s]... book on magnetism published in 1600, is one of the finest examples of inductive philosophy that has ever been presented to the world. It is the more remarkable, because it preceded the Novum Organum of Bacon, in which the inductive method of philosophizing was first explained.\\"Thomson, Thomas (1812) History of the Royal Society: from its Institution to the End of the Eighteenth Century. R. Baldwin. p. 461 Galileo Galilei has been called the \\"father of modern observational astronomy\\", the \\"father of modern physics\\", the \\"father of science\\", and \\"the Father of Modern Science\\". His original contributions to the science of motion were made through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics.Sharratt, pp. 204‚Äì05 On this page Galileo Galilei first noted the moons of Jupiter. Galileo revolutionized the study of the natural world with his rigorous experimental method. Galileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. In The Assayer he wrote \\"Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe ... It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;....\\" His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy.Wallace, William A. (1984) Galileo and His Sources: The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science, Princeton: Princeton Univ. Pr. He ignored Aristotelianism. In broader terms, his work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning. Galileo showed an appreciation for the relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of friction and other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola,Sharratt, pp. 202‚Äì04 but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.Sharratt, 202‚Äì04 =Mathematization= Scientific knowledge, according to the Aristotelians, was concerned with establishing true and necessary causes of things.Dear, Peter (2009) Revolutionizing the Sciences. Princeton University Press. . pp. 65‚Äì67, 134‚Äì38. To the extent that medieval natural philosophers used mathematical problems, they limited social studies to theoretical analyses of local speed and other aspects of life.Grant, pp. 101‚Äì03, 148‚Äì50. The actual measurement of a physical quantity, and the comparison of that measurement to a value computed on the basis of theory, was largely limited to the mathematical disciplines of astronomy and optics in Europe.Pedersen, p. 231.McCluskey, Stephen C. (1998) Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr. pp. 180‚Äì84, 198‚Äì202. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European scientists began increasingly applying quantitative measurements to the measurement of physical phenomena on the Earth. Galileo maintained strongly that mathematics provided a kind of necessary certainty that could be compared to God's: \\"...with regard to those few [mathematical propositions] which the human intellect does understand, I believe its knowledge equals the Divine in objective certainty...\\" * In the 1661 translation by Thomas Salusbury: \\"... the knowledge of those few comprehended by humane understanding, equalleth the divine, as to the certainty objectiv√® ...\\" p. 92 (from the Archimedes Project ) * In the original Italian: \\"... ma di quelle poche intese dall'intelletto umano credo che la cognizione agguagli la divina nella certezza obiettiva, poich√© arriva a comprenderne la necessit√† ...\\" (from the copy at the Italian Wikisource) Galileo anticipates the concept of a systematic mathematical interpretation of the world in his book Il Saggiatore: =The mechanical philosophy= Isaac Newton in a 1702 portrait by Godfrey Kneller Aristotle recognized four kinds of causes, and where applicable, the most important of them is the \\"final cause\\". The final cause was the aim, goal, or purpose of some natural process or man-made thing. Until the Scientific Revolution, it was very natural to see such aims, such as a child's growth, for example, leading to a mature adult. Intelligence was assumed only in the purpose of man-made artifacts; it was not attributed to other animals or to nature. In \\"mechanical philosophy\\" no field or action at a distance is permitted, particles or corpuscles of matter are fundamentally inert. Motion is caused by direct physical collision. Where natural substances had previously been understood organically, the mechanical philosophers viewed them as machines.Westfall, pp. 30‚Äì33. As a result, Isaac Newton's theory seemed like some kind of throwback to \\"spooky action at a distance\\". According to Thomas Kuhn, Newton and Descartes held the teleological principle that God conserved the amount of motion in the universe: > Gravity, interpreted as an innate attraction between every pair of particles > of matter, was an occult quality in the same sense as the scholastics' > \\"tendency to fall\\" had been.... By the mid eighteenth century that > interpretation had been almost universally accepted, and the result was a > genuine reversion (which is not the same as a retrogression) to a scholastic > standard. Innate attractions and repulsions joined size, shape, position and > motion as physically irreducible primary properties of matter.Kuhn, Thomas > (1970), The Structure of Scientific Revolutions . University of Chicago > Press. . pp. 105‚Äì06. Newton had also specifically attributed the inherent power of inertia to matter, against the mechanist thesis that matter has no inherent powers. But whereas Newton vehemently denied gravity was an inherent power of matter, his collaborator Roger Cotes made gravity also an inherent power of matter, as set out in his famous preface to the Principia's 1713 second edition which he edited, and contradicted Newton himself. And it was Cotes's interpretation of gravity rather than Newton's that came to be accepted. =Institutionalization= The Royal Society had its origins in Gresham College in the City of London, and was the first scientific society in the world. The first moves towards the institutionalization of scientific investigation and dissemination took the form of the establishment of societies, where new discoveries were aired, discussed and published. The first scientific society to be established was the Royal Society of London. This grew out of an earlier group, centred around Gresham College in the 1640s and 1650s. According to a history of the College: > The scientific network which centred on Gresham College played a crucial > part in the meetings which led to the formation of the Royal > Society.Chartres, Richard and Vermont, David (1998) A Brief History of > Gresham College. Gresham College. . p. 38 These physicians and natural philosophers were influenced by the \\"new science\\", as promoted by Francis Bacon in his New Atlantis, from approximately 1645 onwards. A group known as The Philosophical Society of Oxford was run under a set of rules still retained by the Bodleian Library. On 28 November 1660, the 1660 committee of 12 announced the formation of a \\"College for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning\\", which would meet weekly to discuss science and run experiments. At the second meeting, Robert Moray announced that the King approved of the gatherings, and a Royal charter was signed on 15 July 1662 creating the \\"Royal Society of London\\", with Lord Brouncker serving as the first President. A second Royal Charter was signed on 23 April 1663, with the King noted as the Founder and with the name of \\"the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge\\"; Robert Hooke was appointed as Curator of Experiments in November. This initial royal favour has continued, and since then every monarch has been the patron of the Society. The French Academy of Sciences was established in 1666. The Society's first Secretary was Henry Oldenburg. Its early meetings included experiments performed first by Robert Hooke and then by Denis Papin, who was appointed in 1684. These experiments varied in their subject area, and were both important in some cases and trivial in others.Henderson (1941) p. 29 The society began publication of Philosophical Transactions from 1665, the oldest and longest- running scientific journal in the world, which established the important principles of scientific priority and peer review. The French established the Academy of Sciences in 1666. In contrast to the private origins of its British counterpart, the Academy was founded as a government body by Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Its rules were set down in 1699 by King Louis XIV, when it received the name of 'Royal Academy of Sciences' and was installed in the Louvre in Paris. New ideas As the Scientific Revolution was not marked by any single change, the following new ideas contributed to what is called the Scientific Revolution. Many of them were revolutions in their own fields. = Astronomy = ;Heliocentrism For almost five millennia, the geocentric model of the Earth as the center of the universe had been accepted by all but a few astronomers. In Aristotle's cosmology, Earth's central location was perhaps less significant than its identification as a realm of imperfection, inconstancy, irregularity and change, as opposed to the \\"heavens\\" (Moon, Sun, planets, stars), which were regarded as perfect, permanent, unchangeable, and in religious thought, the realm of heavenly beings. The Earth was even composed of different material, the four elements \\"earth\\", \\"water\\", \\"fire\\", and \\"air\\", while sufficiently far above its surface (roughly the Moon's orbit), the heavens were composed of different substance called \\"aether\\". The heliocentric model that replaced it involved not only the radical displacement of the earth to an orbit around the sun, but its sharing a placement with the other planets implied a universe of heavenly components made from the same changeable substances as the Earth. Heavenly motions no longer needed to be governed by a theoretical perfection, confined to circular orbits. Portrait of Johannes Kepler Copernicus' 1543 work on the heliocentric model of the solar system tried to demonstrate that the sun was the center of the universe. Few were bothered by this suggestion, and the pope and several archbishops were interested enough by it to want more detail.Hannam, p. 303 His model was later used to create the calendar of Pope Gregory XIII.Hannam, p. 329 However, the idea that the earth moved around the sun was doubted by most of Copernicus' contemporaries. It contradicted not only empirical observation, due to the absence of an observable stellar parallax,Hannam, p. 283 but more significantly at the time, the authority of Aristotle. The discoveries of Johannes Kepler and Galileo gave the theory credibility. Kepler was an astronomer who, using the accurate observations of Tycho Brahe, proposed that the planets move around the sun not in circular orbits, but in elliptical ones. Together with his other laws of planetary motion, this allowed him to create a model of the solar system that was an improvement over Copernicus' original system. Galileo's main contributions to the acceptance of the heliocentric system were his mechanics, the observations he made with his telescope, as well as his detailed presentation of the case for the system. Using an early theory of inertia, Galileo could explain why rocks dropped from a tower fall straight down even if the earth rotates. His observations of the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, the spots on the sun, and mountains on the moon all helped to discredit the Aristotelian philosophy and the Ptolemaic theory of the solar system. Through their combined discoveries, the heliocentric system gained support, and at the end of the 17th century it was generally accepted by astronomers. This work culminated in the work of Isaac Newton. Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos. This work also demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. His prediction that the Earth should be shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by other scientists. His laws of motion were to be the solid foundation of mechanics; his law of universal gravitation combined terrestrial and celestial mechanics into one great system that seemed to be able to describe the whole world in mathematical formulae. ;Gravitation Isaac Newton's Principia, developed the first set of unified scientific laws. As well as proving the heliocentric model, Newton also developed the theory of gravitation. In 1679, Newton began to consider gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679‚Äì80 with Robert Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions.Correspondence of Isaac Newton, vol. 2, 1676‚Äì1687 ed. H.W. Turnbull, Cambridge University Press 1960; at page 297, document No. 235, letter from Hooke to Newton dated 24 November 1679. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680‚Äì1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed.Westfall, pp. 391‚Äì92 After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation ‚Äì History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, in 1684.Whiteside D.T. (ed.) (1974) Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton, vol. 6, 1684‚Äì1691, Cambridge University Press. p. 30. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.Isaac Newton (1643‚Äì1727), BBC ‚Äì History The Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley.Halley biography . Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk. Retrieved on 26 September 2011. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion that contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not to be improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation. Newton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing \\"occult agencies\\" into science.Edelglass et al., Matter and Mind, . p. 54 Later, in the second edition of the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression \\"hypotheses non fingo\\"On the meaning and origins of this expression, see Kirsten Walsh, Does Newton feign an hypothesis?, Early Modern Experimental Philosophy, 18 October 2010.). =Biology and medicine= ;Medical discoveries Vesalius's intricately detailed drawings of human dissections in Fabrica helped to overturn the medical theories of Galen. The writings of Greek physician Galen had dominated European medical thinking for over a millennium. The Flemish scholar Vesalius demonstrated mistakes in the Galen's ideas. Vesalius dissected human corpses, whereas Galen dissected animal corpses. Published in 1543, Vesalius' De humani corporis fabricaPage through a virtual copy of Vesalius's De Humanis Corporis Fabrica. Archive.nlm.nih.gov. Retrieved on 26 September 2011. was a groundbreaking work of human anatomy. It emphasized the priority of dissection and what has come to be called the \\"anatomical\\" view of the body, seeing human internal functioning as an essentially corporeal structure filled with organs arranged in three- dimensional space. This was in stark contrast to many of the anatomical models used previously, which had strong Galenic/Aristotelean elements, as well as elements of astrology. Besides the first good description of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six; and described accurately the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone. He not only verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, but he described the vena azygos, and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named ductus venosus. He described the omentum, and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon; gave the first correct views of the structure of the pylorus; observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first good account of the mediastinum and pleura and the fullest description of the anatomy of the brain yet advanced. He did not understand the inferior recesses; and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth and the fifth as the seventh. Before Vesalius, the anatomical notes by Alessandro Achillini demonstrate a detailed description of the human body and compares what he has found during his dissections to what others like Galen and Avicenna have found and notes their similarities and differences. Niccol√≤ Massa was an Italian anatomist who wrote an early anatomy text Anatomiae Libri Introductorius in 1536, described the cerebrospinal fluid and was the author of several medical works. Jean Fernel was a French physician who introduced the term \\"physiology\\" to describe the study of the body's function and was the first person to describe the spinal canal. Further groundbreaking work was carried out by William Harvey, who published De Motu Cordis in 1628. Harvey made a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart, going on to an analysis of the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery. He noticed that the two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently like had been thought previously by his predecessors.Harvey, William De motu cordis, cited in Debus, Allen G. (1978) Man and Nature in the Renaissance. Cambridge Univ. Pr. p. 69. Image of thumb In the eighth chapter, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each pump of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in half an hour. From these estimations, he demonstrated that according to Gaelen's theory that blood was continually produced in the liver, the absurdly large figure of 540 pounds of blood would have to be produced every day. Having this simple mathematical proportion at hand‚Äîwhich would imply a seemingly impossible role for the liver‚ÄîHarvey went on to demonstrate how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on serpents and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up. This process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood. Various other advances in medical understanding and practice were made. French physician Pierre Fauchard started dentistry science as we know it today, and he has been named \\"the father of modern dentistry\\". Surgeon Ambroise Par√© (c. 1510‚Äì1590) was a leader in surgical techniques and battlefield medicine, especially the treatment of wounds,Zimmer, Carl. (2004) Soul Made Flesh: The Discovery of the Brain ‚Äì and How It Changed the World. New York: Free Press. and Herman Boerhaave (1668‚Äì1738) is sometimes referred to as a \\"father of physiology\\" due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and his textbook Institutiones medicae (1708). =Chemistry= Title page from The Sceptical Chymist, a foundational text of chemistry, written by Robert Boyle in 1661 Chemistry, and its antecedent alchemy, became an increasingly important aspect of scientific thought in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries. The importance of chemistry is indicated by the range of important scholars who actively engaged in chemical research. Among them were the astronomer Tycho Brahe, the chemical physician Paracelsus, Robert Boyle, Thomas Browne and Isaac Newton. Unlike the mechanical philosophy, the chemical philosophy stressed the active powers of matter, which alchemists frequently expressed in terms of vital or active principles‚Äîof spirits operating in nature.Westfall, Richard S. (1983) Never at Rest. Cambridge University Press. . pp. 18‚Äì23. Practical attempts to improve the refining of ores and their extraction to smelt metals were an important source of information for early chemists in the 16th century, among them Georg Agricola (1494‚Äì1555), who published his great work De re metallica in 1556.Agricola, Georg (1494‚Äì1555). Scs.uiuc.edu. Retrieved on 26 September 2011. His work describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. His approach removed the mysticism associated with the subject, creating the practical base upon which others could build.von Zittel, Karl Alfred (1901) History of Geology and Palaeontology, p. 15 English chemist Robert Boyle (1627‚Äì1691) is considered to have refined the modern scientific method for alchemy and to have separated chemistry further from alchemy.Robert Boyle. understandingscience.ucc.ie Although his research clearly has its roots in the alchemical tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. Although Boyle was not the original discover, he is best known for Boyle's law, which he presented in 1662: the law describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system.Levine, Ira. N (1978). \\"Physical Chemistry\\" University of Brooklyn: McGraw-Hill. p. 12 Boyle is also credited for his landmark publication The Sceptical Chymist in 1661, which is seen as a cornerstone book in the field of chemistry. In the work, Boyle presents his hypothesis that every phenomenon was the result of collisions of particles in motion. Boyle appealed to chemists to experiment and asserted that experiments denied the limiting of chemical elements to only the classic four: earth, fire, air, and water. He also pleaded that chemistry should cease to be subservient to medicine or to alchemy, and rise to the status of a science. Importantly, he advocated a rigorous approach to scientific experiment: he believed all theories must be tested experimentally before being regarded as true. The work contains some of the earliest modern ideas of atoms, molecules, and chemical reaction, and marks the beginning of the history of modern chemistry. = Physical = ;Optics Newton's Opticks or a treatise of the reflections, refractions, inflections and colours of light Important work was done in the field of optics. Johannes Kepler published Astronomiae Pars Optica (The Optical Part of Astronomy) in 1604. In it, he described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent).Caspar, Max (1993) Kepler. Courier Corporation. . pp. 142‚Äì46 Willebrord Snellius (1580‚Äì1626) found the mathematical law of refraction, now known as Snell's law, in 1621. Subsequently Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42¬∞ (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42¬∞). He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law. Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695) wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the Opera reliqua (also known as Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma) and the Trait√© de la lumi√®re. Isaac Newton investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into a spectrum of colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already- coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours. The interest of the Royal Society encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour (later expanded into Opticks). Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light. In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \\"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\\" quoting Opticks ;Electricity Otto von Guericke's experiments on electrostatics, published 1672 Dr. William Gilbert, in De Magnete, invented the New Latin word electricus from ' (elektron), the Greek word for \\"amber\\". Gilbert undertook a number of careful electrical experiments, in the course of which he discovered that many substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc.,Priestley, Joseph (1757) History of Electricity. London were capable of manifesting electrical properties. Gilbert also discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the electrification of all bodies, due to the now well- known fact that moisture impaired the insulation of such bodies. He also noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet only attracted iron. The many discoveries of this nature earned for Gilbert the title of founder of the electrical science.Maver, William, Jr.: \\"Electricity, its History and Progress\\", The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge, vol. X, pp. 172ff. (1918). New York: Encyclopedia Americana Corp. By investigating the forces on a light metallic needle, balanced on a point, he extended the list of electric bodies, and found also that many substances, including metals and natural magnets, showed no attractive forces when rubbed. He noticed that dry weather with north or east wind was the most favourable atmospheric condition for exhibiting electric phenomena‚Äîan observation liable to misconception until the difference between conductor and insulator was understood.Dampier, W.C.D. (1905). The theory of experimental electricity. Cambridge physical series. Cambridge [Eng.: University Press. Robert Boyle also worked frequently at the new science of electricity, and added several substances to Gilbert's list of electrics. He left a detailed account of his researches under the title of Experiments on the Origin of Electricity. Boyle, in 1675, stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum. One of his important discoveries was that electrified bodies in a vacuum would attract light substances, this indicating that the electrical effect did not depend upon the air as a medium. He also added resin to the then known list of electrics.Benjamin, P. (1895). A history of electricity: (The intellectual rise in electricity) from antiquity to the days of Benjamin Franklin. New York: J. Wiley & Sons.Boyle, Robert (1676). Experiments and notes about the mechanical origin or production of particular qualities.Boyle, Robert (1675) Experiments on the Origin of Electricity This was followed in 1660 by Otto von Guericke, who invented an early electrostatic generator. By the end of the 17th century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction with an electrostatic generator, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity. The first usage of the word electricity is ascribed to Sir Thomas Browne in his 1646 work, Pseudodoxia Epidemica. In 1729 Stephen Gray (1666‚Äì1736) demonstrated that electricity could be \\"transmitted\\" through metal filaments. New mechanical devices As an aid to scientific investigation, various tools, measuring aids and calculating devices were developed in this period. =Calculating devices= An ivory set of Napier's Bones, an early calculating device invented by John Napier John Napier introduced logarithms as a powerful mathematical tool. With the help of the prominent mathematician Henry Briggs their logarithmic tables embodied a computational advance that made calculations by hand much quicker. His Napier's bones used a set of numbered rods as a multiplication tool using the system of lattice multiplication. The way was opened to later scientific advances, particularly in astronomy and dynamics. At Oxford University, Edmund Gunter built the first analog device to aid computation. The 'Gunter's scale' was a large plane scale, engraved with various scales, or lines. Natural lines, such as the line of chords, the line of sines and tangents are placed on one side of the scale and the corresponding artificial or logarithmic ones were on the other side. This calculating aid was a predecessor of the slide rule. It was William Oughtred (1575‚Äì1660) who first used two such scales sliding by one another to perform direct multiplication and division, and thus is credited as the inventor of the slide rule in 1622. Blaise Pascal (1623‚Äì1662) invented the mechanical calculator in 1642. citing The introduction of his Pascaline in 1645 launched the development of mechanical calculators first in Europe and then all over the world.Pascal biography. Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk. Retrieved on 26 September 2011. Gottfried Leibniz (1646‚Äì1716), building on Pascal's work, became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators; he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator, in 1685, and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, foundation of virtually all modern computer architectures. John Hadley (1682‚Äì1744) was the inventor of the octant, the precursor to the sextant (invented by John Bird), which greatly improved the science of navigation. =Industrial machines= Savery Engine was the first successful steam engine Denis Papin (1647‚Äì1712) was best known for his pioneering invention of the steam digester, the forerunner of the steam engine. The first working steam engine was patented in 1698 by the English inventor Thomas Savery, as a \\"...new invention for raising of water and occasioning motion to all sorts of mill work by the impellent force of fire, which will be of great use and advantage for drayning mines, serveing townes with water, and for the working of all sorts of mills where they have not the benefitt of water nor constant windes.\\" The invention was demonstrated to the Royal Society on 14 June 1699 and the machine was described by Savery in his book The Miner's Friend; or, An Engine to Raise Water by Fire (1702), in which he claimed that it could pump water out of mines. Thomas Newcomen (1664‚Äì1729) perfected the practical steam engine for pumping water, the Newcomen steam engine. Consequently, Thomas Newcomen can be regarded as a forefather of the Industrial Revolution.Thomas Newcomen (1663‚Äì1729), BBC ‚Äì History Abraham Darby I (1678‚Äì1717) was the first, and most famous, of three generations of the Darby family who played an important role in the Industrial Revolution. He developed a method of producing high-grade iron in a blast furnace fueled by coke rather than charcoal. This was a major step forward in the production of iron as a raw material for the Industrial Revolution. =Telescopes= Refracting telescopes first appeared in the Netherlands in 1608, apparently the product of spectacle makers experimenting with lenses. The inventor is unknown but Hans Lippershey applied for the first patent, followed by Jacob Metius of Alkmaar.galileo.rice.edu The Galileo Project > Science > The Telescope by Al Van Helden \\"The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg, Sacharias Janssen had a telescope at about the same time but was at the Frankfurt Fair where he tried to sell it\\" Galileo was one of the first scientists to use this new tool for his astronomical observations in 1609. The reflecting telescope was described by James Gregory in his book Optica Promota (1663). He argued that a mirror shaped like the part of a conic section, would correct the spherical aberration that flawed the accuracy of refracting telescopes. His design, the \\"Gregorian telescope\\", however, remained un-built. In 1666, Isaac Newton argued that the faults of the refracting telescope were fundamental because the lens refracted light of different colors differently. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations.Newton, Isaac. Optics, bk. i. pt. ii. prop. 3 From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope.Treatise on Optics, p. 112 However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a reflecting telescope. It was completed in 1668 and is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.Hall, Alfred Rupert. Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought. p. 67 50 years later, John Hadley developed ways to make precision aspheric and parabolic objective mirrors for reflecting telescopes, building the first parabolic Newtonian telescope and a Gregorian telescope with accurately shaped mirrors.telescope—≤ptics.net ‚Äì 8.2. Two-mirror telescopes. Telescope-optics.net. Retrieved on 26 September 2011. These were successfully demonstrated to the Royal Society. =Other devices= Air pump built by Robert Boyle. Many new instruments were devised in this period, which greatly aided in the expansion of scientific knowledge. The invention of the vacuum pump paved the way for the experiments of Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke into the nature of vacuum and atmospheric pressure. The first such device was made by Otto von Guericke in 1654. It consisted of a piston and an air gun cylinder with flaps that could suck the air from any vessel that it was connected to. In 1657, he pumped the air out of two conjoined hemispheres and demonstrated that a team of sixteen horses were incapable of pulling it apart. The air pump construction was greatly improved by Robert Hooke in 1658. Evangelista Torricelli (1607‚Äì1647) was best known for his invention of the mercury barometer. The motivation for the invention was to improve on the suction pumps that were used to raise water out of the mines. Torricelli constructed a sealed tube filled with mercury, set vertically into a basin of the same substance. The column of mercury fell downwards, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above. = Materials, construction, and aesthetics = Surviving instruments from this period, tend to be made of durable metals such as brass, gold, or steel, although examples such as telescopes made of wood, pasteboard, or with leather components exist. Those instruments that exist in collections today tend to be robust examples, made by skilled craftspeople for and at the expense of wealthy patrons. These may have been commissioned as displays of wealth. In addition, the instruments preserved in collections may not have received heavy use in scientific work; instruments that had visibly received heavy use were typically destroyed, deemed unfit for display, or excluded from collections altogether. It is also postulated that the scientific instruments preserved in many collections were chosen because they were more appealing to collectors, by virtue of being more ornate, more portable, or made with higher-grade materials. Intact air pumps are particularly rare. The pump at right included a glass sphere to permit demonstrations inside the vacuum chamber, a common use. The base was wooden, and the cylindrical pump was brass. Other vacuum chambers that survived were made of brass hemispheres. Instrument makers of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century were commissioned by organizations seeking help with navigation, surveying, warfare, and astronomical observation. The increase in uses for such instruments, and their widespread use in global exploration and conflict, created a need for new methods of manufacture and repair, which would be met by the Industrial Revolution. Scientific developments People and key ideas that emerged from the 16th and 17th centuries: * First printed edition of Euclid's Elements in 1482. * Nicolaus Copernicus (1473‚Äì1543) published On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres in 1543, which advanced the heliocentric theory of cosmology. * Andreas Vesalius (1514‚Äì1564) published De Humani Corporis Fabrica (On the Structure of the Human Body) (1543), which discredited Galen's views. He found that the circulation of blood resolved from pumping of the heart. He also assembled the first human skeleton from cutting open cadavers. * The French mathematician Fran√ßois Vi√®te (1540‚Äì1603) published In Artem Analycitem Isagoge (1591), which gave the first symbolic notation of parameters in literal algebra. * William Gilbert (1544‚Äì1603) published On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth in 1600, which laid the foundations of a theory of magnetism and electricity. * Tycho Brahe (1546‚Äì1601) made extensive and more accurate naked eye observations of the planets in the late 16th century. These became the basic data for Kepler's studies. * Sir Francis Bacon (1561‚Äì1626) published Novum Organum in 1620, which outlined a new system of logic based on the process of reduction, which he offered as an improvement over Aristotle's philosophical process of syllogism. This contributed to the development of what became known as the scientific method. * Galileo Galilei (1564‚Äì1642) improved the telescope, with which he made several important astronomical observations, including the four largest moons of Jupiter (1610), the phases of Venus (1610 ‚Äì proving Copernicus correct), the rings of Saturn (1610), and made detailed observations of sunspots. He developed the laws for falling bodies based on pioneering quantitative experiments which he analyzed mathematically. * Johannes Kepler (1571‚Äì1630) published the first two of his three laws of planetary motion in 1609. * William Harvey (1578‚Äì1657) demonstrated that blood circulates, using dissections and other experimental techniques. * Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1650) published his Discourse on the Method in 1637, which helped to establish the scientific method. * Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632‚Äì1723) constructed powerful single lens microscopes and made extensive observations that he published around 1660, opening up the micro-world of biology. * Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695) published major studies of mechanics (he was the first one to correctly formulate laws concerning centrifugal force and discovered the theory of the pendulum) and optics (being one of the most influential proponents of the wave theory of light). * Isaac Newton (1643‚Äì1727) built upon the work of Kepler, Galileo and Huygens. He showed that an inverse square law for gravity explained the elliptical orbits of the planets, and advanced the law of universal gravitation. His development of infinitesimal calculus (along with Leibniz) opened up new applications of the methods of mathematics to science. Newton taught that scientific theory should be coupled with rigorous experimentation, which became the keystone of modern science. Criticism Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in Athanasius Kircher, La Chine ... Illustr√©e, Amsterdam, 1670. The idea that modern science took place as a kind of revolution has been debated among historians. A weakness of the idea of scientific revolution is the lack of a systematic approach to the question of knowledge in the period comprehended between the 14th and 17th centuries, leading to misunderstandings on the value and role of modern authors. From this standpoint, the continuity thesis is the hypothesis that there was no radical discontinuity between the intellectual development of the Middle Ages and the developments in the Renaissance and early modern period and has been deeply and widely documented by the works of scholars like Pierre Duhem, John Hermann Randall, Alistair Crombie and William A. Wallace, who proved the preexistence of a wide range of ideas used by the followers of the Scientific Revolution thesis to substantiate their claims. Thus, the idea of a scientific revolution following the Renaissance is‚Äîaccording to the continuity thesis‚Äîa myth. Some continuity theorists point to earlier intellectual revolutions occurring in the Middle Ages, usually referring to either a European Renaissance of the 12th centuryGrantHannam, James (31 October 2012) Medieval Christianity and the Rise of Modern Science, Part 2 . biologos.org or a medieval Muslim scientific revolution,Hassan, Ahmad Y and Hill, Donald Routledge (1986), Islamic Technology: An Illustrated History, p. 282, Cambridge University Press.Salam, Abdus, Dalafi, H.R. and Hassan, Mohamed (1994). Renaissance of Sciences in Islamic Countries, p. 162. World Scientific, .Briffault, Robert (1919). The Making of Humanity. London, G. Allen & Unwin ltd. p. 188. as a sign of continuity.Huff, Toby E. (2003) The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China and the West, 2nd. ed., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . pp. 54‚Äì55. Another contrary view has been recently proposed by Arun Bala in his dialogical history of the birth of modern science. Bala proposes that the changes involved in the Scientific Revolution‚Äîthe mathematical realist turn, the mechanical philosophy, the atomism, the central role assigned to the Sun in Copernican heliocentrism‚Äîhave to be seen as rooted in multicultural influences on Europe. He sees specific influences in Alhazen's physical optical theory, Chinese mechanical technologies leading to the perception of the world as a machine, the Hindu- Arabic numeral system, which carried implicitly a new mode of mathematical atomic thinking, and the heliocentrism rooted in ancient Egyptian religious ideas associated with Hermeticism.Saliba, George (1999). Whose Science is Arabic Science in Renaissance Europe? Columbia University. Bala argues that by ignoring such multicultural impacts we have been led to a Eurocentric conception of the Scientific Revolution.Bala, Arun (2006) Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science. Palgrave Macmillan. However, he clearly states: \\"The makers of the revolution‚ÄîCopernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and many others‚Äîhad to selectively appropriate relevant ideas, transform them, and create new auxiliary concepts in order to complete their task... In the ultimate analysis, even if the revolution was rooted upon a multicultural base it is the accomplishment of Europeans in Europe.\\"\\"Book Review of The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science by Arun Bala \\". MuslimHeritage.com Critics note that lacking documentary evidence of transmission of specific scientific ideas, Bala's model will remain \\"a working hypothesis, not a conclusion\\". A third approach takes the term \\"Renaissance\\" literally as a \\"rebirth\\". A closer study of Greek philosophy and Greek mathematics demonstrates that nearly all of the so-called revolutionary results of the so-called scientific revolution were in actuality restatements of ideas that were in many cases older than those of Aristotle and in nearly all cases at least as old as Archimedes. Aristotle even explicitly argues against some of the ideas that were espoused during the Scientific Revolution, such as heliocentrism. The basic ideas of the scientific method were well known to Archimedes and his contemporaries, as demonstrated in the well-known discovery of buoyancy. Atomism was first thought of by Leucippus and Democritus. Lucio Russo claims that science as a unique approach to objective knowledge was born in the Hellenistic period (c. 300 BC), but was extinguished with the advent of the Roman Empire. This approach to the Scientific Revolution reduces it to a period of relearning classical ideas that is very much an extension of the Renaissance. This view does not deny that a change occurred but argues that it was a reassertion of previous knowledge (a renaissance) and not the creation of new knowledge. It cites statements from Newton, Copernicus and others in favour of the Pythagorean worldview as evidence.A survey of the debate over the significance of these antecedents is in Lindberg, D.C. (1992) The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, 600 B.C. to A.D. 1450. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr. . pp. 355‚Äì68. In more recent analysis of the Scientific Revolution during this period, there has been criticism of not only the Eurocentric ideologies spread, but also of the dominance of male scientists of the time. Female scholars were not always given the opportunities that a male scholar would have had, and the incorporation of women's work in the sciences during this time tends to be obscured. Scholars have tried to look into the participation of women in the 17th century in science, and even with sciences as simple as domestic knowledge women were making advances. With the limited history provided from texts of the period we are not completely aware if women were helping these scientists develop the ideas they did. Another idea to consider is the way this period influenced even the women scientists of the periods following it. Annie Jump Cannon was an astronomer who benefitted from the laws and theories developed from this period; she made several advances in the century following the Scientific Revolution. It was an important period for the future of science, including the incorporation of women into fields using the developments made.

The dynasty provided four kings of Germany (1024‚Äì1125), all of whom went on to be crowned Holy Roman emperors (1027‚Äì1125). After the death of the last Ottonian emperor in 1024, the Kingdom of Germany and later the entire Holy Roman Empire passed to Conrad II, a Salian. He was followed by three more Salian rulers: Henry III, Henry IV, and Henry V. They established their monarchy as a major European power. The Salian dynasty developed a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown. Origins and name Family tree of the imperial dynasties of the Holy Roman Empire: Carolingians, Ottonians, Salians and Hohenstaufen. Modern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the Widonids, a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers Moselle and Saar and they supported the Carolingians. The Widonids' eastward expansion towards the river Rhine started after they founded Hornbach Abbey in the Bliesgau around 750. Hornbach remained their proprietary monastery and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the Wormsgau. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians' forefathers remained in Rhenish Franconia. Wipo of Burgundy, the biographer of the first Salian monarch, Emperor Conrad II, described Conrad's father and uncle as \\"distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia\\", but without calling them Salians around 1044. Wipo added that Conrad's mother, Adelaide of Metz, \\"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of Troy\\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal Merovingians who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relationship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as the Salic law. A less likely etymology links the appellation to the old German world sal (\\"lordship\\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures. The term reges salici (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th century. A list of monarchs and archbishops from Mainz, which was completed around 1139‚Äì40, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop Otto of Freising, a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his Chronicle or History of the Two Cities in the middle of the 12th century. In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appellation has already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians. All male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named Conrad or Henry. Emperor Conrad II's grandfather, Otto of Worms, established this tradition in the late 10th century. He named his eldest son, Henry of Worms, after his maternal great- grandfather, King Henry the Fowler; and he gave the name of his father, Conrad the Red, to one of his younger sons, Conrad of Carinthia. Conrad the Red was most probably named for King Conrad I of Germany. Early Salians =Werner= Map of the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th and 11th centuries: Germany (blue), Italy (grey), Burgundy (orange to the West), Bohemia (orange to the East), Papal States (purple). Count Werner who held estates in the Nahegau, Speyergau and Wormsgau early in the 10th century is the Salian monarchs' first certainly identified ancestor. His family links to the Widonids cannot be securely established, but his patrimonial lands and his close relationship with the Hornbach Abbey provide indirect evidence of his Widonid ancestry. He married a kinswoman, most probably a sister, of King Conrad I of Germany. This marriage alliance with the Conradines introduced Conrad as a leading name in his family. =Conrad the Red= Werner's son, Conrad the Red, inherited his father Franconian estates. His family links with the Conradines facilitated his acquisition of large portions of their domains after King Otto I of Germany crushed their revolt in 939. The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto I's principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the Duchy of Lotharingia in 944 or 945 and he married the King's daughter, Luidgard, in 947. The marriage forged a link between the royal Ottonian dynasty and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in- law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading Magyars in the Battle of Lech in 955. The contemporaneous Widukind of Corvey praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the Worms Cathedral, although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals. =Otto of Worms= Conrad the Red's son, Otto of Worms, founded favour with his maternal grandfather, King (from 962 Emperor) Otto I. Still a minor, he was mentioned as a count in the Nahegau in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, Niddagau, Elsenzgau, Kraichgau and Pfinzgau, thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and Neckar by the time Otto I deceased in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, to Count Henry of Arlon, or to Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches. Otto I's son and successor, Emperor Otto II, was obviously worried about the concentration of lands in his nephew's hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway Duchy of Carinthia and March of Verona in 978. The Emperor also persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms and also parts of his revenues in the town, to the local bishop. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in Wasgau, the royal palace at Kaiserslautern and the properietary rights over Weissenburg Abbey. He could also preserve the title of duke, thus he was the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor, thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor's death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, Henry of Bavaria in 1002. Henry restored Carinthia to Otto in 1002 and he ruled the duchy until his death in 1004. Dukes and bishops =Henry of Worms= Pope Gregory V anoints Emperor Otto III (a miniature by an unidentified author, 1450). Henry was Otto of Worms's eldest son. His wife, Adelaide, was born into a prominent Lotharingian family, being the daughter of Richard, Count of Metz. Their son, Conrad, would be the first Salian monarch, but Henry could not transfer his seniority rights to his son, because he predeceased his father most probably in 990 or 991. =Conrad of Carinthia= After Henry of Worms' premature death, his seniority rights shifted to his younger brother, Conrad, enabling him to inherit the major part of the patrimonial lands from his father. Conrad married a daughter of Herman II, Duke of Swabia, Matilda most probably in 1002. Two years later, he succeeded his father as Duke of Carinthia‚Äîthe duchy passed from father to son for the first time on this occasion. His rule in Carinthia is poorly documented and he died in 1011. =Pope Gregory V= Bruno‚Äîthe future Pope Gregory V‚Äîwas a younger son of Otto of Worms. His father's cousin, Otto III, placed him on the papal throne in 996, ignoring the provisions of his own Diploma Ottonianum on papal elections. Bruno, who was the first German pope, assumed his papal name in memory of Pope Gregory the Great. He crowned Otto III emperor on the Feast of the Ascension in the same year. The Roman aristocrat Crescentius the Younger expelled him from Rome, but the Emperor crushed the revolt and restored the papal throne to Gregory V. The Pope died at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven in 999. =William of Strasbourg= William was Otto of Worms' youngest son. After serving in the royal court as archchaplain to Queen Gisella, William was made bishop of Strasbourg in 1028 or 1029. The see of Strasbourg was one of the wealthiest German bishoprics. His tenure was almost uneventful and he died in 1046 or 1047. =Conrad the Younger= Conrad, the elder son of Duke Conrad I of Carinthia and Matilda of Swabia, was born between 1002 and 1005. He was underage when his father died in 1011. He inherited his father's patrimonial lands, but Emperor Henry II made Adalbero of Eppelstein the new duke of Carinthia. After Emperor Henry II died in 1024, both Conrad and his cousin, Conrad the Elder, laid claim to the throne and Conrad the Elder was elected the new monarch. Imperial Salians Salian monarchy After the death of the last Saxon Emperor Henry II, the first Salian regent, Conrad II was elected by the majority of the Prince-electors and was crowned German king in Mainz on 8 September 1024. Early in 1026 Conrad went to Milan, where Ariberto, archbishop of Milan, crowned him king of Italy. When Rudolph III, King of Burgundy died in 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven√ßal nobles paid homage to Conrad in Z√ºrich in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the Kingdom of Arles under Conrad's successors. Already in 1028 Conrad II had his son Henry III elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign Speyer Cathedral was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in Lorraine, this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052‚Äì1055. 1046 Henry ended the papal schism, freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire. Speyer Cathedral, burial place of all Salian Emperors The early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the Church, a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the Investiture Controversy (or Investiture Dispute), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, Gregory VII, demanded that Emperor Henry IV renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to Canossa in northern Italy in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an antipope (Antipope Clement III) in 1080. The monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the Concordat of Worms in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty Henry V coincided with the final phase of the great Investiture Controversy, which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of Gregorian reformers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes. According to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire ‚Äì in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in France and Italy. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century. The first Hohenstaufen king Conrad III was a grandson of the Salian Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. (Agnes, Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty and her second marriage the ducal Babenberg potentates of Duchy of Austria which was elevated much due to such connections Privilegium Minus.)

Biological cells, given suitable environments, reproduce by cell division. During cell division, DNA is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction. Biological viruses can replicate, but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection. Harmful prion proteins can replicate by converting normal proteins into rogue forms. Computer viruses reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers. Self-replication in robotics has been an area of research and a subject of interest in science fiction. Any self-replicating mechanism which does not make a perfect copy (mutation) will experience genetic variation and will create variants of itself. These variants will be subject to natural selection, since some will be better at surviving in their current environment than others and will out-breed them. Overview =Theory= Early research by John von Neumann established that replicators have several parts: *A coded representation of the replicator *A mechanism to copy the coded representation *A mechanism for effecting construction within the host environment of the replicator Exceptions to this pattern may be possible, although none have yet been achieved. For example, scientists have come close to constructing RNA that can be copied in an \\"environment\\" that is a solution of RNA monomers and transcriptase. In this case, the body is the genome, and the specialized copy mechanisms are external. The requirement for an outside copy mechanism has not yet been overcome, and such systems are more accurately characterized as \\"assisted replication\\" than \\"self-replication\\". However, the simplest possible case is that only a genome exists. Without some specification of the self-reproducing steps, a genome-only system is probably better characterized as something like a crystal. =Classes of self- replication= Recent research has begun to categorize replicators, often based on the amount of support they require. *Natural replicators have all or most of their design from nonhuman sources. Such systems include natural life forms. *Autotrophic replicators can reproduce themselves \\"in the wild\\". They mine their own materials. It is conjectured that non-biological autotrophic replicators could be designed by humans, and could easily accept specifications for human products. *Self-reproductive systems are conjectured systems which would produce copies of themselves from industrial feedstocks such as metal bar and wire. *Self-assembling systems assemble copies of themselves from finished, delivered parts. Simple examples of such systems have been demonstrated at the macro scale. The design space for machine replicators is very broad. A comprehensive study to date by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle has identified 137 design dimensions grouped into a dozen separate categories, including: (1) Replication Control, (2) Replication Information, (3) Replication Substrate, (4) Replicator Structure, (5) Passive Parts, (6) Active Subunits, (7) Replicator Energetics, (8) Replicator Kinematics, (9) Replication Process, (10) Replicator Performance, (11) Product Structure, and (12) Evolvability. =A self-replicating computer program= In computer science a quine is a self-reproducing computer program that, when executed, outputs its own code. For example, a quine in the Python programming language is: :\`a='a=%r;print(a%%a)';print(a%a)\` A more trivial approach is to write a program that will make a copy of any stream of data that it is directed to, and then direct it at itself. In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated. This approach is common in most self-replicating systems, including biological life, and is simpler as it does not require the program to contain a complete description of itself. In many programming languages an empty program is legal, and executes without producing errors or other output. The output is thus the same as the source code, so the program is trivially self-reproducing. =Self- replicating tiling= In geometry a self-replicating tiling is a tiling pattern in which several congruent tiles may be joined together to form a larger tile that is similar to the original. This is an aspect of the field of study known as tessellation. The \\"sphinx\\" hexiamond is the only known self- replicating pentagon.For an image that does not show how this replicates, see: Eric W. Weisstein. \\"Sphinx.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sphinx.html For example, four such concave pentagons can be joined together to make one with twice the dimensions.For further illustrations, see Teaching TILINGS / TESSELLATIONS with Geo Sphinx Solomon W. Golomb coined the term rep-tiles for self-replicating tilings. In 2012, Lee Sallows identified rep-tiles as a special instance of a self-tiling tile set or setiset. A setiset of order n is a set of n shapes that can be assembled in n different ways so as to form larger replicas of themselves. Setisets in which every shape is distinct are called 'perfect'. A rep-n rep- tile is just a setiset composed of n identical pieces. { - style=\\"vertical- align:bottom;\\" sphinx' hexiamonds can be put together to form another sphinx. setiset of order 4 } =Self replicating clay crystals= One form of natural self-replication that isn't based on DNA or RNA occurs in clay crystals. Clay consists of a large number of small crystals, and clay is an environment that promotes crystal growth. Crystals consist of a regular lattice of atoms and are able to grow if e.g. placed in a water solution containing the crystal components; automatically arranging atoms at the crystal boundary into the crystalline form. Crystals may have irregularities where the regular atomic structure is broken, and when crystals grow, these irregularities may propagate, creating a form of self-replication of crystal irregularities. Because these irregularities may affect the probability of a crystal breaking apart to form new crystals, crystals with such irregularities could even be considered to undergo evolutionary development. =Applications= It is a long-term goal of some engineering sciences to achieve a clanking replicator, a material device that can self-replicate. The usual reason is to achieve a low cost per item while retaining the utility of a manufactured good. Many authorities say that in the limit, the cost of self- replicating items should approach the cost-per-weight of wood or other biological substances, because self-replication avoids the costs of labor, capital and distribution in conventional manufactured goods. A fully novel artificial replicator is a reasonable near-term goal. A NASA study recently placed the complexity of a clanking replicator at approximately that of Intel's Pentium 4 CPU. That is, the technology is achievable with a relatively small engineering group in a reasonable commercial time-scale at a reasonable cost. Given the currently keen interest in biotechnology and the high levels of funding in that field, attempts to exploit the replicative ability of existing cells are timely, and may easily lead to significant insights and advances. A variation of self replication is of practical relevance in compiler construction, where a similar bootstrapping problem occurs as in natural self replication. A compiler (phenotype) can be applied on the compiler's own source code (genotype) producing the compiler itself. During compiler development, a modified (mutated) source is used to create the next generation of the compiler. This process differs from natural self-replication in that the process is directed by an engineer, not by the subject itself. Mechanical self-replication An activity in the field of robots is the self-replication of machines. Since all robots (at least in modern times) have a fair number of the same features, a self-replicating robot (or possibly a hive of robots) would need to do the following: *Obtain construction materials *Manufacture new parts including its smallest parts and thinking apparatus *Provide a consistent power source *Program the new members *error correct any mistakes in the offspring On a nano scale, assemblers might also be designed to self-replicate under their own power. This, in turn, has given rise to the \\"grey goo\\" version of Armageddon, as featured in such science fiction novels as Bloom, Prey, and Recursion. The Foresight Institute has published guidelines for researchers in mechanical self-replication. The guidelines recommend that researchers use several specific techniques for preventing mechanical replicators from getting out of control, such as using a broadcast architecture. For a detailed article on mechanical reproduction as it relates to the industrial age see mass production. Fields Research has occurred in the following areas: * Biology studies natural replication and replicators, and their interaction. These can be an important guide to avoid design difficulties in self-replicating machinery. * In Chemistry self-replication studies are typically about how a specific set of molecules can act together to replicate each other within the set (often part of Systems chemistry field). * Memetics studies ideas and how they propagate in human culture. Memes require only small amounts of material, and therefore have theoretical similarities to viruses and are often described as viral. * Nanotechnology or more precisely, molecular nanotechnology is concerned with making nano scale assemblers. Without self-replication, capital and assembly costs of molecular machines become impossibly large. * Space resources: NASA has sponsored a number of design studies to develop self-replicating mechanisms to mine space resources. Most of these designs include computer-controlled machinery that copies itself. * Computer security: Many computer security problems are caused by self-reproducing computer programs that infect computers ‚Äî computer worms and computer viruses. * In parallel computing, it takes a long time to manually load a new program on every node of a large computer cluster or distributed computing system. Automatically loading new programs using mobile agents can save the system administrator a lot of time and give users their results much quicker, as long as they don't get out of control. In industry =Space exploration and manufacturing= The goal of self- replication in space systems is to exploit large amounts of matter with a low launch mass. For example, an autotrophic self-replicating machine could cover a moon or planet with solar cells, and beam the power to the Earth using microwaves. Once in place, the same machinery that built itself could also produce raw materials or manufactured objects, including transportation systems to ship the products. Another model of self-replicating machine would copy itself through the galaxy and universe, sending information back. In general, since these systems are autotrophic, they are the most difficult and complex known replicators. They are also thought to be the most hazardous, because they do not require any inputs from human beings in order to reproduce. A classic theoretical study of replicators in space is the 1980 NASA study of autotrophic clanking replicators, edited by Robert Freitas.Wikisource:Advanced Automation for Space Missions Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing lunar regolith, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in regolith. The limiting element was Chlorine, an essential element to process regolith for Aluminium. Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, and a substantially faster rate of reproduction could be assured by importing modest amounts. The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails. Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic robot. Power would be provided by a \\"canopy\\" of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery could run under the canopy. A \\"casting robot\\" would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make plaster molds. Plaster molds are easy to make, and make precise parts with good surface finishes. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from non-conductive molten rock (basalt) or purified metals. An electric oven melted the materials. A speculative, more complex \\"chip factory\\" was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were \\"vitamins\\". =Molecular manufacturing= Nanotechnologists in particular believe that their work will likely fail to reach a state of maturity until human beings design a self-replicating assembler of nanometer dimensions . These systems are substantially simpler than autotrophic systems, because they are provided with purified feedstocks and energy. They do not have to reproduce them. This distinction is at the root of some of the controversy about whether molecular manufacturing is possible or not. Many authorities who find it impossible are clearly citing sources for complex autotrophic self-replicating systems. Many of the authorities who find it possible are clearly citing sources for much simpler self-assembling systems, which have been demonstrated. In the meantime, a Lego-built autonomous robot able to follow a pre-set track and assemble an exact copy of itself, starting from four externally provided components, was demonstrated experimentally in 2003 . Merely exploiting the replicative abilities of existing cells is insufficient, because of limitations in the process of protein biosynthesis (also see the listing for RNA). What is required is the rational design of an entirely novel replicator with a much wider range of synthesis capabilities. In 2011, New York University scientists have developed artificial structures that can self-replicate, a process that has the potential to yield new types of materials. They have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate not just molecules like cellular DNA or RNA, but discrete structures that could in principle assume many different shapes, have many different functional features, and be associated with many different types of chemical species. For a discussion of other chemical bases for hypothetical self-replicating systems, see alternative biochemistry.

Also see Arnold Band, \\"Shai Agnon by Dan Laor\\", AJS Review, Vol. 35 (2011), pp. 206‚Äî208. Band says that Agnon invented the commonly cited date July 17, 1888 in the 1920s. was a Nobel Prize laureate writer and was one of the central figures of modern Hebrew fiction. In Hebrew, he is known by the acronym Shai Agnon (). In English, his works are published under the name S. Y. Agnon. Agnon was born in Polish Galicia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and later immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, and died in Jerusalem, Israel. His works deal with the conflict between the traditional Jewish life and language and the modern world. They also attempt to recapture the fading traditions of the European shtetl (village). In a wider context, he also contributed to broadening the characteristic conception of the narrator's role in literature. Agnon had a distinctive linguistic style mixing modern and rabbinic Hebrew. Agnon shared the Nobel Prize with the poet Nelly Sachs in 1966. Biography Buczacz, Agnon's hometown Shmuel Yosef Halevi Czaczkes (later Agnon) was born in Buczacz (Polish spelling, pronounced Buchach) or Butschatsch (German spelling), Polish Galicia (then within the Austro-Hungarian Empire), now Buchach, Ukraine. Officially, his date of birth on the Hebrew calendar was 18 Av 5648 (July 26), but he always said his birthday was on the Jewish fast day of Tisha B'Av, the Ninth of Av. His father, Shalom Mordechai Halevy, was ordained as a rabbi, but worked in the fur trade, and had many connections among the Hasidim, His mother's side had ties to the Mitnagdim. He did not attend school and was schooled by his parents.Agnon bio . In addition to studying Jewish texts, Agnon studied writings of the Haskalah, and was also tutored in German. At the age of eight, he began to write in Hebrew and Yiddish, At the age of 15, he published his first poem ‚Äì a Yiddish poem about the Kabbalist Joseph della Reina. He continued to write poems and stories in Hebrew and Yiddish, which were published in Galicia. In 1908, he moved to Jaffa in Ottoman Palestine. The first story he published there was \\"Agunot\\" (\\"Forsaken Wives\\"), which appeared that same year in the journal Ha\`omer. He used the pen name \\"Agnon,\\" derived from the title of the story, which he adopted as his official surname in 1924. In 1910, \\"Forsaken Wives\\" was translated into German. In 1912, at the urging of Yosef Haim Brenner, he published a novella, \\"Vehaya Ha'akov Lemishor\\" (\\"The Crooked Shall Be Made Straight\\"). In 1913, Agnon moved to Germany, where he met Esther Marx (1889-1973). They married in 1920 and had two children. In Germany he lived in Berlin and Bad Homburg vor der H√∂he (1921‚Äì24). Salman Schocken, a businessman and later also publisher, became his literary patron and freed him from financial worries. From 1931 on, his work was published by Schocken Books, and his short stories appeared regularly in the newspaper Haaretz, also owned by the Schocken family. In Germany, he continued to write short stories and collaborated with Martin Buber on an anthology of Hasidic stories. Many of his early books appeared in Buber's J√ºdischer Verlag (Berlin). The mostly assimilated, secular German Jews, Buber and Franz Rosenzweig among them, considered Agnon to be a legitimate relic, being a religious man, familiar with Jewish scripture. Gershom Scholem called him \\"the Jews' Jew\\". In 1924, a fire broke out in his home, destroying his manuscripts and rare book collection. This traumatic event crops up occasionally in his stories. Later that year, Agnon returned to Palestine and settled with his family in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Talpiot. In 1929, his library was destroyed again during anti-Jewish riots. When his novel Hachnasat Kalla (\\"The Bridal Canopy\\") appeared in 1931 to great critical acclaim, Agnon's place in Hebrew literature was assured. In 1935, he published Sippur Pashut (\\"A Simple Story\\"), a novella set in Buchach at the end of the 19th century. Another novel, Tmol Shilshom (\\"Only Yesterday\\"), set in Eretz Yisrael (Israel) of the early 20th century, appeared in 1945. Literary themes and influences Agnon's study Agnon's writing has been the subject of extensive academic research. Many leading scholars of Hebrew literature have published books and papers on his work, among them Baruch Kurzweil, Dov Sadan, Nitza Ben-Dov, Dan Miron, Dan Laor and Alan Mintz. Agnon writes about Jewish life, but with his own unique perspective and special touch. In his Nobel acceptance speech, Agnon claimed \\"Some see in my books the influences of authors whose names, in my ignorance, I have not even heard, while others see the influences of poets whose names I have heard but whose writings I have not read.\\" He went on to detail that his primary influences were the stories of the Bible. Agnon acknowledged that he was also influenced by German literature and culture, and European literature in general, which he read in German translation. A collection of essays on this subject, edited in part by Hillel Weiss, with contributions from Israeli and German scholars, was published in 2010: Agnon and Germany: The Presence of the German World in the Writings of S.Y. Agnon. The budding Hebrew literature also influenced his works, notably that of his friend, Yosef Haim Brenner. In Germany, Agnon also spent time with the Hebraists Hayim Nahman Bialik and Ahad Ha'am. The communities he passed through in his life are reflected in his works: * Galicia: in the books \\"The Bridal Canopy\\", \\"A City and the Fullness Thereof\\", \\"A Simple Story\\" and \\"A Guest for the Night\\". * Germany: in the stories \\"Fernheim\\", \\"Thus Far\\" and \\"Between Two Cities\\". * Jaffa: in the stories \\"Oath of Allegiance\\", \\"Tmol Shilshom\\" and \\"The Dune\\". * Jerusalem: \\"Tehilla\\", \\"Tmol Shilshom\\", \\"Ido ve-Inam\\" and \\"Shira\\". Nitza Ben-Dov writes about Agnon's use of allusiveness, free-association and imaginative dream- sequences, and discusses how seemingly inconsequential events and thoughts determine the lives of his characters. Some of Agnon's works, such as The Bridal Canopy, And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight, and The Doctor's Divorce, have been adapted for theatre. A play based on Agnon's letters to his wife, \\"Esterlein Yakirati\\", was performed at the Khan Theater in Jerusalem. Language Agnon's writing often used words and phrases that differed from what would become established modern Hebrew. His distinct language is based on traditional Jewish sources, such as the Torah and the Prophets, Midrashic literature, the Mishnah, and other Rabbinic literature. Some examples include: * bet kahava for modern bet kafe (coffee house / caf√©) * batei yadayim (lit. \\"hand-houses\\") for modern kfafot (gloves) * yatzta () rather than the modern conjugation yatz'a () (\\"she went out\\") * rotev () meaning soup in place of modern marak () Bar-Ilan University has made a computerized concordance of his works in order to study his language. Awards and critical acclaim Ussishkin Prize 1946 Agnon (left), receiving the Nobel Prize, 1966 Agnon was twice awarded the Bialik Prize for literature (1934 and 1950 ‚Äì which omits the award in 1934). He was also twice awarded the Israel Prize, for literature (1954 and 1958). In 1966, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \\"for his profoundly characteristic narrative art with motifs from the life of the Jewish people\\". The prize was shared with German Jewish author Nelly Sachs. In his speech at the award ceremony, Agnon introduced himself in Hebrew: \\"As a result of the historic catastrophe in which Titus of Rome destroyed Jerusalem and Israel was exiled from its land, I was born in one of the cities of the Exile. But always I regarded myself as one who was born in Jerusalem\\".Horst Frenz, ed. Nobel Lectures, Literature 1901‚Äì1967. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1969. Nobel Prize acceptance speech In later years, Agnon's fame was such that when he complained to the municipality that traffic noise near his home was disturbing his work, the city closed the street to cars and posted a sign that read: \\"No entry to all vehicles, writer at work!\\" Death and legacy Shmuel Yosef Agnon Memorial in Bad Homburg, Germany First day cover for Ukrainian commemorative stamp fifty-shekel bill, second series Exposition in Bouchach museum Agnon died in Jerusalem on February 17, 1970. His daughter, Emuna Yaron, has continued to publish his work posthumously. Agnon's archive was transferred by the family to the National Library in Jerusalem. His home in Talpiot, built in 1931 in the Bauhaus style, was turned into a museum, Beit Agnon. The study where he wrote many of his works was preserved intact.A little modesty goes a long way Agnon's image, with a list of his works and his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, appeared on the fifty- shekel bill, second series, in circulation from 1985 to 2014. The main street in Jerusalem's Givat Oranim neighborhood is called Sderot Shai Agnon, and a synagogue in Talpiot, a few blocks from his home, is named after him. Agnon is also memorialized in Buchach, now in Ukraine, where he was born. There is an extensive (relative to the size of the museum) exhibition in the Historical Museum in Buchach and, just a few yards away, a bust of Agnon is mounted on a pedestal in a plaza across the street from the house where he lived. The house itself is preserved and marked as the home where Agnon lived from birth till the age of (approximately) 19; the street that runs in front of the house is named \\"Agnon Street\\" (in Ukrainian).

Agnon stories helps the elderly face their realities Beit Agnon After Agnon's death, the former mayor of Jerusalem Mordechai Ish-Shalom initiated the opening of his home to the public. In the early 1980s, the kitchen and family dining room were turned into a lecture and conference hall, and literary and cultural evenings were held there. In 2005, the Agnon House Association in Jerusalem renovated the building, which reopened in January 2009. The house was designed by the German-Jewish architect Fritz Korenberg, who was also his neighbor. Published works =Novels and novellas= * The Bridal Canopy (1931), translated from HakhnƒÅsat kallƒÅh.

Ditko\\" under extracurricular activities: \\"Vocational Course. Ambition: Undecided\\". (; November 2, 1927 ‚Äì c. June 29, 2018) was an American comics artist and writer best known as the artist and co-creator, with Stan Lee, of the Marvel Comics superheroes Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Ditko studied under Batman artist Jerry Robinson at the Cartoonist and Illustrators School in New York City. He began his professional career in 1953, working in the studio of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, beginning as an inker and coming under the influence of artist Mort Meskin. During this time, he then began his long association with Charlton Comics, where he did work in the genres of science fiction, horror, and mystery. He also co-created the superhero Captain Atom in 1960. During the 1950s, Ditko also drew for Atlas Comics, a forerunner of Marvel Comics. He went on to contribute much significant work to Marvel. In 1966, after being the exclusive artist on The Amazing Spider-Man and the \\"Doctor Strange\\" feature in Strange Tales, Ditko left Marvel for unclear reasons. Ditko continued to work for Charlton and also DC Comics, including a revamp of the long-running character the Blue Beetle, and creating or co-creating the Question, the Creeper, Shade the Changing Man, and Hawk and Dove. Ditko also began contributing to small independent publishers, where he created Mr. A, a hero reflecting the influence of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Ditko largely declined to give interviews, saying he preferred to communicate through his work. Ditko was inducted into the comics industry's Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990, and into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994. Early life Ditko was born on November 2, 1927 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania,Bell, pp. 14-15.Comics Buyer's Guide #1636 (December 2007) p. 135 the son of first-generation American Rusyn immigrants from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia),Bell, Strange and Stranger, Endnotes, p.1, citing 1920 and 1930 United States Census data.

Both parents graves are located at St. Mary‚Äôs Byzantine Catholic Church cemetery a Rusyn parish. father Stephen Ditko, an artistically talented master carpenter at a steel mill, and mother Anna, a homemaker. The second-oldest child in a working-class family, he was preceded by sister Anna Marie, and followed by sister Elizabeth and brother Patrick. Inspired by his father's love of newspaper comic strips, particularly Hal Foster's Prince Valiant, Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of the superhero Batman in 1939, and by Will Eisner's The Spirit, which appeared in a tabloid-sized comic-book insert in Sunday newspapers.Bell, Strange and Stranger, p. 15 Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian World War II aircraft-spotters. Upon graduating from Greater Johnstown High School in 1945, he enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 26, 1945, and did military service in postwar Germany, where he drew comics for an Army newspaper. Career The Thing #12 (Feb. 1954), Ditko's first published comic-book cover Following his discharge, Ditko learned that his idol, Batman artist Jerry Robinson, was teaching at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later the School of Visual Arts) in New York City.

Beginning as an inker on backgrounds, Ditko was soon working with and learning from Mort Meskin, an artist whose work he had long admired. \\"Meskin was fabulous,\\" Ditko once recalled. \\"I couldn't believe the ease with which he drew: strong compositions, loose pencils, yet complete; detail without clutter. I loved his stuff\\".Theakston, Steve Ditko Reader, p. 3 (unnumbered) Ditko's known assistant work includes aiding inker Meskin on the Jack Kirby pencil work of Harvey Comics' Captain 3-D #1 (Dec. 1953).Captain 3-D #1 (Dec. 1953) at the Grand Comics Database For his own third published story, Ditko penciled and inked the six-page \\"A Hole in His Head\\" in Black Magic vol. 4, #3 (Dec. 1953), published by Simon & Kirby's Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics.Black Magic vol. 4, #3 [27 (Dec. 1953)] at the Grand Comics Database Ditko then began a long association with the Derby, Connecticut publisher Charlton Comics, a low-budget division of a company best known for song-lyric magazines. Beginning with the cover of The Thing! #12 (Feb. 1954) and the eight-page vampire story \\"Cinderella\\" in that issue, Ditko would continue to work intermittently for Charlton until the company's demise in 1986, producing science fiction, horror and mystery stories, as well as co- creating Captain Atom, with writer Joe Gill, in Space Adventures #33 (March 1960). He first went on hiatus from the company, and comics altogether, in mid-1954, when he contracted tuberculosis and returned to his parents' home in Johnstown to recuperate. =Marvel Comics= After he recovered and moved back to New York City in late 1955, Ditko began drawing for Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics, beginning with the four-page \\"There'll Be Some Changes Made\\" in Journey into Mystery #33 (April 1956); this debut tale would be reprinted in Marvel's Curse of the Weird #4 (March 1994). Ditko would go on to contribute a large number of stories, many considered classic, to Atlas/Marvel's Strange Tales and the newly launched Amazing Adventures, Strange Worlds, Tales of Suspense and Tales to Astonish, issues of which would typically open with a Kirby-drawn monster story, followed by one or two twist- ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by Don Heck, Paul Reinman, or Joe Sinnott, all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflexive short by Ditko and writer-editor Stan Lee. These Lee-Ditko short stories proved so popular that Amazing Adventures was reformatted to feature such stories exclusively beginning with issue #7 (Dec. 1961), when the comic was rechristened Amazing Adult Fantasy, a name intended to reflect its more \\"sophisticated\\" nature, as likewise the new tagline \\"The magazine that respects your intelligence\\". Lee in 2009 described these \\"short, five-page filler strips that Steve and I did together\\", originally \\"placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill\\", as \\"odd fantasy tales that I'd dream up with O. Henry-type endings.\\" Giving an early example of what would later be known as the \\"Marvel Method\\" of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said, \\"All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he'd be off and running. He'd take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect.\\"Lee, Stan, \\"Introduction\\", in Yoe, p. 9 Creation of Spider-Man After Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee obtained permission from publisher Martin Goodman to create a new \\"ordinary teen\\" superhero named \\"Spider-Man\\",Lee, Stan, and Mair, George. Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee (Fireside, 2002), p.130. Lee originally approached his leading artist, Jack Kirby. Kirby told Lee about his own 1950s character conception, variously called the Silver Spider and Spiderman, in which an orphaned boy finds a magic ring that gives him super powers. Comics historian Greg Theakston says Lee and Kirby \\"immediately sat down for a story conference\\" and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. \\"A day or two later\\", Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, and, as Lee recalled, \\"I hated the way he was doing it. Not that he did it badly ‚Äî it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic\\".Theakston, Greg. The Steve Ditko Reader (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, New York, 2002; ), p. 12 (unnumbered) Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual motif Lee found satisfactory,DeFalco, Tom \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 87: \\"Deciding that his new character would have spider-like powers, [Stan] Lee commissioned Jack Kirby to work on the first story. Unfortunately, Kirby's version of Spider- Man's alter ego Peter Parker proved too heroic, handsome, and muscular for Lee's everyman hero. Lee turned to Steve Ditko, the regular artist on Amazing Adult Fantasy, who designed a skinny, awkward teenager with glasses.\\" although Lee would later replace Ditko's original cover with one penciled by Kirby. Ditko said, \\"The Spider-Man pages Stan showed me were nothing like the (eventually) published character. In fact, the only drawings of Spider-Man were on the splash [i.e., page 1] and at the end [where] Kirby had the guy leaping at you with a web gun... Anyway, the first five pages took place in the home, and the kid finds a ring and turns into Spider-Man.\\"Theakston, Steve Ditko Reader, p. 13 Ditko also recalled that, \\"One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....\\"Ditko, Steve. \\"Jack Kirby's Spider-Man\\", Robin Snyder's History of Comics #5 (May 1990). Reprinted in Thomas, Roy, ed., Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection. Raleigh, North Carolina: TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001, p. 56. Much earlier, in a rare contemporaneous account, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): \\"Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal\\". He added he would continue drawing Spider-Man \\"[i]f nothing better comes along.\\" Additional , February 28, 2012. That same year, he expressed to the fanzine Voice of Comicdom, regarding a poll of \\"Best Liked\\" fan-created comics, \\"It seems a shame, since comics themselves have so little variety of stories and styles that you would deliberately restrict your own creative efforts to professional comics['] shallow range. What is 'Best Liked' by most readers is what they are most familiar in seeing and any policy based on readers likes has to end up with a lot of look-a-like (sic) strips.

Ditko shared a Manhattan studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate. When either artist was under deadline pressure, it was not uncommon for them to pitch in and help the other with his assignment. Additional .Theakston, The Steve Ditko Reader, pp. 13‚Äì15 (unnumbered, pp. 14‚Äì15 misordered as pp. 16 & 14) Ditko biographer Blake Bell, without citing sources, said, \\"At one time in history, Ditko denied ever touching Stanton's work, even though Stanton himself said they would each dabble in each other's art; mainly spot-inking\\", and the introduction to one book of Stanton's work says, \\"Eric Stanton drew his pictures in India ink, and they were then hand- coloured by Ditko\\". In a 1988 interview with Theakston, Stanton recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was \\"almost nil\\", he and Ditko had \\"worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own...

Lee concurred, and starting with #25 (June 1965), Ditko received plot credit for the stories. One of the most celebrated issues of the Lee-Ditko run is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc \\"If This Be My Destiny...!\\", and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery.

Little sidelight: Originally decided to call him Mr. Strange, but thought the 'Mr.' bit too similar to Mr. Fantastic....\\" the supernatural hero Doctor Strange in Strange Tales #110 (July 1963).DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 93: \\"When Dr. Strange first appeared in Strange Tales #110, it was only clear that he dabbled in black magic and had the ability to project his consciousness into an astral form that could leave his physical body.\\" Ditko in the 2000s told a visiting fan that Lee gave Dr. Strange the first name \\"Stephen\\". Though often overshadowed by his Spider-Man work, Ditko's Doctor Strange artwork has been equally acclaimed for its surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly psychedelic visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. \\"People who read 'Doctor Strange' thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e. drug users],\\" recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer Roy Thomas in 1971, \\"because they had had similar experiences high on mushrooms. But ... I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do.\\" Eventually Lee & Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in Strange Tales #130‚Äì146 (March 1965 ‚Äì July 1966), Lee and Ditko introduced the cosmic character Eternity, who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos.Strange Tales #134 at the Grand Comics Database: \\"Indexer Notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in Strange Tales #138 (November 1965)\\". As historian Bradford W. Wright describes, The cartoonist and fine artist Seth in 2003 described Ditko's style as: In addition to Dr. Strange, Ditko in the 1960s also drew comics starring the Hulk and Iron Man. He penciled and inked the final issue of The Incredible Hulk (#6, March 1963), then continued to collaborate with writer-editor Lee on a relaunched Hulk feature in the omnibus Tales to Astonish, beginning with issue #60 (Oct. 1964). Ditko, inked by George Roussos, penciled the feature through #67 (May 1965). Ditko designed the Hulk's primary antagonist, the Leader, in #62 (Dec. 1964). Ditko also penciled the Iron Man feature in Tales of Suspense #47‚Äì49 (Nov. 1963 ‚Äì Jan. 1964), with various inkers. The first of these debuted the initial version of Iron Man's modern red-and-golden armor, though whether Ditko or cover-penciler and principal character designer Jack Kirby designed the costume is uncertain. Whichever feature he drew, Ditko's idiosyncratic, cleanly detailed, instantly recognizable art style, emphasizing mood and anxiety, found great favor with readers. The character of Spider-Man and his troubled personal life meshed well with Ditko's own interests, which Lee eventually acknowledged by giving the artist plotting credits on the latter part of their 38-issue run. But after four years on the title, Ditko left Marvel;DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 117: \\"To this day, no one really knows why Ditko quit. Bullpen sources reported he was unhappy with the way Lee scripted some of his plots, using a tongue-in-cheek approach to stories Ditko wanted handled seriously.\\" he and Lee had not been on speaking terms for some time, with art and editorial changes handled through intermediaries. The details of the rift remain uncertain, even to Lee, who confessed in 2003, \\"I never really knew Steve on a personal level.\\" Ditko later claimed it was Lee who broke off contact and disputed the long-held beliefRoss, Jonathan, In Search of Steve Ditko, BBC Four that the disagreement was over the true identity of the Green Goblin: \\"Stan never knew what he was getting in my Spider-Man stories and covers until after [production manager] Sol Brodsky took the material from me ... so there couldn't have been any disagreement or agreement, no exchanges ... no problems between us concerning the Green Goblin or anything else from before issue #25 to my final issues\\".Lawrence, Christopher, \\"Who Is Steve Ditko?\\", Wizard #124 (Jan. 2002) Spider-Man successor artist John Romita, in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko \\"ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters. ...\\" A friendly farewell was given to Ditko in the \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\" of comics cover-dated July 1966, including Fantastic Four #52: \\"Steve recently told us he was leaving for personal reasons. After all these years, we're sorry to see him go, and we wish the talented guy success with his future endeavors.\\"\\"Bullpen Bulletins\\", Fantastic Four #52 (July 1966). Marvel Comics. Regardless, said Lee in 2007, \\"Quite a few years ago I met him up at the Marvel offices when I was last in New York. And we spoke; he's a hell of a nice guy and it was very pleasant. ... I haven't heard from him since that meeting.\\" =Charlton and DC Comics= Back at Charlton‚Äîwhere the page rate was low but creators were allowed greater freedom‚ÄîDitko worked on such characters as the Blue Beetle (1967‚Äì1968),McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 123: \\"After Ted Kord assumed the scarab as Blue Beetle in a back-up feature of Captain Atom #83, writer/artist Steve Ditko and co-writer 'D.C.

In addition, in 1966 and 1967, he drew 16 stories, most of them written by Archie Goodwin, for Warren Publishing's horror-comic magazines Creepy and Eerie, generally using an ink-wash technique. In 1967, Ditko gave his Objectivist ideas ultimate expression in the form of Mr. A, published in Wally Wood's independent title witzend # 3\\\\. Ditko's hard line against criminals was controversial and he continued to produce Mr. A stories and one-pagers until the end of the 1970s. Ditko returned to Mr. A in 2000 and in 2009.

Ditko's stay at DC was short‚Äîhe would work on all six issues of the Creeper's own title, Beware the Creeper (June 1968 ‚Äì April 1969), though leaving midway through the final one‚Äîand the reasons for his departure uncertain. But while at DC, Ditko recommended Charlton staffer Dick Giordano to the company, who would go on to become a top DC penciller, inker, editor, and ultimately, in 1981, the managing editor. From this time up through the mid-1970s, Ditko worked exclusively for Charlton and various small press/independent publishers. Frank McLaughlin, Charlton's art director during this period, describes Ditko as living \\"in a local hotel in Derby for a while. He was a very happy-go-lucky guy with a great sense of humor at that time, and always supplied the [female] color separators with candy and other little gifts\\".Cooke, Jon B., & Christopher Irving. \\"The Charlton Empire: A Brief History of the Derby, Connecticut Publisher\\", Comic Book Artist #9, August 2000.

Ditko produced much work for Charlton's science-fiction and horror titles, as well as for former Marvel publisher Martin Goodman's start-up line Atlas/Seaboard Comics, where he co-created the superhero the Destructor with writer Archie Goodwin, and penciled all four issues of the namesake series (Feb.‚ÄìAug. 1975), the first two of which were inked by Wally Wood. Ditko worked on the second and third issues of Tiger-Man and the third issue of Morlock 2001, with Bernie Wrightson inking. =Later-day Ditko= Ditko returned to DC Comics in 1975, creating a short-lived title, Shade, the Changing Man (1977‚Äì1978).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 174 \\"Steve Ditko returned to mainstream comics with Shade, the Changing Man.

Editor Jack C. Harris hired Ditko as guest artist on several issues of The Legion of Super-Heroes, a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title's readership. Ditko also drew the Prince Gavyn version of Starman in Adventure Comics #467‚Äì478 (1980).Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 186 \\"The second [feature in Adventure Comics #467] debuted a new version of Starman by writer Paul Levitz and illustrator Steve Ditko.\\" He then decamped to do work for a variety of publishers, briefly contributing to DC again in the mid-1980s, with four pinups of his characters for Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe and a pinup for Superman #400 (Oct. 1984)Superman #400 at the Grand Comics Database and its companion portfolio.Giordano, Dick \\"Meanwhile\\" column, Jemm, Son of Saturn #2 (Oct. 1984) \\"We have another goodie for you!

In 1982, he also began freelancing for the early independent comics label Pacific Comics, beginning with Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers #6 (Sept. 1982), in which he introduced the superhero Missing Man, with Mark Evanier scripting to Ditko's plot and art. Subsequent Missing Man stories appeared in Pacific Presents #1‚Äì3 (Oct. 1982 ‚Äì March 1984), with Ditko scripting the former and collaborating with longtime friend Robin Snyder on the script for the latter two. Ditko also created The Mocker for Pacific, in Silver Star #2 (April 1983). For Eclipse Comics, he contributed a story featuring his character Static (no relation to the later Milestone Comics character) in Eclipse Monthly #1‚Äì3 (Aug.‚ÄìOct. 1983), introducing supervillain the Exploder in #2. With writer Jack C. Harris, Ditko drew the backup feature \\"The Faceless Ones\\" in First Comics' Warp #2‚Äì4 (April‚ÄìJune 1983).

This included a poster that was inked by John Romita Sr. Steve Ditko's Strange Avenging Tales was announced as a quarterly series from Fantagraphics Books, although it only ran one issue (Feb. 1997) due to publicly unspecified disagreements between Ditko and the publisher. The New York Times assessed in 2008 that, \\"By the '70s he was regarded as a slightly old-fashioned odd-ball; by the '80s he was a commercial has-been, picking up wretched work-for-hire gigs. ...following the example of [Ayn] Rand's John Galt, Ditko hacked out moneymaking work, saving his care for the crabbed Objectivist screeds he published with tiny presses. And boy, could Ditko hack: seeing samples of his Transformers coloring book and his Big Boy comic is like hearing Orson Welles sell frozen peas.\\" Ditko retired from mainstream comics in 1998.Bell, Blake.

The Snyder publications have included a number of original books as well as reprints such as Static, The Missing Man, The Mocker and, in 2002, Avenging World, a collection of stories and essays spanning 30 years. In 2008, Ditko and Snyder released The Avenging Mind, a 32-page essay publication featuring several pages of new artwork; and Ditko, Etc..., a 32-page comic book composed of brief vignettes and editorial cartoons. Releases have continued in that format, with stories introducing such characters as the Hero, Miss Eerie, the Cape, the Madman, the Grey Negotiator, the !? and the Outline. He said in 2012 of his self-published efforts, \\"I do those because that's all they'll let me do.\\" In addition to the new material, Ditko and Snyder reprinted earlier Ditko material.

Personal life As of 2012, Ditko continued to work in Manhattan's Midtown West neighborhood. He mostly declined to give interviews or make public appearances, explaining in 1969 that, \\"When I do a job, it's not my personality that I'm offering the readers but my artwork. It's not what I'm like that counts; it's what I did and how well it was done. I produce a product, a comic art story.

As far as it is known, he never married and had no surviving children at the time of his death. Will Eisner stated that Ditko had a son out of wedlock,Eisner in but this may have been a confused reference to the nephew. Ditko said in 2012 that he had made no income on the four Spider-Man films released to that time. However, a neighbor of Ditko's stated that he received royalty checks. Those involved with creating the Doctor Strange film purposely declined to contact him during production, believing they would not be welcome.

He was pronounced dead at age 90, with the cause of death initially deemed as a result of a myocardial infarction, brought on by arteriosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

Life He was probably a Roman soldier martyred for the Christian faith during the persecution of Diocletian in 304 in the city of Porto Torres (), according to the legend on the orders of the governor (preside) of Sardinia and Corsica, a certain Barbarus. The well-known Romanesque church of Gavoi is dedicated to him, as is the town of San Gavino Monreale, and a number of communes in Corsica. The 11th-century Basilica of San Gavino in Porto Torres, Sassari, is also dedicated to this saint. It was built by Comita or Gomida, Judge of Torres, and contains the relics, discovered in 1614, not only of Saint Gavinus, but also of his companions, Saints Protus and Januarius. His feast day is given in the Roman Martyrology as 30 May.

In its natural state, it is yellowish brown and is called raw sienna. When heated, it becomes a reddish brown and is called burnt sienna.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 5th Edition (2002) It takes its name from the city-state of Siena, where it was produced during the Renaissance.Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, College Edition, (1964) Along with ochre and umber, it was one of the first pigments to be used by humans, and is found in many cave paintings. Since the Renaissance, it has been one of the brown pigments most widely used by artists. The first recorded use of sienna as a colour name in English was in 1760.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 204; Color Sample of Sienna: Page 37 Plate 7 Color Sample E12 Earth colours Like the other earth colours, such as yellow ochre and umber, sienna is a clay containing iron oxide, called limonite, which in its natural state has a yellowish colour. In addition to iron oxide, natural or raw sienna also contains about five percent of manganese oxide, which makes it darker than ochre. When heated, the iron oxide is dehydrated and turns partially to haematite, which gives it a reddish-brown colour. Sienna is lighter in shade than raw umber, which is also clay with iron oxide, but which has a higher content of manganese (5 to 20 percent) which makes it greenish brown or dark brown. When heated, raw umber becomes burnt umber, a very dark brown. File:Monteriggioni0001.jpgThe clay soil of Tuscany (here near Monteriggioni) is rich in limonite, or hydrated iron oxide, the main ingredient of sienna pigment.

When limonite is roasted, it turns partially to haematite and becomes more reddish. File:Pigment sienna burnt iconofile.jpgAfter being heated, the pigment has become the colour known as burnt sienna. History The pigment sienna was known and used, in its natural form, by the ancient Romans. It was mined near Arcidosso, formerly under Sienese control, now in the province of Grosseto, on Monte Amiata in southern Tuscany. It was called terra rossa (red earth), terra gialla, or terra di Siena. During the Renaissance, it was noted by the most widely read author about painting techniques, Giorgio Vasari, under the name terra rossa. It became, along with umber and yellow ochre, one of the standard browns used by artists from the 16th to 19th centuries, including Caravaggio (1571-1610) and Rembrandt (1606-1669), who used all the earth colours, including ochre, sienna and umber, in his palette.John Burnet (1880), A Treatise on Painting in Four Parts, (Google Books)David Bomfeld, Christopher Brown, Ashok Roy, (1988) Rembrandt- Art in the Making - Rembrandt. Yale University Press, (). By the 1940s, the traditional sources in Italy were nearly exhausted. Much of today's sienna production is carried out in the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily, while other major deposits are found in the Appalachian Mountains, where it is often found alongside the region's iron deposits. It is also still produced in the French Ardennes, in the small town of Bonne Fontaine near Ecordal. p. 30 In the 20th century, pigments began to be produced using synthetic iron oxide rather than the natural earth. The labels on paint tubes indicate whether they contain natural or synthetic ingredients. PY-43 indicates natural raw sienna, PR-102 indicates natural burnt sienna. File:Giorgio Vasari - The battle of Marciano in Val di Chiana - Google Art Project.jpg  Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574) used earth colors, including ochre and sienna, in his frescos, including this painting in the Hall of the Five Hundred at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.Web exhibits, Pigments through the Ages. In his writings Vasari called sienna terra rossa.Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects. (Google Books). File:Rembrandt Self-portrait (Kenwood).jpg Rembrandt van Rijn used all the earth pigments, including sienna, ochre and umber, to create his rich and complex browns.  Variations There is no single agreed standard for the colour of sienna, and the name is used today for a wide variety of hues and shades. They vary by country and colour list, and there are many proprietary variations offered by paint companies. The colour box at the top of the article shows one variation from the ISCC-NBS colour list. =Raw sienna= Raw sienna is a yellowish-brown natural earth pigment, composed primarily of iron oxide hydroxide. The box shows the colour of the pigment in its natural, or raw state. It contains a large quantity of iron oxide and a small quantity (about five percent) of manganese oxide. This kind of pigment is known as yellow ochre, yellow earth, limonite, or terra gialla. The pigment name for natural raw sienna from the Colour Index International, shown on the labels of oil paints, is PY-43. This box at right shows a variation of raw sienna from the Italian Ferrario 1919 colour list. =Burnt sienna= Burnt sienna contains a large proportion of anhydrous iron oxide. It is made by heating raw sienna, which dehydrates the iron oxide, changing it partially to haematite, giving it rich reddish-brown colour. The pigment is also known as red earth, red ochre, and terra rossa. On the Colour Index International, the pigment is known as PR-102. This version is from the Italian Ferrario 1919 colour list. The first recorded use of burnt sienna as a colour name in English was in 1853.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 204; Color Sample of Sienna: Page 33 Plate 5 Color Sample F12 Burnt sienna pigment (Maerz and Paul) This variation of burnt sienna is from the Maerz and Paul \\"A Dictionary of Color\\" from 1930. It is considerably lighter than most other versions of burnt sienna. It was a mix of burnt orange and raw sienna. =Dark sienna (ISCC-NBS)= This infobox shows the colour dark sienna.

He was editor of PR Watch, and is the author of several books that criticize the public relations industry and what he sees as other forms of corporate and government propaganda. Education Rampton was born in Long Beach, California. At the age of one, his family moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where his father worked as a musician. Raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), he spent two years in Japan as a Latter-day Saint missionary from 1976 to 1978. Upon returning to the United States, however, he left the LDS Church, influenced in part by Mormon feminist Sonia Johnson. Career Upon graduation in 1982, Rampton worked as a newspaper reporter before becoming a peace activist. During the 1980s and 1990s, he worked closely with the Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua (WCCN), which opposed the Reagan administration's military interventions in Central America and works to promote economic development, human rights, and mutual friendship between the people of the United States and Nicaragua. At WCCN, Rampton helped establish the Nicaraguan Credit Alternatives Fund (NICA Fund) in 1992, which channels loans from US investors to support microcredit and other \\"alternative credit\\" programs in Nicaragua. In 1995, Rampton teamed with John Stauber as co-editors of PR Watch, a publication of the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD). They were described as liberal,Chisun Lee, a writer for the Village Voice, noted of Rampton and co-author John Stauber's work: > There isn't likely to be much corporate support there.

California.Text of the decision and dissents, from findlaw.com It has three parts: *Whether \\"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\\", would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, *Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functionsThe syllabus of the case mentions only sexual conduct, but excretory functions are explicitly mentioned on page 25 of the majority opinion. specifically defined by applicable state law, *Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.This is also known as the (S)LAPS test- [Serious] Literary, Artistic, Political, Scientific. The work is considered obscene only if all three conditions are satisfied. The first two prongs of the Miller test are held to the standards of the community, and the last prong is held to what is reasonable to a person of the United States as a whole. The national reasonable person standard of the third prong acts as a check on the community standard of the first two prongs, allowing protection for works that in a certain community might be considered obscene but on a national level might have redeeming value. For legal scholars, several issues are important. One is that the test allows for community standards rather than a national standard. What offends the average person in Manhattan, Kansas, may differ from what offends the average person in Manhattan, New York. The relevant community, however, is not defined. Another important issue is that the Miller test asks for an interpretation of what the \\"average\\" person finds offensive, rather than what the more sensitive persons in the community are offended by, as obscenity was defined by the previous test, the Hicklin test, stemming from the English precedent. In practice, pornography showing genitalia and sexual acts is not ipso facto obscene according to the Miller test. For instance, in 2000, a jury in Provo, Utah, took only a few minutes to clear Larry Peterman, owner of a Movie Buffs video store, in Utah County, Utah. He had been charged with distributing obscene material for renting pornographic videos which were displayed in a screened-off area of the store clearly marked as adult-only. The Utah County region had often boasted of being one of the most socially conservative areas in the United States. However, researchers had shown that guests at the local Marriott Hotel were disproportionately large consumers of pay-per-view pornographic material, accessing far more material than the store was distributing. Criticism =Less strict standard may lead to greater censorship= Because it allows for community standards and demands \\"serious\\" value, Justice Douglas worried in his dissent that this test would make it easier to suppress speech and expression. Miller replaced a previous test asking whether the speech or expression was \\"utterly without redeeming social value\\".Roth v. United States, 1957. As used, however, the test generally makes it difficult to outlaw any form of expression. Many works decried as pornographic have been successfully argued to have some artistic or literary value, most publicly in the context of the National Endowment for the Arts in the 1990s. =Problem of jurisdiction in the Internet age= The advent of the Internet has made the \\"community standards\\" part of the test even more difficult to judge; as material published on a web server in one place can be read by a person residing anywhere else, there is a question as to which jurisdiction should apply. In United States of America v. Extreme Associates, a pornography distributor from North Hollywood, California, was judged to be held accountable to the community standards applying in western Pennsylvania, where the Third Circuit made its ruling, because the materials were available via Internet in that area. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ruled in United States v. Kilbride that a \\"national community standard\\" should be used for the Internet, but this has yet to be upheld at the national level.

It allows simultaneous access to television broadcast and internet applications. A set-top box (STB), also colloquially known as a cable box, is an information appliance device that generally contains a TV-tuner input and displays output to a television set and an external source of signal, turning the source signal into content in a form that can then be displayed on the television screen or other display device. They are used in cable television, satellite television, and over-the- air television systems as well as other uses. A computer that connects to your television. Allows you to use telephone line or cable connection do you browse the Internet and exchange electronic mail on your television. According to the Los Angeles Times, the cost to a cable provider in the United States for a set-top box is between $150 for a basic box to $250 for a more sophisticated box. In 2016, the average pay-TV subscriber paid $231 per year to lease their set-top box from a cable service provider. TV signal sources IF demodulation tuner is on the bottom left, and a Fujitsu MPEG decoder CPU is in the center of the board. The power supply is on the right. The signal source might be an Ethernet cable, a satellite dish, a coaxial cable (see cable television), a telephone line (including DSL connections), broadband over power lines (BPL), or even an ordinary VHF or UHF antenna. Content, in this context, could mean any or all of video, audio, Internet web pages, interactive video games, or other possibilities. Satellite and microwave-based services also require specific external receiver hardware, so the use of set- top boxes of various formats has never completely disappeared. Set-top boxes can also enhance source signal quality. =UHF converter= Before the All- Channel Receiver Act of 1962 required US television receivers to be able to tune the entire VHF and UHF range (which in North America was NTSC-M channels 2 through 83 on 54 to 890 MHz), a set-top box known as a UHF converter would be installed at the receiver to shift a portion of the UHF-TV spectrum onto low-VHF channels for viewing. As some 1960s-era 12-channel TV sets remained in use for many years, and Canada and Mexico were slower than the US to require UHF tuners to be factory-installed in new TVs, a market for these converters continued to exist for much of the 1970s. =Cable converter= Cable television represented a possible alternative to deployment of UHF converters as broadcasts could be frequency-shifted to VHF channels at the cable head-end instead of the final viewing location. However, most cable systems could not accommodate the full 54-890 MHz VHF/UHF frequency range and the twelve channels of VHF space were quickly exhausted on most systems. Adding any additional channels therefore needed to be done by inserting the extra signals into cable systems on nonstandard frequencies, typically either below VHF channel 7 (midband) or directly above VHF channel 13 (superband). These frequencies corresponded to non-television services (such as two-way radio) over-the-air and were therefore not on standard TV receivers. Before cable- ready TV sets became common in the late 1980s, an electronic tuning device called a cable converter box was needed to receive the additional analog cable TV channels and transpose or convert the selected channel to analog radio frequency (RF) for viewing on a regular TV set on a single channel, usually VHF channel 3 or 4. The box allowed an analog non-cable-ready television set to receive analog encrypted cable channels and was a prototype topology for later date digital encryption devices. Newer televisions were then converted to be analog cypher cable-ready, with the standard converter built-in for selling premium television (aka pay per view). Several years later and slowly marketed, the advent of digital cable continued and increased the need for various forms of these devices. Block conversion of the entire affected frequency band onto UHF, while less common, was used by some models to provide full VCR compatibility and the ability to drive multiple TV sets, albeit with a somewhat nonstandard channel numbering scheme. Newer television receivers greatly reduced the need for external set-top boxes, although cable converter boxes continue to be used to descramble premium cable channels according to carrier-controlled access restrictions, and to receive digital cable channels, along with using interactive services like video on demand, pay per view, and home shopping through television. =Closed captioning box= Set-top boxes were also made to enable closed captioning on older sets in North America, before this became a mandated inclusion in new TV sets. Some have also been produced to mute the audio (or replace it with noise) when profanity is detected in the captioning, where the offensive word is also blocked. Some also include a V-chip that allows only programs of some television content ratings. A function that limits children's time watching TV or playing video games may also be built in, though some of these work on main electricity rather than the video signal. =Digital television adapter= The transition to digital terrestrial television after the turn of the millennium left many existing television receivers unable to tune and display the new signal directly. In the United States, where analog shutdown was completed in 2009 for full-service broadcasters, a federal subsidy was offered for coupon- eligible converter boxes with deliberately limited capability which would restore signals lost to digital transition. =Professional set-top box= Professional set-top boxes are referred to as IRDs or integrated receiver/decoders in the professional broadcast audio/video industry. They are designed for more robust field handling and rack mounting environments. IRDs are capable of outputting uncompressed serial digital interface signals, unlike consumer STBs which usually don't, mostly because of copyright reasons. =Hybrid box= Lenovo A30 set-top box Hybrid set-top boxes, such as those used for Smart TV programming, enable viewers to access multiple TV delivery methods (including terrestrial, cable, internet, and satellite); like IPTV boxes, they include video on demand, time-shifting TV, Internet applications, video telephony, surveillance, gaming, shopping, TV-centric electronic program guides, and e-government. By integrating varying delivery streams, hybrids (sometimes known as \\"TV-centric\\") enable pay-TV operators more flexible application deployment, which decreases the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market, and limits disruption for consumers. As examples, Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) set-top boxes allow traditional TV broadcasts, whether from terrestrial (DTT), satellite, or cable providers, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet and personal multimedia content. Advanced Digital Broadcast (ADB) launched its first hybrid DTT/IPTV set-top box in 2005, which provided Telef√≥nica with the digital TV platform for its Movistar TV service by the end of that year. In 2009, ADB provided Europe's first three-way hybrid digital TV platform to Polish digital satellite operator n, which enables subscribers to view integrated content whether delivered via satellite, terrestrial, or internet. UK based Inview Technology has over 8M STBs deployed in the UK for Teletext and an original push VOD service for Top Up TV. =IPTV receiver= In IPTV networks, the set- top box is a small computer providing two-way communications on an IP network and decoding the video streaming media. IP set-top boxes have a built-in home network interface that can be Ethernet, Wireless (802.11 g,n,ac), or one of the existing wire home networking technologies such as HomePNA or the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1Gbit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines, and coaxial cables).New global standard for fully networked home , ITU-T Press Release In the US and Europe, telephone companies use IPTV (often on ADSL or optical fiber networks) as a means to compete with traditional local cable television monopolies. This type of service is distinct from Internet television, which involves third-party content over the public Internet not controlled by the local system operator. Features =Programming features= Electronic program guide Electronic program guides and interactive program guides provide users of television, radio, and other media applications with continuously updated menus displaying broadcast programming or scheduling information for current and upcoming programming. Some guides, such as ITV, also feature backward scrolling to promote their catch-up content. Favorites This feature allows the user to choose preferred channels, making them easier and quicker to access; this is handy with the wide range of digital channels on offer. The concept of favourite channels is superficially similar to that of the \\"bookmark\\" function offered in many Web browsers. Timer The timer allows the user to program and enable the box to switch between channels at certain times: this is handy to record from more than one channel while the user is out. The user still needs to program the VCR or DVD recorder. =Convenience features= Controls on the box Some models have controls on the box, as well as on the remote control. This is useful should the user lose the remote or if the batteries age. Remote controls that work with other TVs Some remote controls can also control some basic functions of various brands of TVs. This allows the user to use just one remote to turn the TV on and off, adjust volume, or switch between digital and analog TV channels or between terrestrial and internet channels. Parental locks The parental lock or content filters allow users over 18 years old to block access to channels that are not appropriate for children, using a personal identification number. Some boxes simply block all channels, while others allow the user to restrict access to chosen channels not suitable for children below certain ages. =Software alternatives= As complexity and potential programming faults of the set-top box increase, 080322 computer.org software such as MythTV, Select-TV and Microsoft's Media Center have developed features comparable to those of set- top boxes, ranging from basic DVR-like functionality to DVD copying, home automation, and housewide music or video playback. =Firmware update features= Set-top box firmware being updated Almost all modern set-top boxes feature automatic firmware update processes. The firmware update is typically provided by the service provider. Ambiguities in the definition With the advent of flat-panel televisions, set-top boxes are now deeper in profile than the tops of most modern TV sets. Because of this, set-top boxes are often placed beneath televisions, and the term set-top box has become something of a misnomer, possibly helping the adoption of the term digibox. Additionally, newer set-top boxes that sit at the edge of IP-based distribution networks are often called net-top boxes or NTBs, to differentiate between IP and RF inputs. The Roku LT is around the size of a pack of cards and delivers Smart TV to conventional sets.Which? Consumer's Guide; October 2012; page 41 The distinction between external tuner or demodulator boxes (traditionally considered to be \\"set-top boxes\\") and storage devices (such as VCR, DVD, or disc-based PVR units) is also blurred by the increasing deployment of satellite and cable tuner boxes with hard disk, network or USB interfaces built-in. Devices with the capabilities of computer terminals, such as the WebTV thin client, also fall into the grey area that could invite the term \\"NTB\\". =Europe= In Europe, a set-top box does not necessarily contain a tuner of its own. A box connected to a television (or VCR) SCART connector is fed with the baseband television signal from the set's tuner, and can have the television display the returned processed signal instead. Pace Micro Technology DC757X Set top box This SCART feature had been used for connection to analogue decoding equipment by pay TV operators in Europe, and in the past was used for connection to teletext equipment before the decoders became built-in. The outgoing signal could be of the same nature as the incoming signal, or RGB component video, or even an \\"insert\\" over the original signal, due to the \\"fast switching\\" feature of SCART. In case of analogue pay-TV, this approach avoided the need for a second remote control. The use of digital television signals in more modern pay-TV schemes requires that decoding take place before the digital-to-analogue conversion step, rendering the video outputs of an analogue SCART connector no longer suitable for interconnection to decryption hardware. Standards such as DVB's Common Interface and ATSC's CableCARD therefore use a PCMCIA-like card inserted as part of the digital signal path as their alternative to a tuner-equipped set-top box. Energy use In June 2011 a report from the American National Resources Defense Council brought attention to the energy efficiency of set-top boxes, Natural Resources Defense Council. and the US Department of Energy announced plans to consider the adoption of energy efficiency standards for set-top boxes. Environmental and Energy Study Institute In November 2011, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association announced a new energy efficiency initiative that commits the largest American cable operators to the purchase of set-top boxes that meet Energy Star standards and the development of sleep modes that will use less energy when the set-top box is not being used to watch or record video.

Scatological studies allow one to determine a wide range of biological information about a creature, including its diet (and thus where it has been), health and diseases such as tapeworms. A comprehensive study of scatology was documented by John Gregory Bourke under the title Rites of All Nations (1891). An abbreviated version of the work (with a foreword by Sigmund Freud), was published as The Portable Scatalog in 1994.  Etymology  The word derives from the Greek ( ) meaning \\"dung, feces\\"; coprology derives from the Greek of similar meaning., .  Psychology  In psychology, a scatology is an obsession with excretion or excrement, or the study of such obsessions. In sexual fetishism, scatology (usually abbreviated scat) refers to coprophilia, when a person is sexually aroused by fecal matter, whether in the use of feces in various sexual acts, watching someone defecating, or simply seeing the feces. Entire subcultures in sexuality are devoted to this fetish.  Literature  In literature, \\"scatological\\" is a term to denote the literary trope of the grotesque body. It is used to describe works that make particular reference to excretion or excrement, as well as to toilet humor. Well known for his scatological tropes is the late medieval fictional character of Till Eulenspiegel. Another common example is John Dryden's Mac Flecknoe, a poem that employs extensive scatological imagery to ridicule Dryden's contemporary Thomas Shadwell. In German literature in particular is a wealth of scatological texts and references, which includes such books as Collofino's Non Olet. A case which has provoked an unusual amount of comment in the academic literature is Mozart's scatological humour. Smith, in his review of English literature's representations of scatology from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, notes two attitudes towards scatology. One of these emphasises the merry and the carnivalesque. This is found in Chaucer and Shakespeare. The other attitude is one of self-disgust and misanthropy. This is found in the works of the Earl of Rochester and Jonathan Swift.Smith (2012)  See also  * Coprolite * Coprophilia * Urolagnia ‚Äì urination fetish  Sources  * Bakhtin, Mikhail, Rabelais and His World. * Lewin, Ralph, Merde: excursions in scientific, cultural and socio-historical coprology.

The definition implies that it also includes the empty subset and that it is closed under countable intersections. The pair (X, Œ£) is called a measurable space or Borel space. A œÉ-algebra is a type of algebra of sets. An algebra of sets needs only to be closed under the union or intersection of finitely many subsets, which is a weaker condition. The main use of œÉ-algebras is in the definition of measures; specifically, the collection of those subsets for which a given measure is defined is necessarily a œÉ-algebra. This concept is important in mathematical analysis as the foundation for Lebesgue integration, and in probability theory, where it is interpreted as the collection of events which can be assigned probabilities. Also, in probability, œÉ-algebras are pivotal in the definition of conditional expectation. In statistics, (sub) œÉ-algebras are needed for the formal mathematical definition of a sufficient statistic, particularly when the statistic is a function or a random process and the notion of conditional density is not applicable. If one possible œÉ-algebra on X is where ‚àÖ is the empty set. In general, a finite algebra is always a œÉ-algebra. If {A1, A2, A3, ‚Ä¶} is a countable partition of X then the collection of all unions of sets in the partition (including the empty set) is a œÉ-algebra. A more useful example is the set of subsets of the real line formed by starting with all open intervals and adding in all countable unions, countable intersections, and relative complements and continuing this process (by transfinite iteration through all countable ordinals) until the relevant closure properties are achieved - the œÉ-algebra produced by this process is known as the Borel algebra on the real line, and can also be conceived as the smallest (i.e. \\"coarsest\\") œÉ-algebra containing all the open sets, or equivalently containing all the closed sets. It is foundational to measure theory, and therefore modern probability theory, and a related construction known as the Borel hierarchy is of relevance to descriptive set theory. Motivation There are at least three key motivators for œÉ-algebras: defining measures, manipulating limits of sets, and managing partial information characterized by sets. =Measure= A measure on X is a function that assigns a non-negative real number to subsets of X; this can be thought of as making precise a notion of \\"size\\" or \\"volume\\" for sets. We want the size of the union of disjoint sets to be the sum of their individual sizes, even for an infinite sequence of disjoint sets. One would like to assign a size to every subset of X, but in many natural settings, this is not possible. For example, the axiom of choice implies that, when the size under consideration is the ordinary notion of length for subsets of the real line, then there exist sets for which no size exists, for example, the Vitali sets. For this reason, one considers instead a smaller collection of privileged subsets of X. These subsets will be called the measurable sets. They are closed under operations that one would expect for measurable sets; that is, the complement of a measurable set is a measurable set and the countable union of measurable sets is a measurable set. Non-empty collections of sets with these properties are called œÉ-algebras. =Limits of sets= Many uses of measure, such as the probability concept of almost sure convergence, involve limits of sequences of sets. For this, closure under countable unions and intersections is paramount. Set limits are defined as follows on œÉ-algebras. * The limit supremum of a sequence A1, A2, A3, ..., each of which is a subset of X, is ::\\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n = \\\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\bigcup_{m=n}^\\\\infty A_m. * The limit infimum of a sequence A1, A2, A3, ..., each of which is a subset of X, is ::\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n = \\\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\bigcap_{m=n}^\\\\infty A_m. * If, in fact, ::\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n = \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n, :then the \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}A_n exists as that common set. =Sub œÉ-algebras= In much of probability, especially when conditional expectation is involved, one is concerned with sets that represent only part of all the possible information that can be observed. This partial information can be characterized with a smaller œÉ-algebra which is a subset of the principal œÉ-algebra; it consists of the collection of subsets relevant only to and determined only by the partial information. A simple example suffices to illustrate this idea. Imagine you and another person are betting on a game that involves flipping a coin repeatedly and observing whether it comes up Heads (H) or Tails (T). Since you and your opponent are each infinitely wealthy, there is no limit to how long the game can last. This means the sample space Œ© must consist of all possible infinite sequences of H or T: :\\\\Omega = \\\\\\\\{H, T\\\\\\\\}^\\\\infty = \\\\\\\\{(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\\\dots) : x_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{H, T\\\\\\\\}, i \\\\ge 1\\\\\\\\}. However, after n flips of the coin, you may want to determine or revise your betting strategy in advance of the next flip. The observed information at that point can be described in terms of the 2n possibilities for the first n flips. Formally, since you need to use subsets of Œ©, this is codified as the œÉ-algebra :\\\\mathcal{G}_n = \\\\\\\\{A \\\\times \\\\\\\\{H, T\\\\\\\\}^\\\\infty : A \\\\subset \\\\\\\\{H, T\\\\\\\\}^n\\\\\\\\}. Observe that then :\\\\mathcal{G}_1 \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{G}_2 \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{G}_3 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{G}_\\\\infty, where \\\\mathcal{G}_\\\\infty is the smallest œÉ-algebra containing all the others. Definition and properties =Definition= Let X be some set, and let \\\\mathcal{P}(X) represent its power set. Then a subset \\\\Sigma \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{P}(X) is called a œÉ-algebra if it satisfies the following three properties: # X is in Œ£, and X is considered to be the universal set in the following context. # Œ£ is closed under complementation: If A is in Œ£, then so is its complement, . # Œ£ is closed under countable unions: If A1, A2, A3, ... are in Œ£, then so is A = A1 ‚à™ A2 ‚à™ A3 ‚à™ ‚Ä¶ . From these properties, it follows that the œÉ-algebra is also closed under countable intersections (by applying De Morgan's laws). It also follows that the empty set ‚àÖ is in Œ£, since by (1) X is in Œ£ and (2) asserts that its complement, the empty set, is also in Œ£. Moreover, since } satisfies condition (3) as well, it follows that } is the smallest possible œÉ-algebra on X. The largest possible œÉ-algebra on X is 2X:=\\\\mathcal{P}(X). Elements of the œÉ-algebra are called measurable sets. An ordered pair , where X is a set and Œ£ is a œÉ-algebra over X, is called a measurable space. A function between two measurable spaces is called a measurable function if the preimage of every measurable set is measurable. The collection of measurable spaces forms a category, with the measurable functions as morphisms. Measures are defined as certain types of functions from a œÉ-algebra to [0, ‚àû]. A œÉ-algebra is both a œÄ-system and a Dynkin system (Œª-system). The converse is true as well, by Dynkin's theorem (below). =Dynkin's œÄ-Œª theorem= This theorem (or the related monotone class theorem) is an essential tool for proving many results about properties of specific œÉ-algebras. It capitalizes on the nature of two simpler classes of sets, namely the following. : A œÄ-system P is a collection of subsets of X that is closed under finitely many intersections, and : a Dynkin system (or Œª-system) D is a collection of subsets of X that contains X and is closed under complement and under countable unions of disjoint subsets. Dynkin's œÄ-Œª theorem says, if P is a œÄ-system and D is a Dynkin system that contains P then the œÉ-algebra œÉ(P) generated by P is contained in D. Since certain œÄ-systems are relatively simple classes, it may not be hard to verify that all sets in P enjoy the property under consideration while, on the other hand, showing that the collection D of all subsets with the property is a Dynkin system can also be straightforward. Dynkin's œÄ-Œª Theorem then implies that all sets in œÉ(P) enjoy the property, avoiding the task of checking it for an arbitrary set in œÉ(P). One of the most fundamental uses of the œÄ-Œª theorem is to show equivalence of separately defined measures or integrals. For example, it is used to equate a probability for a random variable X with the Lebesgue- Stieltjes integral typically associated with computing the probability: :\\\\mathbb{P}(X\\\\in A)=\\\\int_A \\\\,F(dx) for all A in the Borel œÉ-algebra on R, where F(x) is the cumulative distribution function for X, defined on R, while \\\\mathbb{P} is a probability measure, defined on a œÉ-algebra Œ£ of subsets of some sample space Œ©. =Combining œÉ-algebras= Suppose \\\\textstyle\\\\\\\\{\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha:\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}\\\\\\\\} is a collection of œÉ-algebras on a space X. * The intersection of a collection of œÉ-algebras is a œÉ-algebra. To emphasize its character as a œÉ-algebra, it often is denoted by: ::\\\\bigwedge_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha. :Sketch of Proof: Let denote the intersection. Since X is in every is not empty. Closure under complement and countable unions for every implies the same must be true for . Therefore, is a œÉ-algebra. * The union of a collection of œÉ-algebras is not generally a œÉ-algebra, or even an algebra, but it generates a œÉ-algebra known as the join which typically is denoted ::\\\\bigvee_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha=\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha\\\\right). :A œÄ-system that generates the join is ::\\\\mathcal{P}=\\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\bigcap_{i=1}^nA_i:A_i\\\\in\\\\Sigma_{\\\\alpha_i},\\\\alpha_i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A},\\\\ n\\\\ge1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. :Sketch of Proof: By the case n = 1, it is seen that each \\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{P}, so ::\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{P}. :This implies ::\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha\\\\right)\\\\subset\\\\sigma(\\\\mathcal{P}) :by the definition of a œÉ-algebra generated by a collection of subsets. On the other hand, ::\\\\mathcal{P}\\\\subset\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha\\\\right) :which, by Dynkin's œÄ-Œª theorem, implies ::\\\\sigma(\\\\mathcal{P})\\\\subset\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\Sigma_\\\\alpha\\\\right). =œÉ-algebras for subspaces= Suppose Y is a subset of X and let (X, Œ£) be a measurable space. * The collection {Y ‚à© B: B ‚àà Œ£} is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of Y. * Suppose (Y, Œõ) is a measurable space. The collection {A ‚äÇ X : A ‚à© Y ‚àà Œõ} is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of X. =Relation to œÉ-ring= A œÉ-algebra Œ£ is just a œÉ-ring that contains the universal set X. A œÉ-ring need not be a œÉ-algebra, as for example measurable subsets of zero Lebesgue measure in the real line are a œÉ-ring, but not a œÉ-algebra since the real line has infinite measure and thus cannot be obtained by their countable union. If, instead of zero measure, one takes measurable subsets of finite Lebesgue measure, those are a ring but not a œÉ-ring, since the real line can be obtained by their countable union yet its measure is not finite. =Typographic note= œÉ-algebras are sometimes denoted using calligraphic capital letters, or the Fraktur typeface. Thus may be denoted as \\\\scriptstyle(X,\\\\,\\\\mathcal{F}) or \\\\scriptstyle(X,\\\\,\\\\mathfrak{F}). Particular cases and examples =Separable œÉ-algebras= A separable œÉ-algebra (or separable œÉ-field) is a œÉ-algebra \\\\mathcal{F} that is a separable space when considered as a metric space with metric \\\\rho(A,B) = \\\\mu(A \\\\mathbin{\\\\triangle} B) for A,B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F} and a given measure \\\\mu (and with \\\\triangle being the symmetric difference operator). Note that any œÉ-algebra generated by a countable collection of sets is separable, but the converse need not hold. For example, the Lebesgue œÉ-algebra is separable (since every Lebesgue measurable set is equivalent to some Borel set) but not countably generated (since its cardinality is higher than continuum). A separable measure space has a natural pseudometric that renders it separable as a pseudometric space. The distance between two sets is defined as the measure of the symmetric difference of the two sets. Note that the symmetric difference of two distinct sets can have measure zero; hence the pseudometric as defined above need not to be a true metric. However, if sets whose symmetric difference has measure zero are identified into a single equivalence class, the resulting quotient set can be properly metrized by the induced metric. If the measure space is separable, it can be shown that the corresponding metric space is, too. =Simple set-based examples= Let X be any set. * The family consisting only of the empty set and the set X, called the minimal or trivial œÉ-algebra over X. * The power set of X, called the discrete œÉ-algebra. * The collection {‚àÖ, A, Ac, X} is a simple œÉ-algebra generated by the subset A. * The collection of subsets of X which are countable or whose complements are countable is a œÉ-algebra (which is distinct from the power set of X if and only if X is uncountable). This is the œÉ-algebra generated by the singletons of X. Note: \\"countable\\" includes finite or empty. * The collection of all unions of sets in a countable partition of X is a œÉ-algebra. =Stopping time œÉ-algebras= A stopping time \\\\tau can define a \\\\sigma-algebra \\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\tau}, the so-called \\\\sigma -Algebra of œÑ-past, which in a filtered probability space describes the information up to the random time \\\\tau in the sense that, if the filtered probability space is interpreted as a random experiment, the maximum information that can be found out about the experiment from arbitrarily often repeating it until the time \\\\tau is \\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\tau}. œÉ-algebras generated by families of sets =œÉ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family= Let F be an arbitrary family of subsets of X. Then there exists a unique smallest œÉ-algebra which contains every set in F (even though F may or may not itself be a œÉ-algebra). It is, in fact, the intersection of all œÉ-algebras containing F. (See intersections of œÉ-algebras above.) This œÉ-algebra is denoted œÉ(F) and is called the œÉ-algebra generated by F. Then œÉ(F) consists of all the subsets of X that can be made from elements of F by a countable number of complement, union and intersection operations. If F is empty, then œÉ(F) = }, since an empty union and intersection produce the empty set and universal set, respectively. For a simple example, consider the set X = {1, 2, 3}. Then the œÉ-algebra generated by the single subset {1} is }}. By an abuse of notation, when a collection of subsets contains only one element, A, one may write œÉ(A) instead of œÉ({A}) if it is clear that A is a subset of X; in the prior example œÉ({1}) instead of œÉ(). Indeed, using to mean is also quite common. There are many families of subsets that generate useful œÉ-algebras. Some of these are presented here. =œÉ-algebra generated by a function= If f is a function from a set X to a set Y and B is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of Y, then the œÉ-algebra generated by the function f, denoted by œÉ(f), is the collection of all inverse images f -1(S) of the sets S in B. i.e. : \\\\sigma (f) = \\\\\\\\{ f^{-1}(S) \\\\,  \\\\, S\\\\in B \\\\\\\\}. A function f from a set X to a set Y is measurable with respect to a œÉ-algebra Œ£ of subsets of X if and only if œÉ(f) is a subset of Œ£. One common situation, and understood by default if B is not specified explicitly, is when Y is a metric or topological space and B is the collection of Borel sets on Y. If f is a function from X to Rn then œÉ(f) is generated by the family of subsets which are inverse images of intervals/rectangles in Rn: :\\\\sigma(f)=\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\\\\\{f^{-1}((a_1,b_1]\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times(a_n,b_n]):a_i,b_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\}\\\\right). A useful property is the following. Assume f is a measurable map from (X, Œ£X) to (S, Œ£S) and g is a measurable map from (X, Œ£X) to (T, Œ£T). If there exists a measurable map h from (T, Œ£T) to (S, Œ£S) such that f(x) = h(g(x)) for all x, then œÉ(f) ‚äÇ œÉ(g). If S is finite or countably infinite or, more generally, (S, Œ£S) is a standard Borel space (e.g., a separable complete metric space with its associated Borel sets), then the converse is also true. Examples of standard Borel spaces include Rn with its Borel sets and R‚àû with the cylinder œÉ-algebra described below. =Borel and Lebesgue œÉ-algebras= An important example is the Borel algebra over any topological space: the œÉ-algebra generated by the open sets (or, equivalently, by the closed sets). Note that this œÉ-algebra is not, in general, the whole power set. For a non-trivial example that is not a Borel set, see the Vitali set or Non-Borel sets. On the Euclidean space Rn, another œÉ-algebra is of importance: that of all Lebesgue measurable sets. This œÉ-algebra contains more sets than the Borel œÉ-algebra on Rn and is preferred in integration theory, as it gives a complete measure space. =Product œÉ-algebra= Let (X_1,\\\\Sigma_1) and (X_2,\\\\Sigma_2) be two measurable spaces. The œÉ-algebra for the corresponding product space X_1\\\\times X_2 is called the product œÉ-algebra and is defined by :\\\\Sigma_1\\\\times\\\\Sigma_2=\\\\sigma(\\\\\\\\{B_1\\\\times B_2:B_1\\\\in\\\\Sigma_1,B_2\\\\in\\\\Sigma_2\\\\\\\\}). Observe that \\\\\\\\{B_1\\\\times B_2:B_1\\\\in\\\\Sigma_1,B_2\\\\in\\\\Sigma_2\\\\\\\\} is a œÄ-system. The Borel œÉ-algebra for Rn is generated by half-infinite rectangles and by finite rectangles. For example, :\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n)=\\\\sigma \\\\left(\\\\left \\\\\\\\{(-\\\\infty,b_1]\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times(-\\\\infty,b_n]:b_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}\\\\right) = \\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\left \\\\\\\\{(a_1,b_1]\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times(a_n,b_n]:a_i,b_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}\\\\right). For each of these two examples, the generating family is a œÄ-system. =œÉ-algebra generated by cylinder sets= Suppose :X\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{T}}=\\\\\\\\{f:f \\\\text{ is a function from } \\\\mathbb{T} \\\\text{ to } \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\} is a set of real-valued functions on \\\\mathbb{T}. Let \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathbb{R}) denote the Borel subsets of R. For each \\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{T} and \\\\\\\\{B_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n\\\\subset\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathbb{R}) a cylinder subset of is a finitely restricted set defined as :C_{t_1,\\\\dots,t_n}(B_1,\\\\dots,B_n)=\\\\\\\\{f\\\\in X:f(t_i)\\\\in B_i, 1\\\\le i \\\\le n\\\\\\\\}. For each \\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{T}, :\\\\\\\\{C_{t_1,\\\\dots,t_n}(B_1,\\\\dots,B_n):B_i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathbb{R}), 1\\\\le i \\\\le n\\\\\\\\} is a œÄ-system that generates a œÉ-algebra \\\\textstyle\\\\Sigma_{t_1,\\\\dots,t_n}. Then the family of subsets :\\\\mathcal{F}_X=\\\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\bigcup_{t_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{T},i\\\\le n}\\\\Sigma_{t_1,\\\\dots,t_n} is an algebra that generates the cylinder œÉ-algebra for . This œÉ-algebra is a subalgebra of the Borel œÉ-algebra determined by the product topology of \\\\mathbb{R}^{\\\\mathbb{T}} restricted to . An important special case is when \\\\mathbb{T} is the set of natural numbers and is a set of real-valued sequences. In this case, it suffices to consider the cylinder sets :C_n(B_1,\\\\dots,B_n)=(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\infty)\\\\cap X=\\\\\\\\{(x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n,x_{n+1},\\\\dots)\\\\in X:x_i\\\\in B_i,1\\\\le i\\\\le n\\\\\\\\}, for which :\\\\Sigma_n=\\\\sigma(\\\\\\\\{C_n(B_1,\\\\dots,B_n):B_i\\\\in\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathbb{R}), 1\\\\le i \\\\le n\\\\\\\\}) is a non-decreasing sequence of œÉ-algebras. =œÉ-algebra generated by random variable or vector= Suppose (\\\\Omega,\\\\Sigma,\\\\mathbb{P}) is a probability space. If \\\\textstyle Y:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^n is measurable with respect to the Borel œÉ-algebra on Rn then is called a random variable (n = 1) or random vector (n > 1). The œÉ-algebra generated by is : \\\\sigma (Y) = \\\\\\\\{ Y^{-1}(A): A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) \\\\\\\\}. =œÉ-algebra generated by a stochastic process= Suppose (\\\\Omega,\\\\Sigma,\\\\mathbb{P}) is a probability space and \\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\mathbb{T} is the set of real-valued functions on \\\\mathbb{T}. If \\\\textstyle Y:\\\\Omega\\\\to X\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\mathbb{T} is measurable with respect to the cylinder œÉ-algebra \\\\sigma(\\\\mathcal{F}_X) (see above) for , then is called a stochastic process or random process. The œÉ-algebra generated by is :\\\\sigma(Y) = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ Y^{-1}(A): A\\\\in\\\\sigma(\\\\mathcal{F}_X) \\\\right \\\\\\\\}= \\\\sigma(\\\\\\\\{ Y^{-1}(A): A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F}_X\\\\\\\\}), the œÉ-algebra generated by the inverse images of cylinder sets.

The primary use of a sextant is to measure the angle between an astronomical object and the horizon for the purposes of celestial navigation. The estimation of this angle, the altitude, is known as sighting or shooting the object, or taking a sight. The angle, and the time when it was measured, can be used to calculate a position line on a nautical or aeronautical chart‚Äîfor example, sighting the Sun at noon or Polaris at night (in the Northern Hemisphere) to estimate latitude. Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of distance off and, held horizontally, a sextant can measure angles between objects for a position on a chart. A sextant can also be used to measure the lunar distance between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine Greenwich Mean Time and hence longitude. The principle of the instrument was first implemented around 1731 by John Hadley (1682‚Äì1744) and Thomas Godfrey (1704‚Äì1749), but it was also found later in the unpublished writings of Isaac Newton (1643‚Äì1727). In 1922, it was modified for aeronautical navigation by Portuguese navigator and naval officer . Navigational sextants Using a sextant Like the Davis quadrant, the sextant allows celestial objects to be measured relative to the horizon, rather than relative to the instrument. This allows excellent precision. Also, unlike the backstaff, the sextant allows direct observations of stars. This permits the use of the sextant at night when a backstaff is difficult to use. For solar observations, filters allow direct observation of the sun. Since the measurement is relative to the horizon, the measuring pointer is a beam of light that reaches to the horizon. The measurement is thus limited by the angular accuracy of the instrument and not the sine error of the length of an alidade, as it is in a mariner's astrolabe or similar older instrument. A sextant does not require a completely steady aim, because it measures a relative angle. For example, when a sextant is used on a moving ship, the image of both horizon and celestial object will move around in the field of view. However, the relative position of the two images will remain steady, and as long as the user can determine when the celestial object touches the horizon, the accuracy of the measurement will remain high compared to the magnitude of the movement. The sextant is not dependent upon electricity (unlike many forms of modern navigation) or for that matter anything reliant on human-controlled signals (such as GPS satellites). For these reasons it is considered to be an eminently practical back-up navigation tool for ships. =Design= The frame of a sextant is in the shape of a sector which is approximately of a circle (60¬∞), hence its name (sextƒÅns, -antis is the Latin word for \\"one sixth\\"). Both smaller and larger instruments are (or were) in use: the octant, quintant (or pentant) and the (doubly reflecting) quadrantThis article treats the doubly reflecting quadrant, not its predecessor described at quadrant. span sectors of approximately of a circle (45¬∞), of a circle (72¬∞) and of a circle (90¬∞), respectively. All of these instruments may be termed \\"sextants\\". right altitude of the Sun above the horizon300pxright Attached to the frame are the \\"horizon mirror\\", an index arm which moves the index mirror, a sighting telescope, sun shades, a graduated scale and a micrometer drum gauge for accurate measurements. The scale must be graduated so that the marked degree divisions register twice the angle through which the index arm turns. The scales of the octant, sextant, quintant and quadrant are graduated from below zero to 90¬∞, 120¬∞, 140¬∞ and 180¬∞ respectively. For example, the sextant shown alongside has a scale graduated from ‚àí10¬∞ to 142¬∞, so that is basically a quintant: the frame is a sector of a circle subtending an angle of 76¬∞ (not 72¬∞) at the pivot of the index arm. The necessity for the doubled scale reading follows by consideration of the relations of the fixed ray (between the mirrors), the object ray (from the sighted object) and the direction of the normal perpendicular to the index mirror. When the index arm moves by an angle, say 20¬∞, the angle between the fixed ray and the normal also increases by 20¬∞. But the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection so the angle between the object ray and the normal must also increase by 20¬∞. The angle between the fixed ray and the object ray must therefore increase by 40¬∞. This is the case shown in the graphic alongside. There are two types of horizon mirrors on the market today. Both types give good results. Traditional sextants have a half- horizon mirror, which divides the field of view in two. On one side, there is a view of the horizon; on the other side, a view of the celestial object. The advantage of this type is that both the horizon and celestial object are bright and as clear as possible. This is superior at night and in haze, when the horizon and/or a star being sighted can be difficult to see. However, one has to sweep the celestial object to ensure that the lowest limb of the celestial object touches the horizon. Whole-horizon sextants use a half- silvered horizon mirror to provide a full view of the horizon. This makes it easy to see when the bottom limb of a celestial object touches the horizon. Since most sights are of the sun or moon, and haze is rare without overcast, the low-light advantages of the half-horizon mirror are rarely important in practice. In both types, larger mirrors give a larger field of view, and thus make it easier to find a celestial object. Modern sextants often have 5 cm or larger mirrors, while 19th-century sextants rarely had a mirror larger than 2.5 cm (one inch). In large part, this is because precision flat mirrors have grown less expensive to manufacture and to silver. An artificial horizon is useful when the horizon is invisible, as occurs in fog, on moonless nights, in a calm, when sighting through a window or on land surrounded by trees or buildings. There are two common designs of artificial horizon. An artificial horizon can consist simply of a pool of water shielded from the wind, allowing the user to measure the distance between the body and its reflection, and divide by two. Another design allows the mounting of a fluid-filled tube with bubble directly to the sextant. Most sextants also have filters for use when viewing the sun and reducing the effects of haze. The filters usually consist of a series of progressively darker glasses that can be used singly or in combination to reduce haze and the sun's brightness. However, sextants with adjustable polarizing filters have also been manufactured, where the degree of darkness is adjusted by twisting the frame of the filter. Most sextants mount a 1 or 3-power monocular for viewing. Many users prefer a simple sighting tube, which has a wider, brighter field of view and is easier to use at night. Some navigators mount a light-amplifying monocular to help see the horizon on moonless nights. Others prefer to use a lit artificial horizon. Professional sextants use a click-stop degree measure and a worm adjustment that reads to a minute, 1/60 of a degree. Most sextants also include a vernier on the worm dial that reads to 0.1 minute. Since 1 minute of error is about a nautical mile, the best possible accuracy of celestial navigation is about . At sea, results within several nautical miles, well within visual range, are acceptable. A highly skilled and experienced navigator can determine position to an accuracy of about .Dutton's Navigation and Piloting, 12th edition. G.D. Dunlap and H.H. Shufeldt, eds. Naval Institute Press 1972, A change in temperature can warp the arc, creating inaccuracies. Many navigators purchase weatherproof cases so that their sextant can be placed outside the cabin to come to equilibrium with outside temperatures. The standard frame designs (see illustration) are supposed to equalise differential angular error from temperature changes. The handle is separated from the arc and frame so that body heat does not warp the frame. Sextants for tropical use are often painted white to reflect sunlight and remain relatively cool. High-precision sextants have an invar (a special low-expansion steel) frame and arc. Some scientific sextants have been constructed of quartz or ceramics with even lower expansions. Many commercial sextants use low-expansion brass or aluminium. Brass is lower-expansion than aluminium, but aluminium sextants are lighter and less tiring to use. Some say they are more accurate because one's hand trembles less. Solid brass frame sextants are less susceptible to wobbling in high winds or when the vessel is working in heavy seas, but as noted are substantially heavier. Sextants with aluminum frames and brass arcs have also been manufactured. Essentially, a sextant is intensely personal to each navigator, and they will choose whichever model has the features which suit them best. Aircraft sextants are now out of production, but had special features. Most had artificial horizons to permit taking a sight through a flush overhead window. Some also had mechanical averagers to make hundreds of measurements per sight for compensation of random accelerations in the artificial horizon's fluid. Older aircraft sextants had two visual paths, one standard and the other designed for use in open-cockpit aircraft that let one view from directly over the sextant in one's lap. More modern aircraft sextants were periscopic with only a small projection above the fuselage. With these, the navigator pre-computed their sight and then noted the difference in observed versus predicted height of the body to determine their position. =Taking a sight= A sight (or measure) of the angle between the sun, a star, or a planet, and the horizon is done with the 'star telescope' fitted to the sextant using a visible horizon. On a vessel at sea even on misty days a sight may be done from a low height above the water to give a more definite, better horizon. Navigators hold the sextant by its handle in the right hand, avoiding touching the arc with the fingers. For a sun sight, a filter is used to overcome the glare such as \\"shades\\" covering both index mirror and the horizon mirror designed to prevent eye damage. By setting the index bar to zero, the sun can be viewed through the telescope. Releasing the index bar (either by releasing a clamping screw, or on modern instruments, using the quick-release button), the image of the sun can be brought down to about the level of the horizon. It is necessary to flip back the horizon mirror shade to be able to see the horizon, and then the fine adjustment screw on the end of the index bar is turned until the bottom curve (the lower limb) of the sun just touches the horizon. \\"Swinging\\" the sextant about the axis of the telescope ensures that the reading is being taken with the instrument held vertically. The angle of the sight is then read from the scale on the arc, making use of the micrometer or vernier scale provided. The exact time of the sight must also be noted simultaneously, and the height of the eye above sea- level recorded. An alternative method is to estimate the current altitude (angle) of the sun from navigation tables, then set the index bar to that angle on the arc, apply suitable shades only to the index mirror, and point the instrument directly at the horizon, sweeping it from side to side until a flash of the sun's rays are seen in the telescope. Fine adjustments are then made as above. This method is less likely to be successful for sighting stars and planets. Star and planet sights are normally taken during nautical twilight at dawn or dusk, while both the heavenly bodies and the sea horizon are visible. There is no need to use shades or to distinguish the lower limb as the body appears as a mere point in the telescope. The moon can be sighted, but it appears to move very fast, appears to have different sizes at different times, and sometimes only the lower or upper limb can be distinguished due to its phase. After a sight is taken, it is reduced to a position by looking at several mathematical procedures. The simplest sight reduction is to draw the equal-altitude circle of the sighted celestial object on a globe. The intersection of that circle with a dead-reckoning track, or another sighting, gives a more precise location. Sextants can be used very accurately to measure other visible angles, for example between one heavenly body and another and between landmarks ashore. Used horizontally, a sextant can measure the apparent angle between two landmarks such as a lighthouse and a church spire, which can then be used to find the distance off or out to sea (provided the distance between the two landmarks is known). Used vertically, a measurement of the angle between the lantern of a lighthouse of known height and the sea level at its base can also be used for distance off. =Adjustment= Due to the sensitivity of the instrument it is easy to knock the mirrors out of adjustment. For this reason a sextant should be checked frequently for errors and adjusted accordingly. There are four errors that can be adjusted by the navigator, and they should be removed in the following order. ;Perpendicularity error:This is when the index mirror is not perpendicular to the frame of the sextant. To test for this, place the index arm at about 60¬∞ on the arc and hold the sextant horizontally with the arc away from you at arm's length and look into the index mirror. The arc of the sextant should appear to continue unbroken into the mirror. If there is an error, then the two views will appear to be broken. Adjust the mirror until the reflection and direct view of the arc appear to be continuous. ;Side error:This occurs when the horizon glass/mirror is not perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. To test for this, first zero the index arm then observe a star through the sextant. Then rotate the tangent screw back and forth so that the reflected image passes alternately above and below the direct view. If in changing from one position to another, the reflected image passes directly over the unreflected image, no side error exists. If it passes to one side, side error exists. The user can hold the sextant on its side and observe the horizon to check the sextant during the day. If there are two horizons there is side error; adjust the horizon glass/mirror until the stars merge into one image or the horizons are merged into one. Side error is generally inconsequential for observations and can be ignored or reduced to a level that is merely inconvenient. ;Collimation error:This is when the telescope or monocular is not parallel to the plane of the sextant. To check for this you need to observe two stars 90¬∞ or more apart. Bring the two stars into coincidence either to the left or the right of the field of view. Move the sextant slightly so that the stars move to the other side of the field of view. If they separate there is collimation error. As modern sextants rarely use adjustable telescopes, they do not need to be corrected for collimation error. ;Index error:This occurs when the index and horizon mirrors are not parallel to each other when the index arm is set to zero. To test for index error, zero the index arm and observe the horizon. If the reflected and direct image of the horizon are in line there is no index error.

This can be done at night with a star or with the moon. =Modern Navy Training= After a 15-year interregnum, the U.S. Navy began training again in the sextant as back-up navigational devices as instructed by 30th Chief of Naval Operations inasmuch as it does not rely on electrical systems.https://navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/09/09/uss-benfold-sailors-look-to- past-to-chart-their-future/ See also * Astrolabe * Bris sextant * Davis quadrant * Gago Coutinho * Harold Gatty * History of longitude * Intercept method * Latitude * Longitude * Longitude by chronometer * Mariner's astrolabe * Navigation * Octant (instrument) * Quadrant (instrument) * Sextant (astronomical) Notes References   * External links * Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office * The History of HM Nautical Almanac Office * Chapter 17 from the online edition of Nathaniel Bowditch's American Practical Navigator * Understand difference in Antique & Replica Sextant * CD- Sextant - Build your own sextant Simple do-it-yourself project. * Lunars web site. online calculation * Complete celnav theory book, including Lunars Category:Navigational equipment Category:Celestial navigation Category:1731 introductions Category:Astronomical instruments ","title":"Sextant"},{"id":"29591","text":"Example of a stellarator design, as used in the Wendelstein 7-X experiment: A series of magnet coils (blue) surrounds the plasma (yellow). A magnetic field line is highlighted in green on the yellow plasma surface. Wendelstein 7-X in Greifswald, Germany. Coils are prepared for the experimental stellarator. HSX stellarator A stellarator is a plasma device that relies primarily on external magnets to confine a plasma. In the future, scientists researching magnetic confinement fusion aim to use stellarator devices as a vessel for nuclear fusion reactions. The name refers to the possibility of harnessing the power source of the stars, including the sun. It is one of the earliest fusion power devices, along with the z-pinch and magnetic mirror. The stellarator was invented by American scientist Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1951, and much of its early development was carried out by his team at what became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). Lyman's Model A began operation in 1953 and demonstrated plasma confinement. Larger models followed, but these demonstrated poor performance, suffering from a problem known as pump-out that caused them to lose plasma at rates far worse than theoretical predictions. By the early 1960s, any hope of quickly producing a commercial machine faded, and attention turned to studying the fundamental theory of high-energy plasmas. By the mid-1960s, Spitzer was convinced that the stellarator was matching the Bohm diffusion rate, which suggested it would never be a practical fusion device. The release of information on the USSR's tokamak design in 1968 indicated a leap in performance. After great debate within the US industry, PPPL converted the Model C stellarator to the Symmetrical Tokamak (ST) as a way to confirm or deny these results. ST confirmed them, and large-scale work on the stellarator concept ended as the tokamak got most of the attention for the next two decades. The tokamak ultimately proved to have similar problems to the stellarators, but for different reasons. Since the 1990s, the stellarator design has seen renewed interest. New methods of construction have increased the quality and power of the magnetic fields, improving performance. A number of new devices have been built to test these concepts. Major examples include Wendelstein 7-X in Germany, the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) in the US, and the Large Helical Device in Japan. History =Previous work= In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford were the first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. These experiments allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various reactions of fusion between nuclei, and determined that the tritium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than any other fuel, peaking at about 100,000 electronvolts (100 keV). 100 keV corresponds to a temperature of about a billion kelvins. Due to the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics, a bulk gas at a much lower temperature will still contain some particles at these much higher energies. Because the fusion reactions release so much energy, even a small number of these reactions can release enough energy to keep the gas at the required temperature. In 1944, Enrico Fermi demonstrated that this would occur at a bulk temperature of about 50 million Celsius, still very hot but within the range of existing experimental systems. The key problem was confining such a plasma; no material container could withstand those temperatures. But because plasmas are electrically conductive, they are subject to electric and magnetic fields which provide a number of solutions. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei of the plasma circle the magnetic lines of force. One way to provide some confinement would be to place a tube of fuel inside the open core of a solenoid. A solenoid creates magnetic lines running down its center, and fuel would be held away from the walls by orbiting these lines of force. But such an arrangement does not confine the plasma along the length of the tube. The obvious solution is to bend the tube around into a torus (donut) shape, so that any one line forms a circle, and the particles can circle forever. However, this solution does not actually work. For purely geometric reasons, the magnets ringing the torus are closer together on the inside curve, inside the \\"donut hole\\". Fermi noted this would cause the electrons to drift away from the nuclei, eventually causing them to separate and cause large voltages to develop. The resulting electric field would cause the plasma ring inside the torus to expand until it hit the walls of the reactor. =Stellarator= In the post-war era, a number of researchers began considering different ways to confine a plasma. George Paget Thomson of Imperial College London proposed a system now known as z-pinch, which runs a current through the plasma. Due to the Lorentz force, this current creates a magnetic field that pulls the plasma in on itself, keeping it away from the walls of the reactor. This eliminates the need for magnets on the outside, avoiding the problem Fermi noted. Various teams in the UK had built a number of small experimental devices using this technique by the late 1940s. Another person working on controlled fusion reactors was Ronald Richter, a former German scientist who moved to Argentina after the war. His thermotron used a system of electrical arcs and mechanical compression (sound waves) for heating and confinement. He convinced Juan Per√≥n to fund development of an experimental reactor on an isolated island near the Chilean border. Known as the Huemul Project, this was completed in 1951. Richter soon convinced himself fusion had been achieved in spite of other people working on the project disagreeing. The \\"success\\" was announced by Per√≥n on 24 March 1951, becoming the topic of newspaper stories around the world. While preparing for a ski trip to Aspen, Lyman Spitzer received a telephone call from his father, who mentioned an article on Huemul in The New York Times. Looking over the description in the article, Spitzer concluded it could not possibly work; the system simply could not provide enough energy to heat the fuel to fusion temperatures. But the idea stuck with him, and he began considering systems that would work. While riding the ski lift, he hit upon the stellarator concept. The basic concept was a way to modify the torus layout so that it addressed Fermi's concerns though the device's geometry. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the magnetic lines no longer travelled around the tube at a constant radius, instead they moved closer and further from the torus' center. A particle orbiting these lines would find itself constantly moving in and out across the minor axis of the torus. The drift upward while it travelled through one section of the reactor would be reversed after half an orbit and it would drift downward again. The cancellation was not perfect, but it appeared this would so greatly reduce the net drift rates that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to heat it to the required temperatures. His 1958 description was simple and direct: =Matterhorn= While working at Los Alamos in 1950, John Wheeler suggested setting up a secret research lab at Princeton University that would carry on theoretical work on H-bombs after he returned to the university in 1951. Spitzer was invited to join this program, given his previous research in interstellar plasmas. But by the time of his trip to Aspen, Spitzer had lost interest in bomb design and he turned his attention full-time to fusion as a power source. Over the next few months, Spitzer produced a series of reports outlining the conceptual basis for the stellarator, as well as potential problems. The series is notable for its depth; it not only included a detailed analysis of the mathematics of the plasma and stability but also outlined a number of additional problems like heating the plasma and dealing with impurities. With this work in hand, Spitzer began to lobby the Department of Energy (DOE) for funding to develop the system. He outlined a plan involving three stages. The first would see the construction of a Model A, whose purpose was to demonstrate that a plasma could be created and that its confinement time was better than a torus. If the A model was successful, the B model would attempt to heat the plasma to fusion temperatures. This would be followed by a C model, which would attempt to actually create fusion reactions at a large scale. This entire series was expected to take about a decade. Around the same time, Jim Tuck had been introduced to the pinch concept while working at Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University. He was offered a job in the US and eventually ended up at Los Alamos, where he acquainted the other researchers with the concept. When he heard Spitzer was promoting the stellarator, he also travelled to Washington to propose building a pinch device. He considered Spitzer's plans \\"incredibly ambitious.\\" Nevertheless, Spitzer was successful in gaining $50,000 in funding from the DOE, while Tuck received nothing. The Princeton program was officially created on 1 July 1951. Spitzer, an avid mountain climber, proposed the name \\"Project Matterhorn\\" because he felt \\"the work at hand seemed difficult, like the ascent of a mountain.\\" Two sections were initially set up, S Section working on the stellarator under Spitzer, and B Section working on bomb design under Wheeler. Matterhorn was set up at Princeton's new Forrestal Campus, a plot of land the University purchased from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research when Rockefeller relocated to Manhattan. The land was located about from the main Princeton campus and already had sixteen laboratory buildings. Spitzer set up the top-secret S Section in a former rabbit hutch. It was not long before the other labs began agitating for their own funding. Tuck had managed to arrange some funding for his Perhapsatron through some discretionary budgets at LANL, but other teams at LANL, Berkeley and Oak Ridge (ORNL) also presented their ideas. The DOE eventually organized a new department for all of these projects, becoming \\"Project Sherwood\\". =Early devices= With the funding from the DOE, Spitzer began work by inviting James Van Allen to join the group and set up an experimental program. Allen suggested starting with a small \\"tabletop\\" device. This led to the Model A design, which began construction in 1952. It was made from pyrex tubes about in total length, and magnets capable of about 1,000 gauss. The machine began operations in early 1953 and clearly demonstrated improved confinement over the simple torus. This led to the construction of the Model B, which had the problem that the magnets were not well mounted and tended to move around when they were powered to their maximum capacity of 50,000 gauss. A second design also failed for the same reason, but this machine demonstrated several-hundred-kilovolt X-rays that suggested good confinement. The lessons from these two designs led to the B-1, which used ohmic heating (see below) to reach plasma temperatures around 100,000 degrees. This machine demonstrated that impurities in the plasma caused large x-ray emissions that rapidly cooled the plasma. In 1956, B-1 was rebuilt with an ultra-high vacuum system to reduce the impurities but found that even at smaller quantities they were still a serious problem. Another effect noticed in the B-1 was that during the heating process, the particles would remain confined for only a few tenths of a millisecond, while once the field was turned off, any remaining particles were confined for as long as 10 milliseconds. This appeared to be due to \\"cooperative effects\\" within the plasma. Meanwhile, a second machine known as B-2 was being built. This was similar to the B-1 machine but used pulsed power to allow it to reach higher magnetic energy and included a second heating system known as magnetic pumping. This machine was also modified to add an ultra-high vacuum system. Unfortunately, B-2 demonstrated little heating from the magnetic pumping, which was not entirely unexpected because this mechanism required longer confinement times, and this was not being achieved. As it appeared that little could be learned from this system in its current form, in 1958 it was sent to the Atoms for Peace show in Geneva. However, when the heating system was modified, the coupling increased dramatically, demonstrating temperatures within the heating section as high as . Two additional machines were built to study pulsed operation. B-64 was completed in 1955, essentially a larger version of the B-1 machine but powered by pulses of current that produced up to 15,000 gauss. This machine included a diverter, which removed impurities from the plasma, greatly reducing the x-ray cooling effect seen on earlier machines. B-64 included straight sections in the curved ends which gave it a squared-off appearance. This appearance led to its name, it was a \\"figure-8, squared\\", or 8 squared, or 64. This led to experiments in 1956 where the machine was re-assembled without the twist in the tubes, allowing the particles to travel without rotation. B-65, completed in 1957, was built using the new \\"racetrack\\" layout. This was the result of the observation that adding helical coils to the curved portions of the device produced a field that introduced the rotation purely through the resulting magnetic fields. This had the added advantage that the magnetic field included shear, which was known to improve stability. B-3, also completed in 1957, was a greatly enlarged B-2 machine with ultra-high vacuum and pulsed confinement up to 50,000 gauss and projected confinement times as long as 0.01 second. The last of the B-series machines was the B-66, completed in 1958, which was essentially a combination of the racetrack layout from B-65 with the larger size and energy of the B-3. Unfortunately, all of these larger machines demonstrated a problem that came to be known as \\"pump out\\". This effect was causing plasma drift rates that were not only higher than classical theory suggested but also much higher than the Bohm rates. B-3's drift rate was a full three times that of the worst-case Bohm predictions, and failed to maintain confinement for more than a few tens of microseconds. =Model C= As early as 1954, as research continued on the B-series machines, the design of the Model C device was becoming more defined. It emerged as a large racetrack-layout machine with multiple heating sources and a diverter, essentially an even larger B-66. Construction began in 1958 and was completed in 1961. It could be adjusted to allow a plasma minor axis between and was in length. The toroidal field coils normally operated at 35,000 gauss. By the time Model C began operations, information collected from previous machines was making it clear that it would not be able to produce large-scale fusion. Ion transport across the magnetic field lines was much higher than classical theory suggested. Greatly increased magnetic fields of the later machines did little to address this, and confinement times simply were not improving. Attention began to turn to a much greater emphasis on the theoretical understanding of the plasma. In 1961, Melvin B. Gottlieb took over the Matterhorn Project from Spitzer, and on 1 February the project was renamed as the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). Continual modification and experimentation on the Model C slowly improved its operation, and the confinement times eventually increased to match that of Bohm predictions. New versions of the heating systems were used that slowly increased the temperatures. Notable among these was the 1964 addition of a small particle accelerator to accelerate fuel ions to high enough energy to cross the magnetic fields, depositing energy within the reactor when they collided with other ions already inside. This method of heating, now known as neutral beam injection, has since become almost universal on magnetic confinement fusion machines. Model C spent most of its history involved in studies of ion transport. Through continual tuning of the magnetic system and the addition of the new heating methods, in 1969, Model C eventually reached electron temperatures of 400 eV. =Other approaches= Through this period, a number of new potential stellarator designs emerged, which featured a simplified magnetic layout. The Model C used separate confinement and helical coils, as this was an evolutionary process from the original design which had only the confinement coils. Other researchers, notably in Germany, noted that the same overall magnetic field configuration could be achieved with a much simpler arrangement. This led to the torastron or heliotron layout. In these designs, the primary field is produced by a single helical magnet, similar to one of the helical windings of the \\"classical\\" stellarator. In contrast to those systems, only a single magnet is needed, and it is much larger than those in the stellarators. To produce the net field, a second set of coils running poloidally around the outside of the helical magnet produces a second vertical field that mixes with the helical one. The result in a much simpler layout, as the poloidal magnets are generally much smaller and there is ample room between them to reach the interior, whereas in the original layout the toroidal confinement magnets are relatively large and leave little room between them. A further update emerged from the realization that the total field could be produced through a series of independent magnets shaped like the local field. This results in a series of complex magnets that are arranged like the toroidal coils of the original layout. The advantage of this design is that the magnets are entirely independent; if one is damaged it can be individually replaced without affecting the rest of the system. Additionally, one can re-arrange the overall field layout by replacing the elements. These \\"modular coils\\" are now a major part of ongoing research. =Tokamak stampede= In 1968, scientists in the Soviet Union released the results of their tokamak machines, notably their newest example, T-3. The results were so startling that there was widespread scepticism. To address this, the Soviets invited a team of experts from the United Kingdom to test the machines for themselves. Their tests, made using a laser-based system developed for the ZETA reactor in England, verified the Soviet claims of electron temperatures of 1,000 eV. What followed was a \\"veritable stampede\\" of tokamak construction worldwide. At first the US labs ignored the tokamak; Spitzer himself dismissed it out of hand as experimental error. However, as new results came in, especially the UK reports, Princeton found itself in the position of trying to defend the stellarator as a useful experimental machine while other groups from around the US were clamoring for funds to build tokamaks. In July 1969 Gottlieb had a change of heart, offering to convert the Model C to a tokamak layout. In December it was shut down and reopened in May as the Symmetric Tokamak (ST). The ST immediately matched the performance being seen in the Soviet machines, besting the Model C's results by over ten times. From that point, PPPL was the primary developer of the tokamak approach in the US, introducing a series of machines to test various designs and modifications. The Princeton Large Torus of 1975 quickly hit several performance numbers that were required for a commercial machine, and it was widely believed the critical threshold of breakeven would be reached in the early 1980s. What was needed was larger machines and more powerful systems to heat the plasma to fusion temperatures. Tokamaks are a type of pinch machine, differing from earlier designs primarily in the amount of current in the plasma: above a certain threshold known as the safety factor, or q, the plasma is much more stable. ZETA ran at a q around , while experiments on tokamaks demonstrated it needs to be at least 1. Machines following this rule showed dramatically improved performance. However, by the mid-1980s the easy path to fusion disappeared; as the amount of current in the new machines began to increase, a new set of instabilities in the plasma appeared. These could be addressed, but only by greatly increasing the power of the magnetic fields, requiring superconducting magnets and huge confinement volumes. The cost of such a machine was such that the involved parties banded together to begin the ITER project. =Stellarator returns= As the problems with the tokamak approach grew, interest in the stellarator approach reemerged. This coincided with the development of advanced computer aided planning tools that allowed the construction of complex magnets that were previously known but considered too difficult to design and build. New materials and construction methods have increased the quality and power of the magnetic fields, improving performance. New devices have been built to test these concepts. Major examples include Wendelstein 7-X in Germany, the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) in the US, and the Large Helical Device in Japan. W7X and LHD use superconducting magnetic coils. The lack of an internal current eliminates some of the instabilities of the tokamak, meaning the stellarator should be more stable at similar operating conditions. On the downside, since it lacks the confinement provided by the current found in a tokamak, the stellarator requires more powerful magnets to reach any given confinement. The stellarator is an inherently steady-state machine, which has several advantages from an engineering standpoint. In 2019 a Hessian matrix was applied to simplify the math required to assess the error fields associated with important coil imperfections. Magnetic island size and quasi-symmetry are analytically differentiated over coil parameters. The eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix identify sensitive coil deviations. Each coil requires separate tolerance and some certain perturbation combinations, permitting greater coil tolerances, which could reduce time and cost. Underlying concepts =Requirements for fusion= Heating a gas increases the energy of the particles within it, so by heating a gas into the hundreds of millions of degrees, the majority of the particles within it would reach the energy required to fuse. According to the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution, some of the particles will reach the required energies at much lower average temperatures. Because the energy released by the reaction is much greater than what it takes to start it, even a small number of reactions can heat surrounding fuel until it fuses as well. In 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated the D-T reaction would be self-sustaining at about . Materials heated beyond a few tens of thousand degrees ionize into their electrons and nuclei, producing a gas-like state of matter known as plasma. According to the ideal gas law, like any hot gas, plasma has an internal pressure and thus wants to expand. For a fusion reactor, the challenge is to keep the plasma contained; any known substance would melt or sublime at these temperatures. But because a plasma is electrically conductive, it is subject to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit around the magnetic field lines, confining them to the area defined by the field. =Magnetic confinement= A simple confinement system can be made by placing a tube inside the open core of a solenoid. The tube can be evacuated and then filled with the requisite gas and heated until it becomes a plasma. The plasma naturally wants to expand outwards to the walls of the tube, as well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates magnetic field lines running down the center of the tube, and the plasma particles orbit these lines, preventing their motion towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement would not confine the plasma along the length of the tube, and the plasma would be free to flow out the ends. The obvious solution to this problem is to bend the tube around into a torus (a ring or donut) shape. Motion towards the sides remains constrained as before, and while the particles remain free to move along the lines, in this case, they will simply circulate around the long axis of the tube. But, as Fermi pointed out, when the solenoid is bent into a ring, the electrical windings would be closer together on the inside than the outside. This would lead to an uneven field across the tube, and the fuel will slowly drift out of the center. Since the electrons and ions would drift in opposite directions, this would lead to a charge separation and electrostatic forces that would eventually overwhelm the magnetic force. Some additional force needs to counteract this drift, providing long-term confinement. =Stellarator concept= Spitzer's key concept in the stellarator design is that the drift that Fermi noted could be canceled out through the physical arrangement of the vacuum tube. In a simple torus, particles on the inside edge of the tube, where the field was stronger, would drift up, while those on the outside would drift down (or vice versa). However, if the particle were made to alternate between the inside and outside of the tube, the drifts would cancel out. The cancellation is not perfect, leaving some net drift, but basic calculations suggested drift would be lowered enough to confine plasma long enough to heat it sufficiently. Spitzer's suggestion for doing this was simple. Instead of a normal torus, the device would essentially be cut in half to produce two half-tori. They would then be joined with two straight sections between the open ends. The key was that they were connected to alternate ends so that the right half of one of the tori was connected to the left of the other. The resulting design resembled a figure-8 when viewed from above. Because the straight tubes could not pass through each other, the design did not lie flat, the tori at either end had to be tilted. This meant the drift cancellation was further reduced, but again, calculations suggested the system would work. To understand how the system works to counteract drift, consider the path of a single particle in the system starting in one of the straight sections. If that particle is perfectly centered in the tube, it will travel down the center into one of the half-tori, exit into the center of the next tube, and so on. This particle will complete a loop around the entire reactor without leaving the center. Now consider another particle traveling parallel to the first, but initially located near the inside wall of the tube. In this case, it will enter the outside edge of the half-torus and begin to drift down. It exits that section and enters the second straight section, still on the outside edge of that tube. However, because the tubes are crossed, when it reaches the second half- torus it enters it on the inside edge. As it travels through this section it drifts back up. This effect would reduce one of the primary causes of drift in the machine, but there were others to consider as well. Although the ions and electrons in the plasma would both circle the magnetic lines, they would do so in opposite directions, and at very high rotational speeds. This leads to the possibility of collisions between particles circling different lines of force as they circulate through the reactor, which due to purely geometric reasons, causes the fuel to slowly drift outward. This process eventually causes the fuel to either collide with the structure or cause a large charge separation between the ions and electrons. Spitzer introduced the concept of a divertor, a magnet placed around the tube that pulled off the very outer layer of the plasma. This would remove the ions before they drifted too far and hit the walls. It would also remove any heavier elements in the plasma. Using classical calculations the rate of diffusion through collisions was low enough that it would be much lower than the drift due to uneven fields in a normal toroid. But earlier studies of magnetically confined plasmas in 1949 demonstrated much higher losses and became known as Bohm diffusion. Spitzer spent considerable effort considering this issue and concluded that the anomalous rate being seen by Bohm was due to instability in the plasma, which he believed could be addressed. =Complications, alternative designs= Practical complications make the original figure-8 device less than ideal. This led to alternative designs and additions. One of the major concerns is that the magnetic fields in the system will only properly confine a particle of a given mass traveling at a given speed. Particles traveling faster or slower will not circulate in the desired fashion. Particles with very low speeds (corresponding to low temperatures) are not confined and can drift out to the tube walls. Those with too much energy may hit the outside walls of the curved sections. To address these concerns, Spitzer introduced the concept of a divertor that would connect to one of the straight sections. This was essentially a mass spectrometer that would remove particles that were moving too fast or too slow for proper confinement. The physical limitation that the two straight sections cannot intersect means that the rotational transform within the loop is not a perfect 180 degrees, but typically closer to 135 degrees. This led to alternate designs in an effort to get the angle closer to 180. An early attempt was built into the Stellarator B-2, which placed both curved sections flat in relation to the ground, but at different heights. The formerly straight sections had additional curves inserted, two sections of about 45 degrees, so they now formed extended S-shapes. This allowed them to route around each other while being perfectly symmetrical in terms of angles. A better solution to the need to rotate the particles was introduced in the Stellarator B-64 and B-65. These eliminated the cross-over and flattened the device into an oval, or as they referred to it, a racetrack. The rotation of the particles was introduced by placing a new set of magnetic coils on the half-torus on either end, the corkscrew windings. The field from these coils mixes with the original confinement fields to produce a mixed field that rotates the lines of force through 180 degrees. This made the mechanical design of the reactor much simpler, but in practice, it was found that the mixed field was very difficult to produce in a perfectly symmetrical fashion. =Heating= Unlike the z-pinch designs being explored in the UK and other US labs, the stellarator has no induced electrical current within the plasma ‚Äì at a macroscopic level, the plasma is neutral and unmoving, in spite of the individual particles within it rapidly circulating. In pinch machines, and the later tokamaks, the current itself is one of the primary methods of heating the plasma. In the stellarator, no such natural heating source is present. Early stellarator designs used a system similar to those in the pinch devices to provide the initial heating to bring the gas to plasma temperatures. This consisted of a single set of windings from a transformer, with the plasma itself forming the secondary set. When energized with a pulse of current, the particles in the region are rapidly energized and begin to move. This brings additional gas into the region, quickly ionizing the entire mass of gas. This concept was referred to as ohmic heating because it relied on the resistance of the gas to create heat, in a fashion not unlike a conventional resistance heater. As the temperature of the gas increases, the conductivity of the plasma improves. This makes the ohmic heating process less and less effective, and this system is limited to temperatures of about 1 million kelvins. To heat the plasma to higher temperatures, a second heat source was added, the magnetic pumping system. This consisted of radio-frequency source fed through a coil spread along the vacuum chamber. The frequency is chosen to be similar to the natural frequency of the particles around the magnetic lines of force, the cyclotron frequency. This causes the particles in the area to gain energy, which causes them to orbit in a wider radius. Since other particles are orbiting their own lines nearby, at a macroscopic level, this change in energy appears as an increase in pressure. According to the ideal gas law, this results in an increase in temperature. Like the ohmic heating, this process also becomes less efficient as the temperature increases, but is still capable of creating very high temperatures. When the frequency is deliberately set close to that of the ion circulation, this is known as ion-cyclotron resonance heating, although this name is not widely used. Plasma heating There are several ways to heat the plasma (which must be done before ignition can occur). ;Current heating: The plasma is electrically conductive, and heats up when a current is passed through it (due to electrical resistance). Only used for initial heating, as the resistance is inversely proportional to the plasma temperature. ;High-frequency electromagnetic waves: The plasma absorbs energy when electromagnetic waves are applied to it (in the same manner as food in a microwave). ;Heating by neutral particles: A neutral particle beam injector makes ions and accelerates them with an electric field. To avoid being affected by the Stellarator's magnetic field, the ions must be neutralised. Neutralised ions are then injected into the plasma. Their high kinetic energy is transferred to the plasma particles by collisions, heating them. Configurations Sketch of a classical stellarator with helical coils (white) and toroidal field coils (green) Several different configurations of stellarator exist, including: ;Spatial stellarator: The original figure-8 design that used geometry to produce the rotational transform of the magnetic fields. ;Classical stellarator: A toroidal or racetrack-shaped design with separate helical coils on either end to produce the rotation. ;Torsatron: A stellarator with continuous helical coils. It can also have the continuous coils replaced by a number of discrete coils producing a similar field. The Compact Auburn Torsatron at Auburn University is an example. ;Heliotron: A stellarator in which a helical coil is used to confine the plasma, together with a pair of poloidal field coils to provide a vertical field. Toroidal field coils can also be used to control the magnetic surface characteristics. The Large Helical Device in Japan uses this configuration. ;Modular stellarator: A stellarator with a set of modular (separated) coils and a twisted toroidal coil. e.g. Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) (and Helias (below)) TJ-II Heliac ;Heliac: A helical axis stellarator, in which the magnetic axis (and plasma) follows a helical path to form a toroidal helix rather than a simple ring shape. The twisted plasma induces twist in the magnetic field lines to effect drift cancellation, and typically can provide more twist than the Torsatron or Heliotron, especially near the centre of the plasma (magnetic axis). The original Heliac consists only of circular coils, and the flexible heliac (H-1NF, TJ-II, TU-Heliac) adds a small helical coil to allow the twist to be varied by a factor of up to 2. ;Helias: A helical advanced stellarator, using an optimized modular coil set designed to simultaneously achieve high plasma, low Pfirsch‚ÄìSchluter currents and good confinement of energetic particles; i.e., alpha particles for reactor scenarios. The Helias has been proposed to be the most promising stellarator concept for a power plant, with a modular engineering design and optimised plasma, MHD and magnetic field properties. The Wendelstein 7-X device is based on a five field-period Helias configuration. Recent results Visualization of magnetic field lines in Wendelstein 7-X =Optimization to reduce transport losses= The goal of magnetic confinement devices is to minimise energy transport across a magnetic field. Toroidal devices are relatively successful because the magnetic properties seen by the particles are averaged as they travel around the torus. The strength of the field seen by a particle, however, generally varies, so that some particles will be trapped by the mirror effect. These particles will not be able to average the magnetic properties so effectively, which will result in increased energy transport. In most stellarators, these changes in field strength are greater than in tokamaks, which is a major reason that transport in stellarators tends to be higher than in tokamaks. University of Wisconsin electrical engineering Professor David Anderson and research assistant John Canik proved in 2007 that the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) can overcome this major barrier in plasma research. The HSX is the first stellarator to use a quasisymmetric magnetic field. The team designed and built the HSX with the prediction that quasisymmetry would reduce energy transport. As the team's latest research showed, that is exactly what it does. \\"This is the first demonstration that quasisymmetry works, and you can actually measure the reduction in transport that you get,\\" says Canik. The newer Wendelstein 7-X in Germany was designed to be close to omnigeneity (a property of the magnetic field such that the mean radial drift is zero), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for quasisymmetry; that is, all quasisymmetric magnetic fields are omnigenous, but not all omnigenous magnetic fields are quasisymmetric.

SYSTRAN has done extensive work for the United States Department of Defense and the European Commission. SYSTRAN provided the technology for Yahoo! Babel Fish until May 30, 2012, among others. It was used by Google's language tools until 2007.Google Switches to Its Own Language System, Google Operating System, October 2007 SYSTRAN is used by the Dashboard Translation widget in macOS. Commercial versions of SYSTRAN can run on Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile), Linux, and Solaris. Historically, SYSTRAN systems used rule-based machine translation (RbMT) technology. With the release of SYSTRAN Server 7 in 2010, SYSTRAN implemented a hybrid rule-based/statistical machine translation (SMT) technology which was the first of its kind in the marketplace. , the company had 59 employees of whom 26 are computational experts and 15 computational linguists. The number of employees decreased from 70 in 2006 to 59 in 2008. History With its origin in the Georgetown machine translation effort, SYSTRAN was one of the few machine translation systems to survive the major decrease of funding after the ALPAC Report of the mid-1960s. The company was established in La Jolla in California to work on translation of Russian to English text for the United States Air Force during the Cold War. Large numbers of Russian scientific and technical documents were translated using SYSTRAN under the auspices of the USAF Foreign Technology Division (later the National Air and Space Intelligence Center) at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The quality of the translations, although only approximate, was usually adequate for understanding content. The company was sold in 1986 to the Gachot family, based in Paris, and is now traded publicly on the French stock exchange. Its company headquarters is in Paris, while its U.S. headquarters is still in La Jolla. During the dot-com boom, the international language industry started a new era, and SYSTRAN entered into agreements with a number of translation integrators, the most successful of these being WorldLingo. In 2014, the company was acquired by CSLi (Korea).

The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in, or after, 975, in Esztergom. At his birth, he was given the pagan name Vajk. The date of his baptism is unknown. He was the only son of Grand Prince G√©za and his wife, Sarolt, who was descended from a prominent family of gyulas. Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of his family to become a devout Christian. He married Gisela of Bavaria, a scion of the imperial Ottonian dynasty. After succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, Kopp√°ny, who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Kopp√°ny with the assistance of foreign knights including Vecelin, Hont and P√°zm√°ny, and native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftainsincluding the Black Hungarians and his uncle, Gyula the Youngerhe unified the Carpathian Basin. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, to withdraw from Hungary in 1030. Stephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries, leading the Church in Hungary to develop independently from the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire. He encouraged the spread of Christianity by meting out severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials. Hungary enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, and became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe, the Holy Land and Constantinople. He survived all of his children, dying on 15 August 1038, and was buried in his new basilica, built in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and dedicated to the Holy Virgin. His death was followed by civil wars which lasted for decades. He was canonized by Pope Gregory VII, together with his son, Emeric, and Bishop Gerard of Csan√°d, in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and the neighboring territories. In Hungary, his feast day (celebrated on 20 August) is also a public holiday commemorating the foundation of the state, known as State Foundation Day.  Early years ( 975‚Äì997)  Stephen's birth date is uncertain as it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents. Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years: 967, 969 and 975. The unanimous testimony of his three late 11th-century or early 12th-century hagiographies and other Hungarian sources, which state that Stephen was \\"still an adolescent\\" in 997,Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary (ch. 5), p. 381. substantiate the reliability of the later year (975). Stephen's Lesser Legend adds that he was born in Esztergom, which implies that he was born after 972 because his father, G√©za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year. G√©za promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force, but never ceased worshipping pagan gods. Both his son's Greater Legend and the nearly contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg described G√©za as a cruel monarch, suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords. Hungarian chronicles agree that Stephen's mother was Sarolt, daughter of Gyula, a Hungarian chieftain with jurisdiction either in Transylvania or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros. Many historiansincluding P√°l Engel and Gyula Krist√≥propose that her father was identical with \\"Gylas\\", who had been baptized in Constantinople around 952 and \\"remained faithful to Christianity\\",John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History, 811‚Äì1057 (ch. 11.5.), p. 231. according to Byzantine chronicler John Skylitzes. However, this identification is not unanimously accepted; historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy states that it was not Sarolt's father, but his younger brother, who was baptized in the Byzantine capital. In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle and later Polish sources state that Stephen's mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke Mieszko I of Poland, but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians. Stephen's birth depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle Stephen was born as Vajk, a name derived from the Turkic word baj, meaning \\"hero\\", \\"master\\", \\"prince\\" or \\"rich\\". Stephen's Greater Legend narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop Adalbert of Prague, who stayed in G√©za's court several times between 983 and 994. However, Saint Adalbert's nearly contemporaneous Legend, written by Bruno of Querfurt, does not mention this event. Accordingly, the date of Stephen's baptism is unknown: Gy√∂rffy argues that he was baptized soon after birth, while Krist√≥ proposes that he only received baptism just before his father's death in 997. Stephen's official hagiography, written by Bishop Hartvic and sanctioned by Pope Innocent III, narrates that he \\"was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art\\" in his childhood.Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary (ch. 4), p. 381. This implies that he studied Latin, though some scepticism is warranted as few kings of this era were able to write. His two other late 11th-century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies, stating only that he \\"was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince\\". Krist√≥ says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen's physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from Italy, who later founded a monastery in Tata. According to Stephen's legends, Grand Prince G√©za convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen \\"ascended to the first stage of adolescence\\", at the age of 14 or 15. G√©za nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince. Gy√∂rffy also writes, without identifying his source, that G√©za appointed his son to rule the \\"Nyitra ducate\\" around that time. Slovak historians, including J√°n Steinh√ºbel and J√°n Lukaƒçka, accept Gy√∂rffy's view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra (now Nitra, Slovakia) from around 995. G√©za arranged Stephen's marriage, to Gisela, daughter of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, in or after 995. This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house, as Gisela was closely related to the Ottonian dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors. According to popular tradition preserved in the Scheyern Abbey in Bavaria, the ceremony took place at the Scheyern castle and was celebrated by Saint Adalbert. Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights, many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary, helping to strengthen Stephen's military position. Gy√∂rffy writes that Stephen and his wife \\"presumably\\" settled in Nyitra after their marriage.  Reign (997‚Äì1038)  = Grand Prince (997‚Äì1000) = Grand Prince G√©za died in 997. Stephen convoked an assembly at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince. Initially, he only controlled the northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin; the rest of the territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains. Stephen's ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of primogeniture, which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son. On the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority, according to which G√©za should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the √Årp√°d dynasty, which was Kopp√°ny at that time. Kopp√°ny, who held the title Duke of Somogy, had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake Balaton. Kopp√°ny's execution after his defeat by Stephen, depicted in the Chronicon Pictum. Kopp√°ny proposed to G√©za's widow, Sarolt, in accordance with the pagan custom of levirate marriage. He also announced his claim to the throne. Although it is not impossible that Kopp√°ny had already been baptized, in 972, most of his supporters were pagans, opponents of the Christianity represented by Stephen and his predominantly German retinue. A charter of 1002 for the Pannonhalma Archabbey writes of a war between \\"the Germans and the Hungarians\\" when referring to the armed conflicts between Stephen and Kopp√°ny. Even so, Gy√∂rffy says that Oszlar (\\"Alan\\"), Beseny≈ë (\\"Pecheneg\\"), K√©r and other place names, referring to ethnic groups or Hungarian tribes in Transdanubia around the supposed borders of Kopp√°ny's duchy, suggest that significant auxiliary units and groups of Hungarian warriorswho had been settled there by Grand Prince G√©zafought in Stephen's army. Krist√≥ states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Kopp√°ny was only a feud between two members of the √Årp√°d dynasty, with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders. Kopp√°ny and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia, took many of Stephen's forts and plundered his lands. Stephen, who according to the Illuminated Chronicle \\"was for the first time girded with his sword\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 39.64), p. 105. placed the brothers Hont and P√°zm√°ny at the head of his own guard and nominated Vecelin to lead the royal army. The latter was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of G√©za. Hont and P√°zm√°ny were, according to Simon of K√©za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum and the Illuminated Chronicle, \\"knights of Swabian origin\\"Simon of K√©za: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 78.), p. 163. who settled in Hungary either under G√©za or in the first years of Stephen's reign. On the other hand, Lukaƒçka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and P√°zm√°ny were \\"Slovak\\" noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra. Kopp√°ny was besieging Veszpr√©m when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen's army. In the ensuing battle, Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies. Kopp√°ny was killed on the battlefield. His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom, Gy≈ër, Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (Alba Iulia, Romania) and Veszpr√©m in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch. Stephen occupied Kopp√°ny's duchy and granted large estates to his own partisans. He also prescribed that Kopp√°ny's former subjects were to pay tithes to the Pannonhalma Archabbey, according to the deed of the foundation of this monastery which has been preserved in a manuscript containing interpolations. The same document declares that \\"there were no other bishoprics and monasteries in Hungary\\" at that time. On the other hand, the nearly contemporary Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg stated that Stephen \\"established bishoprics in his kingdom\\"The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg (ch. 29.), p. 193. before being crowned king. If the latter report is valid, the dioceses of Veszpr√©m and Gy≈ër are the most probable candidates, according to historian G√°bor Thoroczkay. = Coronation (1000‚Äì1001) = King Saint Stephen's modern sculpture in Budapest By ordering the display of one part of Kopp√°ny's quartered corpse in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, the seat of his maternal uncle, Gyula the Younger, Stephen asserted his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate. Thietmar of Merseburg writes that Stephen received the crown \\"with the favour and urging\\" of Emperor Otto III (r. 996‚Äì1002), implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor's suzerainty before his coronation. On the other hand, all of Stephen's legends emphasize that he received his crown from Pope Sylvester II (r. 999‚Äì1003). Krist√≥ and other historians point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies, which implies that both reports are valid: Stephen \\"received the crown and consecration\\" from the Pope, but not without the Emperor's consent. Around 75 years after the coronation, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1075‚Äì1085), who claimed suzerainty over Hungary, declared that Stephen had \\"offered and devotedly surrendered\\" Hungary \\"to Saint Peter\\" (that is to the Holy See).Pope Gregory VII's letter to King Solomon of Hungary, claiming suzerainty over that kingdom, p. 48. In a contrasting report, Stephen's Greater Legend states that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary. Modern historiansincluding P√°l Engel, and Mikl√≥s Moln√°rwrite that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty. For instance, none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal. Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his First Book of Laws that he governed his realm \\"by the will of God\\".Laws of King Stephen I (Stephen I:Preface), p. 1. The exact date of Stephen's coronation is unknown. According to later Hungarian tradition, he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001. Details of Stephen's coronation preserved in his Greater Legend suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony. Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones. Besides his crown, Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty. For instance, his first coins bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS (\\"the king's spear\\") and depict an arm holding a spear with flag. According to the contemporaneous Ad√©mar de Chabannes, a spear had been given to Stephen's father by Emperor Otto III as a token of G√©za's right to \\"enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country\\". Stephen is styled in various waysUngarorum rex (\\"king of the Hungarians\\"), Pannoniorum rex (\\"king of the Pannonians\\") or Hungarie rex (\\"king of Hungary\\")in his charters. = Consolidation (1001‚Äì 1009) = Although Stephen's power did not rely on his coronation, the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm \\"by the Grace of God\\". All his legends testify that he established an archbishopric with its see in Esztergom shortly after his coronation. This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire. The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom, named Domokos, has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002. According to historian G√°bor Thoroczkay, Stephen also established the Diocese of Kalocsa in 1001. Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom. Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague, including Radla and Astrik, arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign. The presence of an unnamed \\"Archbishop of the Hungarians\\" at the synod of 1007 of Frankfurt and the consecration of an altar in Bamberg in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen's prelates maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire. The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs. Stephen's forces seize his uncle, Gyula the Younger Many Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen's suzerainty even after his coronation. The new King first turned against his own uncle, Gyula the Younger, whose realm \\"was most wide and rich\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 40.65), p. 105. according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003. The contemporary Annals of Hildesheim adds that Stephen converted his uncle's \\"country to the Christian faith by force\\" after its conquest. Accordingly, historians date the establishment of the Diocese of Transylvania to this period. If the identification, proposed by Krist√≥, Gy√∂rffy and other Hungarian historians, of Gyula with one Prokuiwho was Stephen's uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburgis valid, Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to Boles≈Çaw I the Brave, Duke of Poland (r. 992‚Äì1025). About a hundred years later, the chronicler Gallus Anonymus also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav, stating that the latter \\"defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the Danube\\".The Deeds of the Princes of the Poles (ch. 6.), pp. 31‚Äì33. Gy√∂rffy says that the chronicler's report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river Moravaa tributary of the Danubeby the Poles in the 1010s. On the other hand, the Polish-Hungarian Chronicle states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 11th century. According to Steinh√ºbel, the latter source proves that a significant part of the lands that now form Slovakia were under Polish rule between 1002 and 1030. In contrast with the Slovak historian, Gy√∂rffy writes that this late chronicle \\"in which one absurdity follows another\\" contradicts all facts known from 11th-century sources. Stephen defeats Kean \\"Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs\\" The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that Stephen \\"led his army against Kean, Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs whose lands are by their natural position most strongly fortified\\"The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 41.66), p. 105. following the occupation of Gyula's country. According to a number of historians, including Zolt√°n Lenkey and G√°bor Thoroczkay, Kean was the head of a small state located in the southern parts of Transylvania and Stephen occupied his country around 1003. Other historians, including Gy√∂rffy, say that the chronicle's report preserved the memory of Stephen's campaign against Bulgaria in the late 1010s. Likewise, the identification of the \\"Black Hungarians\\"Life of the Five Brethren by Bruno of Querfurt (ch. 10.), p. 245.who were mentioned by Bruno of Querfurt and Ad√©mar de Chabannes among the opponents of Stephen's proselytizing policyis uncertain. Gy√∂rffy locates their lands to the east of the river Tisza; while Thoroczkay says they live in the southern parts of Transdanubia. Bruno of Querfurt's report of the Black Hungarians' conversion by force suggests that Stephen conquered their lands at the latest in 1009 when \\"the first mission of Saint Peter\\"a papal legate, Cardinal Azoarrived in Hungary. The latter attended the meeting in Gy≈ër where the royal charter determining the borders of the newly established Bishopric of P√©cs was issued on 23 August 1009. The Diocese of Eger was also set up around 1009. According to Thoroczkay, \\"it is very probable\\" that the bishopric's establishment was connected with the conversion of the Kabarsan ethnic group of Khazar origin and their chieftain. The head of the Kabarswho was either Samuel Aba or his father married Stephen's unnamed younger sister on this occasion. The Aba clan was the most powerful among the native families who joined Stephen and supported him in his efforts to establish a Christian monarchy. The reports by Anonymus, Simon of K√©za and other Hungarian chroniclers of the B√°r-Kal√°n, Cs√°k and other 13th-century noble families descending from Hungarian chieftains suggest that other native families were also involved in the process. Stephen set up a territory-based administrative system, establishing counties. Each county, headed by a royal official known as a count or isp√°n, was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress. Most fortresses were earthworks in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and Veszpr√©m were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around them, where markets were held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers. = Wars with Poland and Bulgaria ( 1009‚Äì1018) = Stephen's brother-in-law, Henry II, became King of Germany in 1002 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1013. Their friendly relationship ensured that the western borders of Hungary experienced a period of peace in the first decades of the 11th century. Even when Henry II's discontented brother, Bruno, sought refuge in Hungary in 1004, Stephen preserved the peace with Germany and negotiated a settlement between his two brothers-in-law. Around 1009, he gave his younger sister in marriage to Otto Orseolo, Doge of Venice (r. 1008‚Äì1026), a close ally of the Byzantine Emperor, Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025), which suggests that Hungary's relationship with the Byzantine Empire was also peaceful. On the other hand, the alliance between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire brought her into a war with Poland lasting from around 1014 until 1018. The Poles occupied the Hungarian posts along the river Morava. Gy√∂rffy and Krist√≥ write that a Pecheneg incursion into Transylvania, the memory of which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, also took place in this period, because the Pechenegs were close allies of the Polish duke's brother-in-law, Grand Prince Sviatopolk I of Kiev (r. 1015‚Äì1019). Poland and the Holy Roman Empire concluded the Peace of Bautzen in January 1018. Later in the same year, 500 Hungarian horsemen accompanied Boleslav of Poland to Kiev, suggesting that Hungary had been included in the peace treaty. The historian Ferenc Makk says that the Peace of Bautzen obliged Boleslav to hand over all the territories he had occupied in the Morava valley to Stephen. According to Leodvin, the first known Bishop of Bihar (r. 1050 ‚Äì 1060), Stephen allied with the Byzantines and led a military expedition to assist them against \\"barbarians\\" in the Balkan Peninsula. The Byzantine and Hungarian troops jointly took \\"Cesaries\\" which Gy√∂rffy identifies as the present-day town of Ohrid. Leodvin's report suggests that Stephen joined the Byzantines in the war ending with their conquest of Bulgaria in 1018. However, the exact date of his expedition is uncertain. Gy√∂rffy argues that it was only in the last year of the war that Stephen led his troops against the Bulgarians. = Domestic policies (1018‚Äì1024) = Modern statute of Bishop Gerard of Csan√°d and his disciple, Prince Emeric (both were canonized along with King Stephen in 1083). P√ºsp√∂kk√∫t-statue in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, installment Ruins of the P√©csv√°rad Abbey, established by Stephen Bishop Leodvin wrote that Stephen collected relics of a number of saints in \\"Cesaries\\" during his campaign in the Balkans, including Saint George and Saint Nicholas. He donated them to his new triple-naved basilica dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, where he also set up a cathedral chapter and his new capital. His decision was influenced by the opening, in 1018 or 1019, of a new pilgrimage route that bypassed his old capital, Esztergom. The new route connected Western Europe and the Holy Land through Hungary. Stephen often met the pilgrims, contributing to the spread of his fame throughout Europe. Abbot Odilo of Cluny, for example, wrote in a letter to Stephen that \\"those who have returned from the shrine of our Lord\\" testify to the king's passion \\"towards the honour of our divine religion\\". Stephen also established four hostels for pilgrims in Constantinople, Jerusalem, Ravenna and Rome. In addition to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe. Stephen's legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary, but were attacked by Hungarian border guards. The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace. Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s. Stephen's silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX (\\"King Stephen\\") and REGIA CIVITAS (\\"royal city\\") were popular in contemporary Europe, as demonstrated by counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden. Stephen convinced some pilgrims and merchants to settle in Hungary. Gerard, a Benedictine monk who arrived in Hungary from the Republic of Venice between 1020 and 1026, initially planned to continue his journey to the Holy Land, but decided to stay in the country after his meeting with the king. Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteriesincluding the abbeys at P√©csv√°rad, Zalav√°r and Bakonyb√©lin this period. The Long Life of Saint Gerard mentions Stephen's conflict with Ajtony, a chieftain in the region of the river Maros. Many historians date their clash to the end of the 1020s, although Gy√∂rffy and other scholars put it at least a decade earlier. The conflict arose when Ajtony, who \\"had taken his power from the Greeks\\", according to Saint Gerard's legend, levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river. The king sent a large army led by Csan√°d against Ajtony, who was killed in battle. His lands were transformed into a Hungarian county and the king set up a new bishopric at Csan√°d (Cenad, Romania), Ajtony's former capital, which was renamed after the commander of the royal army. According to the Annales Posonienses, the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030. = Conflicts with the Holy Roman Empire (1024‚Äì1031) = Stephen's brother-in-law, Emperor Henry, died on 13 July 1024. He was succeeded by a distant relative, Conrad II (r. 1024‚Äì1039), who adopted an offensive foreign policy. Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolothe husband of Stephen's sisterfrom Venice in 1026. He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, Henry, as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, Emeric had a strong claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother. Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop Werner of Strasbourg, to Constantinople. In the autumn of 1027, the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country. Conrad II's biographer Wipo of Burgundy narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries. Emperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the River R√°ba. However, according to the Annals of Niederalteich, the emperor, suffering from consequences of the scorched earth tactics used by the Hungarian army, returned to Germany \\"without an army and without achieving anything, because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at Vienna\\". Peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers Lajta and Fischa to Hungary in the summer of 1031. = Last years (1031‚Äì1038) = Saint Emeric Stephen's biographer, Hartvic, narrates that the King, whose children died one by one in infancy, \\"restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son\\",Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary (ch. 19), p. 390. Emeric. However, Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031. After the death of his son, the elderly King could never \\"fully regain his former health\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 45.69), p. 107. according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Krist√≥ writes that the picture, which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, of the king keeping the vigils and washing the feet of paupers, is connected with Stephen's last years, following the death of his son. Emeric's death jeopardized his father's achievements in establishing a Christian state, because Stephen's cousin, Vazulwho had the strongest claim to succeed himwas suspected of an inclination towards paganism. According to the Annals of Altaich Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his sister's son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo, as his heir. The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, Levente, Andrew and B√©la, were expelled from Hungary. Stephen's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court. According to Krist√≥, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act. That Vazul's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the Illuminated Chronicle. In the view of some historians, provisions in Stephen's Second Book of Laws on the \\"conspiracy against the king and the kingdom\\" imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul's unsuccessful plot against Stephen.Laws of King Stephen I (Stephen II:19), p. 11. However, this view has not been universally accepted. Gy√∂rffy states that the law book was issued, not after 1031, but around 1009. Likewise, the authenticity of the decree on tithes is debated: according to Gy√∂rffy, it was issued during Stephen's reign, but Berend, Laszlovszky and Szak√°cs argue that it \\"might be a later addition\\". Stephen died on 15 August 1038. He was buried in the basilica of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. His reign was followed by a long period of civil wars, pagan uprisings and foreign invasions. The instability ended in 1077 when Ladislaus, a grandson of Vazul, ascended the throne.  Family  King Stephen and his wife Gisela of Bavaria founding a church at √ìbuda from the Chronicon Pictum Stephen married Gisela, a daughter of Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria, who was a nephew of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. Gisela's mother was Gisela of Burgundy, a member of the Welf dynasty. Born around 985, Gisela was younger than her husband, whom she survived. She left Hungary in 1045 and died as Abbess of the Niedernburg Abbey in Passau in Bavaria around 1060. Although the Illuminated Chronicle states that Stephen \\"begot many sons\\",The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 38.63), p. 104. only two of them, Otto and Emeric, are known by name. Otto, who was named after Otto III, seems to have been born before 1002. He died as a child. Emeric, who received the name of his maternal uncle, Emperor Henry II, was born around 1007. His Legend from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his chastity even during his marriage. According to Gy√∂rffy, Emeric's wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. His premature death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul's blinding and civil wars. The following family tree presents Stephen's ancestors and his relatives who are mentioned in the article. *A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady. **Gy√∂rffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty. ***Samuel Aba might have been the son of Stephen's sister instead of her husband.  Legacy  = Founder of Hungary = Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary. His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state that ensured that the Hungarians survived in the Carpathian Basin, in contrast to the Huns, Avars and other peoples who had previously controlled the same territory. As Bryan Cartledge emphasizes, Stephen also gave his kingdom \\"forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule\\". His successors, including those descended from Vazul, were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen's achievements. Although Vazul's son, Andrew I of Hungary, secured the throne due to a pagan uprising, he prohibited pagan rites and declared that his subjects should \\"live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had taught them\\", according to the 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle.The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle (ch. 60.86), p. 113. In medieval Hungary, communities that claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own \\"liberties\\" often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen. An example is a 1347 letter from the people of T√°p telling the king about their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey and stating that the taxes levied upon them by the abbot contradicted \\"the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen\\". = Sainthood = Stephen's cult emerged after the long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his immediate successors. However, there is no evidence that Stephen became an object of veneration before his canonization. For instance, the first member of the royal family to be named after him, Stephen II, was born in the early 12th century. Stephen's canonization was initiated by Vazul's grandson, King Ladislaus I of Hungary, who had consolidated his authority by capturing and imprisoning his cousin, Solomon. According to Bishop Hartvic, the canonization was \\"decreed by apostolic letter, by order of the Roman see\\",Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary (ch. 24.), p. 393. suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII. The ceremony started at Stephen's tomb, where on 15 August 1083 masses of believers began three days of fasting and praying. Legend tells that Stephen's coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held Solomon in captivity at Visegr√°d. The opening of Stephen's tomb was followed by the occurrence of healing miracles, according to Stephen's legends. Historian Krist√≥ attributes the healings either to mass psychosis or deception. Stephen's legends also say that his \\"balsam-scented\\" remains were elevated from the coffin, which was filled with \\"rose-colored water\\", on 20 August. On the same day, Stephen's son, Emeric, and the bishop of Csan√°d, Gerard, were also canonized. Stephen's first legend, the so-called Greater Legend, was written between 1077 and 1083. It provided an idealized portrait of the king, one who dedicated himself and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary. However, Stephen's Lesser Legendcomposed around 1100, under King Colomanemphasized Stephen's severity. A third legend, also composed during King Coloman's reign by Bishop Hartvic, was based on the two existing legends. Sanctioned in 1201 by Pope Innocent III, Hartvic's work served as Stephen's official legend. G√°bor Klaniczay wrote that Stephen's legends \\"opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre\\", suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers. Stephen was the first triumphant miles Christi (\\"Christ's soldier\\") among the canonized monarchs. He was also a \\"confessor king\\", one who had not suffered martyrdom, whose cult was sanctioned, in contrast with earlier holy monarchs. Stephen's cult spread beyond the borders of Hungary. Initially, he was primarily venerated in Scheyern and Bamberg, in Bavaria, but his relics were also taken to Aachen, Cologne, Montecassino and Namur. Upon the liberation of Buda from the Ottoman Turks, Pope Innocent XI expanded King Saint Stephen's cult to the entire Roman Catholic Church in 1686, and declared 2 September his feast day. As the feast of Saint Joachim was moved, in 1969, from 16 August,\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), pp. 98 and 135 the day immediately following the day of Stephen's death, Stephen's feast was moved to that date.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 100, 137 Stephen is venerated as the patron saint of Hungary, and regarded as the protector of kings, masons, stonecutters, stonemasons and bricklayers, and also of children suffering from severe illnesses. His canonization was recognized by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople in 2000. In the calendar of the Hungarian Catholic Church, Stephen's feast is observed on 20 August, the day on which his relics were translated. In addition, a separate feast day (30 May) is dedicated to his \\"Holy Dexter\\". = Holy Dexter = The Holy Right displayed in St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest Stephen's intact dexter, or right hand (), became the subject of a cult. A cleric named Mercurius stole it, but it was discovered on 30 May 1084 in Bihar County. The theft of sacred relics, or furta sacra, had by that time become a popular topic of saints' biographies. Bishop Hartvic described the discovery of Stephen's right hand in accordance with this tradition, referring to adventures and visions. An abbey erected in Bihar County (now S√¢niob, Romania) was named after and dedicated to the veneration of the Holy Dexter. The Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242, when it was transferred to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). The relic was then taken to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r around 1420. Following the Ottoman occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16th century, it was guarded in many places, including Bosnia, Ragusa and Vienna. It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen Maria Theresa donated it to the cloister of the Sisters of Loreto in Buda. It was kept in Buda Castle's St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near Salzburg in 1944 and 1945, and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda, between 1945 and 1950. Finally, since 1950, the Holy Dexter has been in St. Stephen's Basilica in Budapest. An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938, and continued until 1950, when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government. It was resumed in 1988. = Admonitions = According to Stephen's Greater Legend, the king \\"himself compiled a book for his son on moral education\\". This work, now known as Admonitions or De institutione morum, was preserved in manuscripts written in the Late Middle Ages. Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th century. The Admonitions argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith. Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong. One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the \\"pillars of his rule\\", meaning the prelates, aristocrats, isp√°ns and warriors. = In arts = King St Stephen has been a popular theme in Hungarian poetry since the end of the 13th century. The earliest poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians. Secular poetry, especially poems written for his feast day, followed a similar pattern, emphasizing Stephen's role as the first king of Hungary. Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989. A popular hymn, still sung in the churches, was first recorded in the late . It hails King St. Stephen as \\"radiant star of Hungarians\\". Ludwig van Beethoven composed his King Stephen Overture for the inauguration of the Hungarian theatre in Pest in 1812. According to musician James M. Keller, \\"[t]he descending unisons that open the King Stephen Overture would seem to prefigure the opening of the Ninth Symphony [a]nd then a later theme, introduced by flutes and clarinets, seems almost to be a of the famous Ode 'To Joy' melody of the Ninth Symphony's finale\\". Hungarian composer Ferenc Erkel named his last complete opera from 1885, Istv√°n kir√°ly (\\"King Stephen\\"), after him. In 1938, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly wrote a choral piece titled √ânek Szent Istv√°n Kir√°lyhoz (\\"Hymn to King Stephen\\"). In 1983, Levente Sz√∂r√©nyi and J√°nos Br√≥dy composed a rock opera‚ÄîIstv√°n, a kir√°ly (\\"Stephen, the King\\")‚Äîabout the early years of his reign. Seventeen years later, in 2000, Sz√∂r√©nyi composed a sequel called Veled, Uram! (\\"You, Sir\\").

Joplin achieved fame for his ragtime compositions and was dubbed the King of Ragtime. During his brief career, he wrote over 100 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first and most popular pieces, the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag. Joplin grew up in a musical family of railway laborers in Texarkana, Arkansas, and developed his own musical knowledge with the help of local teachers. While in Texarkana, Texas, he formed a vocal quartet and taught mandolin and guitar. During the late 1880s, he left his job as a railroad laborer and traveled the American South as an itinerant musician. He went to Chicago for the World's Fair of 1893, which played a major part in making ragtime a national craze by 1897. Joplin moved to Sedalia, Missouri in 1894 and earned a living as a piano teacher. There he taught future ragtime composers Arthur Marshall, Scott Hayden and Brun Campbell. He began publishing music in 1895 and publication of his \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" in 1899 brought him fame. This piece had a profound influence on writers of ragtime. It also brought Joplin a steady income for life, though he did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problems. In 1901, Joplin moved to St. Louis, where he continued to compose and publish and regularly performed in the community. The score to his first opera, A Guest of Honor, was confiscated in 1903 with his belongings for non-payment of bills, and is now considered lost. In 1907, Joplin moved to New York City to find a producer for a new opera. He attempted to go beyond the limitations of the musical form that had made him famous but without much monetary success. His second opera, Treemonisha, was never fully staged during his life. In 1916, Joplin descended into dementia as a result of syphilis. He was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital in January 1917 and died there three months later at the age of 48. Joplin's death is widely considered to mark the end of ragtime as a mainstream music format; over the next several years, it evolved with other styles into stride, jazz and eventually big band swing. Joplin's music was rediscovered and returned to popularity in the early 1970s with the release of a million-selling album recorded by Joshua Rifkin. This was followed by the Academy Award-winning 1973 film The Sting, which featured several of Joplin's compositions, most notably \\"The Entertainer\\", a piece performed by pianist Marvin Hamlisch that received wide airplay. Treemonisha was finally produced in full, to wide acclaim, in 1972. In 1976, Joplin was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize. Early life Joplin was the second of six children born to Giles Joplin, a former slave from North Carolina, and Florence Givens, a freeborn African-American woman from Kentucky.Jasen & Tichenor (1978) p. 82.. His birth date was accepted by early biographers Blesh and Haskins as November 24, 1868, although later biographer Berlin showed this was \\"almost certainly incorrect\\". There is disagreement over his exact place of birth in Texas, with Blesh identifying Texarkana, and Berlin showing the earliest record of Joplin being the June 1870 census which locates him in Linden, as a two-year old. By 1880 the Joplins moved to Texarkana, Arkansas where Giles worked as a railroad laborer and Florence as a cleaner. As Joplin's father had played the violin for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo, he was given a rudimentary musical education by his family and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned.Berlin (1994) p. 6. At some point in the early 1880s, Giles Joplin left the family for another woman and Florence struggled to support her children through domestic work. Biographer Susan Curtis speculates that Florence's support of her son's musical education was a critical factor behind her separation from Giles, who wanted the boy to pursue practical employment that would supplement the family income.Curtis (2004) p. 38. According to a family friend, the young Joplin was serious and ambitious studying music and playing the piano after school. While a few local teachers aided him, he received most of his musical education from Julius Weiss, a German-born American Jewish music professor who had immigrated to Texas in the late 1860s and was employed as music tutor by a prominent local business family. Weiss, as described by San Diego Jewish World writer Eric George Tauber, \\"was no stranger to [receiving] race hatred... As a Jew in Germany, he was often slapped and called a ‚ÄúChrist-killer.\\"\\"Play about Scott Joplin is electrifying.\\" Tauber, Eric George. San Diego Jewish World. www.sdjewishworld.com. Published September 28, 2014. Accessed November 6, 2017. Weiss had studied music at a German university and was listed in town records as a professor of music. Impressed by Joplin's talent, and realizing the Joplin family's dire straits, Weiss taught him free of charge. While tutoring the 11-year-old Joplin until age 16, Weiss introduced him to folk and classical music, including opera. Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an \\"art as well as an entertainment,\\" and helped Florence acquire a used piano. According to Weiss' wife Lottie, Joplin never forgot Weiss. In his later years, after achieving fame as a composer, Joplin sent his former teacher \\"...gifts of money when he was old and ill\\" until Weiss died.Albrecht (1979) pp. 89‚Äì105. At the age of 16, Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana, also playing piano. He also taught guitar and mandolin.Berlin (1994) pp. 7‚Äì8. Life in the southern states and Chicago In the late 1880s, having performed at various local events as a teenager, Joplin gave up his job as a railroad laborer and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician.Christensen (1999) p. 442 Little is known about his movements at this time, although he is recorded in Texarkana in July 1891 as a member of the Texarkana Minstrels, who were raising money for a monument to Jefferson Davis, president of the former Confederate States of America.Berlin (1994) p. 9 However, Joplin soon learned that there were few opportunities for black pianists. Churches and brothels were among the few options for steady work. Joplin played pre-ragtime \\"jig-piano\\" in various red- light districts throughout the mid-South, and some claim he was in Sedalia and St. Louis, Missouri, during this time.Kirk (2001) p. 190.Berlin (1994) pp. 8‚Äì9 In 1893, while in Chicago for the World's Fair, Joplin formed a band in which he played cornet and also arranged the band's music. Although the World's Fair minimized the involvement of African-Americans, black performers still came to the saloons, caf√©s and brothels that lined the fair. The exposition was attended by 27 million visitors and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life, including ragtime. Although specific information is sparse, numerous sources have credited the Chicago World's Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime.Berlin (1994) pp. 11‚Äì12. Joplin found that his music, as well as that of other black performers, was popular with visitors.Christensen (1999) p. 442. By 1897, ragtime had become a national craze in U.S. cities, and was described by the St. Louis Dispatch as \\"a veritable call of the wild, which mightily stirred the pulses of city bred people.\\"St. Louis Dispatch, quoted in Life in Missouri In 1894 Joplin arrived in Sedalia, Missouri. At first, Joplin stayed with the family of Arthur Marshall, at the time a 13-year-old boy but later one of Joplin's students and a ragtime composer in his own right.Berlin (1994) pp. 24‚Äì25. There is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence in the town until 1904, as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician. Front cover of the third edition of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" sheet music with Joplin portrait There is little precise evidence known about Joplin's activities at this time, although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia, the Black 400 Club and the Maple Leaf Club. He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own six-piece dance orchestra. A tour with his own singing group, the Texas Medley Quartet, gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions, and it is known that he went to Syracuse, New York and Texas. Two businessmen from New York published Joplin's first two works, the songs \\"Please Say You Will\\" and \\"A Picture of Her Face\\", in 1895.Berlin (1994) pp. 25‚Äì27. Joplin's visit to Temple, Texas enabled him to have three pieces published there in 1896, including the \\"Great Crush Collision March\\", which commemorated a planned train crash on the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad on September 15 that he may have witnessed. The march was described by one of Joplin's biographers as a \\"special... early essay in ragtime.\\" While in Sedalia, Joplin taught piano to students who included future ragtime composers Arthur Marshall, Brun Campbell and Scott Hayden. Joplin enrolled at the George R. Smith College, where he apparently studied \\"...advanced harmony and composition.\\" The college's records were destroyed in a fire in 1925,Berlin (1994) p. 19 and biographer Edward A. Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for African-Americans would be able to provide such a course.Berlin (1994) pp. 31‚Äì34Berlin (1994) p. 27. In 1899, Joplin married Belle the sister-in-law of collaborator Scott Hayden. Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" was published, Joplin was not far behind. His first published rag, \\"Original Rags\\" had been completed in 1897, the same year that the first ragtime work appeared in print, the \\"Mississippi Rag\\" by William Krell. The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in 1899; Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around 1898.Berlin (1994) pp. 47, 52. The exact circumstances that led to the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other. After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers, Joplin signed a contract on August 10, 1899 with John Stillwell Stark, a retailer of musical instruments who later became his most important publisher. The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a 1% royalty on all sales of the rag, with a minimum sales price of 25 cents.Berlin (1994) pp. 56, 58. With the inscription \\"To the Maple Leaf Club\\" prominently visible along the top of at least some editions, it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club, although there is no direct evidence to prove the link, and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time.Berlin (1994) p. 62. Scott Joplin House in St. Louis, Missouri September 2, 1903 Advertising poster for A Guest of Honor by Scott Joplin Cover of Scott Joplin's 1905 work \\"Bethena\\"; an unproven theory is that the woman on the cover is a wedding picture of Joplin's 2nd wife Freddie Alexander who had passed away September 1904 \\"Nonpareil\\" (1907) There have been many claims about the sales of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", for example that Joplin was the first musician to sell 1 million copies of a piece of instrumental music. Joplin's first biographer, Rudi Blesh wrote that during its first six months the piece sold 75,000 copies, and became \\"...the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America.\\" However, research by Joplin's later biographer Edward A. Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case; the initial print-run of 400 took one year to sell, and under the terms of Joplin's contract with a 1% royalty would have given Joplin an income of $4 (or approximately $ at current prices). Later sales were steady, and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses. In 1909, estimated sales would have given him an income of $600 annually (approximately $16,968 in current prices).Berlin (1994) p. 56, 58. The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers, especially in the development of classic ragtime. After the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", Joplin was soon being described as \\"King of rag time writers\\", not least by himselfBerlin (1994) p. 128. on the covers of his own work, such as \\"The Easy Winners\\" and \\"Elite Syncopations\\". After the Joplins moved to St. Louis in early 1900, they had a baby daughter who died only a few months after birth. Joplin's relationship with his wife was difficult, as she had no interest in music. They eventually separated and then divorced.Ryerson (1973) About this time, Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags.Jasen & Tichenor (1978) p. 88 It was in St. Louis that Joplin produced some of his best-known works, including \\"The Entertainer\\", \\"March Majestic\\", and the short theatrical work \\"The Ragtime Dance\\". By 1903 the Joplins had moved to a 13-room house, renting some of the rooms to lodgers which included pianist-composers Arthur Marshall and Scott Hayden. Joplin did not work as a pianist in the saloons in St Louis, which was usually a major source of income for musicians, as he was \\"probably outclassed by the competition\\" and was, according to Stark's son, \\"a mediocre pianist\\". Biographer Berlin speculated that by 1903 Joplin was already showing early signs of syphilis which negatively affected his coordination and \\"pianistic skills\\" . In June 1904, Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock, Arkansas, the young woman to whom he had dedicated \\"The Chrysanthemum\\". She died on September 10, 1904, of complications resulting from a cold, ten weeks after their wedding.Berlin (1994) p.142 Joplin's first work copyrighted after Freddie's death, \\"Bethena\\", was described by one biographer as \\"...an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtime waltzes.\\"Berlin (1994) p. 149. During this time, Joplin created an opera company of 30 people and produced his first opera A Guest of Honor for a national tour. It is not certain how many productions were staged, or even if this was an all-black show or a racially mixed production. During the tour, either in Springfield, Illinois, or Pittsburg, Kansas, someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts. Joplin could not meet the company's payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house. It is believed that the score for A Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of non-payment of the company's boarding house bill. Later years and death Front cover of the \\"Wall Street Rag\\" (1909) sheet music In 1907, Joplin moved to New York City, which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera. After his move to New York, Joplin met Lottie Stokes, whom he married in 1909. In 1911, unable to find a publisher, Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishing Treemonisha himself in piano-vocal format. In 1915, as a last-ditch effort to see it performed, he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall in Harlem. Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment, it was \\"a miserable failure\\" to a public not ready for \\"crude\\" black musical forms‚Äîso different from the European grand opera of that time.Kirk (2001) p. 191. The audience, including potential backers, was indifferent and walked out. Scott writes that \\"after a disastrous single performance ... Joplin suffered a breakdown. He was bankrupt, discouraged, and worn out.\\" He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles: \\"Treemonisha went unnoticed and unreviewed, largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music, a field closed to African Americans.\\" In fact, it would not be until the 1970s that the opera received a full theatrical staging. In 1914, Joplin and Lottie self-published his \\"Magnetic Rag\\" as the Scott Joplin Music Company, which he had formed the previous December.Berlin (1994) pp. 226, 230. Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due to syphilis and was \\"...consciously racing against time.\\" In her sleeve notes on the 1992 Deutsche Grammophon release of Treemonisha she notes that he \\"...plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera, day and night, with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts, page by page, as each page of the full score was completed.\\"Vera Brodsky Lawrence, Sleeve notes to 1992 Deutsche Grammophon release of Treemonisha, quoted in Kirk (2001) p. 191. By 1916, Joplin was suffering from tertiary syphilisBerlin (1994) p. 239. but more specifically it likely was neurosyphilis. In January 1917, he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital, a mental institution. He died there on April 1 of syphilitic dementia at the age of 48 and was buried in a pauper's grave that remained unmarked for 57 years. His grave at St. Michael's Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in 1974, the year The Sting, which showcased his music, won for Best Picture at the Oscars. Works The combination of classical music, the musical atmosphere present around Texarkana (including work songs, gospel hymns, spirituals and dance music) and Joplin's natural ability have been cited as contributing significantly to the invention of a new style that blended African-American musical styles with European forms and melodies, and first became celebrated in the 1890s: ragtime. When Joplin was learning the piano, serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs \\"...cranked out by the tune-smiths of Tin Pan Alley.\\" As a composer Joplin refined ragtime, elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the \\"...wandering honky-tonk pianists... playing mere dance music\\" of popular imagination. This new art form, the classic rag, combined Afro- American folk music's syncopation and 19th-century European romanticism, with its harmonic schemes and its march-like tempos.Davis (1995)pp. 67‚Äì68. In the words of one critic, \\"Ragtime was basically... an Afro-American version of the polka, or its analog, the Sousa-style march.\\"Williams (1987) With this as a foundation, Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them ‚Äì without improvisation. Joplin wrote his rags as \\"classical\\" music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its \\"cheap bordello\\" origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as, \\"... more tuneful, contrapuntal, infectious, and harmonically colorful than any others of his era.\\" Some speculate that Joplin's achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacher Julius Weiss, who may have brought a polka rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the 11-year old Joplin. As Curtis put it, \\"The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware.\\"Curtis (2004) p. 37. Joplin's first and most significant hit, the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", was described as the archetype of the classic rag, and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least 12 years after its initial publication thanks to its rhythmic patterns, melody lines, and harmony, though with the exception of Joseph Lamb, they generally failed to enlarge upon it. Joplin used the Maple Leaf Rag as inspiration for subsequent works such as The Cascades in 1903, Leola in 1905, Gladiolus Rag in 1907, and Sugar Cane Rag in 1908. While he used similar harmonic and melodic patterns the later compositions were not simple copies, but were distinctly new works, which used dissonance, chromatic sections and the blues third. =Treemonisha= Treemonisha (1911) The opera's setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin's childhood town Texarkana in September 1884. The plot centers on an 18-year-old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman, and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition. Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps' nest when her friend Remus rescues her. The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader.Berlin (1994) p. 203.Crawford (2001) p. 545. Joplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera, which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias, ensembles and choruses. In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism evident in Treemonisha are common in the operatic tradition, and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composer Richard Wagner (of which Joplin was aware). A sacred tree Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from in Die Walk√ºre, and the retelling of the heroine's origins echos aspects of the opera Siegfried. In addition, African-American folk tales also influence the story‚Äîthe wasp nest incident is similar to the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch.Berlin (1994) pp. 203‚Äì204. Treemonisha is not a ragtime opera‚Äîbecause Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly, using them to convey \\"racial character,\\" and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the 19th century. The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late 19th century re-created by a \\"skilled and sensitive participant.\\"Berlin (1994) pp. 202, 204. Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin's own life. He notes that Lottie Joplin (the composer's third wife) saw a connection between the character Treemonisha's wish to lead her people out of ignorance, and a similar desire in the composer. In addition, it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie, Joplin's second wife, because the date of the opera's setting was likely to have been the month of her birth.Berlin (1994) pp. 207‚Äì208. At the time of the opera's publication in 1911, the American Musician and Art Journal praised it as, \\"...an entirely new form of operatic art.\\"Berlin (1994) p. 202. Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history, with its heroine, \\"...a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes, notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement.\\"Kirk (2001) p. 194. Curtis's conclusion is similar: \\"In the end, Treemonisha offered a celebration of literacy, learning, hard work, and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race.\\"Christensen (1999) p. 444. Berlin describes it as a \\"...fine opera, certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States,\\" but later states that Joplin's own libretto showed the composer, \\"...was not a competent dramatist,\\" with the book not up to the quality of the music.Berlin (1994) pp. 202‚Äì203. As Rick Benjamin, the founder and director of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra, found out, Joplin succeeded in performing Treemonisha for paying audiences in Bayonne, New Jersey, in 1913. On 6 December 2011, the centenary of the Joplin piano score's publication, New World Records released an entirely new recording of Treemonisha. August 1984 saw the German premiere of Treemonisha at the Stadttheater Gie√üen. In October 2013, Nicol√°s Isasi directed the premiere of Treemonisha in Argentina with a team of 60 young artists at the in Buenos Aires. Another performance in Germany, falsely labelling itself as the German premiere, occurred on 25 April 2015 at the Staatsschauspiel Dresden under direction and choreography of . =Performance skills= Joplin's skills as a pianist were described in glowing terms by a Sedalia newspaper in 1898, and fellow ragtime composers Arthur Marshall and Joe Jordan both said that he played the instrument well. However, the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper, rather than at the piano. Artie Matthews recalled the \\"delight\\" the St. Louis players took in outplaying Joplin.Jasen & Tichenor (1978) p. 86. While Joplin never made an audio recording, his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls for use in mechanical player pianos. All seven were made in 1916. Of these, the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of significant editing to correct the performance to strict rhythm and add embellishments, probably by the staff musicians at Connorized. Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St. Louis, he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers, tremors, and an inability to speak clearly‚Äîall symptoms of the syphilis that killed him in 1917.Berlin (1994) pp. 237, 239. Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" on the UniRecord label from June 1916 as \\"...shocking... disorganized and completely distressing to hear.\\" While there is disagreement among piano-roll experts as to how much of this is due to the relatively primitive recording and production techniques of the time,Siepmann (1998) p. 36.Philip (1998) pp. 77‚Äì78.Howat (1986) p. 160.McElhone (2004) p. 26. Berlin notes that the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" roll was likely to be the truest record of Joplin's playing at the time. The roll, however, may not reflect his abilities earlier in life.Berlin (1994) p. 237. Legacy Joplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music, fostering an appreciation for African-American music among European-Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes. \\"Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties ... Joplin's ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America.\\" Joshua Rifkin, a leading Joplin recording artist, wrote, \\"A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work, and even at his most high-spirited, he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity ... He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him.\\"Rifkin, Joshua. Scott Joplin Piano Rags, Nonesuch Records (1970) album cover Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that, \\"In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin, ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety ... Joplin did for the rag what Chopin did for the mazurka. His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated the bolero and the tango.\\" Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin's music had helped to \\"revolutionise American music and culture\\" by removing Victorian restraint.Curtis (2004) p. 1. Composer and actor Max Morath found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin's work did not enjoy the popularity of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation they remained obscure and unheralded during his life. Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time: As music historian Ian Whitcomb mentions that Joplin, \\"...opined that \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" would make him 'King of Ragtime Composers' but he also knew that he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime. 'When I'm dead twenty-five years, people are going to recognize me,' he told a friend.\\" Just over thirty years later he was recognized, and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime, which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin. Although he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life, Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music. And as a pioneer composer and performer, he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of all races. After his death, jazz historian Floyd Levin noted: \\"Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow. This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers, the man who gave America a genuine native music.\\"Levin (2002) p. 197. =Museum= The home Joplin rented in St. Louis from 1900 to 1903 was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and was saved from destruction by the local African American community. In 1983, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources made it the first state historic site in Missouri dedicated to African American heritage. At first it focused entirely on Joplin and ragtime music, ignoring the urban milieu which shaped his musical compositions. A newer heritage project has expanded coverage to include the more complex social history of black urban migration and the transformation of a multi- ethnic neighborhood to the contemporary community. Part of this diverse narrative now includes coverage of uncomfortable topics of racial oppression, poverty, sanitation, prostitution, and sexually transmitted diseases.Timothy Baumann, et al. \\"Interpreting Uncomfortable History at the Scott Joplin House State Historic Site in St. Louis, Missouri.\\" The Public Historian 33.2 (2011): 37-66. online Revival After his death in 1917, Joplin's music and ragtime in general waned in popularity as new forms of musical styles, such as jazz and novelty piano, emerged. Even so, jazz bands and recording artists such as Tommy Dorsey in 1936, Jelly Roll Morton in 1939 and J. Russel Robinson in 1947 released recordings of Joplin compositions. \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" was the Joplin piece found most often on 78 rpm records.Jasen (1981) pp. 319‚Äì320. In the 1960s, a small-scale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars such as Trebor Tichenor, William Bolcom, William Albright and Rudi Blesh. Audiophile Records released a two-record set, The Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin, The Greatest of Ragtime Composers, performed by Knocky Parker, in 1970.The Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin, The Greatest of Ragtime Composers, John W. (Knocky) Parker, piano. Audiophile Records (1970) AP 71‚Äì72 In 1968, Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin, a young musicologist, in the body of Joplin's work. Together, they hosted an occasional ragtime-and-early-jazz evening on WBAI radio.Waldo (1976) pp. 179‚Äì182. In November 1970, Rifkin released a recording called Scott Joplin: Piano Rags on the classical label Nonesuch. It sold 100,000 copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch's first million-selling record. The Billboard Best-Selling Classical LPs chart for September 28, 1974 has the record at number 5, with the follow-up \\"Volume 2\\" at number 4, and a combined set of both volumes at number 3. Separately both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks. In the top seven spots on that chart, six of the entries were recordings of Joplin's work, three of which were Rifkin's. Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section. The album was nominated in 1971 for two Grammy Award categories: Best Album Notes and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra). Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin, but at the ceremony on March 14, 1972, Rifkin did not win in any category. He did a tour in 1974, which included appearances on BBC Television and a sell-out concert at London's Royal Festival Hall. In 1979, Alan Rich wrote in the magazine New York that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin's music on disc, Nonesuch Records \\"...created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival.\\" In January 1971, Harold C. Schonberg, music critic at The New York Times, having just heard the Rifkin album, wrote a featured Sunday edition article entitled \\"Scholars, Get Busy on Scott Joplin!\\" Schonberg's call to action has been described as the catalyst for classical music scholars, the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life, to conclude that Joplin was a genius.Waldo (1976) p. 184. Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library published a two-volume set of Joplin works in June 1971, entitled The Collected Works of Scott Joplin, stimulating a wider interest in the performance of Joplin's music. In mid-February 1973 under the direction of Gunther Schuller, the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble recorded an album of Joplin's rags taken from the period collection Standard High-Class Rags called Joplin: The Red Back Book. The album won a Grammy Award as Best Chamber Music Performance in that year, and went on to become Billboard magazine's Top Classical Album of 1974. The group subsequently recorded two more albums for Golden Crest Records: More Scott Joplin Rags in 1974 and The Road From Rags To Jazz in 1975. In 1973, film producer George Roy Hill contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately, asking each man to write the score for a film project he was working on: The Sting. Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments. Instead Hill found Marvin Hamlisch available, and brought him into the project as composer.Waldo (1976) p. 187. Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin's music for The Sting, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation on April 2, 1974. His version of \\"The Entertainer\\" reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the American Top 40 music chart on May 18, 1974, prompting The New York Times to write, \\"The whole nation has begun to take notice.\\" Thanks to the film and its score, Joplin's work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world, becoming (in the words of music magazine Record World), the \\"classical phenomenon of the decade.\\"Record World Magazine July 1974, quoted in Berlin (1994) p. 251. Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin's style and his band adaptations from Schuller's style. Schuller said Hamlisch, \\"...got the Oscar for music he didn't write (since it is by Joplin) and arrangements he didn't write, and 'editions' he didn't make. A lot of people were upset by that, but that's show biz!\\" On October 22, 1971, excerpts from Treemonisha were presented in concert form at Lincoln Center with musical performances by Bolcom, Rifkin and Mary Lou Williams supporting a group of singers. Finally, on January 28, 1972, T.J. Anderson's orchestration of Treemonisha was staged for two consecutive nights, sponsored by the Afro- American Music Workshop of Morehouse College in Atlanta, with singers accompanied by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Shaw, and choreography by Katherine Dunham. Schonberg remarked in February 1972 that the \\"Scott Joplin Renaissance\\" was in full swing and still growing. In May 1975, Treemonisha was staged in a full opera production by the Houston Grand Opera. The company toured briefly, then settled into an eight-week run in New York on Broadway at the Palace Theatre in October and November. This appearance was directed by Gunther Schuller, and soprano Carmen Balthrop alternated with Kathleen Battle as the title character. An \\"original Broadway cast\\" recording was produced. Because of the lack of national exposure given to the brief Morehouse College staging of the opera in 1972, many Joplin scholars wrote that the Houston Grand Opera's 1975 show was the first full production. 1974 saw the Birmingham Royal Ballet under director Kenneth MacMillan create Elite Syncopations, a ballet based on tunes by Joplin and other composers of the era. That year also brought the premiere by the Los Angeles Ballet of Red Back Book, choreographed by John Clifford to Joplin rags from the collection of the same name, including both solo piano performances and arrangements for full orchestra.

More simply, syncopation is \\"a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm\\": a \\"placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn't normally occur\\". It is the correlation of at least two sets of time intervals.Patterson, William Morrison, \\"Rhythm of Prose\\" (Introductory Outline), Columbia University Press 1917. Syncopation is used in many musical styles, especially dance music: \\"All dance music makes use of syncopation, and it's often a vital element that helps tie the whole track together\\". In the form of a back beat, syncopation is used in virtually all contemporary popular music. Syncopation can also occur when a strong harmony is simultaneous with a weak beat, for instance, when a 7th-chord is played on the second beat of measure or a dominant chord is played at the fourth beat of a measure. The latter occurs frequently in tonal cadences for 18th- and early-19th-century music and is the usual conclusion of any section. A hemiola (the equivalent Latin term is sesquialtera) can also be considered as one straight measure in three with one long chord and one short chord and a syncope in the measure thereafter, with one short chord and one long chord. Usually, the last chord in a hemiola is a (bi-)dominant, and as such a strong harmony on a weak beat, hence a syncope. Types of syncopation Technically, \\"syncopation occurs when a temporary displacement of the regular metrical accent occurs, causing the emphasis to shift from a strong accent to a weak accent\\".Reed, Ted (1997). Progressive Steps to Syncopation for the Modern Drummer, p. 33. . \\"Syncopation is\\", however, \\"very simply, a deliberate disruption of the two- or three-beat stress pattern, most often by stressing an off-beat, or a note that is not on the beat.\\"Day, Holly and Pilhofer, Michael (2007). Music Theory For Dummies, p. 58‚Äì60. . =Suspension= For the following example, there are two points of syncopation where the third beats are sustained from the second beats. In the same way, the first beat of the second bar is sustained from the fourth beat of the first bar. : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 c4-> c2-> c4->~ c c2-> c4-> } Though syncopation may be very complex, dense or complex-looking rhythms often contain no syncopation. The following rhythm, though dense, stresses the regular downbeats, 1 and 4 (in ): : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 6/8 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 80 c8-> c c c16-> \\\\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c c32-> c c \\\\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c c \\\\set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \\\\set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c c c c8-> c c } However, whether it's a placed rest or an accented note, any point in a piece of music that changes the listener's sense of the downbeat is a point of syncopation because it's shifting where the strong and weak accents are built. =Off-beat syncopation= The stress can shift by less than a whole beat, so it occurs on an offbeat, as in the following example, where the stress in the first bar is shifted back by an eighth note (or quaver): : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 4/4 d8 a'4 c8~ c e4 gis,8 a1 } } Whereas the notes are expected to occur on the beat: : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 4/4 d4 a' c e gis, a2. } } Playing a note ever so slightly before, or after, a beat is another form of syncopation because this produces an unexpected accent: : { \\\\relative c' { \\\\time 4/4 \\\\partial8 d8 a'4 c e gis,8 a~ a1 } } It can be helpful to think of a rhythm in eighth notes and count it as \\"1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and\\". In general, emphasizing the \\"and\\" would be considered the off-beat. =Anticipated bass= Anticipated bassPeter Manuel (1985). \\"The anticipated bass in Cuban popular music\\", Latin American Music Review, Vol. 6, No. 2, Autumn-Winter, pp. 249‚Äì261. is a bass tone that comes syncopated shortly before the downbeat, which is used in Son montuno Cuban dance music. Timing can vary, but it usually occurs on the 2+ and the 4 of the time, thus anticipating the third and first beats. This pattern is known commonly as the Afro-Cuban bass tumbao.

First however, one may listen to the audio example of stress on the \\"strong\\" beats, where expected: =Latin equivalent of simple = In the example below, for the first two measures an unsyncopated rhythm is shown in the first measure. The third measure has a syncopated rhythm in which the first and fourth beat are provided as expected, but the accent occurs unexpectedly in between the second and third beats, creating a familiar \\"Latin rhythm\\" known as tresillo. : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 c8-> c c-> c c-> c c-> c c1-> \\\\bar \\"\\" c8-> c c c-> c c c-> c c1-> \\\\bar \\"\\" } =Backbeat transformation of simple = The accent may be shifted from the first to the second beat in duple meter (and the third to fourth in quadruple), creating the backbeat rhythm: : ew RhythmicStaff { \\\\clef percussion \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 c4-> c c-> c c-> c c-> c c1-> \\\\bar \\"\\" c4 c-> c c-> c c-> c c-> c1 \\\\bar \\"\\" } Different crowds will \\"clap along\\" at concerts either on 1 and 3 or on 2 and 4, as above. =\\"Satisfaction\\" example= The phrasing of \\"Satisfaction\\" is a good example of syncopation. It is derived here from its theoretic unsyncopated form, a repeated trochee (¬Ø Àò ¬Ø Àò). A backbeat transformation is applied to \\"I\\" and \\"can't\\", and then a before-the-beat transformation is applied to \\"can't\\" and \\"no\\". 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & Repeated trochee: ¬Ø Àò ¬Ø Àò I can't get no ‚Äì o Backbeat trans.: ¬Ø Àò ¬Ø Àò I can't get no ‚Äì o Before- the-beat: ¬Ø Àò ¬Ø Àò I can't get no ‚Äì o This demonstrates how each syncopated pattern may be heard as a remapping, \\"with reference to\\" or \\"in light of\\", an unsyncopated pattern. History Syncopation has been an important element of European musical composition since at least the Middle Ages. Many Italian and French compositions of the music of the 14th-century Trecento use syncopation, as in of the following madrigal by Giovanni da Firenze. (See also hocket.) Giovanni da Firenze, Appress' un fiume.Listen The refrain \\"Deo Gratias\\" from the 15th-century anonymous English Agincourt Carol is also characterised by lively syncopation: Agincourt carol ‚Äì Deo gratias Agincourt carol ‚Äì Deo gratias ‚ÄúThe 15th-century carol repertory is one of the most substantial monuments of English medieval music... The early carols are rhythmically straightforward, in modern 6/8 time; later the basic rhythm is in 3/4, with many cross-rhythms... as in the famous Agincourt carol 'Deo gratias Anglia'. As in other music of the period, the emphasis is not on harmony, but on melody and rhythm.‚Äùhttps://www.britannica.com/art/carol, accessed 14 March 2019. Composers of the musical High Renaissance Venetian School, such as Giovanni Gabrieli (1557‚Äì1612), exploited syncopation for both their secular madrigals and instrumental pieces and also in their choral sacred works, such as the motet Domine, Dominus noster: Gabrieli Domine Dominus nosterGiovanni Gabrieli Denis Arnold (1979, p. 93) says: \\"the syncopations of this passage are of a kind which is almost a Gabrieli fingerprint, and they are typical of a general liveliness of rhythm common to Venetian music\\".Arnold, D. (1979) Giovanni Gabrieli. Oxford University Press. The composer Igor Stravinsky (1959, p. 91), no stranger to syncopation himself, spoke of \\"those marvellous rhythmic inventions\\" that feature in Gabrieli's music.Stravinsky, I. and Craft, R. (1959) Conversations with Igor Stravinsky. London, Faber. J. S. Bach and George Handel used syncopated rhythms as an inherent part of their compositions. One of the best-known examples of syncopation in music from the Baroque era was the \\"Hornpipe\\" from Handel‚Äôs Water Music (1733). Handel Hornpipe from Water MusicHandel Hornpipe from Water Music Christopher Hogwood (2005, p. 37) describes the Hornpipe as ‚Äúpossibly the most memorable movement in the collection, combining instrumental brilliance and rhythmic vitality‚Ä¶ Woven amongst the running quavers are the insistent off-beat syncopations that symbolise confidence for Handel.‚ÄùHogwood, C. (2005) Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks. Cambridge University press. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 features striking deviations from the established rhythmic norm in its first and third movements. According to Malcolm Boyd (1993, p. 53), each ritornello section of the first movement, \\"is clinched with an Epilog of syncopated antiphony\\":Boyd, M. (1993) Bach: The Brandenburg Concertos. Cambridge University Press. Bach Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 ending bars of first movement Bach Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 ending bars of the first movement Boyd (1993, p. 85) also hears the coda to the third movement as \\"remarkable‚Ä¶ for the way the rhythm of the initial phrase of the fugue subject is expressed‚Ä¶ with the accent thrown on to the second of the two minims (now staccato)\\": Bach Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 coda to the 3rd movement Bach Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 coda to the 3rd movement Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert used syncopation to create variety especially in their symphonies. The beginning movement of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony No. 3 exemplifies powerfully the uses of syncopation in a piece in triple time. After producing a pattern of three beats to a bar at the outset, Beethoven disrupts it through syncopation in a number of ways: (1) By displacing the rhythmic emphasis to a weak part of the beat, as in the first violin part in bars 7‚Äì9: Beethoven, Symphony No. 3, beginning of first movement Beethoven Symphony No. 3, beginning of first movement Taruskin (2010, p. 658) describes here how \\"the first violins, entering immediately after the C sharp, are made palpably to totter for two bars\\".Taruskin, R. (2010), The Oxford History of Western Music. Oxford University Press. (2) By placing accents on normally weak beats, as in bars 25‚Äì26 and 28‚Äì35: Beethoven, Symphony No. 3, first movement, bars 23‚Äì37 Beethoven, Symphony No. 3, first movement, bars 23‚Äì37, first violin part This \\"long sequence of syncopated sforzandi\\" recurs later during the development section of this movement, in a passage that Antony Hopkins (1981, p. 75) describes as \\"a rhythmic pattern that rides roughshod over the properties of a normal three-in-a bar\\".Hopkins, A.

In the sense of the \\"art of the general\\", which included several subsets of skills including military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. From then until the 20th century, the word \\"strategy\\" came to denote \\"a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills\\" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact. Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve goals are usually limited. Strategy generally involves setting goals and priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking. Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of strategy as planning, while Henrik von Scheel defines the essence of strategy as the activities to deliver a unique mix of value ‚Äì choosing to perform activities differently or to perform different activities than rivals.Henrik von Scheel and Prof Mark von Rosing. Importance of a Business Model (pp. 23‚Äì54). Applying real-world BPM in an SAP environment. while Max McKeown (2011) argues that \\"strategy is about shaping the future\\" and is the human attempt to get to \\"desirable ends with available means\\". Dr. Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as \\"a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully.\\" Complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context. Components Professor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure he called a kernel. The kernel has three parts: 1) A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent actions designed to carry out the guiding policy. President Kennedy illustrated these three elements of strategy in his Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962: # Diagnosis: \\"This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites are now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.\\" # Guiding Policy: \\"Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere.\\" # Action Plans: First among seven numbered steps was the following: \\"To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back.\\" Rumelt wrote in 2011 that three important aspects of strategy include \\"premeditation, the anticipation of others' behavior, and the purposeful design of coordinated actions.\\" He described strategy as solving a design problem, with trade-offs among various elements that must be arranged, adjusted and coordinated, rather than a plan or choice. Formulation and implementation Strategy typically involves two major processes: formulation and implementation. Formulation involves analyzing the environment or situation, making a diagnosis, and developing guiding policies. It includes such activities as strategic planning and strategic thinking. Implementation refers to the action plans taken to achieve the goals established by the guiding policy. Bruce Henderson wrote in 1981 that: \\"Strategy depends upon the ability to foresee future consequences of present initiatives.\\" He wrote that the basic requirements for strategy development include, among other factors: 1) extensive knowledge about the environment, market and competitors; 2) ability to examine this knowledge as an interactive dynamic system; and 3) the imagination and logic to choose between specific alternatives. Henderson wrote that strategy was valuable because of: \\"finite resources, uncertainty about an adversary's capability and intentions; the irreversible commitment of resources; necessity of coordinating action over time and distance; uncertainty about control of the initiative; and the nature of adversaries' mutual perceptions of each other.\\" Military theory In military theory, strategy is \\"the utilization during both peace and war, of all of the nation's forces, through large scale, long-range planning and development, to ensure security and victory\\" (Random House Dictionary). The father of Western modern strategic study, Carl von Clausewitz, defined military strategy as \\"the employment of battles to gain the end of war.\\" B. H. Liddell Hart's definition put less emphasis on battles, defining strategy as \\"the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy\\".Liddell Hart, B. H. Strategy London: Faber, 1967 (2nd rev ed.) p. 321 Hence, both gave the pre- eminence to political aims over military goals. U.S. Naval War College instructor Andrew Wilson defined strategy as the \\"process by which political purpose is translated into military action.\\" Lawrence Freedman defined strategy as the \\"art of creating power.\\" Eastern military philosophy dates back much further, with examples such as The Art of War by Sun Tzu dated around 500 B.C. The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Special Edition Books. 2007. Management theory Modern business strategy emerged as a field of study and practice in the 1960s; prior to that time, the words \\"strategy\\" and \\"competition\\" rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature. Alfred Chandler wrote in 1962 that: \\"Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals.\\"Chandler, Alfred Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the history of industrial enterprise, Doubleday, New York, 1962. Michael Porter defined strategy in 1980 as the \\"...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals\\" and the \\"...combination of the ends (goals) for which the firm is striving and the means (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.\\" Henry Mintzberg described five definitions of strategy in 1998: * Strategy as plan ‚Äì a directed course of action to achieve an intended set of goals; similar to the strategic planning concept; * Strategy as pattern ‚Äì a consistent pattern of past behavior, with a strategy realized over time rather than planned or intended. Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as emergent; * Strategy as position ‚Äì locating brands, products, or companies within the market, based on the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders; a strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm; * Strategy as ploy ‚Äì a specific maneuver intended to outwit a competitor; and * Strategy as perspective ‚Äì executing strategy based on a \\"theory of the business\\" or natural extension of the mindset or ideological perspective of the organization.Mintzberg, H. Ahlstrand, B. and Lampel, J. Strategy Safari : A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Strategic Management, The Free Press, New York, 1998. Strategies in game theory In game theory, a strategy refers to the rules that a player uses to choose between the available actionable options. Every player in a non-trivial game has a set of possible strategies to use when choosing what moves to make. A strategy may recursively look ahead and consider what actions can happen in each contingent state of the game‚Äîe.g. if the player takes action 1, then that presents the opponent with a certain situation, which might be good or bad, whereas if the player takes action 2 then the opponents will be presented with a different situation, and in each case the choices they make will determine their own future situation. Strategies in game theory may be random (mixed) or deterministic (pure). Pure strategies can be thought of as a special case of mixed strategies, in which only probabilities 0 or 1 are assigned to actions. Strategy based games generally require a player to think through a sequence of solutions to determine the best way to defeat the opponent.  Counterterrorism Strategy  Because counterterrorism involves the synchronized efforts of numerous competing bureaucratic entities, national governments frequently create overarching counterterrorism strategies at the national level. A national counterterrorism strategy is a government's plan to use the instruments of national power to neutralize terrorists, their organizations, and their networks in order to render them incapable of using violence to instill fear and to coerce the government or its citizens to react in accordance with the terrorists' goals. The United States has had several such strategies in the past, including the United States National Strategy for Counterterrorism (2018); the Obama-era National Strategy for Counterterrorism (2011); and the National Strategy for Combatting Terrorism (2003). There have also been a number of ancillary or supporting plans, such as the 2014 Strategy to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and the 2016 Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States. Similarly, the United Kingdom's counterterrorism strategy, CONTEST, seeks \\"to reduce the risk to the UK and its citizens and interests overseas from terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.\\" =See also= * Concept Driven Strategy * Odds algorithm (odds strategy) * Strategy game * Strategy pattern * Strategic planning * Strategic management * Strategist * Strategy Markup Language Further reading * Burgleman, James.

Born in Saudi Arabia, Ghamdi left his home to fight in Chechnya after dropping out of college, but was reported to have diverted to Afghanistan to train in an al-Qaeda camp. It was reported he was chosen by Osama bin Laden to participate in terrorist attacks in the United States and arrived in the U.S. in June 2001. During his stay in the U.S., he quietly settled in Florida, planning out how the attacks would commence and training on flight simulators. On September 11, 2001, he boarded United 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which was crashed into a field in the control of hijacker-pilot Ziad Jarrah in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the passengers attempted to retake control of the plane in an uprising. Early life and education 208x208px Ghamdi was from the al Bahah province of Saudi Arabia, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Ahmed al- Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Haznawi, although he was not related to either Ghamdi. He may have been in contact with the two Ghamdis and Haznawi as early as 1999. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers. Ghamdi spent time in al Qasim province, Saudi Arabia where he transferred to college but soon dropped out and ceased contact with his family. While there he probably associated with the radical Saudi cleric named Sulayman al-Alwan as several other future hijackers had. Saeed later headed to Chechnya to participate in the conflict against the Russians. At this time, Chechen fighters were turning away additional foreigners, many of whom ended up in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan to train and await entry to Chechnya. Saeed ended up at the Al Farouq training camp, where he met Ahmed al-Nami, and the brothers Wail and Waleed al-Shehri. The four reportedly pledge themselves to Jihad in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail‚Äîwho had dubbed himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions. Saeed was known to Tawfiq bin Attash who is thought to have convinced him to become a martyr. Saeed was at that time working as a security guard at Kandahar airport along with Waleed al-Shehri. Some time late in 2000, Saeed traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Majed Moqed, Wail al-Shehri, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. On November 13, 2000, another Saeed al-GhamdiSaeed Abdullah al- Ghamdi. tried to obtain a visa to enter the United States, but was declined. Although the 9/11 Commission makes mention of him, there is no evidence he was associated with the hijackers. In March 2001, Saeed was filmed in a farewell video that was later aired on al-Jazeera. In the video, many future 9/11 hijackers swear to become martyrs, although no details of the plot are revealed. Saeed referred to America as \\"the enemy\\", and is seen studying maps and flight manuals.Cooperative Research In the United States On June 12, 2001, Saeed al-Ghamdi applied for and received a second two-year US B-1/B-2 (tourist/business) visa in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. His application was submitted by a local travel agency and processed through Visa Express, a controversial US visa program in Saudi Arabia which was discontinued the following year. Arriving in the U.S. on June 27, 2001, with Fayez Banihammad, Saeed shared an apartment with Ahmed al-Nami in Delray Beach, Florida. Oddly, he listed the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, as his permanent address on his driver's license. He was one of 9 hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001. According to al-Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda's documentary Top Secret: The Road to September 11, three weeks prior to the attacks Saeed is believed to have used the name 'Abdul Rahman' to send a message to Ramzi bin al-Shibh (who was posing as a girlfriend) online, in which he wrote On September 7, all four of Flight 93 hijackers flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark International Airport aboard Spirit Airlines. Attacks Visa page from Saeed al-Ghamdi's Kingdom of Saudi Arabia passport recovered from the United Airlines Flight 93 crash site On the morning of September 11, 2001, Ghamdi boarded United Airlines Flight 93 without incident. Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day, and were told to be on the alert. Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well. At least two of the cell phone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas. The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was. The flight transcript suggests that at least two hijackers were in the cockpit. Ziad Jarrah was identified as the pilot and is heard calling another hijacker \\"Saeed\\",Flight 93 Cockpit Transcript at Wikisource indicating that Ghamdi, who also trained in flight simulators, was helping Jarrah with the controls.Relevant page of Wikisource transcript where Saeed is said twice Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising resulted in the plane crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing everyone aboard. Mistaken identity On September 23, 2001, before the FBI had released the pictures of the hijackers, the BBC and The Daily Telegraph reported that a Saudi Airlines pilot named Saeed al-Ghamdi was furious that a name on the hijacker's list released by the FBI matched his own. CNN also showed a picture of the \\"living\\" Ghamdi as the hijacker. The man claimed CNN likely got his picture from a Flight Safety flying school in Florida he attended. Der Spiegel later investigated the claims of \\"living\\" hijackers by the BBC and discovered them to be cases of mistaken identity. In June 2005 the Saudi government released a list (see al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) of 36 wanted (and alive) terrorists, one of whom was Salih Sa'id Al Batih al-Ghamdi. 9/11 conspiracy theorists quickly confused him with the hijacker Saeed al-Ghamdi. He has been portrayed by Iraqi actor Lewis Alsamari in United 93 and Shawn Ahmed in Flight 93.

In a letter to Melanchthon of April 22, 1519, Erasmus specifically adduced the Cretans of Plutarch as an example of his adage \\"Concord is a mighty rampart\\".  Social and political roles  The use of elephant-shaped column brackets in buildings of the Lahore Fort reflects Hindu influences on Mughal Architecture during the reign of Akbar. Islam forbids representation of living figures. Overt syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the \\"other\\" cult may survive or infiltrate without authorized syncresis. For example, some conversos developed a sort of cult for martyr-victims of the Spanish Inquisition, thus incorporating elements of Catholicism while resisting it. The Kushite kings who ruled Upper Egypt for approximately a century and the whole of Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BC, constituting the Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Manetho's Aegyptiaca, developed a syncretic worship identifying their own god Dedun with the Egyptian Osiris. They maintained that worship even after they had been driven out of Egypt. A temple dedicated to this syncretic god, built by the Kushite ruler Atlanersa, was unearthed at Jebel Barkal. Syncretism was common during the Hellenistic period, with rulers regularly identifying local deities in various parts of their domains with the relevant god or goddess of the Greek Pantheon as a means of increasing the cohesion of their kingdom. This practice was accepted in most locations but vehemently rejected by the Jews, who considered the identification of Yahweh with the Greek Zeus as the worst of blasphemy. The Roman Empire continued the practice, first by the identification of traditional Roman deities with Greek ones, producing a single Graeco-Roman pantheon, and then identifying members of that pantheon with the local deities of various Roman provinces. Allegedly, an undeclared form of syncretism was the transfer of many attributes of the goddess Isis, whose worship was widespread in the Later Roman Empire, to the Christian Virgin Mary. Some religious movements have embraced overt syncretism, such as the case of melding Shint≈ç beliefs into Buddhism or the supposed amalgamation of Germanic and Celtic pagan views into Christianity during its spread into Gaul, Ireland, Britain, Germany and Scandinavia. In later times, Christian missionaries in North America identified Manitou, the spiritual and fundamental life force in the traditional beliefs of the Algonquian groups, with the God of Christianity. Similar identifications were made by missionaries at other locations in the Americas and Africa whenever they encountered a local belief in a Supreme God or Supreme Spirit of some kind. Indian influences are seen in the practice of Shi'i Islam in Trinidad. Others have strongly rejected it as devaluing and compromising precious and genuine distinctions; examples include post-Exile Second Temple Judaism, Islam, and most of Protestant Christianity. Syncretism tends to facilitate co-existence and unity between otherwise l-different cultures and world views (intercultural competence), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multiethnic realms. Conversely, the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of \\"piety\\" and \\"orthodoxy\\", may help to generate, bolster or authenticate a sense of uncompromised cultural unity in a well-defined minority or majority.  Religious syncretism  Religious syncretism is the blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in a culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or (especially) practices. Religions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so- labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents who belong to \\"revealed\\" religious systems, such as the Abrahamic religions, or any system that exhibits an exclusivist approach. Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true. Indeed, critics of a syncretistic trend may use the word or its variants as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system pervert the original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Keith Ferdinando notes that the term \\"syncretism\\" is an elusive one, and can apply to refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of a religion by beliefs or practices introduced from elsewhere. The consequence under such a definition, according to Ferdinando, can lead to a fatal \\"compromise\\" of the original religion's \\"integrity\\". In modern secular society, religious innovators sometimes construct new faiths or key tenets syncretically, with the added benefit or aim of reducing inter-religious discord. Such chapters often have a side-effect of arousing jealousy and suspicion among authorities and ardent adherents of the pre-existing religion. Such religions tend to inherently appeal to an inclusive, diverse audience. Sometimes the state itself sponsored such new movements, such as the Living Church founded in Soviet Russia and the German Evangelical Church in Nazi Germany, chiefly to stem all outside influences. The god Hermanubis, an example of syncretism between Ancient Greek religion and Ancient Egyptian religion  Cultures and societies  According to some authors, \\"Syncretism is often used to describe the product of the large-scale imposition of one alien culture, religion, or body of practices over another that is already present.\\"Peter J. Claus and Margaret A. Mills, South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia: (Garland Publishing, Inc., 2003). Others such as Jerry H. Bentley, however, have argued that syncretism has also helped to create cultural compromise. It provides an opportunity to bring beliefs, values, and customs from one cultural tradition into contact with, and to engage different cultural traditions. Such a migration of ideas is generally successful only when there is a resonance between both traditions. While, as Bentley has argued, there are numerous cases where expansive traditions have won popular support in foreign lands, this is not always so.Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), viii. =Mogul Empire= In the 16th century a new religion called the Din-i Ilahi (literally, \\"Religion of God\\")Din-i Ilahi - Britannica Online Encyclopedia was propounded by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1582 CE, intending to merge some of the elements of the religions of his empire, and thereby reconcile the differences that divided his subjects. The elements were primarily drawn from Islam and Hinduism, but some others were also taken from Christianity, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism. Akbar the Great holding a court discussing Theology. More resembling a personality cult than a religion, it had no sacred scriptures, no priestly hierarchy, and fewer than 20 disciples, all hand-picked by Akbar himself. It is also accepted that the policy of sulh- i-kul, which formed the essence of the Dƒ´n-i IlƒÅhƒ´, was adopted by Akbar as a part of general imperial administrative policy. Sulh-i-kul means \\"universal peace\\". = During the Enlightenment = The modern, rational non-pejorative connotations of syncretism arguably date from Denis Diderot's Encyclop√©die articles: Eclecticisme and Syncr√©tistes, H√©notiques, ou Conciliateurs. Diderot portrayed syncretism as the concordance of eclectic sources. Scientific or legalistic approaches of subjecting all claims to critical thinking prompted at this time much literature in Europe and the Americas studying non-European religions such as Edward Moor's The Hindu Pantheon of 1810, much of which was almost evangelistically appreciative, embracing spirituality and creating the space and tolerance in particular disestablishment of religion (or its stronger form, official secularisation as in France) whereby believers of spiritualism, agnosticism, atheists and in many cases more innovative or pre- Abrahimic based religions could promote and spread their belief system, whether in the family or beyond.

The S7G designation stands for: * S = Submarine platform * 7 = Seventh reactor designed by the contractor * G = General Electric was the contracted designer This prototype design was a land-based nuclear reactor that did not use control rods. It was tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Modifications and Additions to a Reactor Facility (MARF) plant located at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory's Kesselring Site in Ballston Spa, New York. It consisted of an experimental reactor core installed in a modified S5W reactor plant. Design and operation Instead of the movable hafnium-based control rods used in all of the other United States Naval reactors, reactivity in the S7G core was controlled by stationary gadolinium-clad tubes partially filled with water. Water could be pumped from the portion of the tube inside the core up to a reservoir above the core, or allowed to flow back down into the tube. A higher water level in the tube slowed more neutrons in the core, causing more neutron capture by the gadolinium tube cladding rather than by the uranium fuel, thus lowering the power level. The system was configured with the pump running continually to keep the water level low; on loss of electrical power, all of the water would flow back into the tube, shutting down the reactor. As with all small pressurized water reactors, the design also had the advantage of negative feedback: an increase in reactor power caused the water to expand, leading to reduced thermalization of neutrons and lowering absorption by the fuel, therefore lowering the power. Thus, changes in the average coolant temperature, notably from the steam demand of engine throttles, naturally maintains reactor power without intervention from a reactor operator. The S7G reactor was never used on a ship. In the late 1980s the S7G core was replaced with the experimental DMC (Developmental Materials Core) References Category:United States naval reactors ","title":"S7G reactor"},{"id":"29617","text":"In linguistic typology, subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject (SVO) is a sentence structure where the subject comes first, the verb second, and the object third. Languages may be classified according to the dominant sequence of these elements in unmarked sentences (i.e., sentences in which an unusual word order is not used for emphasis). The label is often used for ergative languages that do not have subjects, but have an agent‚Äìverb‚Äìobject (AVO) order. English is included in this group. An example is \\"Sam ate oranges.\\" SVO is the second- most common order by number of known languages, after SOV. Together, SVO and SOV account for more than 75% of the world's languages. It is also the most common order developed in Creole languages, suggesting that it may be somehow more initially \\"obvious\\" to human psychology.Diamond, Jared. The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee. p. 143 Languages regarded as SVO include: All Bantu languages, Albanian, Arabic dialects, Assyrian, Bosnian, Chinese, English, Estonian, Finnish (but see below), French, Greek, Hausa, Icelandic (with the V2 restriction), Igbo, Italian, Javanese, Khmer, Latvian, Macedonian, Malay (Malaysian, Indonesian), Modern Hebrew, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Quiche, Reo Rapa, Romanian, Russian (but see below), Slovene, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish (with the V2 restriction), Thai and Lao, Ukrainian (but see below), Vietnamese and Yoruba. Ancient Greek has free syntactic order, though Classical Greeks tended to favor SOV. Many famous phrases are SVO, however. Properties Subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject languages almost always place relative clauses after the nouns which they modify and adverbial subordinators before the clause modified, with varieties of Chinese being notable exceptions. Although some subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject languages in West Africa, the best known being Ewe, use postpositions in noun phrases, the vast majority of them, such as English, have prepositions. Most subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject languages place genitives after the noun, but a significant minority, including the postpositional SVO languages of West Africa, the Hmong‚ÄìMien languages, some Sino-Tibetan languages, and European languages like Swedish, Danish, Lithuanian and Latvian have prenominal genitivesOrder of Genitive and Noun (as would be expected in an SOV language). Non-European languages, usually subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject languages, have a strong tendency to place adjectives, demonstratives and numerals after nouns that they modify, but Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Indonesian place numerals before nouns, as in English. Some linguists have come to view the numeral as the head in the E relationship to fit the rigid right-branching of these languages.Donohue, Mark; \\"Word order in Austronesian from north to south and west to east\\" in Linguistic Typology 11 (2007); p. 379 There is a strong tendency, as in English, for main verbs to be preceded by auxiliaries: I am thinking. He should reconsider. Sample sentences An example of SVO order in English is: :Andy ate cereal. In an analytic language such as English, subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject order is relatively inflexible because it identifies which part of the sentence is the subject and which one is the object. (\\"The dog bit Andy\\" and \\"Andy bit the dog\\" mean two completely different things, while, in case of \\"Bit Andy the dog\\", it may be difficult to determine whether it's a complete sentence or a fragment, with \\"Andy the dog\\" the object and an omitted/implied subject.) The situation is more complex in languages that have no word order imposed by their grammar; Russian, Finnish, Ukrainian, and Hungarian have both the VO and OV constructs in their common word order uses. In some languages, some word orders are considered more \\"natural\\" than others. In some, the order is the matter of emphasis. For example, Russian allows the use of subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject in any order and \\"shuffles\\" parts to bring up a slightly different contextual meaning each time. E.g. \\"–ª—é–±–∏—Ç –æ–Ω–∞ –µ–≥–æ\\" (loves she him) may be used to point out \\"she acts this way because she LOVES him\\", or \\"–µ–≥–æ –æ–Ω–∞ –ª—é–±–∏—Ç\\" (him she loves) is used in the context \\"if you pay attention, you'll see that HE is the one she truly loves\\", or \\"–µ–≥–æ –ª—é–±–∏—Ç –æ–Ω–∞\\" (him loves she) may appear along the lines \\"I agree that cat is a disaster, but since my wife adores it and I adore her...\\". Regardless of order, it is clear that \\"–µ–≥–æ\\" is the object because it is in the accusative case. In Polish, SVO order is basic in an affirmative sentence, and a different order is used to either emphasize some part of it or to adapt it to a broader context logic. For example, \\"Roweru ci nie kupiƒô\\" (I won't buy you a bicycle), \\"Od piƒÖtej czekam\\" (I've been waiting since five).Polish, An Essential Grammar by Dana Bielec (Routledge, 2007), p. 272 In Turkish, it is normal to use SOV, but SVO may be used sometimes to emphasize the verb. For example, \\"John terketti Mary'yi\\" (Lit. John/left/Mary: John left Mary) is the answer to the question \\"What did John do with Mary?\\" instead of the regular [SOV] sentence \\"John Mary'yi terketti\\" (Lit. John/Mary/left). In German, Dutch, and Kashmiri, SOV with V2 word order in main clauses coexists with SOV in subordinate clauses, as given in Example 1 below; and a change in syntax, such as by bringing an adpositional phrase to the front of the sentence for emphasis, may also dictate the use of VSO, as in Example 2. In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3. #\\"Er wei√ü da√ü ich jeden Sonntag das Auto wasche.\\"/\\"Hij weet dat ik elke zondag de auto was.\\" (German & Dutch respectively: \\"He knows that I wash the car each Sunday\\", lit. \\"He knows that I each Sunday the car wash\\".) Cf. the simple sentence \\"Ich wasche das Auto jeden Sonntag.\\"/ \\"Ik was de auto elke zondag.\\", \\"I wash the car each Sunday.\\" #\\"Jeden Sonntag wasche ich das Auto.\\"/\\"Elke zondag was ik de auto.\\" (German & Dutch respectively: \\"Each Sunday I wash the car.\\", lit. \\"Each Sunday wash I the car.\\"). \\"Ich wasche das Auto jeden Sonntag\\"/\\"Ik was de auto elke zondag\\" translates perfectly into English \\"I wash the car each Sunday\\", but as a result of changing the syntax, inversion SV->VS takes place. #\\"mye ees phyikyir yithi.ni tsi temyis ciThy dyikh\\" (Kashmiri: \\"I was afraid you might give him the letter\\", lit. \\"to.me was worry lest you to.him letter will.give\\"). If the embedded clause is introduced by the transparent conjunction zyi the SOV order changes to SVO. \\"mye ees phyikyir (zyi) tsi maa dyikh temyis ciThy\\". English developed from such a reordering language and still bears traces of this word order, for example in locative inversion (\\"In the garden sat a cat.\\") and some clauses beginning with negative expressions: \\"only\\" (\\"Only then do we find X.\\"), \\"not only\\" (\\"Not only did he storm away but also slammed the door.\\"), \\"under no circumstances\\" (\\"under no circumstances are the students allowed to use a mobile phone\\"), \\"never\\" (\\"Never have I done that.\\"), \\"on no account\\" and the like. In such cases, do- support is sometimes required, depending on the construction.

It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. \\"It is usually considered less abrasive and more melodic than thrash metal, showing less influence from hardcore punk. However, speed metal is usually faster and more aggressive than traditional heavy metal, also showing more inclination to virtuoso soloing and featuring short instrumental passages between couplets. Speed metal songs frequently make use of highly expressive vocals, but are usually less likely to employ 'harsh' vocals than thrash metal songs.\\" Origins =New wave of British heavy metal= One of the key influences on the development of speed metal was the new wave of British heavy metal, or NWOBHM. This was a heavy metal movement that started in the late 1970s, in Britain, and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. NWOBHM bands toned down the blues influences of earlier acts, incorporated elements of punk, increased the tempo, and adopted a \\"tougher\\" sound, taking a harder approach to its music. It was an era directed almost exclusively at heavy metal fans and is considered to be a major foundation stone for the extreme metal genres. The NWOBHM came to dominate the heavy metal scene of the early-mid-1980s. It was musically characterized by fast upbeat tempo songs, power chords, fast guitar solos and melodic, soaring vocals. Groups such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Venom, Saxon and Mot√∂rhead as well as many lesser- known ones, became part of the canon that influenced American bands that formed in the early eighties. =Other metal influences= Motorhead playing in 2005 Mot√∂rhead is often credited as the first band to play speed metal. Some of speed metal's earlier influences include Black Sabbath's \\"Children of the Grave\\" and \\"Symptom of the Universe\\", Budgie's \\"Breadfan\\" and Queen's \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" (the latter two were eventually covered by the thrash metal band Metallica), as well as certain Deep Purple songs such as \\"Speed King\\", \\"Fireball\\" and \\"Highway Star\\". The latter was called \\"early speed metal\\" by Robb Reiner of speed metal band Anvil. History The origin song for the genre was aptly named \\"Speed King\\" by Deep Purple. Recording on the song started in 1969 making it nearly a full decade ahead of the musical style being recognized. The song is not only very fast and technical but was also extremely loud creating noticeable distortion in the recording process. The title song for the band's next album, \\"Fireball\\", is a further refinement of the band's influence with drummer Ian Paice's use of the double bass. The way the double bass is played in \\"Fireball\\"‚Äîuptempo \\"four on the floor\\"‚Äîbecomes a mainstay in many Heavy, Speed and Thrash Metal songs in the years to come. This is the only Deep Purple song that employs the double bass, and video from the band shows them actually bring out the second bass as needed to play the song. While speedy, technical playing did not dominate Deep Purple's music, they clearly were the inventors of rock that was fast, technical and loud. Those characteristics would become the hallmarks of Speed Metal. Given the name of the origin song‚ÄîSpeed King‚Äîthey also probably played a role in the genre's naming. At the very least they acknowledged what they were doing which was a radical departure from all prior rock music. Black Sabbath are a British heavy metal band from Birmingham, England, and are often cited as one of the grandfathers of the genre. Though usually known for playing a fairly slow, sludgy tempo, \\"After Forever\\" is a very up-tempo song with a much faster pace than other songs in their catalogue. Still in certain other songs such as \\"Electric Funeral\\", \\"Into the Void\\" and \\"Under the Sun (Every Day Comes and Goes)\\" there is a section in the middle of the song that shifts away from the core music and plays a much faster pace than in the rest of the song, then returns to the original melody. There are those who believe that their song \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" from their 1975 release Sabotage album is the first true example of a speed metal song. Judas Priest are a British heavy metal band, also formed in Birmingham, England. They often played faster than most rock groups of the time and brought a more \\"metallic\\" sound to the guitars. Some songs, such as 1978's \\"Exciter\\", were groundbreaking for their sheer ferocity and speed; few, if any, bands exempting Mot√∂rhead played with the same tempo. Exciter (who took their name from the aforementioned Judas Priest song) is a Canadian speed metal band from Ottawa, Ontario, which was formed in 1978. They are widely considered to be one of the first speed metal bands and a seminal influence of the thrash metal genre. Anvil are another Canadian speed metal band, from Toronto, Ontario, who also formed in 1978. To date, the band has released seventeen studio albums, and has been cited as having influenced many notable thrash metal groups, including Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer and Megadeth. Accept is a German heavy metal band which played an important role in the development of speed and thrash metal, being part of the German heavy metal scene, which emerged in the early to mid-1980s. Of particular importance was their 1982 track \\"Fast as a Shark\\". Speed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal. Although many tend to equate the two subgenres, others argue that there is a distinct difference between them. In his book Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal, Ian Christe states that \\"...thrash metal relies more on long, wrenching rhythmic breaks, while speed metal... is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory, still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal.\\"* However, on the very next page, Christe calls speed metal a \\"subset of thrash metal\\" and argues that \\"There was little intrinsic difference between speed metal and thrash metal. With the sudden boom of fast, raging bands, however, it sometimes helped to distinguish between the throbbing, rhythm-heavy thrash metal and something a bit cleaner and more melodic--dubbed speed metal.\\"Christe 2004, p. 138. Regional differences Speed metal's sound varied between various regional scenes. European bands leaned towards the sound of bands like Venom and Mot√∂rhead. Japanese bands had a more melodic sound that resembled power metal. North American bands had a faster, more aggressive sound that would later influence the thrash metal movement.

Rogers was noted for his rich, baritone voice and his traditional-sounding songs which were frequently inspired by Canadian history and the daily lives of working people, especially those from the fishing villages of the Maritime provinces and, later, the farms of the Canadian prairies and Great Lakes.Edwards, Melissa. \\"The Stan Rogers Map of Canada\\". The Geist Atlas of Canada, Arsenal Pulp Press, Vancouver, BC. page 70. Rogers died in a fire aboard Air Canada Flight 797 on the ground at the Greater Cincinnati Airport at the age of 33. Early life and musical development Rogers was born in Hamilton, Ontario, the eldest son of Nathan Allison Rogers and Valerie (n√©e Bushell) Rogers, two Maritimers who had relocated to Ontario in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948. Although Rogers was raised in Binbrook, Ontario, he often spent summers visiting family in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia. It was there that he became familiar with the way of life in the Maritimes, an influence which was to have a profound impact on his subsequent musical development. He was interested in music from an early age, reportedly beginning to sing shortly after learning to speak. He received his first guitar, a miniature hand-built by his uncle Lee Bushell, when he was five years of age. He was exposed to a variety of music influences, but among the most lasting were the country and western tunes his uncles would sing during family get-togethers. Throughout his childhood, he would practice his singing and playing along with his brother Garnet, six years his junior. While Rogers was attending Saltfleet High School, Stoney Creek, Ontario, he started to meet other young people interested in folk music, although at this time he was dabbling in rock and roll, singing and playing bass guitar in garage bands such as \\"Stanley and the Living Stones\\" and \\"The Hobbits\\". After high school, Rogers briefly attended both McMaster University and Trent University, where he performed in small venues with other student musicians, including Ian Tamblyn, Chris Ward and fellow Hobbit Nigel Russell.\\"Hoot Heats Up\\". The Arthur, Volume II, No. 9. November 22, 1967. C. Hardess. Russell wrote the song \\"White Collar Holler\\", which Rogers sang frequently on stage.\\"Anglo-Canadian Occupational Songs\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, Edith Fowke 02/07/06 Rogers signed with RCA Records in 1970 and recorded two singles: \\"Here's to You Santa Claus\\" in 1970, and \\"The Fat Girl Rag\\" in 1971. In 1973, Rogers recorded three singles for Polygram: \\"Three Pennies\\", \\"Guysborough Train\\", and \\"Past Fifty.\\" In 1976, Rogers recorded his debut album, Fogarty's Cove, released in 1977 on Barnswallow Records. The album's subject matter dealt almost entirely with life in maritime Canada, and was an immediate success. Rogers then formed Fogarty's Cove Music, and bought Barnswallow during the production of Turnaround, allowing him to release his own albums. Posthumously, additional albums were released. Rogers' songs often had a Celtic feel which was due, in part, to his frequent use of DADGAD guitar tuning. He regularly used his William 'Grit' Laskin built 12-string guitar in his performances. His best-known pieces include \\"Northwest Passage\\", \\"Barrett's Privateers\\", \\"The Mary Ellen Carter\\", \\"Make and Break Harbour\\", \\"The Idiot\\", \\"Fogarty's Cove\\", and \\"White Squall\\". Death Rogers died alongside 22 other passengers most likely of smoke inhalation on June 2, 1983, while traveling on Air Canada Flight 797 (a McDonnell Douglas DC-9) after performing at the Kerrville Folk Festival. The airliner was flying from Dallas, Texas, to Toronto and Montreal when a fire of unknown ignition source within the vanity or toilet shroud of the aft washroom forced it to make an emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport in northern Kentucky. There were initially no visible flames, and after attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, smoke filled the cabin. Upon landing, the plane's doors were opened, allowing the five crew and 18 of the passengers to escape, but approximately 60 to 90 seconds into the evacuation the oxygen rushing in from outside caused a flash fire. Rogers had initially been one of the passengers to escape, but he at some point re-entered the plane to assist in the effort to help others escape. Legacy Rogers' legacy includes his recordings, songbook, and plays for which he was commissioned to write music. His songs are still frequently covered by other musicians, and are perennial favourites at Canadian campfires and song circles. Members of Rogers' band, including his brother Garnet Rogers, continue to be active performers and form a significant part of the fabric of contemporary Canadian folk music. Following his death, he was nominated for the 1984 Juno Awards in the category for Best Male Vocalist. That same year, he was posthumously awarded the Dipl√¥me d‚ÄôHonneur of the Canadian Conference of the Arts. In 1994, his posthumous live album Home in Halifax was likewise nominated for Best Roots and Traditional Album. His widow, Ariel, continues to oversee his estate and legacy. His music and lyrics have been featured in numerous written publications and films. For instance, his lyrics have appeared in school poetry books, taking their place alongside acknowledged classics. His song \\"Northwest Passage\\" was featured in the last episode of the TV show Due South, his songs \\"Barrett's Privateers\\" and \\"Watching the Apples Grow\\" having been previously featured. \\"Barrett's Privateers\\" has also been used extensively in promotion ads for Alexander Keith's ale. In the 2005 CTV made-for-TV movie on the life of Terry Fox, Rogers' \\"Turnaround\\" is the music over the closing shot. As the movie ends, Fox is depicted, alone, striding up a hill, while the lyric \\"And yours was the open road. The bitter song / The heavy load that I'll never share, tho' the offer's still there / Every time you turn around,\\" forges a link between these Canadian icons. Many of his songs on the albums Northwest Passage and From Fresh Water refer to events in Canadian history. Adrienne Clarkson, who, prior to serving as the Governor General of Canada from 1999 to 2005, had worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, highlighted Rogers' career in a 1989 television documentary called One Warm Line on CBC Television; she also quoted Rogers in her investitural address. When CBC's Peter Gzowski asked Canadians to pick an alternate national anthem, \\"Northwest Passage\\" was the overwhelming choice. The Stan Rogers Folk Festival is held every year in Canso, Nova Scotia. In 1995, several artists performed two nights of concerts at Halifax's Rebecca Cohn Auditorium, which were released on album that year as Remembering Stan Rogers. Rogers is also a lasting fixture of the Canadian folk festival Summerfolk, held annually in Owen Sound, Ontario, where the main stage and amphitheater are dedicated as the \\"Stan Rogers Memorial Canopy\\". The festival is firmly fixed in tradition, with Rogers' song \\"The Mary Ellen Carter\\" being sung by all involved, including the audience and a medley of acts at the festival. At The Canmore Folk Festival, Alberta's longest running folk music festival, performers take to the Stan Rogers Memorial Stage, which is the festival's main stage. Stan's son, Nathan Rogers, is also an established Canadian folk artist with a voice and lyrical acumen similar to his father's. He has released two critically acclaimed solo discs and tours internationally as a solo act and in the trio Dry Bones.

The Sierpi≈Ñski carpet is a plane fractal first described by Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski in 1916. The carpet is one generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions; another is the Cantor dust. The technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself, removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended to other shapes. For instance, subdividing an equilateral triangle into four equilateral triangles, removing the middle triangle, and recursing leads to the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. In three dimensions, a similar construction based on cubes is known as the Menger sponge. Construction The construction of the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet begins with a square. The square is cut into 9 congruent subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, and the central subsquare is removed. The same procedure is then applied recursively to the remaining 8 subsquares, ad infinitum. It can be realised as the set of points in the unit square whose coordinates written in base three do not both have a digit '1' in the same position. The process of recursively removing squares is an example of a finite subdivision rule. 122px 122px 122px 122px 122px 122px Properties Variant of the Peano curve with the middle line erased creates a Sierpi≈Ñski carpet The area of the carpet is zero (in standard Lebesgue measure). :Proof: Denote as the area of iteration . Then . So , which tends to 0 as goes to infinity. The interior of the carpet is empty. :Proof: Suppose by contradiction that there is a point in the interior of the carpet. Then there is a square centered at which is entirely contained in the carpet. This square contains a smaller square whose coordinates are multiples of for some . But, this square must have been holed in iteration , so it cannot be contained in the carpet ‚Äì a contradiction. The Hausdorff dimension of the carpet is . Sierpi≈Ñski demonstrated that his carpet is a universal plane curve. That is: the Sierpinski carpet is a compact subset of the plane with Lebesgue covering dimension 1, and every subset of the plane with these properties is homeomorphic to some subset of the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet. This 'universality' of the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet is not a true universal property in the sense of category theory: it does not uniquely characterize this space up to homeomorphism. For example, the disjoint union of a Sierpi≈Ñski carpet and a circle is also a universal plane curve. However, in 1958 Gordon Whyburn uniquely characterized the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet as follows: any curve that is locally connected and has no 'local cut-points' is homeomorphic to the Sierpinski carpet. Here a local cut-point is a point for which some connected neighborhood of has the property that is not connected. So, for example, any point of the circle is a local cut point. In the same paper Whyburn gave another characterization of the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet. Recall that a continuum is a nonempty connected compact metric space. Suppose is a continuum embedded in the plane. Suppose its complement in the plane has countably many connected components and suppose: * the diameter of goes to zero as ; * the boundary of and the boundary of are disjoint if ; * the boundary of is a simple closed curve for each ; * the union of the boundaries of the sets is dense in . Then is homeomorphic to the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet. Brownian motion on the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet The topic of Brownian motion on the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet has attracted interest in recent years. Martin Barlow and Richard Bass have shown that a random walk on the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet diffuses at a slower rate than an unrestricted random walk in the plane. The latter reaches a mean distance proportional to after steps, but the random walk on the discrete Sierpi≈Ñski carpet reaches only a mean distance proportional to for some . They also showed that this random walk satisfies stronger large deviation inequalities (so called \\"sub-Gaussian inequalities\\") and that it satisfies the elliptic Harnack inequality without satisfying the parabolic one. The existence of such an example was an open problem for many years. Wallis sieve Third iteration of the Wallis sieve A variation of the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet, called the Wallis sieve, starts in the same way, by subdividing the unit square into nine smaller squares and removing the middle of them. At the next level of subdivision, it subdivides each of the squares into 25 smaller squares and removes the middle one, and it continues at the th step by subdividing each square into (the odd squares) smaller squares and removing the middle one. By the Wallis product, the area of the resulting set is , unlike the standard Sierpi≈Ñski carpet which has zero limiting area. However, by the results of Whyburn mentioned above, we can see that the Wallis sieve is homeomorphic to the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet. In particular, its interior is still empty.  Applications  Mobile phone and WiFi fractal antennas have been produced in the form of few iterations of the Sierpi≈Ñski carpet. Due to their self- similarity and scale invariance, they easily accommodate multiple frequencies. They are also easy to fabricate and smaller than conventional antennas of similar performance, thus being optimal for pocket-sized mobile phones.

The columns interpreted as binary numbers give 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 51... The Sierpi≈Ñski triangle (sometimes spelled Sierpinski), also called the Sierpi≈Ñski gasket or Sierpi≈Ñski sieve, is a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self- similar sets‚Äîthat is, it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpi≈Ñski.  Constructions  There are many different ways of constructing the Sierpinski triangle. = Removing triangles = The evolution of the Sierpinski triangle The Sierpinski triangle may be constructed from an equilateral triangle by repeated removal of triangular subsets: # Start with an equilateral triangle. # Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove the central triangle. # Repeat step 2 with each of the remaining smaller triangles infinitely. Each removed triangle (a trema) is topologically an open set.\\"Sierpinski Gasket by Trema Removal\\" This process of recursively removing triangles is an example of a finite subdivision rule. = Shrinking and duplication = The same sequence of shapes, converging to the Sierpinski triangle, can alternatively be generated by the following steps: #Start with any triangle in a plane (any closed, bounded region in the plane will actually work). The canonical Sierpinski triangle uses an equilateral triangle with a base parallel to the horizontal axis (first image). #Shrink the triangle to height and width, make three copies, and position the three shrunken triangles so that each triangle touches the two other triangles at a corner (image 2). Note the emergence of the central hole‚Äîbecause the three shrunken triangles can between them cover only of the area of the original. (Holes are an important feature of Sierpinski's triangle.) #Repeat step 2 with each of the smaller triangles (image 3 and so on). Note that this infinite process is not dependent upon the starting shape being a triangle‚Äîit is just clearer that way. The first few steps starting, for example, from a square also tend towards a Sierpinski triangle. Michael Barnsley used an image of a fish to illustrate this in his paper \\"V-variable fractals and superfractals.\\"NOVA (public television program). The Strange New Science of Chaos (episode). Public television station WGBH Boston. Aired 31 January 1989. Iterating from a square The actual fractal is what would be obtained after an infinite number of iterations. More formally, one describes it in terms of functions on closed sets of points. If we let dA denote the dilation by a factor of about a point A, then the Sierpinski triangle with corners A, B, and C is the fixed set of the transformation dA ‚à™ dB ‚à™ dC. This is an attractive fixed set, so that when the operation is applied to any other set repeatedly, the images converge on the Sierpinski triangle. This is what is happening with the triangle above, but any other set would suffice. = Chaos game = Animated creation of a Sierpinski triangle using the chaos game If one takes a point and applies each of the transformations dA, dB, and dC to it randomly, the resulting points will be dense in the Sierpinski triangle, so the following algorithm will again generate arbitrarily close approximations to it:. Start by labeling p1, p2 and p3 as the corners of the Sierpinski triangle, and a random point v1. Set , where rn is a random number 1, 2 or 3. Draw the points v1 to v‚àû. If the first point v1 was a point on the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle, then all the points vn lie on the Sierpinski triangle. If the first point v1 to lie within the perimeter of the triangle is not a point on the Sierpinski triangle, none of the points vn will lie on the Sierpinski triangle, however they will converge on the triangle. If v1 is outside the triangle, the only way vn will land on the actual triangle, is if vn is on what would be part of the triangle, if the triangle was infinitely large. Animated construction of a Sierpinski triangle A Sierpinski Triangle is outlined by a fractal tree with three branches forming an angle of 60¬∞ between each other. If the angle is reduced, the triangle can be continuously transformed into a fractal resembling a tree. tree with n levels (if n=‚àû then the tree is also a fractal); T=top/center, L=left, R=right, and these sequences can represent both the deterministic form and, \\"a series of moves in the chaos game\\"Peitgen, Heinz-Otto; J√ºrgens, Hartmut; Saupe, Dietmar; Maletsky, Evan; Perciante, Terry; and Yunker, Lee (1991). Fractals for the Classroom: Strategic Activities Volume One, p.39. Springer-Verlag, New York. and . Or more simply: # Take three points in a plane to form a triangle, you need not draw it. # Randomly select any point inside the triangle and consider that your current position. # Randomly select any one of the three vertex points. # Move half the distance from your current position to the selected vertex. # Plot the current position. # Repeat from step 3. This method is also called the chaos game, and is an example of an iterated function system. You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpinski Gasket with a few leftover points (if the starting point lies on the outline of the triangle, there are no leftover points). With pencil and paper, a brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred. An interactive version of the chaos game can be found here. Sierpinski triangle using an iterated function system = Arrowhead construction of Sierpinski gasket = Animated arrowhead construction of Sierpinski gasket Arrowhead construction of the Sierpinski gasket Another construction for the Sierpinski gasket shows that it can be constructed as a curve in the plane. It is formed by a process of repeated modification of simpler curves, analogous to the construction of the Koch snowflake: # Start with a single line segment in the plane # Repeatedly replace each line segment of the curve with three shorter segments, forming 120¬∞ angles at each junction between two consecutive segments, with the first and last segments of the curve either parallel to the original line segment or forming a 60¬∞ angle with it. At every iteration, this construction gives a continuous curve. In the limit, these approach a curve that traces out the Sierpenski triangle by a single continuous directed (infinitely wiggly) path, which is called the Sierpinski arrowhead.. In fact, the aim of the original article by Sierpinski of 1915, was to show an example of a curve (a Cantorian curve), as the title of the article itself declares. = Cellular automata = The Sierpinski triangle also appears in certain cellular automata (such as Rule 90), including those relating to Conway's Game of Life. For instance, the Life-like cellular automaton B1/S12 when applied to a single cell will generate four approximations of the Sierpinski triangle.. A very long one cell thick line in standard life will create two mirrored Sierpinski triangles. The time-space diagram of a replicator pattern in a cellular automaton also often resembles a Sierpinski triangle, such as that of the common replicator in HighLife.. The Sierpinski triangle can also be found in the Ulam-Warburton automaton and the Hex-Ulam-Warburton automaton. =Pascal's triangle= A level-5 approximation to a Sierpinski triangle obtained by shading the first 25 (32) levels of a Pascal's triangle white if the binomial coefficient is even and black otherwise If one takes Pascal's triangle with 2n rows and colors the even numbers white, and the odd numbers black, the result is an approximation to the Sierpinski triangle. More precisely, the limit as n approaches infinity of this parity-colored 2n-row Pascal triangle is the Sierpinski triangle.. =Towers of Hanoi= The Towers of Hanoi puzzle involves moving disks of different sizes between three pegs, maintaining the property that no disk is ever placed on top of a smaller disk. The states of an n-disk puzzle, and the allowable moves from one state to another, form an undirected graph, the Hanoi graph, that can be represented geometrically as the intersection graph of the set of triangles remaining after the nth step in the construction of the Sierpinski triangle. Thus, in the limit as n goes to infinity, this sequence of graphs can be interpreted as a discrete analogue of the Sierpinski triangle.. Properties For integer number of dimensions d, when doubling a side of an object, 2d copies of it are created, i.e. 2 copies for 1-dimensional object, 4 copies for 2-dimensional object and 8 copies for 3-dimensional object. For the Sierpinski triangle, doubling its side creates 3 copies of itself. Thus the Sierpinski triangle has Hausdorff dimension = log2 3 ‚âà 1.585, which follows from solving 2d = 3 for d. The area of a Sierpinski triangle is zero (in Lebesgue measure). The area remaining after each iteration is of the area from the previous iteration, and an infinite number of iterations results in an area approaching zero.. The points of a Sierpinski triangle have a simple characterization in barycentric coordinates. If a point has coordinates (0.u1u2u3‚Ä¶, 0.v1v2v3‚Ä¶, 0.w1w2w3‚Ä¶), expressed as binary numerals, then the point is in Sierpinski's triangle if and only if for all i. Generalization to other moduli A generalization of the Sierpinski triangle can also be generated using Pascal's triangle if a different Modulo is used. Iteration n can be generated by taking a Pascal's triangle with Pn rows and coloring numbers by their value for x mod P. As n approaches infinity, a fractal is generated. The same fractal can be achieved by dividing a triangle into a tessellation of P2 similar triangles and removing the triangles that are upside-down from the original, then iterating this step with each smaller triangle. Conversely, the fractal can also be generated by beginning with a triangle and duplicating it and arranging of the new figures in the same orientation into a larger similar triangle with the vertices of the previous figures touching, then iterating that step. Analogues in higher dimensions A Sierpinski square-based pyramid and its 'inverse' Sierpinski pyramid recursion progression (7 steps) A Sierpi≈Ñski triangle-based pyramid as seen from above (4 main sections highlighted). Note the self-similarity in this 2-dimensional projected view, so that the resulting triangle could be a 2D fractal in itself. The Sierpinski tetrahedron or tetrix is the three- dimensional analogue of the Sierpinski triangle, formed by repeatedly shrinking a regular tetrahedron to one half its original height, putting together four copies of this tetrahedron with corners touching, and then repeating the process. A tetrix constructed from an initial tetrahedron of side-length L has the property that the total surface area remains constant with each iteration. The initial surface area of the (iteration-0) tetrahedron of side-length L is L2. The next iteration consists of four copies with side length , so the total area is 4()2 = 4L2¬∑ = L2 again. Meanwhile the volume of the construction is halved at every step and therefore approaches zero. The limit of this process has neither volume nor surface but, like the Sierpinski gasket, is an intricately connected curve. Its Hausdorff dimension is = 2\\\\. If all points are projected onto a plane that is parallel to two of the outer edges, they exactly fill a square of side length without overlap.

However, similar patterns appear already in the 13th-century Cosmati mosaics in the cathedral of Anagni, Italy, and other places of central Italy, for carpets in many places such as the nave of the Roman Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin,\\"Geometric floor mosaic (Sierpinski triangles), nave of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Forum Boarium, Rome\\", 5 September 2011, Flickr and for isolated triangles positioned in rotae in several churches and basilicas. In the case of the isolated triangle, the iteration is at least of three levels. A medieval triangle, with historically certain dating has been studied recently. It is in porphiry and golden leaf, isolated, level 4 iteration The Apollonian gasket was first described by Apollonius of Perga (3rd century BC) and further analyzed by Gottfried Leibniz (17th century), and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. Etymology The usage of the word \\"gasket\\" to refer to the Sierpinski triangle refers to gaskets such as are found in motors, and which sometimes feature a series of holes of decreasing size, similar to the fractal; this usage was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot, who thought the fractal looked similar to \\"the part that prevents leaks in motors\\".

Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound (or, more generally, one phonetic feature value) by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be environmentally conditioned, meaning that the change only occurs in a defined sound environment, whereas in other environments the same speech sound is not affected by the change. The term \\"sound change\\" refers to diachronic changes‚Äîthat is, changes in a language's sound system over time; \\"alternation\\", on the other hand, refers to changes that happen synchronically (i.e. within the language of an individual speaker, depending on the neighboring sounds) and which do not change the language's underlying system (for example, the -s in the English plural can be pronounced differently depending on what sound it follows, as in bet[s], bed[z]; this is a form of alternation, rather than sound change). However, since \\"sound change\\" can refer to the historical introduction of an alternation (such as post-vocalic /k/ in Tuscan‚Äîonce [k] as in di [k]arlo 'of Carlo', but now [h] di [h]arlo, alternating with [k] in other positions: con [k]arlo 'with Carlo')‚Äîthe label is inherently imprecise and often must be clarified as referring to phonemic change or restructuring. Research on sound change is usually conducted on the working assumption that it is regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors (such as the meaning of the words affected). However, apparent exceptions to regular change can occur‚Äîdue to dialect borrowing, grammatical analogy, or other causes known and unknown‚Äîand some changes are described as \\"sporadic\\", meaning that they affect only one particular word or a few words, without any apparent regularity. The Neogrammarian linguists of the 19th century introduced the term \\"sound law\\" to refer to rules of regular change, perhaps in imitation of the laws of physics,Sihler, p. 50 and the term \\"law\\" is still used in referring to specific sound rules named after their authors, such as Grimm's Law, Grassmann's Law, etc. Real-world sound changes often admit exceptions; nevertheless, the expectation of their regularity or absence of exceptions is of great heuristic value, since it allows historical linguists to define the notion of regular correspondence (see: comparative method). Each sound change is limited in space and time. This means it functions within a limited area (within certain dialects) and during a limited period of time. For these (and other) reasons, the term \\"sound law\\" has been criticized for implying a universality that is unrealistic with regard to sound change.For example by \\"[t]he French phoneticians and the Fino-Ugric linguists\\", according to Anttila, p. 85. Sound change that affects the phonological system, in the number or distribution of its phonemes, is covered more fully at phonological change. Formal notation A statement of the form ::A > B is to be read, \\"sound A changes into (or is replaced by, is reflected as, etc) sound B\\". Therefore, A belongs to an older stage of the language in question, whereas B belongs to a more recent stage. The symbol \\">\\" can be reversed, B < A, still meaning that the (more recent) B derives from the (older) A\\". For example, ::POc. *t > Rot. f :means that \\"Proto-Oceanic language (POc.) *t is reflected as the Voiceless labiodental fricative in the Rotuman language (Rot.).\\" The two sides of such a statement indicate start and end points only, and do not imply that there are no additional intermediate stages. The example above is actually a compressed account of a sequence of changes; *t changed first into a voiceless dental fricative (like the initial consonant of English thin), which has yielded present-day [f]. This can be represented more fully as: :: t > > f Unless a change operates unconditionally (in all environments), the context in which it applies must be specified: ::A > B /X__Y := \\"A changes to B when preceded by X and followed by Y.\\" For example: ::It. b > v /[vowel]__[vowel], which can be simplified to just ::It. b > v /V__V (where the capital V stands for any given vowel) := \\"Intervocalic [b] (inherited from Latin) became [v] in Italian\\" (e.g. in caballum, dƒìbet > cavallo 'horse', deve 'owe (3sg.)' A second example: ::PIr. [‚àícont][‚àívoi] > [+cont]/__[C][+cont] := \\"Preconsonantal voiceless non-continuants (i.e. voiceless stops) changed into corresponding voiceless continuants (fricatives) in Proto-Iranian (PIr)\\" when immediately followed by a continuant consonant (i.e. resonants and fricatives). Examples: Proto-Indo-Iranian *pra 'forth' > Avestan fra; *trayas \\"three\\" (masc.nom.pl.)> Av. Œ∏ray≈ç; *ƒçatwƒÅras \\"four\\" (masc.nom.pl.) > Av. ƒçaŒ∏wƒÅr≈ç; *p≈õaws \\"of a cow\\" (nom. *pa≈õu) > Av. f≈°ƒÅo≈° (nom. pasu). Note that the fricativization does not occur before stops, so *sapta \\"seven\\" > Av. hapta. (However, in the variety of Iranian that led to Old Persian, fricativization occurs in all clusters, thus Old Persian hafta \\"seven\\".) The symbol \\"#\\" stands for a word boundary (initial or final). Thus the notation \\"/__#\\" means \\"word- finally\\", and \\"/#__\\" means \\"word-initially\\". For example: ::Gk. [stop] > ‚àÖ /__# := \\"Word-final stops were deleted in Greek (Gk.).\\" This can be simplified to ::Gk. P > ‚àÖ / __# where capital P stands for any plosive. Principles The following statements are used as heuristics in formulating sound changes as understood within the Neogrammarian model. However, for modern linguistics, they are not taken as inviolable rules; rather, they are seen as guidelines. Sound change has no memory: Sound change does not discriminate between the sources of a sound. If a previous sound change causes X,Y > Y (features X and Y merge as Y), a new one cannot affect only an original X. Sound change ignores grammar: A sound change can only have phonological constraints, like X > Z in unstressed syllables. For example, it cannot only affect adjectives. The only exception to this is that a sound change may or may not recognise word boundaries, even when they are not indicated by prosodic clues. Also, sound changes may be regularized in inflectional paradigms (such as verbal inflection), in which case the change is no longer phonological but morphological in nature.See Hill, Nathan W. (2014) 'Grammatically conditioned sound change.' Language and Linguistics Compass, 8 (6). pp. 211-229. Sound change is exceptionless: if a sound change can happen at a place, it will. It affects all sounds that meet the criteria for change. Apparent exceptions are possible, due to analogy and other regularization processes, or another sound change, or an unrecognized conditioning factor. This is the traditional view, expressed by the Neogrammarians. In past decades it has been shown that sound change does not necessarily affect all the words that in principle it could. However, when a sound change is initiated, it often expands to the whole lexicon given enough time, though not always. For example, in Spanish the fronting of the Vulgar Latin [g] (voiced velar stop) before [i e …õ] seems to have reached every possible word it could. By contrast, the voicing of word- initial Latin [k] to [g] occurred in colaphus > golpe and cattus > gato, but not in canna > ca√±a. See also lexical diffusion. Sound change is inevitable: All languages vary from place to place and time to time, and neither writing nor media prevent this change. Terms for changes in pronunciation In historical linguistics, a number of traditional terms designate types of phonetic change, either by nature or result. A number of such types are often (or usually) sporadic, that is, more or less accidents that happen to a specific form. Others affect a whole phonological system. Sound changes that affect a whole phonological system are also classified according to how they affect the overall shape of the system; see phonological change. * Assimilation: One sound becomes more like another, or (much more rarely) two sounds become more like each other. Example: in Latin the prefix *kom- becomes con- before an apical stop () or : contactus \\"touched\\", condere \\"to found, establish\\", conn≈´bium \\"legal marriage\\". The great majority of assimilations take place between contiguous segments, and the great majority involve the earlier sound becoming more like the later one (e.g. in conn≈´bium, m- + n becomes -nn- rather than -mm-). Assimilation between contiguous segments are (diachronically speaking) exceptionless sound laws rather than sporadic, isolated changes. * Dissimilation: The opposite of assimilation. One sound becomes less like another, or (much more rarely) two sounds become less like each other. Examples: Classical Latin quƒ´nque \\"five\\" > Vulgar Latin *kink ∑e (whence French cinq, Italian cinque, etc.); Old Spanish omne \\"man\\" > Spanish hombre. The great majority of dissimilations involve segments that are not contiguous, but, as with assimilations, the great majority involve an earlier sound changing with reference to a later one. Dissimilation is usually a sporadic phenomenon, but Grassmann's Law (in Sanskrit and Greek) exemplifies a systematic dissimilation. If the change of a sequence of fricatives such that one becomes a stop is dissimilation, then such changes as Proto-Germanic *hs to (spelled x) in English would count as a regular sound law: PGmc. *sehs \\"six\\" > Old English siex, etc. * Metathesis: Two sounds switch places. Example: Old English thridda became Middle English third. Most such changes are sporadic, but occasionally a sound law is involved, as Romance *tl > Spanish ld, thus *kapitlu, *titlu \\"chapter (of a cathedral)\\", \\"tittle\\" > Spanish cabildo, tilde. Metathesis can take place between non-contiguous segments, as Greek am√©lg≈ç \\"I milk\\" > Modern Greek arm√©g≈ç. * Lenition, softening of a consonant, e.g. stop consonant to affricate or fricative; and its antonym fortition, hardening of a consonant. * Tonogenesis: Syllables come to have distinctive pitch contours. * Sandhi: conditioned changes that take place at word-boundaries but not elsewhere. It can be morpheme-specific, as in the loss of the vowel in the enclitic forms of English is , with subsequent change of to adjacent to a voiceless consonant Frank's not here . Or a small class of elements, such as the assimilation of the of English the, this and that to a preceding (including the of and when the is elided) or : all the often , in the often , and so on. As in these examples, such features are rarely indicated in standard orthography. In a striking exception, Sanskrit orthography reflects a wide variety of such features; thus, tat \\"that\\" is written tat, tac, taj, tad, or tan depending on what the first sound of the next word is. These are all assimilations, but medial sequences do not assimilate the same way. * Haplology: The loss of a syllable when an adjacent syllable is similar or (rarely) identical. Example: Old English Englaland became Modern English England, or the common pronunciation of probably as . This change usually affects commonly used words. The word haplology itself is sometimes jokingly pronounced \\"haplogy\\". * Elision, aphaeresis, syncope, and apocope: all losses of sounds. Elision is the loss of unstressed sounds, aphaeresis the loss of initial sounds, syncope is the loss of medial sounds, and apocope is the loss of final sounds. ** Elision examples: in the southeastern United States, unstressed schwas tend to drop, so \\"American\\" is not but . Standard English is possum < opossum. ** Syncope examples: the Old French word for \\"state\\" is estat, but the s disappeared, yielding √©tat. Similarly, the loss of in English soften, hasten, castle, etc. ** Apocope examples: the final -e in Middle English words was pronounced, but is only retained in spelling as a silent E. In English and were apocopated in final position after nasals: lamb, long . * Epenthesis (also known as anaptyxis): The introduction of a sound between two adjacent sounds. Examples: Latin humilis > English humble; in Slavic an -l- intrudes between a labial and a following yod, as *zemya \\"land\\" > Russian zemlya (–∑–µ–º–ª—è). Most commonly, epenthesis is in the nature of a \\"transitional\\" consonant, but vowels may be epenthetic: non-standard English film in two syllables, athlete in three. Epenthesis can be regular, as when the Indo-European \\"tool\\" suffix *-tlom everywhere becomes Latin -culum (so speculum \\"mirror\\" < *spe·∏±tlom, p≈çculum \\"drinking cup\\" < *poH3-tlom). Some scholars reserve the term epenthesis for \\"intrusive\\" vowels and use excrescence for intrusive consonants. * Prothesis: The addition of a sound at the beginning of a word. Example: word-initial + stop clusters in Latin gained a preceding in Old Spanish and Old French; hence, the Spanish word for \\"state\\" is estado, deriving from Latin status. * Nasalization: Vowels followed by nasal consonants can become nasalized. If the nasal consonant is lost but the vowel retains its nasalized pronunciation, nasalization becomes phonemic, that is, distinctive. Example: French \\"-in\\" words used to be pronounced , but are now pronounced , and the is no longer pronounced (except in cases of liaison). Examples of specific historical sound changes * Umlaut * Grimm's law * Grassmann's law * Verner's law * Great Vowel Shift (English) * High German consonant shift * Slavic palatalization * Canaanite shift * Anglo-Frisian nasal spirant law * Kluge's law * Dahl's law * Sound change in Japanese Notes References * Anttila, Raimo (1989).

He is known for his chronicle of sacred history, as well as his biography of Saint Martin of Tours. Life Almost all that we know of Severus' life comes from a few allusions in his own writings, some passages in the letters of his friend Paulinus, bishop of Nola, and a short biography by the historian Gennadius of Massilia. Born of noble parents in Aquitaine, Severus enjoyed excellent educational advantages. He was imbued with the culture of his time and of his country, a center of Latin letters and learning. He studied jurisprudence in Burdigala (Moderne Bordeaux) and was renowned as an eloquent lawyer; his knowledge of Roman law is reflected in parts of his writings. He married the daughter of a wealthy consular family, who died young, leaving him no children. At this time Severus came under the powerful influence of Saint Martin, bishop of Tours, by whom he was led to devote his wealth to the Christian poor, and his own powers to a life of good works and the contemplative vision of God. This choice incurred his father's displeasure, but was encouraged in his determination by his mother-in-law. To use the words of his friend Paulinus, he broke with his father, followed Christ, and set the teachings of the \\"fishermen\\" far above all his \\"Tullian learning.\\" He rose to no higher rank in the church than that of presbyter. His ordination is vouched for by Gennadius, but no details of his priestly activity have reached us. He is said to have been led away in his old age by Pelagianism, but to have repented and inflicted long-enduring penance on himself. His time was passed chiefly in the neighbourhood of Toulouse, and such literary efforts as he permitted to himself were made in the interests of Christianity. In many respects no two men could be more unlike than Severus, the scholar and orator, well versed in the ways of the world, and Martin, the rough Pannonian bishop, champion of the monastic life, seer and worker of miracles. Yet the spirit of the rugged saint subdued that of the polished scholar, and the works of Severus are important because they reflect the ideas, influence and aspirations of Martin, the foremost ecclesiastic of Gaul.J. S. Reid, in 1902 Encyclopedia (from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica), accessed 14 May 2016 Works Page from the Vita Sancti Martini by Sulpicius Severus, written in Carolingian minuscule. Biblioth√®que nationale de France. =Chronicle= The chief work of Severus is the Chronicle (Chronica, Chronicorum Libri duo or Historia sacra, c. 403), a summary of sacred history from the beginning of the world to his own times, with the omission of the events recorded in the Gospels and the Acts, \\"lest the form of his brief work should detract from the honour due to those events\\". It is a source of primary importance for the history of Priscillianism and contains considerable information respecting the Arian controversy. The book was a textbook, and was used as such in the schools of Europe for about a century and a half after the editio princeps was published by Flacius Illyricus in 1556. Severus nowhere clearly points to the class of readers for whom his book is designed. He disclaims the intention of making his work a substitute for the actual narrative contained in the Bible. \\"Worldly historians\\" had been used by him, he says, to make clear the dates and the connexion of events and for supplementing the sacred sources, and with the intent at once to instruct the unlearned and to \\"convince\\" the learned. Probably the \\"unlearned\\" are the mass of Christians and the learned are the cultivated Christians and pagans alike, to whom the rude language of the sacred texts, whether in Greek or Latin, would be distasteful. The literary structure of the narrative shows that Severus had in his mind principally readers on the same level of culture with himself. He was anxious to show that sacred history might be presented in a form which lovers of Sallust and Tacitus could appreciate and enjoy. The style is lucid and almost classical. Though phrases and even sentences from many classical authors are inwoven here and there, the narrative flows easily, with no trace of the jolts and jerks which offend us in almost every line of an imitator of the classics like Sidonius. It is free from useless digressions. In order that his work might fairly stand beside that of the old Latin writers, Severus ignored the allegorical methods of interpreting sacred history to which the heretics and the orthodox of his age were wedded. As an authority for times antecedent to his own, Severus is of little moment. At only a few points does he enable us to correct or supplement other records. Jakob Bernays suggested that he based his narrative of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus on the account given by Tacitus in his Histories, a portion of which has been lost. In his allusions to the Gentile rulers with whom the Jews came into contact from the time of the Maccabees onwards, Severus discloses some points which are not without importance. The real interest of his work lies, first, in the incidental glimpses it affords all through of the history of his own time; next and more particularly, in the information he has preserved concerning the struggle over the Priscillianist heresy, which disorganized and degraded the churches of Spain and Gaul, and particularly affected Aquitaine. The sympathies here betrayed by Severus are wholly those of St. Martin. The bishop had withstood Maximus, who ruled for some years a large part of the western portion of the empire, though he never conquered Italy. He had reproached him with attacking and overthrowing his predecessors on the throne, and for his dealings with the church. Severus loses no opportunity for laying stress on the crimes and follies of rulers, and on their cruelty, though he once declares that, cruel as rulers could be, priests could be crueller still. This last statement has reference to the bishops who had left Maximus no peace till he had stained his hands with the blood of Priscillian and his followers. Martin, too, had denounced the worldliness and greed of the Gaulish bishops and clergy. Accordingly we find that Severus, in narrating the division of Canaan among the tribes, calls the special attention of ecclesiastics to the fact that no portion of the land was assigned to the tribe of Levi, lest they should be hindered in their service of God. \\"Our clergy seem\\", he says, \\"not merely forgetful of the lesson but ignorant of it, such a passion for possessions has in our days fastened like a pestilence on their souls.\\" We here catch a glimpse of the circumstances which were winning over good men to monasticism in the West, though the evidence of an enthusiastic votary of the solitary life, such as Severus was, is probably not free from exaggeration. Severus also fully sympathized with the action of St. Martin touching Priscillianism. This mysterious Western offshoot of Gnosticism had no single feature about it which could soften the hostility of a character such as Martin's, but he resisted the introduction of secular punishment for evil doctrine, and withdrew from communion with those bishops in Gaul, a large majority, who invoked the aid of Maximus against their erring brethren. In this connection, the account given by Severus of the Council of Rimini in 359, where the question arose whether the bishops attending the assembly might lawfully receive money from the imperial treasury to recoup their travelling and other expenses, is notable. Severus evidently approved the action of the British and Gaulish bishops, who deemed it unbecoming that they should lie under pecuniary obligation to the emperor. His ideal of the church required that it should stand clear and above the state. =Life of St. Martin, dialogues, and letters= More popular during the Middle Ages was Severus' Life of St. Martin, as were also the dialogues and letters which relate to the same subject. These works did much to establish the great reputation which that wonder-working saint maintained throughout the Middle Ages. The book is not properly a biography, but a catalogue of miracles, told in all the simplicity of absolute belief. The power to work miraculous signs is assumed to be in direct proportion to holiness, and is by Severus valued merely as an evidence of holiness, which he is persuaded can only be attained through a life of isolation from the world. In the first of his Dialogues (fair models of Cicero), Severus puts into the mouth of an interlocutor (Posthumianus) a pleasing description of the life of coenobites and solitaries in the deserts bordering on Egypt. The main evidence of the virtue attained by them lies in the voluntary subjection to them of the savage beasts among which they lived. But Severus was no indiscriminating adherent of monasticism. The same dialogue shows him to be alive to its dangers and defects. The second dialogue is a large appendix to the Life of Martin, and really supplies more information of his life as bishop and of his views than the work which bears the title Vita S. Martini. The two dialogues occasionally make interesting references to personages of the epoch. In Dial. 1, cc. 6, 7, we have a vivid picture of the controversies which raged at Alexandria over the works of Origen. The judgment of Severus himself is no doubt that which he puts in the mouth of his interlocutor Posthumianus: \\"I am astonished that one and the same man could have so far differed from himself that in the approved portion of his works he has no equal since the apostles, while in that portion for which he is justly blamed it is proved that no man has committed more unseemly errors.\\" Three Epistles on the death of Martin (ad Eusebium, ad Aurelium diaconum, ad Bassulam) complete the list of Severus' genuine works. Other letters (to his sister), on the love of God and the renunciation of the world, have not survived. =Spurious attributions= Beside the above-mentioned three letters, seven others have been attributed to Severus. These are rejected as spurious by some critics, whilst the genuineness of the first two is admitted, rightly it would seem, by others. The World Chronicle of the so-called Sulpicius Severus has nothing to do with the subject of this biography; it was written in Spain in the sixth century. Sources The text of the Chronicle rests on a single 11th century MS., one of the Palatine collection now in the Vatican; of the other works MSS. are abundant, the best being one of the 6th century at Verona. Some spurious letters bear the name of Severus; also in a MS. at Madrid is a work falsely professing to be an epitome of the Chronicle of Severus, and going down to 511. The chief editions of the complete works of Severus are those by De Prato (Verona, 1741) and by Halm (forming volume i. of the Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, Vienna, 1866). There is a most admirable monograph on the Chronicle by J. Bernays (Berlin, 1861). See also Goelzer, Grammaticae in Sulp. Severum observationes (1884) (thesis).

He was the founder of modern functional analysis,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stefan- Banach, ‚ÄúPolish mathematician who founded modern functional analysis and helped develop the theory of topological vector spaces.‚Äù and an original member of the Lw√≥w School of Mathematics. His major work was the 1932 book, Th√©orie des op√©rations lin√©aires (Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of functional analysis. Born in Krak√≥w, Banach attended IV Gymnasium, a secondary school, and worked on mathematics problems with his friend Witold Wilkosz. After graduating in 1910, Banach moved to Lw√≥w (today called Lviv) . However, during World War I Banach returned to Krak√≥w, where he befriended Hugo Steinhaus. After Banach solved some mathematics problems which Steinhaus considered difficult, they published their first joint work. In 1919, with several other mathematicians, Banach formed a mathematical society. In 1920 he received an assistantship at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic. He soon became a professor at the Polytechnic, and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning. He organized the \\"Lw√≥w School of Mathematics\\". Around 1929 he began writing his Th√©orie des op√©rations lin√©aires. After the outbreak of World War II, in September 1939, Lw√≥w was taken over by the Soviet Union. Banach became a member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and was dean of Lw√≥w University's Department of Mathematics and Physics. In 1941, when the Germans took over Lw√≥w, all institutions of higher education were closed to Poles. As a result, Banach was forced to earn a living as a feeder of lice at Rudolf Weigl's Institute for Study of Typhus and Virology. While the job carried the risk of infection with typhus, it protected him from being sent to slave labor in Germany and from other forms of repression. When the Soviets recaptured Lw√≥w in 1944, Banach reestablished the University. However, because the Soviets were removing Poles from Soviet-annexed formerly-Polish territories, Banach prepared to return to Krak√≥w. Before he could do so, he died in August 1945, having been diagnosed seven months earlier with lung cancer. Some of the notable mathematical concepts that bear Banach's name include Banach spaces, Banach algebras, Banach measures, the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox, the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem, the Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus theorem, the Banach‚ÄìMazur game, the Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem, and the Banach fixed-point theorem. Life =Early life= Stefan Banach was born on 30 March 1892 at St. Lazarus General Hospital in Krak√≥w, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, into a G√≥ral Roman Catholic family and was subsequently baptised by his father, while his mother abandoned him upon this event and her identity is ambiguous.Peter Stachura, Poland in the Twentieth Century, Springer (1999), p. 51 Banach's parents were Stefan Greczek and Katarzyna Banach, both natives of the Podhale region. Greczek was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army stationed in Krak√≥w. Little is known about Banach's mother. According to his baptismal certificate, she was born in Bor√≥wna and worked as a domestic help. Unusually, Stefan's surname was his mother's instead of his father's, though he received his father's given name, Stefan. Since Stefan Greczek was a private and was prevented by military regulations from marrying, and the mother was too poor to support the child, the couple decided that he should be reared by family and friends. Stefan spent the first few years of his life with his grandmother, but when she took ill Greczek arranged for his son to be raised by Franciszka P≈Çowa and her niece Maria Puchalska in Krak√≥w. Young Stefan would regard Franciszka as his foster mother and Maria as his older sister. In his early years Banach was tutored by Juliusz Mien, a French intellectual and friend of the P≈Çowa family, who had emigrated to Poland and supported himself with photography and translations of Polish literature into French. Mien taught Banach French and most likely encouraged him in his early mathematical pursuits. In 1902 Banach, aged 10, enrolled in Krak√≥w's IV Gymnasium (also known as the Goetz Gymnasium). While the school specialized in the humanities, Banach and his best friend Witold Wi≈Çkosz (also a future mathematician) spent most of their time working on mathematics problems during breaks and after school. Later in life Banach would credit Dr. Kamil Kraft, the mathematics and physics teacher at the gymnasium with kindling his interests in mathematics. While generally Banach was a diligent student he did on occasion receive low grades (he failed Greek during his first semester at the gymnasium) and would later speak critically of the school's math teachers. After obtaining his matura (high school degree) at age 18 in 1910, Banach moved to Lw√≥w (today called Lviv) with the intention of studying at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic. He initially chose engineering as his field of study since at the time he was convinced that there was nothing new to discover in mathematics. At some point he also attended Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w on a part- time basis. As Banach had to earn money to support his studies it was not until 1914 that he finally, at age 22, passed his high school graduation exams. When World War I broke out, Banach was excused from military service due to his left-handedness and poor vision. When the Russian Army opened its offensive toward Lw√≥w, Banach left for Krak√≥w, where he spent the rest of the war. He made his living as a tutor at the local gymnasiums, worked in a bookstore and as a foreman of road building crew. He attended some lectures at the Jagiellonian University at that time, including those of the famous Polish mathematicians Stanis≈Çaw Zaremba and Kazimierz ≈ªorawski, but little is known of that period of his life. =Discovery by Steinhaus= Otto Nikodym and Stefan Banach Memorial Bench in Krak√≥w, Poland (sculpted by Stefan Dousa) In 1916, in Krak√≥w's Planty gardens, Banach encountered Professor Hugo Steinhaus, one of the renowned mathematicians of the time. According to Steinhaus, while he was strolling through the gardens he was surprised to overhear the term \\"Lebesgue integral\\" (Lebesgue integration was at the time still a fairly new idea in mathematics) and walked over to investigate. As a result, he met Banach, as well as Otto Nikodym. Steinhaus became fascinated with the self- taught young mathematician. The encounter resulted in a long-lasting collaboration and friendship. In fact, soon after the encounter Steinhaus invited Banach to solve some problems he had been working on but which had proven difficult. Banach solved them within a week and the two soon published their first joint work (On the Mean Convergence of Fourier Series). Steinhaus, Banach and Nikodym, along with several other Krak√≥w mathematicians (W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ölebodzi≈Ñski, Leon Chwistek, Alfred Rosenblatt and W≈Çodzimierz Sto≈ºek) also established a mathematical society, which eventually became the Polish Mathematical Society. The society was officially founded on 2 April 1919. It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, ≈Åucja Braus. =Interbellum= Scottish Caf√©, meeting place of many famous Lw√≥w mathematicians Steinhaus introduced Banach to academic circles and substantially accelerated his career. After Poland regained independence in 1918, Banach was given an assistantship at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic. Steinhaus' backing also allowed him to receive a doctorate without actually graduating from a university. The doctoral thesis, accepted by King John II Casimir University of Lw√≥w in 1920 and published in 1922, included the basic ideas of functional analysis, which was soon to become an entirely new branch of mathematics. The thesis was widely discussed in academic circles and allowed him in 1922 to become a professor at the Lw√≥w Polytechnic. Initially an assistant to Professor Antoni ≈Åomnicki, in 1927 Banach received his own chair. In 1924 he was also accepted as a member of the Polish Academy of Learning. At the same time, from 1922, Banach also headed the second Chair of Mathematics at University of Lw√≥w. Young and talented, Banach gathered around him a large group of mathematicians. The group, meeting in the Scottish Caf√©, soon gave birth to the \\"Lw√≥w School of Mathematics\\". In 1929 the group began publishing its own journal, Studia Mathematica, devoted primarily to Banach's field of study‚Äîfunctional analysis. Around that time, Banach also began working on his best-known work, the first monograph on the general theory of linear-metric space. First published in Polish in 1931, the following year it was also translated into French and gained wider recognition in European academic circles. The book was also the first in a long series of mathematics monographs edited by Banach and his circle. In 17 June 1924 Banach become a correspondence member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts in Krak√≥w. =World War II= Banach's grave, Lychakiv Cemetery, Lviv (Lw√≥w, in Polish) Following the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Lw√≥w came under the control of the Soviet Union for almost two years. Banach, from 1939 a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and on good terms with Soviet mathematicians, had to promise to learn Ukrainian to be allowed to keep his chair and continue his academic activities. Following the German takeover of Lw√≥w in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, all universities were closed and Banach, along with many colleagues and his son, was employed as lice feeder at Professor Rudolf Weigl's Typhus Research Institute. Employment in Weigl's Institute provided many unemployed university professors and their associates protection from random arrest and deportation to Nazi concentration camps. After the Red Army recaptured Lviv in the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive of 1944, Banach returned to the University and helped re-establish it after the war years. However, because the Soviets were removing Poles from annexed formerly Polish territories, Banach began preparing to leave the city and settle in Krak√≥w, Poland, where he had been promised a chair at the Jagiellonian University. He was also considered a candidate for Minister of Education of Poland. In January 1945, however, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was allowed to stay in Lw√≥w. He died on 31 August 1945, aged 53. His funeral at the Lychakiv Cemetery was attended by hundreds of people. Contributions Decomposition of a ball into two identical balls - the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox. Banach's dissertation, completed in 1920 and published in 1922, formally axiomatized the concept of a complete normed vector space and laid the foundations for the area of functional analysis. In this work Banach called such spaces \\"class E-spaces\\", but in his 1932 book, Th√©orie des op√©rations lin√©aires, he changed terminology and referred to them as \\"spaces of type B\\", which most likely contributed to the subsequent eponymous naming of these spaces after him. The theory of what came to be known as Banach spaces had antecedents in the work of the Hungarian mathematician Frigyes Riesz (published in 1916) and contemporaneous contributions from Hans Hahn and Norbert Wiener. For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as \\"Banach‚ÄìWiener\\" spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself. However, because Wiener's work on the topic was limited, the established name became just Banach spaces. Likewise, Banach's fixed point theorem, based on earlier methods developed by Charles √âmile Picard, was included in his dissertation, and was later extended by his students (for example in the Banach‚ÄìSchauder theorem) and other mathematicians (in particular Brouwer and Poincar√© and Birkhoff). The theorem did not require linearity of the space, and applied to any complete Cauchy space (in particular to any complete metric space). The Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem, is one of the fundamental theorems of functional analysis. * Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox * Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus theorem * Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem * Banach‚ÄìStone theorem Quotes Banach monument, Krak√≥w Stanislaw Ulam, another mathematician of the Lw√≥w School of Mathematics, in his autobiography, quotes Banach as saying: : \\"Good mathematicians see analogies.

A single-lens reflex camera (SLR) is a camera that typically uses a mirror and prism system (hence \\"reflex\\" from the mirror's reflection) that permits the photographer to view through the lens and see exactly what will be captured. With twin lens reflex and rangefinder cameras, the viewed image could be significantly different from the final image. When the shutter button is pressed on most SLRs, the mirror flips out of the light path, allowing light to pass through to the light receptor and the image to be captured.

SLR without lens kit Cross section of SLR camera. Prior to the development of SLR, all cameras with viewfinders had two optical light paths: one path through the lens to the film, and another path positioned above (TLR or twin-lens reflex) or to the side (rangefinder). Because the viewfinder and the film lens cannot share the same optical path, the viewing lens is aimed to intersect with the film lens at a fixed point somewhere in front of the camera. This is not problematic for pictures taken at a middle or longer distance, but parallax causes framing errors in close-up shots. Moreover, focusing the lens of a fast reflex camera when it is opened to wider apertures (such as in low light or while using low- speed film) is not easy. Most SLR cameras permit upright and laterally correct viewing through use of a roof pentaprism situated in the optical path between the reflex mirror and viewfinder. Light, which comes both horizontally and vertically inverted after passing through the lens, is reflected upwards by the reflex mirror, into the pentaprism where it is reflected several times to correct the inversions caused by the lens, and align the image with the viewfinder. When the shutter is released, the mirror moves out of the light path, and the light shines directly onto the film (or in the case of a DSLR, the CCD or CMOS imaging sensor). The Canon Pellix, along with several special purpose high speed cameras(such as the Canon EOS-1N RS), were an exception to the moving mirror system, wherein the mirror was a fixed beamsplitting pellicle. Focus can be adjusted manually by the photographer or automatically by an autofocus system. The viewfinder can include a matte focusing screen located just above the mirror system to diffuse the light. This permits accurate viewing, composing and focusing, especially useful with interchangeable lenses. Up until the 1990s, SLR was the most advanced photographic preview system available, but the recent development and refinement of digital imaging technology with an on-camera live LCD preview screen has overshadowed SLR's popularity. Nearly all inexpensive compact digital cameras now include an LCD preview screen allowing the photographer to see what the CCD is capturing. However, SLR is still popular in high-end and professional cameras because they are system cameras with interchangeable parts, allowing customization. They also have far less shutter lag, allowing photographs to be timed more precisely. Also the pixel resolution, contrast ratio, refresh rate, and color gamut of an LCD preview screen cannot compete with the clarity and shadow detail of a direct-viewed optical SLR viewfinder. Large format SLR cameras were probably first marketed with the introduction of C.R. Smith's Monocular Duplex (U.S., 1884).One was patented in 1861 (Thomas Sutton), but it is not clear if a second example was ever produced; Calvin Rae Smith's design of a Patent Monocular Duplex camera was advertised and sold. Spira, The History of Photography, 119. SLRs for smaller exposure formats were launched in the 1920s by several camera makers. The first 35 mm SLR available to the mass market, Leica's PLOOT reflex housing along with a 200 mm f4.5 lens paired to a 35 mm rangefinder camera body, debuted in 1935. The Soviet –°–ø–æ—Ä—Ç (‚ÄúSport‚Äù),A. O. Gelgar's Sport also a 24 mm by 36 mm image size, was prototyped in 1934 and went to market in 1937. K. N√ºchterlein's Kine Exakta (Germany, 1936) was the first integrated 35 mm SLR to enter the market. Additional Exakta models, all with waist-level finders, were produced up to and during World War II. Another ancestor of the modern SLR camera was the Swiss-made Alpa, which was innovative, and influenced the later Japanese cameras. The first eye-level SLR viewfinder was patented in Hungary on August 23, 1943 by Jen≈ë Dulovits, who then designed the first 35 mm camera with one, the Duflex, which used a system of mirrors to provide a laterally correct, upright image in the eye-level viewfinder. The Duflex, which went into serial production in 1948, was also the world's first SLR with an instant-return (a.k.a. autoreturn) mirror. The first commercially produced SLR that employed a roof pentaprism was the Italian Rectaflex A.1000, shown in full working condition on Milan fair April 1948 and produced from September the same year, thus being on the market one year before the east German Zeiss Ikon VEB Contax S, announced on May 20, 1949, produced from September. The Japanese adopted and further developed the SLR. In 1952, Asahi developed the Asahiflex and in 1954, the Asahiflex IIB. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax combined the fixed pentaprism and the right-hand thumb wind lever. Nikon, Canon and Yashica introduced their first SLRs in 1959 (the F, Canonflex, and Pentamatic, respectively). = Through-the-lens light metering = As a small matter of history, the first 35 mm camera (non-SLR) to feature through the lens light metering may have been Nikon, with a prototype rangefinder camera, the SPX. According to the website below, the camera used Nikon 'S' type rangefinder lenses. Through-the-lens light metering is also known as \\"behind-the-lens metering\\". In the SLR design scheme, there were various placements made for the metering cells, all of which used CdS (Cadmium sulfide) photocells. The cells were either located in the pentaprism housing, where they metered light transmitted through the focusing screen; underneath the reflex mirror glass itself, which was Topcon's design; or in front of the shutter mechanism, which was the design used by Canon with their Canon Pellix. Pentax was the first manufacturer to show an early prototype 35 mm behind-the-lens metering SLR camera, which was named the Pentax Spotmatic. The camera was shown at the 1960 photokina show. However, the first Through-the-lens (TTL) light metering SLR on the market was the 1963 Topcon RE Super, which had the CdS metering cell placed behind the reflex mirror. The mirror had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell providing average metering. Late in the following year, a production model of the Pentax Spotmatic was shown whose CdS light meter cells were on the pentaprism, reading the light off the focusing screen providing average reading, yet keeping the Spotmatic name, but now written in one word. Another clever design appeared in 1965, the Canon Pellix employing a pellicle mirror that is semi-transparent, placing the meter cell on an arm swinging into the lightpass behind the mirror for meter reading. Mamiya Sekor came out with cameras such as the Mamiya Sekor TL and various other versions. Yashica introduced the TL Super. Both of these cameras used M42 screw thread lenses as did the Pentax Spotmatic. Later on Fujica introduced their ST-701, then ST-801 and ST-901 cameras. The ST-701 was the first SLR to use a silicon cell photodiode, which was more sensitive than CdS and was immune to the memory effect that the CdS cell suffered from in bright sunlight. Gradually, other 35 mm SLR camera manufacturers changed their behind-the-lens meters from CdS cells to Silicon Diode photocells. Other manufacturers responded and introduced their own behind-the-lens metering cameras. Nikon and Miranda, at first, simply upgraded their interchangeable pentaprisms to include behind-the-lens metering (for Nikon F, and Miranda D, F, Fv and G models) and these manufacturers also bought out other camera models with built-in behind-the-lens metering capability, such as the Nikkormat FT and the Miranda Sensorex (which used an external coupling diaphragm). Minolta introduced the SRT-101, which used Minolta's proprietary system they referred to as \\"CLC\\", which was an acronym for \\"contrast light compensation\\", which metered differently from an average metering behind-the- lens camera. Some German manufacturers also introduced cameras such as the Zeiss Ikon Contarex family, which was one of very few 35 mm SLR to use interchangeable film backs. Inexpensive leaf-shutter cameras also benefited from behind-the-lens metering as, Topcon introduced the Auto 100 with front- mount interchangeable lenses designed only for that camera, and one of the Zeiss Ikon Contaflex leaf shutter cameras. Kowa manufactured their SET-R, which had similar specifications. Within months, manufacturers decided to bring out models that provided limited area metering, such as Nikon's Photomic Tn finder, which concentrated 60% of the CdS cells sensitivity on the inner circle of the focusing screen and 30% on the surrounding area. Canon used spot metering in the unusual Canon Pellix camera, which also had a stationary mirror system that allowed approximately 70% of the light to travel to the film plane and 30% to the photographer's eye. This system, unfortunately, degraded the native resolution of the attached lens and provided less illumination to the eyepiece. It did have the advantage of having less vibration than other SLR cameras but this was not sufficient to attract professionals to the camera in numbers. = Semi-automatic exposure capabilities = While auto-exposure was commonly used in the early 1960s with various 35 mm fixed lens rangefinder cameras such as the Konica Auto 'S', and other cameras such as the Polaroid Land cameras whose early models used selenium cell meters, auto-exposure for interchangeable lens SLRs was a feature that was largely absent, except for a few early leaf-shutter SLRs such as the Kowa SE-R and Topcon Auto 100. The types of automation found in some of these cameras consisted of the simple programmed shutter, whereby the camera's metering system would select a mechanically set series of apertures with shutter speeds, one setting of which would be sufficient for the correct exposure. In the case of the above-mentioned Kowa and Topcon, automation was semi-automatic, where the camera's CDs meter would select the correct aperture only. Autoexposure, technically known as semi-automatic exposure, where the camera's metering system chooses either the shutter speed or the aperture, was finally introduced by the Savoyflex and popularized by Konishiroku in the 1965 Konica Auto-Reflex. This camera was of the 'shutter-priority' type automation, which meant that the camera selected the correct aperture automatically. This model also had the interesting ability to photograph in 35 mm full-frames or half-frames, all selected by a lever. Other SLRs soon followed, but because of limitations with their lens mounts, the manufacturers of these cameras had to choose 'aperture-priority' automation, where the camera's metering system selects the correct shutter speed. As one example, Pentax introduced the Electro Spotmatic, which was able to use the then considerable bulk of 42 mm screw-mount lenses produced by various manufacturers. Yashica, another screw- mount camera manufacturer, soon followed. Canon, which produced the FD lens mount (known as the breech-mount; a unique lens mounting system that combines the advantages of screw-mount and bayonet-mount) introduced their shutter priority 35 mm SLR, the Canon EF in 1976 or so. This camera's build quality was almost the equal of their flagship camera, the Canon F1, and featured a copal-square vertically travelling focal plane shutter that could synchronize electronic flash at shutter speeds up to and including 1/125 of a second, thus making this a good second-body camera for the professional photographer. Nikon at first produced an aperture-priority camera, but later made subtle changes on the inside of their bayonet mount, which allowed for shutter-priority automation without obsoleting the photographers lenses. = Full-program auto- exposure = Full-program auto-exposure soon followed with the advent of the Canon A-1 in 1978. This SLR had a 'P' mode on the shutter speed dial, and a lock on the aperture ring to allow the lens to be put on 'Auto' mode. Other manufacturers soon followed with Nikon introducing the FA, Minolta introducing the X-700 in 1981, and Pentax introducing the Super Program. Olympus, however, continued with 'aperture-priority' automation in their OM system line. The 1970s and 1980s saw steadily increasing use of electronics, automation, and miniaturization, including integrated motor driven film advance with the Konica FS-1 in 1979, and motor rewind functions. = Autofocus = The first autofocus 35 mm SLR was the Pentax ME-F released in 1981. The Minolta Maxxum 7000, released in 1985, was the first 35 mm SLR with integrated autofocus and motorized film-advance winder, which became the standard configuration for SLR cameras from then on. This development had significant impact on the photographic industry. Some manufacturers discarded their existing lens systems to compete with other manufacturer's autofocus capability in their new cameras. This was the case for Canon, with its new EOS lens line. Other manufacturers chose to adapt their existing lens systems for autofocus capability, as was the case with Nikon and Pentax. This allowed photographers to continue using their existing lenses, which greatly reduced the cost of upgrading. For example, almost all Nikon lenses from the 1960s and later still function on the current Nikon bodies, only lacking autofocus. Still some manufacturers, notably Leica with its R-system lenses, and Contax with its Zeiss lenses, decided to keep their lens mounts non-autofocus. Typical film SLR viewfinder information From the late 1980s competition and technical innovations made 35 mm camera systems more versatile and sophisticated by adding more advanced light metering capabilities such as spot-metering; limited area metering such as used by Canon with the F1 series; matrix metering as used by Nikon, exposure communication with dedicated electronic flash units. The user interface also changed on many cameras, replacing meter needle displays that were galvanometer-based and thereby fragile, with light- emitting diodes (LEDs) and then with more comprehensive liquid crystal displays (LCDs) both in the SLR viewfinder and externally on the cameras' top plate using an LCD screen. Wheels and buttons replaced the shutter dial on the camera and the aperture ring on the lens on many models, although some photographers still prefer shutter dials and aperture rings. Some manufacturers introduced image stabilization on certain lenses to combat camera shake and to allow longer hand-held exposures without using a tripod. This feature is especially useful with long telephoto lenses. = Digital SLRs = Canon, Nikon and Pentax have all developed digital SLR cameras (DSLRs) using the same lens mounts as on their respective film SLR cameras. Konica Minolta did the same, and after having bought Konica Minolta's camera division in 2006 Sony continue using the Minolta AF lens mount in their DSLRs, including cameras built around a semi-transparent fixed mirror. Samsung builds DSLRs based on the Pentax lens mount. Olympus, on the other hand, chose to create a new digital-only Four Thirds System SLR standard, adopted later by Panasonic and Leica. Contax came out with a DSLR model, the Contax N-Digital. This model was too late and too expensive to be competitive with other camera manufacturers. The Contax N-digital was the last Contax to use that maker's lens system, and the camera, while having impressive features such as a full- frame sensor, was expensive and lacked sufficient write-speed to the memory card for it to be seriously considered by some professional photographers. The digital single-lens reflex camera have largely replaced film SLR's design in convenience, sales and popularity at the start of 21st century.

Via a condensing lens (6) and internal reflections in the roof pentaprism (7) the image appears in the eyepiece (8). When an image is taken, the mirror moves upwards from its resting position in the direction of the arrow, the focal plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected onto the film or sensor (4) in exactly the same manner as on the focusing screen. This feature distinguishes SLRs from other cameras as the photographer sees the image composed exactly as it will be captured on the film or sensor (see Advantages below). = Pentaprisms and penta-mirrors = A perspective drawing showing how a roof pentaprism corrects a laterally reversed SLR image. Most 35 mm SLRs use a roof pentaprism or penta-mirror to direct the light to the eyepiece, first used on the 1948 Duflex constructed by Jen≈ë Dulovits and patented August 1943 (Hungary). With this camera also appeared the first Instant-return mirror. The first Japanese pentaprism SLR was the 1955 Miranda T, followed by the Asahi Pentax, Minolta SR-2, Zunow, Nikon F and the Yashica Pentamatic. Some SLRs offered removable pentaprisms with optional viewfinder capabilities, such as the waist-level finder, the interchangeable sports finders used on the Canon F1 and F1n; the Nikon F, F2, F3, F4 and F5; and the Pentax LX. Another prism design was the porro prism system used in the Olympus Pen F, the Pen FT, the Pen FV half- frame 35 mm SLR cameras. This was later used on the Olympus EVOLT E-3x0 series, the Leica Digilux 3 and the Panasonic DMC-L1. A right-angle finder is available that slips onto the eyepiece of most SLRs and D-SLRs and allows viewing through a waist-level viewfinder. There is also a finder that provides EVF remote capability.  Shutter mechanisms  = Focal-plane shutters = Almost all contemporary SLRs use a focal-plane shutter located in front of the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the shutter is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for focal plane shutters. Early focal-plane shutters designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening shutter curtain followed by a closing shutter curtain. During fast shutter speeds, the focal- plane shutter would form a 'slit' whereby the second shutter curtain was closely following the first opening shutter curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the shutter slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as shutter speeds were increased. Initially these shutters were made from a cloth material (which was in later years often rubberised), but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon K≈çgaku (now Nikon Corporation), for example, used titanium foil shutters for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the Nikon F, F2, and F3. Other focal-plane shutter designs, such as the Copal Square, travelled vertically ‚Äî the shorter travelling distance of 24 millimetres (as opposed to 36 mm horizontally) meant that minimum exposure and flash synchronisation times could be reduced. These shutters are usually manufactured from metal, and use the same moving-slit principle as horizontally travelling shutters. They differ, though, in usually being formed of several slats or blades, rather than single curtains as with horizontal designs, as there is rarely enough room above and below the frame for a one-piece shutter. Vertical shutters became very common in the 1980s (though Konica, Mamiya, and Copal first pioneered their use in the 1950s and 1960s, and are almost exclusively used for new cameras. Nikon used Copal-made vertical plane shutters in their Nikomat/Nikkormat -range, enabling x-sync speeds from to while the only choice for focal plane shutters at that time was . Later, Nikon again pioneered the use of titanium for vertical shutters, using a special honeycomb pattern on the blades to reduce their weight and achieve world-record speeds in 1982 of second for non-sync shooting, and with x-sync. Nowadays most such shutters are manufactured from cheaper aluminium (though some high-end cameras use materials such as carbon-fibre and Kevlar).  Rotary focal-plane shutter  One unusual design, the Olympus Pen half- frame 35 mm SLR system, manufactured by Olympus in Japan, used a rotary focal- plane shutter mechanism that was extremely simple and elegant in design. This shutter used titanium foil but consisted of one piece of metal with a fixed opening, which allowed electronic flash synchronisation up to and including its maximum speed of 1/500 of a second ‚Äì rivalling the capabilities of leaf- shutter systems Another 35 mm camera system that used a rotary shutter, was the Robot Royal cameras, most of which were rangefinder 35 mm cameras. Some of these cameras were full-frame; some were half-frame, and at least one Robot camera produced an unusual square-sized image on the 35 mm frame. The Mercury II, produced in 1946, also used a rotary shutter. This was a half-frame 35 mm camera. = Leaf shutters = Another shutter system is the leaf shutter, whereby the shutter is constructed of diaphragm-like blades and can be situated either between the lens or behind the lens. If the shutter is part of a lens assembly some other mechanism is required to ensure that no light reaches the film between exposures. An example of a behind-the-lens leaf shutter is found in the 35 mm SLRs produced by Kodak, with their Retina Reflex camera line; Topcon, with their Auto 100; and Kowa with their SE-R and SET-R reflexes. A primary example of a medium-format SLR with a between-the-lens leaf shutter system would be Hasselblad, with their 500C, 500 cm, 500 EL-M (a motorized Hasselblad) and other models (producing a 6 cm square negative). Hasselblads use an auxiliary shutter blind situated behind the lens mount and the mirror system to prevent the fogging of film. Other medium-format SLRs also using leaf shutters include the now discontinued Zenza-Bronica camera system lines such as the Bronica ETRs, the ETRs'i (both producing a 6 √ó 4.5 cm. image), the SQ and the SQ-AI (producing a 6 √ó 6 cm image like the Hasselblad), and the Zenza-Bronica G system (6 √ó 7 cm). Certain Mamiya medium- format SLRs, discontinued camera systems such as the Kowa 6 and a few other camera models also used between-the-lens leaf shutters in their lens systems. Thus, any time a photographer purchased one of these lenses, that lens included a leaf shutter in its lens mount. Because leaf shutters synchronized electronic flash at all shutter speeds especially at fast shutter speeds of of a second or faster, cameras using leaf shutters were more desirable to studio photographers who used sophisticated studio electronic flash systems. Some manufacturers of medium-format 120 film SLR cameras also made leaf-shutter lenses for their focal-plane-shutter models. Rollei made at least two such lenses for their Rolleiflex SL-66 medium format which was a focal-plane shutter SLR. Rollei later switched to a camera system of leaf-shutter design (e.g., the 6006 and 6008 reflexes) and their current medium-format SLRs are now all of the between-the-lens shutter design.  Further developments  Parts Since the technology became widespread in the 1970s, SLRs have become the main photographic instrument used by dedicated amateur photographers and professionals. Some photographers of static subjects (such as architecture, landscape, and some commercial subjects), however, prefer view cameras because of the capability to control perspective. With a triple-extension bellows 4\\" √ó 5\\" camera such as the Linhof SuperTechnika V, the photographer can correct certain distortions such as \\"keystoning\\", where the image 'lines' converge (i.e., photographing a building by pointing a typical camera upward to include the top of the building). Perspective correction lenses are available in the 35 mm and medium formats to correct this distortion with film cameras, and it can also be corrected after the fact with photo software when using digital cameras. The photographer can also extend the bellows to its full length, tilt the front standard and perform photomacrography (commonly known as 'macro photography'), producing a sharp image with depth-of-field without stopping down the lens diaphragm.  Film formats  Early SLRs were built for large format photography, but this film format has largely lost favor among professional photographers. SLR film-based cameras have been produced for most film formats as well as for digital formats. These film-based SLRs use the 35 mm format as, this film format offers a variety of emulsions and film sensitivity speeds, usable image quality and a good market cost. 35 mm film comes in a variety of exposure lengths: 20 exposure, 24 exposure and 36 exposure rolls. Medium format SLRs provide a higher-quality image with a negative that can be more easily retouched than the smaller 35 mm negative, when this capability is required. A small number of SLRs were built for APS such as the Canon IX series and the Nikon Pronea cameras. SLRs were also introduced for film formats as small as Kodak's 110, such as the Pentax Auto 110, which had interchangeable lenses. 16 mm SLR Narciss camera The Narciss camera is an all-metal 16 mm subminiature single lens reflex camera made by Russian optic firm Krasnogorsky Mekhanichesky Zavod (KMZ) Narciss (Soviet Union; –ù–∞—Ä—Ü–∏—Å—Å) between 1961 and 1965.  Common features  Cut-away of a Minolta XE film-based SLR thumb Other features found on many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control referred to as \\"dedicated electronic flash\\". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is inserted into the camera's hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera's synchronization speed is set, along with the aperture. Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the electronic flash. This is denoted TTL flash metering. Some electronic flash units can send out several short bursts of light to aid the autofocus system or for wireless communication with off-camera flash units. A pre-flash is often used to determine the amount of light that is reflected from the subject, which sets the duration of the main flash at time of exposure. Some cameras also employ automatic fill-flash, where the flash light and the available light are balanced. While these capabilities are not unique to the SLR, manufacturers included them early on in the top models, whereas the best rangefinder cameras adopted such features later.  Advantages  Many of the advantages of SLR cameras derive from viewing and focusing the image through the attached lens. Most other types of cameras do not have this function; subjects are seen through a viewfinder that is near the lens, making the photographer's view different from that of the lens. SLR cameras provide photographers with precision; they provide a viewing image that will be exposed onto the negative exactly as it is seen through the lens. There is no parallax error, and exact focus can be confirmed by eye‚Äîespecially in macro photography and when photographing using long focus lenses. The depth of field may be seen by stopping down to the attached lens aperture, which is possible on most SLR cameras except for the least expensive models. Because of the SLR's versatility, most manufacturers have a vast range of lenses and accessories available for them. Compared to most fixed-lens compact cameras, the most commonly used and inexpensive SLR lenses offer a wider aperture range and larger maximum aperture (typically to for a 50 mm lens). This allows photographs to be taken in lower light conditions without flash, and allows a narrower depth of field, which is useful for blurring the background behind the subject, making the subject more prominent. \\"Fast\\" lenses are commonly used in theater photography, portrait photography, surveillance photography, and all other photography requiring a large maximum aperture. The variety of lenses also allows for the camera to be used and adapted in many different situations. This provides the photographer with considerably more control (i.e., how the image is viewed and framed) than would be the case with a view camera. In addition, some SLR lenses are manufactured with extremely long focal lengths, allowing a photographer to be a considerable distance away from the subject and yet still expose a sharp, focused image. This is particularly useful if the subject includes dangerous animals (e.g., wildlife); the subject prefers anonymity to being photographed; or else, the photographer's presence is unwanted (e.g., celebrity photography or surveillance photography). Practically all SLR and DSLR camera bodies can also be attached to telescopes and microscopes via an adapter tube to further enhance their imaging capabilities.  Disadvantages  In most cases, single-lens reflex cameras cannot be made as small or as light as other camera designs‚Äîsuch as rangefinder cameras, autofocus compact cameras and digital cameras with electronic viewfinders (EVF)‚Äîowing to the mirror box and pentaprism/pentamirror. The mirror box also prevents lenses with deeply recessed rear elements from being mounted close to the film or sensor unless the camera has a mirror lockup feature; this means that simple designs for wide angle lenses cannot be used. Instead, larger and more complex retrofocus designs are required. During an exposure, the viewfinder is blocked The SLR mirror 'blacks-out' the viewfinder image during the exposure. In addition, the movement of the reflex mirror takes time, limiting the maximum shooting speed. The mirror system can also cause noise and vibration. Partially reflective (pellicle) fixed mirrors avoid these problems and have been used in a very few designs including the Canon Pellix and the Canon EOS-1N RS, but these designs introduce their own problems. These pellicle mirrors reduce the amount of light travelling to the film plane or sensor and also can distort the light passing through them, resulting in a less-sharp image. To avoid the noise and vibration, many professional cameras offer a mirror lock-up feature, however, this feature totally disables the SLR's automatic focusing ability. Electronic viewfinders have the potential to give the 'viewing-experience' of a DSLR (through-the-lens viewing) without many of the disadvantages. More recently, Sony have resurrected the pellicle mirror concept in their \\"single-lens translucent\\" (SLT) range of cameras. = Reliability = SLRs vary widely in their construction and typically have bodies made of plastic or magnesium. Most manufacturers do not cite durability specifications, but some report shutter life expectancies for professional models. For instance, the Canon EOS 1Ds MkII is rated for 200,000 shutter cycles and the Nikon D3 is rated for 300,000 with its exotic carbon fiber/kevlar shutter. Because many SLRs have interchangeable lenses, there is a tendency for dust, sand and dirt to get into the main body of the camera through the mirror box when the lens is removed, thus dirtying or even jamming the mirror movement mechanism or the shutter curtain mechanism itself. In addition, these particles can also jam or otherwise hinder the focusing feature of a lens if they enter into the focusing helicoid. The problem of sensor cleaning has been somewhat reduced in DSLRs as some cameras have a built-in sensor cleaning unit. = Price and affordability = The price of SLRs in general also tends to be somewhat higher than that of other types of cameras, owing to their internal complexity. This is compounded by the expense of additional components, such as flashes or lenses. The initial investment in equipment can be prohibitive enough to keep some casual photographers away from SLRs, although the market for used SLRs has become larger particularly as photographers migrate to digital systems.  Future  The digital single-lens reflex camera has largely replaced the film SLR for its convenience, sales, and popularity at the start of 21st century. These cameras are currently the marketing favorite among advanced amateur and professional photographers. Film-based SLRs are still used by a niche market of enthusiasts and format lovers.

Ballmer is the current owner of the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As of Oct 2020, Forbes estimates his personal wealth at US$74. 7billion, ranking him the 9th richest person in the world.https://www.forbes.com/profile/steve- ballmer/?list=billionaires#301f20c54818 Retrieved 22nd July 2020 Ballmer was hired by Bill Gates at Microsoft in 1980 and subsequently left the MBA program at Stanford University. He eventually became president in 1998, and replaced Gates as CEO on January 13, 2000. On February 4, 2014, Ballmer retired as CEO and resigned from the Board of Directors on August 19, 2014 to prepare for teaching a new class. On May 29, 2014, Ballmer placed a bid of $2 billion to purchase the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers after NBA commissioner Adam Silver forced Donald Sterling to sell the team. He became the Los Angeles Clippers owner on August 12, 2014; Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was a fellow owner in the NBA, having owned the Portland Trail Blazers since 1988. His tenure and legacy as Microsoft CEO has received mixed reception, with the company tripling sales and doubling profits, but losing its market dominance and missing out on 21st-century technology trends. Early life and education Ballmer was born in Detroit, Michigan; he is the son of Beatrice Dworkin and Frederic Henry Ballmer (Fritz Hans Ballmer), a manager at the Ford Motor Company. His father was a Swiss immigrant who predicted that his son, at eight years old, would attend Harvard. His mother was Belarusian Jewish. Through his mother, Ballmer is a second cousin of actress and comedian Gilda Radner. Ballmer grew up in the affluent community of Farmington Hills, Michigan. Ballmer also lived in Brussels from 1964 to 1967, where he attended the International School of Brussels. In 1973, he attended college prep and engineering classes at Lawrence Technological University. He graduated as valedictorian from Detroit Country Day School, a private college preparatory school in Beverly Hills, Michigan, with a score of 800 on the mathematical section of the SAT and was a National Merit Scholar. He now sits on the school's board of directors. In 1977, he graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in applied mathematics and economics. At college, Ballmer was a manager for the Harvard Crimson football team and a member of the Fox Club, worked on The Harvard Crimson newspaper as well as the Harvard Advocate, and lived down the hall from fellow sophomore Bill Gates. He scored highly in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, an exam sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America, scoring higher than Bill Gates. He then worked as an assistant product manager at Procter & Gamble for two years, where he shared an office with Jeffrey R. Immelt, who later became CEO of General Electric. After briefly trying to write screenplays in Hollywood, in 1980 Ballmer dropped out of the Stanford Graduate School of Business to join Microsoft. History with Microsoft Ballmer joined Microsoft on June 11, 1980, and became Microsoft's 30th employee, the first business manager hired by Gates. Ballmer was offered a salary of $50,000 as well as 5-10% of the company. When Microsoft was incorporated in 1981, Ballmer owned 8% of the company. In 2003, Ballmer sold 39.3 million Microsoft shares equating to approximately $955 million, thereby reducing his ownership to 4%. The same year, he replaced Microsoft's employee stock options program. In the 20 years following his hire, Ballmer headed several Microsoft divisions, including operations, operating systems development, and sales and support. From February 1992 onwards, he was Executive Vice President, Sales, and Support. Ballmer led Microsoft's development of the .NET Framework. Ballmer was then promoted to President of Microsoft, a title that he held from July 1998 to February 2001, making him the de facto number two in the company to the chairman and CEO, Bill Gates. =Chief Executive Officer (2000‚Äì2014)= Ballmer at Mobile World Congress 2010 On January 13, 2000, Ballmer was officially named the chief executive officer. As CEO, Ballmer handled company finances and daily operations, but Gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the \\"technological vision\\" as chief software architect. Gates relinquished day-to- day activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in 2006, while staying on as chairman, and that gave Ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at Microsoft. When Ballmer took over as CEO, the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the U.S. government and 20 states, plus class-action lawsuits and complaints from rival companies. While it was said that Gates would have continued fighting the suit, Ballmer made it his priority to settle these saying: \\"Being the object of a lawsuit, effectively, or a complaint from your government is a very awkward, uncomfortable position to be in. It just has all downside. People assume if the government brought a complaint that there's really a problem, and your ability to say we're a good, proper, moral place is tough. It's actually tough, even though you feel that way about yourselves.\\" Upon becoming CEO, Ballmer required detailed business justification in order to approve of new products, rather than allowing hundreds of products that sounded potentially interesting or trendy. In 2005, he recruited B. Kevin Turner from Walmart, who was the President and CEO of Sam's Club, to become Microsoft's Chief Operating Officer. Turner was hired at Microsoft to lead the company's sales, marketing and services group and to instill more process and discipline in the company's operations and salesforce. Since Bill Gates' retirement, Ballmer oversaw a \\"dramatic shift away from the company's PC-first heritage\\", replacing most major division heads in order to break down the \\"talent-hoarding fiefdoms\\", and Businessweek said that the company \\"arguably now has the best product lineup in its history\\". Ballmer was instrumental in driving Microsoft's connected computing strategy, with acquisitions such as Skype. Under Ballmer's tenure as CEO, Microsoft's share price stagnated. The lackluster stock performance occurred despite Microsoft's financial success at that time. The company's annual revenue surged from $25 billion to $70 billion, while its net income increased 215% to $23 billion, and its gross profit of 75 cents on every dollar in sales is double that of Google or IBM. In terms of leading the company's total annual profit growth, Ballmer's tenure at Microsoft (16.4%) surpassed the performances of other well-known CEOs such as General Electric's Jack Welch (11.2%) and IBM's Louis V. Gerstner Jr. (2%). These gains came from the existing Windows and Office franchises, with Ballmer maintaining their profitability, fending off threats from competitors such as GNU/Linux and other open-source operating systems and Google Docs. Ballmer also built half a dozen new businesses, such as the data centers division and the Xbox entertainment and devices division ($8.9 billion), (which has prevented the Sony PlayStation and other gaming consoles from undermining Windows),Fortune and oversaw the acquisition of Skype. Ballmer also constructed the company's $20 billion Enterprise Business, consisting of new products and services such as Exchange, Windows Server, SQL Server, SharePoint, System Center, and Dynamics CRM, each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category. This diversified product mix helped to offset the company's reliance on PCs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the Post-PC era; in reporting quarterly results during April 2013, while Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 had not managed to increase their market share above single digits, the company increased its profit 19% over the previous quarter in 2012, as the Microsoft Business Division (including Office 365) and Server and Tools division (cloud services) are each larger than the Windows division.Ovide, Shira. (August 25, 2013) \\"Next CEO's Biggest Job: Fixing Microsoft's Culture\\". The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved on September 4, 2013. Ballmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies, forcing Microsoft to play catch-up in the areas of tablet computing, smartphones and music players with mixed results. Under Ballmer's watch, \\"In many cases, Microsoft latched onto technologies like smartphones, touchscreens, 'smart' cars and wristwatches that read sports scores aloud long before Apple or Google did. But it repeatedly killed promising projects if they threatened its cash cows [Windows and Office].\\" Ballmer was even named one of the worst CEOs of 2013 by the BBC. As a result of these many criticisms, in May 2012, hedge fund manager David Einhorn called on Ballmer to step down as CEO of Microsoft. \\"His continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock,\\" Einhorn said in reference to Ballmer. In a May 2012 column in Forbes magazine, Adam Hartung described Ballmer as \\"the worst CEO of a large publicly traded American company\\", saying he had \\"steered Microsoft out of some of the fastest growing and most lucrative tech markets (mobile music, headsets and tablets)\\". In 2009, and for the first time since Bill Gates resigned from day-to-day management at Microsoft, Ballmer delivered the opening keynote at CES. MIX in 2008 As part of his plans to expand on hardware, on June 19, 2012, Ballmer revealed Microsoft's first ever computer device, a tablet called Microsoft Surface at an event held in Hollywood, Los Angeles. He followed this by announcing the company's purchase of Nokia's mobile phone division in September 2013, his last major acquisition for Microsoft as CEO. On August 23, 2013, Microsoft announced that Ballmer would retire within the next 12 months. A special committee that included Bill Gates would decide on the next CEO.Chaudhuri, Saabira (August 23, 2013). \\"Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to Retire Within 12 Months\\". The Wall Street Journal. There was a list of potential successors to Ballmer as Microsoft CEO, but all had departed the company: Jim Allchin, Brad Silverberg, Paul Maritz, Nathan Myhrvold, Greg Maffei, Pete Higgins, Jeff Raikes, J. Allard, Robbie Bach, Bill Veghte, Ray Ozzie, Bob Muglia and Steven Sinofsky. B. Kevin Turner, Microsoft's Chief Operating Officer (COO), was considered by some to be a de facto number two to Ballmer, with Turner having a strong grasp of business and operations but lacking technological vision.Turner, Kevin. \\"Who will succeed Steve Ballmer at Microsoft?\\" Fortune / CNN. Retrieved September 4, 2013. On February 4, 2014, Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer as CEO. =Public image= Although as a child he was so shy that he would hyperventilate before Hebrew school, Ballmer is known for his energetic and exuberant personality, which is meant to motivate employees and partners, shouting so much that he needed surgery on his vocal cords. Ballmer's flamboyant stage appearances at Microsoft events are widely circulated on the Internet as viral videos. One of his earliest known viral videos was his promotion of Windows 1.0 for a Crazy Eddie commercial in 1985, where he energetically shouts \\"How much do YOU think this advanced operating environment is worth? WAIT just one minute before you answer\\". Ballmer and Brian Valentine repeated this in a spoof promotion of Windows XP later on.Avram Piltch, Laptop Mag; 9 Craziest Steve Ballmer Moments, https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/steve-ballmers-9-craziest-moments A widely circulated video was his entrance on stage at Microsoft's 25th anniversary event in September 2000, where he shouted and jumped across the stage, and saying \\"I love this company\\". It has been nicknamed 'monkey boy dance'. Another well-known viral video was one captured at a Windows 2000 developers' conference, featuring a perspiring Ballmer chanting the word \\"developers\\". =Relationship with Bill Gates= Ballmer was Gates' best man at his wedding to Melinda French, and the two men described their relationship as a marriage. They were so close for years that another Microsoft executive described it as a mind meld. Combative debates‚Äîa part of Microsoft's corporate culture‚Äîthat many observers believed were personal arguments occurred within the relationship; while Gates was glad in 2000 that Ballmer was willing to become CEO so he could focus on technology, the Wall Street Journal reported that there was tension surrounding the transition of authority. Things became so bitter that, on one occasion, Gates stormed out of a meeting in a huff after a shouting match in which Ballmer jumped to the defense of several colleagues, according to an individual present at the time. After the exchange, Ballmer seemed \\"remorseful\\", the person said. Once Gates leaves, \\"I'm not going to need him for anything. That's the principle\\", Ballmer said. \\"Use him, yes, need him, no\\". In October 2014, a few months after Ballmer left his post at Microsoft, a Vanity Fair profile stated that Ballmer and Gates no longer talk to each other due to animosity over Ballmer's resignation. In a November 2016 interview, Ballmer said he and Gates have \\"drifted apart\\" ever since, saying that they always had a \\"brotherly relationship\\" beforehand. He said that his push into the hardware business, specifically smartphones, which Gates did not support, contributed to their relationship breakdown. =Retirement= After saying in 2008 that he intended to remain CEO for another decade, Ballmer announced his retirement in 2013, after losing billions of dollars in acquisitions and on the Surface tablet. Microsoft's stock price rebounded on the news.\\"Why Teflon Ballmer had to go: He couldn't shift crud from Windows 8, Surface\\". Ballmer says that he regretted the lack of focus on Windows Mobile in the early 2000s, leaving Microsoft a distant third in the current smartphone market. Moreover, he attributed the success of the expensively- priced iPhones to carrier subsidies. He went on to say, He called the acquisition of the mobile phone division of Nokia as his \\"toughest decision\\" during his tenure, as it was overseeing the changing profile of Microsoft as it was expanding on hardware. Ballmer hosted his last company meeting in September 2013, and stepped down from the company's board of directors, in August 2014. On December 24, 2014, the Seattle Times reported that the IRS sued Ballmer, Craig Mundie, Jeff Raikes, Jim Allchin, Orlando Ayala and David Guenther in an effort to compel them to testify in Microsoft's corporate tax audit. The IRS has been looking into how Microsoft and other companies deal with transfer pricing. Other positions Ballmer served as director of Accenture Ltd. and a general partner of Accenture SCA from 2001 to 2006. On competing companies and software =Apple= In 2007, Ballmer said \\"There's no chance that the [Apple] iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.\\" Speaking at a conference in NYC in 2009, Ballmer criticized Apple's pricing, saying, \\"Now I think the tide has turned back the other direction (against Apple). The economy is helpful. Paying an extra $500 for a computer in this environment‚Äîsame piece of hardware‚Äîpaying $500 more to get a logo on it? I think that's a more challenging proposition for the average person than it used to be.\\" SlashGear In 2015, Ballmer called Microsoft's decision to invest in Apple to save it from bankruptcy in 1997 as the \\"craziest thing we ever did\\". By 2015, Apple was the world's most valuable company. In 2016, Ballmer did an interview with Bloomberg where Ballmer added context to his iPhone statement, saying \\"People like to point to this quote...but the reason I said that was the price of $600-$700 was too high\\", he says he did not realize the business model innovation that Apple was going to deploy, using the carriers to subsidize the phones by building the cost into the customer's monthly bill.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFe0S3F389w =Free and open source software= In July 2000, Ballmer called the free software Linux kernel \\"communism\\" and further claimed that it infringed with Microsoft's intellectual property. In June 2001 he called Linux a \\"cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches\\"., Chicago Sun-Times, June 1, 2001; archived from the original on December 11, 2001; retrieved December 18, 2009. Ballmer used the notion of \\"viral\\" licensing terms to express his concern over the fact that the GNU General Public License (GPL) employed by such software requires that all derivative software be under the GPL or a compatible license. In April 2003 he even interrupted his skiing holiday in Switzerland to personally plead with the mayor of Munich not to switch to GNU/Linux. But he did not succeed with this and Munich switched to LiMux, despite his offering a 35% discount at his lobbying visit. In March 2016, Ballmer changed his stance on Linux, saying that he supports his successor Satya Nadella's open source commitments. He maintained that his comments in 2001 were right at the time but that times have changed. =Google= In 2005, Microsoft sued Google for hiring one of its previous vice presidents, Kai-Fu Lee, claiming it was in violation of his one-year non-compete clause in his contract. Mark Lucovsky, who left for Google in 2004, alleged in a sworn statement to a Washington state court that Ballmer became enraged upon hearing that Lucovsky was about to leave Microsoft for Google, picked up his chair, and threw it across his office, and that, referring to then Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt (who had previously worked for competitors Sun and Novell), Ballmer vowed to \\"kill Google.\\" Lucovsky reports: Ballmer then resumed attempting to persuade Lucovsky to stay at Microsoft. Ballmer has described Lucovsky's account of the incident as a \\"gross exaggeration of what actually took place\\". During the 2011 Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, he said: \\"You don't need to be a computer scientist to use a Windows Phone and you do to use an Android phone ... It is hard for me to be excited about the Android phones.\\" In 2013, Ballmer said that Google was a \\"monopoly\\" that should be pressured from market competition authorities. Sports On March 6, 2008, Seattle mayor Greg Nickels announced that a local ownership group involving Ballmer made a \\"game-changing\\" commitment to invest $150 million in cash toward a proposed $300 million renovation of KeyArena and were ready to purchase the Seattle SuperSonics from the Professional Basketball Club LLC in order to keep the team in Seattle. However, this initiative failed, and the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where they now play as the Oklahoma City Thunder. In June 2012, Ballmer was an investor in Chris R. Hansen's proposal to build a new arena in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle and bring the SuperSonics back to Seattle. On January 9, 2013, Ballmer and Hansen led a group of investors in an attempt to purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family and relocate them to Seattle for an estimated $650 million. However, this attempt also fell through.espn.com, Clippers name has to go with Sterling, accessed May 30, 2014. Following the Donald Sterling scandal in May 2014, Ballmer was the highest bidder in an attempt to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers for a reported price of $2 billion, which is the second highest bid for a sports franchise in North American sports history (after the $2.15 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012). After a California court confirmed the authority of Shelly Sterling to sell the team, it was officially announced on August 12, 2014, that Ballmer would become the Los Angeles Clippers owner. On September 25, 2014, Ballmer said he would bar the team from using Apple products such as iPads, and replace them with Microsoft products. It has been reported that he had previously also barred his family from using iPhones. In March 2020, Ballmer agreed to buy The Forum in Inglewood, California. The purchase would allow him to build the Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center in the nearby area since plans for a new Clippers' arena were opposed by the former owners of The Forum. Wealth Ballmer was the second person after Roberto Goizueta to become a billionaire in U.S. dollars based on stock options received as an employee of a corporation in which he was neither a founder nor a relative of a founder. As of July 2020, Forbes estimates his personal wealth at US$71.4 billion. While CEO of Microsoft in 2009, Ballmer earned a total compensation of $1,276,627, which included a base salary of $665,833, a cash bonus of $600,000, no stock or options, and other compensation of $10,794. Philanthropy On November 12, 2014, it was announced that Ballmer and his wife Connie donated $50 million to the University of Oregon. Connie Ballmer is a University of Oregon alumna and serves on the institution's board of trustees. The funds will go towards the university's $2 billion fundraising effort, and will focus towards scholarships, public health research and advocacy, and external branding/communications. On November 13, 2014, it was announced that Ballmer would provide a gift, estimated at $60 million, to Harvard University's computer science department. The gift would allow the department to hire new faculty, and hopefully increase the national stature of the program. Ballmer previously donated $10 million to the same department in 1994, in a joint-gift with Bill Gates. Ballmer serves on the World Chairman's Council of the Jewish National Fund, which means he has donated US$1 million or more to the JNF. USAFacts Ballmer launched USAFacts.org in 2017, a non- profit organization whose goal is to allow people to understand US government revenue, spending and societal impact. He is reported to have contributed $10 million to fund teams of researchers who populated the website's database with official data. Personal life In 1990, Ballmer married Connie Snyder; they have three sons.The Guardian: \\"Loyalty is his number one strength. He still drives Ford cars because his father used to work for the company\\" by Bobbie Johnson June 28, 2008 The Ballmers live in Hunts Point, Washington.

Using the term 'terrorism' to mean violent action used with the predominant intention of causing terror, Paul James and Jonathan Friedman distinguish between state terrorism against non-combatants and state terrorism against combatants, including 'shock and awe' tactics: > Shock and Awe\\" as a subcategory of \\"rapid dominance\\" is the name given to > massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. > It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long > before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired > military personnel. However, others, including governments, international organisations, private institutions and scholars, believe the term is applicable only to the actions of violent non-state actors. Historically, the term terrorism was used to refer to actions taken by governments against their own citizens whereas now it is more often perceived as targeting of non-combatants as part of a strategy directed against governments. Historian Henry Commager wrote that \\"Even when definitions of terrorism allow for state terrorism, state actions in this area tend to be seen through the prism of war or national self- defense, not terror.\\" While states may accuse other states of state-sponsored terrorism when they support insurgencies, individuals who accuse their governments of terrorism are seen as radicals, because actions by legitimate governments are not generally seen as illegitimate. Academic writing tends to follow the definitions accepted by states.Donahue, pp. 19‚Äì20. Most states use the term \\"terrorism\\" for non-state actors only. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online defines terrorism generally as \\"the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective\\", and states that \\"terrorism is not legally defined in all jurisdictions.\\" The encyclopedia adds that \\"[e]stablishment terrorism, often called state or state-sponsored terrorism, is employed by governments‚Äîor more often by factions within governments‚Äîagainst that government's citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups.\\" While the most common modern usage of the word terrorism refers to civilian-victimising political violence by insurgents or conspirators,\\"Dealing with Terrorism\\", by Helen Purkitt, in Conflict in World Society, 1984, p. 162. several scholars make a broader interpretation of the nature of terrorism that encompasses the concepts of state terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism.Michael Stohl, p. 14. Michael Stohl argues, \\"The use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.The Superpowers and International Terror Michael Stohl, Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association, Atlanta, March 27April 1, 1984. Stohl clarifies, however, that \\"[n]ot all acts of state violence are terrorism. It is important to understand that in terrorism the violence threatened or perpetrated, has purposes broader than simple physical harm to a victim. The audience of the act or threat of violence is more important than the immediate victim.\\"Stohl, National Interests and State Terrorism, The Politics of Terrorism, Marcel Dekker 1988, p.275. Scholar Gus Martin describes state terrorism as terrorism \\"committed by governments and quasi-governmental agencies and personnel against perceived threats\\", which can be directed against both domestic and foreign targets. Noam Chomsky defines state terrorism as \\"terrorism practised by states (or governments) and their agents and allies\\". Stohl and George A. Lopez have designated three categories of state terrorism, based on the openness/secrecy with which the alleged terrorist acts are performed, and whether states directly perform the acts, support them, or acquiesce in them.Stohl & Lopez, 1988: pp. 207‚Äì208. History Aristotle wrote critically of terror employed by tyrants against their subjects.\\"Those Hell-Hounds Called Terrorists\\" By Harvey C. Mansfield, The Claremont Institute, posted November 28, 2001. The earliest use of the word terrorism identified by the Oxford English Dictionary is a 1795 reference to tyrannical state behavior, the \\"reign of terrorism\\" in France.Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Edition, CD Version 3, 2002, Oxford University Press. In that same year, Edmund Burke decried the \\"thousands of those hell-hounds called terrorists\\" who he believed threatened Europe. During the Reign of Terror, the Jacobin government and other factions of the French Revolution used the apparatus of the state to kill and intimidate political opponents, and the Oxford English Dictionary includes as one definition of terrorism \\"Government by intimidation carried out by the party in power in France between 1789‚Äì1794\\". The original general meaning of terrorism was of terrorism by the state, as reflected in the 1798 supplement of the Dictionnaire of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, which described terrorism as systeme, regime de la terreur.A History of Terrorism, by Walter Laqueur, Transaction Publishers, 2007, , at , p. 6. Myra Williamson wrote: > The meaning of \\"terrorism\\" has undergone a transformation. During the Reign > of Terror, a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of > governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary state against > the enemies of the people. Now the term \\"terrorism\\" is commonly used to > describe terrorist acts committed by non-state or sub-national entities > against a state. (italics in original) Later examples of state terrorism include the police state measures employed by the Soviet Union beginning in the 1930s, and by Germany's Nazi regime in the 1930s and 1940s.Primoratz, Igor (2007); \\"Terrorism\\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. According to Igor Primoratz, \\"Both [the Nazis and the Soviets] sought to impose total political control on society. Such a radical aim could be pursued only by a similarly radical method: by terrorism directed by an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and defenseless population. Its success was due largely to its arbitrary character‚Äîto the unpredictability of its choice of victims. In both countries, the regime first suppressed all opposition; when it no longer had any opposition to speak of, political police took to persecuting 'potential' and 'objective opponents'. In the Soviet Union, it was eventually unleashed on victims chosen at random.\\"Primoratz, Igor (2007). Military actions primarily directed against non-combatant targets have also been referred to as state terrorism. For example, the bombing of Guernica has been called an act of terrorism.What's wrong with terrorism? by Robert E. Goodin, Polity, 2006, , at , p. 62. Other examples of state terrorism may include the World War II bombings of Pearl Harbor, London, Dresden, Chongqing, and Hiroshima.Michael Stohl, \\"The Superpowers and International Terror\\", Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association, Atlanta, March 27April 1, 1984. An act of sabotage, sometimes regarded as an act of terrorism, was the peacetime sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, a ship owned by Greenpeace, which occurred while in port at Auckland, New Zealand on July 10, 1985. The bomb detonation killed Fernando Pereira, a Dutch photographer. The organisation who committed the attack, the DGSE, is a branch of France's intelligence services. The agents responsible pleaded guilty to manslaughter as part of a plea deal and were sentenced to ten years in prison, but were secretly released early to France under an agreement between the two countries' governments. Another example is the British Military Reaction Force in Northern Ireland during the 1970s, which murdered innocent civilians from the Catholic community in order to stir up ethnic hatred and \\"take the heat off the army\\".Murray, Raymond. The SAS in Ireland. Mercier Press, 1990. pp.44‚Äì45. In November 2013, a BBC Panorama documentary was aired about the MRF. It drew on information from seven former members, as well as a number of other sources. Soldier H said: \\"We operated initially with them thinking that we were the UVF.\\" Soldier F added: \\"We wanted to cause confusion.\\"Ware, John. \\"Britain's Secret Terror Force\\". Irish Republican News, 23 November 2013. Retrieved 23 November 2013. In June 1972, he was succeeded as commander by Captain James 'Hamish' McGregor. In June 2014, in the wake of the Panorama programme, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) opened an investigation into the matter. In an earlier review of the programme, the position of the PSNI was that none of the statements by soldiers in the programme could be taken as an admission of criminality. By country =China= The Uyghur American Association has claimed that Beijing's military approach to terrorism in Xinjiang is state terrorism. The Chinese state has also been accused of state terrorism in Tibet. =France= The sinking of the Rainbow Warrior took place in New Zealand's Auckland Harbour on July 10, 1985. It was an attack carried out by French DGSE agents Captain Dominique Prieur and Commander Alain Mafart aimed at sinking the flagship craft of the Greenpeace Organisation in order to stop her from interfering in French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The attack resulted in the death of Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira and led to a huge uproar over the first ever attack on New Zealand's sovereignty. France initially denied any involvement in the attack, and it even joined in condemning the attack as a terrorist act. In July 1986, a United Nations-sponsored mediation effort between New Zealand and France resulted in the transfer of the two prisoners to the French Polynesian island of Hao, so they could serve three years there, as well as an apology and a NZD 13 million payment from France to New Zealand. =Iran= =Israel= =Libya= In the 1980s, Libya under Muammar Gaddafi was accused of state terrorism following attacks abroad such as the Lockerbie bombing. =Myanmar= Myanmar has been accused of state terrorism in the internal conflict.https://www.lakeheadu.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/92/Dr.%20Islam.pdf =North Korea= North Korea has been accused of state terrorism on several occasions, such as in 1983 in the Rangoon bombing, the Gimpo International Airport bombing, and in 1987 when North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing everybody aboard.United States Department of State =Pakistan= =Russia/Soviet Union= =South Africa= =Spain= =Sri Lanka= =Syria= =United Kingdom= The British state has been accused of involvement in state terrorism in the Northern Ireland conflict from the 1960s to 1990s by covertly assisting the loyalist paramilitaries. =United States= Ruth J Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Sheffield, accuses the United States of sponsoring and deploying state terrorism, which she defines as \\"the illegal targeting of individuals that the state has a duty to protect in order to instill fear in a target audience beyond the direct victim\\", on an \\"enormous scale\\" during the Cold War. The United States government justified this policy by saying it needed to contain the spread of Communism, but Blakeley says the United States government also used it as a means to buttress and promote the interests of U.S. elites and multinational corporations. The U.S. supported death squads throughout Latin America, and U.S. counterinsurgency training of right-wing military forces included advocating their interrogation and torture of suspected insurgents.Blakeley, Ruth (2009). State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South. Routledge. pp. 21, 22 & 23 J. Patrice McSherry, a professor of political science at Long Island University, says \\"hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans were tortured, abducted or killed by right-wing military regimes as part of the U.S.-led anti-communist crusade,\\" which included U.S. support for Operation Condor and the Guatemalan military during the Guatemalan Civil War. More people were repressed and killed throughout Latin America in the last three decades of the Cold War than in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, according to historian John Henry Coatsworth. Declassified documents from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta in 2017 confirm that the U.S. directly facilitated and encouraged the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in Indonesia during the mid-1960s. Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, says \\"Washington did everything in its power to encourage and facilitate the army-led massacre of alleged PKI members, and U.S. officials worried only that the killing of the party's unarmed supporters might not go far enough, permitting Sukarno to return to power and frustrate the [Johnson] Administration's emerging plans for a post- Sukarno Indonesia.\\"Simpson, Bradley. Economists with Guns: Authoritarian Development and U.S.‚ÄìIndonesia Relations, 1960-1968. Stanford University Press, 2010. p. 193. According to Simpson, the terror in Indonesia was an \\"essential building block of the quasi neo-liberal policies the West would attempt to impose on Indonesia in the years to come\\".Brad Simpson (2009). Accomplices in atrocity. Inside Indonesia. Retrieved May 21, 2018. Historian John Roosa, who commented on documents which were released by the U.S. embassy in Jakarta in 2017, said they confirmed that \\"the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI.\\" Geoffrey B. Robinson, a historian at UCLA, argues that without the support of the U.S. and other powerful Western states, the Indonesian Army's program of mass killings would not have happened. =Uzbekistan= Criticism of the concept The chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has said the twelve previous international conventions on terrorism had never referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept, and when states abuse their powers they should be judged against international conventions which deal with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law, rather than international anti-terrorism statutes. In a similar vein, Kofi Annan, at the time the United Nations Secretary-General, said it is \\"time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already regulated under international law\\". Annan added, \\"...regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.\\" Dr. Bruce Hoffman has argued that failing to differentiate between state and non-state violence ignores the fact that there is a \\"fundamental qualitative difference between the two types of violence.\\" Hoffman argues that even in war, there are rules and accepted norms of behaviour that prohibit certain types of weapons and tactics and outlaw attacks on specific categories of targets. For instance, rules which are codified in the Geneva and Hague Conventions on warfare prohibit taking civilians as hostages, outlaw reprisals against either civilians or POWs, recognise neutral territory, etc. Hoffman says \\"even the most cursory review of terrorist tactics and targets over the past quarter century reveals that terrorists have violated all these rules.\\" Hoffman also says that when states transgress these rules of war \\"the term \\"war crime\\" is used to describe such acts.\\" Walter Laqueur has said those who argue that state terrorism should be included in studies of terrorism ignore the fact that \\"The very existence of a state is based on its monopoly of power. If it were different, states would not have the right, nor would they be in a position, to maintain that minimum of order on which all civilized life rests.\\" Calling the concept a \\"red herring\\" he stated: \\"This argument has been used by the terrorists themselves, arguing that there is no difference between their activities and those by governments and states. It has also been employed by some sympathizers, and it rests on the deliberate obfuscation between all kinds of violence...\\"  See also  * Asymmetric warfare * Nationalist terrorism * Political repression * Sociology of revolution * State violence * State sponsors of terrorism * State-sponsored terrorism * War crimes * State terrorism by country: ** Iran and state-sponsored terrorism ** Israel and state-sponsored terrorism ** State terrorism by Kazakhstan ** Soviet Union and state terrorism ** Sri Lanka and state terrorism ** State terrorism by Syria ** United States and state terrorism ** State terrorism by Uzbekistan ** Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism References =Bibliography=   * * =Further reading=     * =External links= Prevention of terrorism * The National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism * State Terrorism and Counterterrorism Category:Political repression Category:Dirty wars ","title":"State terrorism"},{"id":"29664","text":"Figure 1: The price P of a product is determined by a balance between production at each price (supply S) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price (demand D). The diagram shows a positive shift in demand from D1 to D2, resulting in an increase in price (P) and quantity sold (Q) of the product. Supply and demand comes with an (implicit) agreement. In microeconomics, supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that, holding all else equal, in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted. Graphical representations Although it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as functions of the price of the goods, the standard graphical representation, usually attributed to Alfred Marshall, has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. Since determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the diagram, changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves . In contrast, responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves. =Supply schedule= A supply schedule, depicted graphically as a supply curve, is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied by producers. Under the assumption of perfect competition, supply is determined by marginal cost: firms will produce additional output as long as the cost of producing an extra unit is less than the market price they receive. A hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply, shifting the supply curve up, while a production cost discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases. Mathematically, a supply curve is represented by a supply function, giving the quantity supplied as a function of its price and as many other variables as desired to better explain quantity supplied. The two most common specifications are linear supply, e.g., the slanted line : Q(P) = 3P - 6 and the constant-elasticity supply function (also called isoelastic or log-log or loglinear supply function), e.g., the smooth curve : Q(P) = 5P^{0.5} which can be rewritten as : \\\\log Q(P) = \\\\log 5 + 0.5 \\\\log P Note that really a supply curve should be drawn with price on the horizontal x-axis, since it is the independent variable. Instead, price is put on the vertical, f(x) y-axis as a matter of unfortunate historical convention. By its very nature, the concept of a supply curve assumes that firms are perfect competitors, having no influence over the market price. This is because each point on the supply curve answers the question, \\"If this firm is faced with this potential price, how much output will it sell?\\" If a firm has market power--in violation of the perfect competitor model--its decision on how much output to bring to market influences the market price. Thus the firm is not \\"faced with\\" any given price, and a more complicated model, e.g., a monopoly or oligopoly or differentiated-product model, should be used. Economists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve shows the total quantity supplied by all firms, so it is the sum of the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price (that is, the individual firms' supply curves are added horizontally). Economists distinguish between short-run and long-run supply curve Short run refers to a time period during which one or more inputs are fixed (typically physical capital), and the number of firms in the industry is also fixed (if it a market supply curve). long run refers to a time period during which new firms enter or existing firms exit and all inputs can be adjusted fully to any price change. Long-run supply curves are flatter than short-run counterparts (with quantity more sensitive to price, more elastic supply). Common determinants of supply are: # Prices of inputs, including wages # The technology used, Productivity # Firms' expectations about future prices # Number of suppliers (for a market supply curve) =Demand schedule= A demand schedule, depicted graphically as a demand curve, represents the amount of a certain good that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all other determinants of demand are held constant, such as income, tastes and preferences, and the prices of substitute and complementary goods. According to the law of demand, the demand curve is always downward-sloping, meaning that as the price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good. Mathematically, a demand curve is represented by a demand function, giving the quantity demanded as a function of its price and as many other variables as desired to better explain quantity demanded. The two most common specifications are linear demand, e.g., the slanted line : Q(P) = 32 - 2P and the constant-elasticity demand function (also called isoelastic or log-log or loglinear demand function), e.g., the smooth curve : Q(P) = 3P^{-2} which can be rewritten as : \\\\log Q(P) = log 3 - 2 \\\\log P Note that really a demand curve should be drawn with price on the horizontal x-axis, since it is the independent variable. Instead, price is put on the vertical, f(x) y-axis as a matter of unfortunate historical convention. Just as the supply curve parallels the marginal cost curve, the demand curve parallels marginal utility, measured in dollars. Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the opportunity cost determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product at a certain time. The demand curve is generally downward-sloping, but for some goods it is upward-sloping. Two such types of goods have been given definitions and names that are in common use: Veblen goods, goods which because of fashion or signalling are more attractive at higher prices, and Giffen goods, which, by virtue of being inferior goods that absorb a large part of a consumer's income (e.g., staples such as the classic example of potatoes in Ireland), may see an increase in quantity demanded when the price rises. The reason the law of demand is violated for Giffen goods is that the rise in the price of the good has a strong income effect, sharply reducing the purchasing power of the consumer so that he switches away from luxury goods to the Giffen good, e.g., when the price of potatoes rises, the Irish peasant can no longer afford meat and eats more potatoes to cover for the lost calories. As with the supply curve, by its very nature the concept of a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor‚Äîthat is, that the purchaser have no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve answers the question, \\"If buyers are faced with this potential price, how much of the product will they purchase?\\" But, if a buyer has market power (that is, the amount he buys influences the price), he is not \\"faced with\\" any given price, and we must use a more complicated model, of monopsony. As with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve for an individual and the demand curve for a market. The market demand curve is obtained by adding the quantities from the individual demand curves at each price. Common determinants of demand are: # Income # Tastes and preferences # Prices of related goods and services # Consumers' expectations about future prices and incomes # Number of potential consumers # Advertising Microeconomics Figure 2: Supply and Demand =Equilibrium= Generally speaking, an equilibrium is defined to be the price-quantity pair where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. It is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. The analysis of various equilibria is a fundamental aspect of microeconomics: Market equilibrium: A situation in a market when the price is such that the quantity demanded by consumers is correctly balanced by the quantity that firms wish to supply. In this situation, the market clears. Changes in market equilibrium: Practical uses of supply and demand analysis often center on the different variables that change equilibrium price and quantity, represented as shifts in the respective curves. Comparative statics of such a shift traces the effects from the initial equilibrium to the new equilibrium. Demand curve shifts: When consumers increase the quantity demanded at a given price, it is referred to as an increase in demand. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve to the new curve . In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from to the higher . This raises the equilibrium quantity from to the higher . (A movement along the curve is described as a \\"change in the quantity demanded\\" to distinguish it from a \\"change in demand,\\" that is, a shift of the curve.) The increase in demand has caused an increase in (equilibrium) quantity. The increase in demand could come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute goods, market expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in movement along the supply curve from the point to the point . If the demand decreases, then the opposite happens: a shift of the curve to the left. If the demand starts at , and decreases to , the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The quantity supplied at each price is the same as before the demand shift, reflecting the fact that the supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different as a result of the change (shift) in demand. Supply curve shifts: When technological progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. For example, assume that someone invents a better way of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. Otherwise stated, producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve outward, to ‚Äîan increase in supply. This increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from to . The equilibrium quantity increases from to as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. If the quantity supplied decreases, the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at , and shifts leftward to , the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change (shift) in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed. The movement of the supply curve in response to a change in a non-price determinant of supply is caused by a change in the y-intercept, the constant term of the supply equation. The supply curve shifts up and down the y axis as non-price determinants of demand change. =Partial equilibrium= Partial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium. Jain proposes (attributed to George Stigler): \\"A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis.\\" The supply-and-demand model is a partial equilibrium model of economic equilibrium, where the clearance on the market of some specific goods is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all substitutes and complements, as well as income levels of consumers are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a general equilibrium model which includes an entire economy. Here the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study equilibrium, efficiency and comparative statics. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach makes the model considerably more tractable, but may produce results which, while seemingly precise, do not effectively model real world economic phenomena. Partial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any. Hence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets. L√©on Walras first formalized the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist Antoine Augustin Cournot and English political economist Alfred Marshall who developed tractable models to analyze an economic system. Other markets The model of supply and demand also applies to various specialty markets. The model is commonly applied to wages, in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and demander are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The demanders of labor are businesses, which try to buy the type of labor they need at the lowest price. The equilibrium price for a certain type of labor is the wage rate. However, economist Steve Fleetwood revisited the empirical reality of supply and demand curves in labor markets and concluded that the evidence is \\"at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence.\\" For instance, he cites Kaufman and Hotchkiss (2006): \\"For adult men, nearly all studies find the labour supply curve to be negatively sloped or backward bending.\\" In both classical and Keynesian economics, the money market is analyzed as a supply-and-demand system with interest rates being the price. The money supply may be a vertical supply curve, if the central bank of a country chooses to use monetary policy to fix its value regardless of the interest rate; in this case the money supply is totally inelastic. On the other hand,Basij J. Moore, Horizontalists and Verticalists: The Macroeconomics of Credit Money, Cambridge University Press, 1988 the money supply curve is a horizontal line if the central bank is targeting a fixed interest rate and ignoring the value of the money supply; in this case the money supply curve is perfectly elastic. The demand for money intersects with the money supply to determine the interest rate. Empirical estimation Demand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity, and other data with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with simultaneous-equation methods of estimation in econometrics. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant \\"structural coefficients,\\" the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The Parameter identification problem is a common issue in \\"structural estimation.\\" Typically, data on exogenous variables (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are endogenous variables) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to \\"structural estimation\\" is reduced-form estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables. Macroeconomic uses Demand and supply have also been generalized to explain macroeconomic variables in a market economy, including the quantity of total output and the general price level. The aggregate demand-aggregate supply model may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to microeconomic uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such macroeconomic counterparts as aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate money supply and money demand to interest rates, and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates. History The 256th couplet of Tirukkural, which was composed at least 2000 years ago, says that \\"if people do not consume a product or service, then there will not be anybody to supply that product or service for the sake of price\\".C Chendroyaperumal (2010). The First Laws in Economics and Indian Economic Thought ‚Äì Thirukkural According to Hamid S. Hosseini, the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century Syrian scholar Ibn Taymiyyah, who wrote: \\"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down.\\" (citing Hamid S. Hosseini, 1995. \\"Understanding the Market Mechanism Before Adam Smith: Economic Thought in Medieval Islam,\\" History of Political Economy, Vol. 27, No. 3, 539‚Äì61). Adam Smith John Locke's 1691 work Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money.John Locke (1691) Some Considerations on the consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money includes an early and clear description of supply and demand and their relationship. In this description demand is rent: ‚ÄúThe price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers‚Äù and ‚Äúthat which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.‚Äù The phrase \\"supply and demand\\" was first used by James Denham-Steuart in his Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy, published in 1767. Adam Smith used the phrase in his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations, and David Ricardo titled one chapter of his 1817 work Principles of Political Economy and Taxation \\"On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price\\". Thomas Robert Malthus used the phrase \\"supply and demand\\" twenty times in the second edition of the Essay on Population in 1803.Groenewegen P. (2008) ‚ÄòSupply and Demand‚Äô. In: Palgrave Macmillan (eds) The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, London In The Wealth of Nations, Smith generally assumed that the supply price was fixed but that its \\"merit\\" (value) would decrease as its \\"scarcity\\" increased, in effect what was later called the law of demand also. Ricardo, in Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. Antoine Augustin Cournot first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his 1838 Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth, including diagrams. During the late 19th century the marginalist school of thought emerged. The main innovators of this approach where Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and L√©on Walras. The key idea was that the price was set by the subjective value of a good at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith's thoughts on determining the supply price. In his 1870 essay \\"On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand\\", Fleeming Jenkin in the course of \\"introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature\\" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves in English,A.D. Brownlie and M. F.

Artificial intelligent buying platforms Much of the buying and selling are now conducted online using platforms such as Amazon and eBay, where the profiles of the customers are captured and analyzed. Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their book observed that the advent of artificial intelligence and related technologies such as flexible manufacturing offers the opportunity for individualized demand and supply curves to be generated. This has been found to reduce the degree of arbitrage in the market, allow for individualized pricing for the same product and brings efficiency into the market. Criticism The philosopher Hans Albert has argued that the ceteris paribus conditions of the marginalist theory rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing.Fixing the Economists. 27 February 2014. Available at: Hans Albert Expands Robinson‚Äôs Critique of Marginal Utility Theory to the Law of Demand In essence, he argues, the supply and demand curves (theoretical functions which express the quantity of a product which would be offered or requested for a given price) are purely ontological. Cambridge economist Joan Robinson attacked the theory in similar line, arguing that the concept is circular: \\"Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them, and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility\\" Robinson also pointed out that if we take changes in peoples' behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in the underlying budget constraint, then we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change in price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change in preferences.Pilkington, Philip. Fixing the Economists. 17 February 2014. Available at: Joan Robinson's Critique of Marginal Utility Theory Piero Sraffa's critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good.Avi J. Cohen, \\"'The Laws of Returns Under Competitive Conditions': Progress in Microeconomics Since Sraffa (1926)?\\", Eastern Economic Journal, V. 9, N. 3 (Jul.-Sep.): 1983) The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by Paul Samuelson's comments and engagements with it over many years, for example: :What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how nearly empty are all of Marshall's partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the Marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost.Paul A. Samuelson, \\"Reply\\" in Critical Essays on Piero Sraffa's Legacy in Economics (edited by H. D. Kurz) Cambridge University Press, 2000 Modern Post-Keynesians criticize the supply and demand model for failing to explain the prevalence of administered prices, in which retail prices are set by firms, primarily based on a mark-up over normal average unit costs, and aren't responsive to changes in demand up to capacity. Lee, F. S. (1999). Post Keynesian price theory. Cambridge University Press. Some economists criticize the conventional supply and demand theory for failing to explain or anticipate asset bubbles that can arise from a positive feedback loop. Conventional supply and demand theory assumes that expectations of consumers do not change as a consequence of price changes. In scenarios such as the United States housing bubble, an initial price change of an asset can increase the expectations of investors, making the asset more lucrative and contributing to further price increases until market sentiment changes, which creates a positive feedback loop and an asset bubble. Asset bubbles cannot be understood in the conventional supply and demand framework because the conventional system assumes a price change will be self-correcting and the system will snap back to equilibrium.

Marxist literature defines state capitalism as a social system combining capitalism with ownership or control by a state. By this definition, a state capitalist country is one where the government controls the economy and essentially acts like a single huge corporation, extracting the surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production. This designation applies regardless of the political aims of the state (even if the state is nominally socialist). Many scholars argue that the economy of the Soviet Union and of the Eastern Bloc countries modeled after it, including Maoist China, were state capitalist systems. They also argue that the current economy of China constitutes a form of state capitalism.Howard, M. C.; King, J. E. (2001). \\"'State Capitalism' in the Soviet Union\\".

There are various theories and critiques of state capitalism, some of which existed before the October Revolution. The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and that capitalist social relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism, fundamentally retaining the capitalist mode of production. In Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (1880), Friedrich Engels argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large- scale production and communication by the bourgeois state. He argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism.Engels, Friedrich (1970) [1880]. Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. \\"Historical Materialism\\".

State capitalism is used by various authors in reference to a private capitalist economy controlled by a state, i.e. a private economy that is subject to economic planning and interventionism. It has also been used to describe the controlled economies of the Great Powers during World War I.Coleman, Janet; Conolly, Willam; Miller, David; Ryan, Alan, eds. (1991). The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought (reprinted ed.). Wifey/Blackwell Publishing. Alternatively, state capitalism may refer to an economic system where the means of production are privately owned, but the state has considerable control over the allocation of credit and investment.Bakunin, Mikhail (1971) [1873].

Other examples include the economies of Denmark, Norway and Sweden which have almost equal mixtures of private and state ownership. These countries have enough state ownership and regulation to be legitimately labeled forms of democratic state capitalism. Theoretically, a system that has state ownership of the economy but is democratic would be called democratic state capitalism. Systems where an authoritarian state has full control of the economy are called authoritarian state capitalist systems. An existing example of this type of system would be North Korea. Another would be that of authoritarian capitalist states such as China since the economic reforms, Hungary under Viktor Orb√°n, Russia under Vladimir Putin, Singapore under Lee Kuan YewBerger, Mark T.

State capitalism has also come to be used sometimes interchangeably with state monopoly capitalism to describe a system where the state intervenes in the economy to protect and advance the interests of big business and large-scale businesses. Noam Chomsky, a libertarian socialist, applies the term state capitalism to the economy of the United States, where large enterprises that are deemed \\"too big to fail\\" receive publicly funded government bailouts that mitigate the firms' assumption of risk and undermine market laws, and where private production is largely funded by the state at public expense, but private owners reap the profits. This practice is in contrast with the ideals of both socialism and laissez-faire capitalism.Johnson, Allan G. (2000). The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology. Blackwell Publishing. p. 306. . In 2008, the U.S. National Intelligence Council used the term in Global Trends 2025: A World Transformed to describe the development of China, India and Russia.  Origins and early usage  Friedrich Engels, who argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself In the Anti-Duhring (1877), Friedrich Engels described state ownership, i.e. state capitalism, as follows: > If the crisis revealed the incapacity of the bourgeoisie any longer to > control the modern productive forces, the conversion of the great > organizations for production and communication into joint-stock companies > and state property shows that for this purpose the bourgeoisie can be > dispensed with. All the social functions of the capitalists are now carried > out by salaried employees. The capitalist has no longer any social activity > save the pocketing of revenues, the clipping of coupons, and gambling on the > stock exchange, where the different capitalists fleece each other of their > capital. Just as at first the capitalist mode of production displaced the > workers, so now it displaces the capitalists, relegating them to the > superfluous population even if not in the first instance to the industrial > reserve army.Engels, Friedrich (1962) [1877]. Anti-Duhring. Foreign > Languages Publishing House. pp. 329‚Äì330. Engels argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism, further writing: > But neither the conversion into joint stock companies nor into state > property deprives the productive forces of their character as capital. In > the case of joint-stock companies this is obvious. And the modern state, > too, is only the organization with which bourgeois society provides itself > in order to maintain the general external conditions of the capitalist mode > of production against encroachments either by the workers or by individual > capitalists. The modern state, whatever its form, is then the state of the > capitalists, the ideal collective body of all the capitalists. The more > productive forces it takes over as its property, the more it becomes the > real collective body of the capitalists, the more citizens it exploits. The > workers remain wage-earners, proletarians. The capitalist relationship isn't > abolished; it is rather pushed to the extreme. But at this extreme it is > transformed into its opposite. State ownership of the productive forces is > not the solution of the conflict, but it contains within itself the formal > means, the key to the solution. In Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (1880), Engels described state capitalism as a new form or variant of capitalism. The term state capitalism was first used by Wilhelm Liebknecht in 1896 who said: \\"Nobody has combated State Socialism more than we German Socialists; nobody has shown more distinctively than I, that State Socialism is really State capitalism\\". It has been suggested that the concept of state capitalism can be traced back to Mikhail Bakunin's critique during the First International of the potential for state exploitation under Marxist-inspired socialism, or to Jan Waclav Machajski's argument in The Intellectual Worker (1905) that socialism was a movement of the intelligentsia as a class, resulting in a new type of society he termed state capitalism.Bottomore, T. B. (1961). Elites and Society. London: Watts. p. 54.Gouldner, A. W. (November 1982). \\"Marx's Last Battle: Bakunin and the First International\\". Theory and Society. Springer. 11 (6): pp. 853‚Äì884. Gouldner argues that Bakunin formulated an original critique of Marxism as \\"the ideology, not of the working class, but of a new class of scientific intelligentsia‚Äîwho would corrupt socialism, make themselves a new elite, and impose their rule on the majority\\" (pp. 860‚Äì861).Slavic Review (Spring 1991).

For anarchists, state socialism is equivalent to state capitalism, hence oppressive and merely a shift from private capitalists to the state being the sole employer and capitalist. In Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism and Imperialism and World Economy, both Vladimir Lenin and Nikolai Bukharin, respectively, had similarly identified the growth of state capitalism as one of the main features of capitalism in its imperialist epoch.Lenin, Vladimir (1948) [1916].

In The State and Revolution, Lenin wrote that \\"the erroneous bourgeois reformist assertion that monopoly capitalism or state-monopoly capitalism is no longer capitalism, but can now be called \\"state socialism\\" and so on, is very common\\".Lenin, Vladimir (1964) [1917]. The State and Revolution. \\"Supplementary Explanations by Engels\\". Lenin Collected Works. 25. Moscow: Progress Publishers. pp. 381‚Äì492 ‚Äì via Marxists Internet Archive. During World War I, using Lenin's idea that tsarism was taking a Prussian path to capitalism, the Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin identified a new stage in the development of capitalism in which all sectors of national production and all important social institutions had become managed by the state‚Äîhe termed this new stage state capitalism.Bukharin, Nikolai (1972) [1915]. Imperialism and World Economy. London: Merlin. p. 158. . After the October Revolution, Lenin used the term state capitalism positively. In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of war communism and again during the New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the dictatorship of the proletariat to further central control and develop the productive forces, making the following point: > Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward. If in a > small space of time we could achieve state capitalism, that would be a > victory. Lenin argued the state should temporarily run the economy which would eventually be taken over by workers. To Lenin, state capitalism did not mean the state would run most of the economy, but that state capitalism would be one of five elements of the economy: = By the left = As a term and concept, state capitalism has been used by various socialists, including anarchists, Marxists, Leninists, left communists, Marxist‚ÄìLeninists and Trotskyists.  Anarchists  Perhaps the earliest critique of the Soviet Union as state capitalist was formulated by the Russian anarchists as documented in Paul Avrich's work on Russian anarchism.Paul Avrich, 1967, The Russian Anarchists, Princeton University Press, chapter 7. The Russian anarchists' claim would become standard in anarchist works. Of the Soviet Union, the prominent anarchist Emma Goldman wrote an article from 1935 titled \\"There Is No Communism in Russia\\" in which she argued: > Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be > fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it > must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest > form of state capitalism economically. When speaking about Marxism, Murray Bookchin said the following: > Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced > forms of state capitalist movement ‚Äî notably Russia. By an incredible irony > of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state > capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. > The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the > womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois > society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but > state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'. This is an > extraordinary statement if one thinks out its implications, and a mouthful > of contradictions. While speaking about Leninism, the authors of An Anarchist FAQ say: > Rather than present an effective and efficient means of achieving > revolution, the Leninist model is elitist, hierarchical and highly > inefficient in achieving a socialist society. At best, these parties play a > harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants > with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular > structures and groups. At worst, these parties can seize power and create a > new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working > class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its > appointees).  Classical and orthodox Marxists  Immediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, Karl Kautsky said: After 1929, exiled Mensheviks such as Fyodor Dan began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society.Liebich, A. 1987. 'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', Dissent 34, Spring, pp. 223-40 In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the Socialist Party of Great Britain independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the Catholic Church's.State capitalism: the wages system under new management / Adam Buick and John Crump. Basingstoke : Macmillan, 1986. As John O'Neill notes: Writing in the Menshevik journal Socialist Courier on 25 April 25, Rudolf Hilferding rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that as practiced in the Soviet Union it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital. According to Hilferding, state capitalism was not a form of capitalism, but rather a form of totalitarianism.  Communist left and council communists  Another early analysis of the Soviet Union as state capitalist came from various groups advocating left communism. One major tendency of the 1918 Russian communist left criticised the re-employment of authoritarian capitalist relations and methods of production. As Valerian Osinsky in particular argued, \\"one-man management\\" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished) and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production. Taylorism converted workers into the appendages of machines and piece work imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling petty bourgeois values into workers. In sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. In 1918, this tendency within the left communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its transcendence lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of Marx's critique of alienation.Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967. 'Soviet state capitalism? The history of an idea', Survey 62, January, pp. 58-71. This type of criticism was revived on the left of the Russian Communist Party after the 10th Congress in 1921, which introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP). Many members of the Workers' Opposition and the Decists (both later banned) and two new underground left communist groups, Gavril Myasnikov's Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.EH Carr, The Interregnum 1923-1924, London, 1954, p80 The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.Marshall Shatz The left and council communist traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist,Bordiga, Amadeo (1952). \\"Dialogue With Stalin\\".

Trotskyists  Leon Trotsky stated that the term state capitalism \\"originally arose to designate the phenomena which arise when a bourgeois state takes direct charge of the means of transport or of industrial enterprises\\" and is therefore a \\"partial negation\\" of capitalism. However, Trotsky rejected that description of the Soviet Union, claiming instead that it was a degenerated workers' state. After World War II, most Trotskyists accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being deformed workers' states. However, alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a new class theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, Cuba, China and other self-proclaimed socialist states. The discussion goes back to internal debates in the Left Opposition during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Ante Ciliga, a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many within the Left Opposition to a theory of state capitalism influenced by Gavril Myasnikov's Workers Group and other left communist factions.Philippe Bourrinet, \\"An Ambiguous Journey\\" On release and returning to activity in the International Left Opposition, Ciliga \\"was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles\\". George Orwell, who was an anti-Stalinist leftist like Ciliga, used the term in his Homage to Catalonia (1938). After 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the Johnson‚ÄìForest Tendency of C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three Five Year Plans alongside readings of Marx's early humanist writings.Dunayevskaya, Raya (1941). \\"The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a Capitalist Society\\".

Another is that of Tony Cliff, associated with the International Socialist Tendency and the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones.Aufheben Cliff and the neo-Trotskyist theory of the USSR as state capitalist in What Was The USSR? A relatively recent text by Stephen Resnick and Richard D. Wolff, titled Class Theory and History, explores what they term state capitalism in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century. Other left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies include bureaucratic collectivism, deformed workers' states, degenerated workers' states and new class.  Maoists and anti-revisionist Marxist‚ÄìLeninists  In the common program set up by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, in effect the country's interim constitution, state capitalism meant an economic system of corporatism. It provided as follows: \\"Whenever necessary and possible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism\\". From 1956 to the late 1970s, the Communist Party of China and their Maoist or anti- revisionist adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of Nikita Khrushchev and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled \\"socialist\\" states.The Economics of Revisionism by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967. This was involved in the ideological Sino‚ÄìSoviet split. After Mao Zedong's death, amidst the supporters of the Cultural Revolution and the Gang of Four, most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the Communist Party of China which likewise distanced itself from these former fraternal groups. The related theory of Hoxhaism was developed in 1978, largely by Socialist Albanian President Enver Hoxha, who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and revisionist economic policies.Imperialism and the Revolution by Enver Hoxha, 1978. Most current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being state capitalist from a certain point in their history onwards‚Äîmost commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and anti-revisionists also sometimes use the term social imperialism to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence‚Äîtheir phrase, \\"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds\\" denotes this. = By liberal economists = Murray Rothbard, who advanced a right- libertarian analysis of state capitalism Murray Rothbard, an anarcho- capitalist philosopher, used the term state capitalism interchangeably with the term state monopoly capitalism and used it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers. Ludwig von Mises, who described state capitalism as a form of state socialism Rothbard distinguished it from laissez-faire capitalism, where big business is not protected from market forces. This usage dates from the 1960s, when Harry Elmer Barnes described the post-New Deal economy of the United States as \\"state capitalism\\". More recently, Andrei Illarionov, former economic adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, resigned in December 2005, protesting Russia's \\"embracement of state capitalism\\". The term state capitalism is not used by classical liberals to describe the public ownership of the means of production. The explanation why is given by the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises, who argued: > The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels > for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by > another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic > problem of Socialism ‚Äî until it becomes obvious that nothing has been > changed but the name. The most recent slogan is \\"State Capitalism.\\" It is > not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be > called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, > Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the > \\"classic\\" ideal of egalitarian Socialism. = By Italian Fascists = Benito Mussolini, who claimed that the modern phase of capitalism is state socialism \\"turned on its head\\" On economic issues, Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would \\"lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than state socialism turned on its head. In either event, [whether the outcome be state capitalism or state socialism] the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation\\".Mussolini, Benito; \\"Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933)\\". Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions. Fertig, 1978. Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or heroic capitalism (1830‚Äì1870), followed by static capitalism (1870‚Äì1914) and then reaching its final form of decadent capitalism, also known as supercapitalism beginning in 1914.Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta.

Mussolini claimed that at this stage of supercapitalism \\"[it] is then that a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary.

Due to the inability of businesses to operate properly when facing economic difficulties, Mussolini claimed that this proved that state intervention into the economy was necessary to stabilize the economy. Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the bourgeoisie could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism only if the concept of economic individualism were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.Salvemini, Gaetano. Under the Axe of Fascism. READ BOOKS, 2006. pp. 134. Private enterprise would control production, but it would be supervised by the state.Salvemini. p. 134. Italian Fascism presented the economic system of corporatism as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.  In Western countries and European studies  An alternate definition is that state capitalism is a close relationship between the government and private capitalism such as one in which the private capitalists produce for a guaranteed market. An example of this would be the military‚Äìindustrial complex in which autonomous entrepreneurial firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets. Both the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably Nikolai Bukharin, who in his book Imperialism and World Economy thought that advanced, imperialist countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former. State capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for national security. These may involve private investment as well. A government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include Neste, Equinor and OMV. There are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's creative destruction, the threat of revolution and any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill-equipped to inspire innovation. Several European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the European Union. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on The Futures of European Capitalism, in which she divides modern European capitalism in three groups, namely market, managed and state. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-corporatist model. The author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism. A general theory of capitalist forms, whereby state capitalism is a particular case, was developed by Ernesto Screpanti, who argued that Soviet-type economies of the 20th century used state capitalism to sustain processes of primitive accumulation.Ernesto Screpanti, Capitalist Forms and the Essence of Capitalism, \\"Review of International Political Economy\\", vol. 6, n. 1, 1999; Ernesto Screpanti, The Fundamental Institutions of Capitalism, Routledge, London 2001. In their historical analysis of the Soviet Union, Marxist economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.Resnick, Stephen; Wolff, Richard D. (2002). Class Theory and History: Capitalism and Communism in the U.S.S.R. London: Routledge. = State monopoly capitalism = The theory of state monopoly capitalism was initially a neo-Stalinist doctrine popularised after World War II. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or oligopolistic businesses from competition by smaller firms. The main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a monopoly or cartel position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial oligarchy or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership. State monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in neo-Trotskyist theories of state capitalism as well as in libertarian anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.  Political implications  The strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the Joseph Stalin era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a people's democratic alliance under the leadership of the communist party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called monopoly for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the anti-monopoly alliance. At the 1965 Afro-Asian Conference, delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algeri, Che Guevara argued that \\"[e]ver since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries\\".Guevara, Che (24 February 1965). \\"At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria\\". In Deutschmann, David (2003). Che Guevara Reader: Writings on Politics & Revolution (2nd expanded ed.). New York: Che Guevara Studies Center and Ocean Press. . Retrieved 8 July 2020 ‚Äì via Marxists Internet Archive.  Neo-Trotskyist theory  In neo-Trotskyist theory, such an alliance was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of popular fronts, or on political opportunism, said to be incompatible either with a permanent revolution or with the principle of independent working class political action. The state in Soviet-type societies was redefined by the neo-Trotskyists as being also state-monopoly capitalist. There was no difference between the West and the East in this regard. Consequently, some kind of anti-bureaucratic revolution was said to be required, but different Trotskyist groups quarreled about what form such a revolution would need to take, or could take. Some Trotskyists believed the anti-bureaucratic revolution would happen spontaneously, inevitably and naturally, others believed it needed to be organised‚Äîthe aim being to establish a society owned and operated by the working class. According to the neo-Trotskyists, the communist party could not play its leading role because it did not represent the interests of the working class.  Criticism  When Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that \\"under capitalism anarchy of production reigns\\".The Case of Eugene Varga Raya Dunayevskaya 1949. Critics of the stamocap theory (e.g. Ernest Mandel and Leo Kofler) claimed the following: * Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter- capitalist competition, the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the law of value. * Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the state and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of domination which in reality did not exist in that way. * Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of neoliberal ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state's influence in the economy. * Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the communist party, or rather its central committee, played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party or its central committee. = In popular culture = * WALL-E has the \\"Buy n' Large\\" corporation, which acted as the de facto and possibly de jure government in the decades before and after the evacuation of Earth. * The Druuge, an alien race in Star Control, are governed by the Crimson Corporation which owns the Druuge home planet and everything on it. All Druuge are employees and/or shareholders of this corporation and Druuge who lose their jobs are immediately executed for stealing the planet's air, owned by the company, by breathing it.  Current forms in the 21st century  State capitalism is distinguished from capitalist mixed economies where the state intervenes in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates businesses for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed- market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as corporations, companies or business enterprises. = Mainland China = Many analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century.Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives, by Vahan Janjigian, forbes.com, Mar. 22 2010.The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism, by Gady Epstein, forbes.com, Aug. 31 2010.The Economist (2012). \\"State Capitalism: The Visible Hand\\". Special Report. In his book The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations, political scientist Ian Bremmer describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the free market economies of the developed world, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Bremmer draws a broad definition of state capitalism as such: Following on Bremmer, Aligica, and TarkoAligica, Paul and Vlad Tarko (2012). \\"State Capitalism and the Rent-SeekingConjecture\\", Constitutional Political Economy 23(4): 357-379 further develop the theory that state capitalism in countries like modern day China and Russia is an example of a rent-seeking society. They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power. In his article \\"We're All State Capitalists Now\\", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University Niall Ferguson warns against \\"an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps. The reality is that most countries are arranged along a spectrum where both the intent and the extent of state intervention in the economy vary\\". He then notes: \\"The real contest of our time is not between a state-capitalist China and a market-capitalist America, with Europe somewhere in the middle. It is a contest that goes on within all three regions as we all struggle to strike the right balance between the economic institutions that generate wealth and the political institutions that regulate and redistribute it.\\" In the common program set up by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, in effect the country's interim constitution, state capitalism meant an economic system of corporatism. It provided as follows: \\"Whenever necessary and possible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism.\\" Analysis of the Chinese model and the socialist market economy by the economists Julan Du and Chenggang Xu finds that the contemporary economic system of the People's Republic of China represents a state capitalist system as opposed to a market socialist system. The reason for this categorization is the existence of financial markets in the Chinese economic system, which are absent in the market socialist literature and in the classic models of market socialism; and that state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being equitably distributed among the population in a basic income/social dividend or similar scheme, which are major features in the market socialist literature. They conclude that China is neither a form of market socialism nor a stable form of capitalism.Market Socialism or Capitalism? Evidence from Chinese Financial Market Development, by Julan Du and Chenggang Xu. 2005. IEA 2005 Round Table on Market and Socialism. Despite these claims, the Chinese government maintains that these reforms are actually the primary stage of socialism and the Chinese Communist Party remains nominally dedicated to establishing a socialist society and subsequently developing into full communism. = Taiwan = Some Taiwanese economists refer to Taiwan's economy model as party-state capitalism. Taiwan's economy has been classified as a state capitalist system influenced by its Leninist model of political control, a legacy which still lingers in the decision-making process. Taiwan's economy includes a number of state-owned enterprises, but the Taiwanese state's role in the economy shifted from that of an entrepreneur to a minority investor in companies alongside the democratization agenda of the late 1980s. = Norway = Modern Norwegian state capitalism has its origins in public ownership of the country's oil reserves and in the country's post-World War II social democratic reforms. The government of Norway has ownership stakes in many of the country's largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% of the Oslo stock market and operates the country's largest non-listed companies including Equinor and Statkraft. The government also operates a sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund of Norway, whose partial objective is to prepare Norway for a post-oil future. = Singapore = Singapore has attracted some of the world's most powerful corporations through business friendly legislation and through the encouragement of Western style corporatism, with close cooperation between the state and corporations. Singapore's large holdings of government-linked companies and the state's close cooperation with business are defining aspects of the economy of Singapore. Singapore's government owns controlling shares in many government-linked companies and directs investment through sovereign wealth funds, an arrangement commonly cited as state capitalism.\\"The True Meaning of the 'Singapore Model': State Capitalism and Urban Planning\\", by Shatkin, Gavin.

This cyst, called a syrinx, can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord. The damage may result in loss of feeling, paralysis, weakness, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, and extremities. Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. It may also lead to a cape- like bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation along the upper chest and arms. Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms. These symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and, often more critically, on the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord. Syringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000 people,Brewis M, Poskanzer DC, Rolland C, et al., \\"Neurological disease in an English city\\". Acta Neurologica Scand Suppl 24:1--89, 1966. with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood. Signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing, straining, or myelopathy.  Signs and symptoms  Syringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms, due to damage to the spinal cord. Patients may experience severe chronic pain, abnormal sensations and loss of sensation, particularly in the hands. Some patients experience paralysis or paresis, temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, leading to abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem, as in syringobulbia, vocal cord paralysis, ipsilateral tongue wasting, trigeminal nerve sensory loss, and other signs may be present.Greenberg, David A, et al.: Clinical Neurology. 5th ed. Feb 9, 2002. Rarely, bladder stones can occur at the onset of weakness in the lower extremities.Nishida, Takayasu, et al. \\"A large bladder stone caused by syringomyelia\\" . Japanese Journal of Clinical Urology, Vol.60, No. 6, pp 413-415, 2006. . Classically, syringomyelia spares the dorsal column/medial lemniscus of the spinal cord, leaving pressure, vibration, touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities. Neuropathic arthropathy, also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia. The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time.\\"Neuropathic Arthropathy of the Shoulder (Charcot Shoulder): Clinical Commentary\\" Medscape. Accessed 9 January 2011.  Cause  Generally, there are two forms of syringomyelia: congenital and acquired. Syringomyelia is generally a chronic disorder that occurs over time, resulting in muscular atrophy. Acquired Syringomyelia can be caused by a serious physical trauma to the body such as in a road traffic accident. Syringomyelia can also be classified into communicating and noncommunicating forms. Communicating typically occurs due to lesions on the foramen magnum and noncommunicating occurring due to other spinal cord diseases. =Congenital= The first major form relates to an abnormality of the brain called an Arnold‚ÄìChiari malformation or Chiari malformation. This is the most common cause of syringomyelia, where the anatomic abnormality, which may be due to a small posterior fossa, causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal. A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Here, symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining, called a valsalva maneuver, or any activity that causes cerebrospinal fluid pressure to fluctuate suddenly. Some patients, however, may have long periods of stability. Some patients with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus, in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull, or a condition called arachnoiditis, in which a covering of the spinal cord‚Äîthe arachnoid membrane‚Äîis inflamed. Some cases of syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare. =Acquired= The second major form of syringomyelia occurs as a complication of trauma, meningitis, hemorrhage, a tumor, or arachnoiditis. Here, the syrinx or cyst develops in a segment of the spinal cord damaged by one of these conditions. The syrinx then starts to expand. This is sometimes referred to as noncommunicating syringomyelia. Symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury, starting with pain, weakness, and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma. The primary symptom of post-traumatic syringomyelia (often referred to using the abbreviation of PTS) is pain, which may spread upward from the site of injury. Symptoms, such as pain, numbness, weakness, and disruption in temperature sensation, may be limited to one side of the body. Syringomyelia can also adversely affect sweating, sexual function, and, later, bladder and bowel control. A typical cause of PTS would be a car accident or similar trauma involving a whiplash injury. What can make PTS difficult to diagnose is the fact that symptoms can often first appear long after the actual cause of the syrinx occurred (e.g., a car accident occurring and then the patient first experiencing PTS symptoms such as pain, loss of sensation, and reduced ability on the skin to feel varying degrees of hot and cold a number of months after the car accident).  Pathogenesis  The pathogenesis of syringomyelia is debated. The cerebrospinal fluid also serves to cushion the brain. Excess cerebrospinal fluid in the central canal of the spinal cord is called hydromyelia. This term refers to increased cerebrospinal fluid that is contained within the ependyma of the central canal. When fluid dissects into the surrounding white matter forming a cystic cavity or syrinx, the term syringomyelia is applied. As these conditions coexist in the majority of cases, the term syringohydromyelia is applied. The terms are used interchangeably. It has been observed that obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces in the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation, and alleviation of the obstruction may improve symptoms. A number of pathological conditions can cause an obstruction of the normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces. These include Chiari malformation, spinal arachnoiditis, scoliosis, spinal vertebrae misalignment, spinal tumors, spina bifida, and others. The reasons that blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid space within the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation are not fully understood although a small posterior fossa is one known cause. It is unclear if syrinx fluid originates from bulk movement of cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal cord, from bulk transmural movement of blood fluids through the spinal vasculature into the syrinx, or from a combination of both. Recent work suggests that central nervous system compliance is the underlying problem for the central nervous system, and also that hydrocephalus and syringomyelia have related causes.  Diagnosis  thumb Physicians now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose syringomyelia. The MRI radiographer takes images of body anatomy, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail. This test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor. MRI is safe, painless, and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia. The physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. One of these is called electromyography (EMG), which show possible lower motor neuron damage. In addition, computed axial tomography (CT) scans of a patient's head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus. Like MRI and CT scans, another test, called a myelogram, uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space. Since the introduction of MRI, this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia. The possible causes are trauma, tumors, and congenital defects. It is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area. Symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and include pain, decreased sensation of touch, weakness, and loss of muscle tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal CT, myelogram or MRI of the spinal cord. The cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression. Furthermore, evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervical-located syrinx.  Treatment  =Surgery= The first step after diagnosis is finding a neurosurgeon who is experienced in the treatment of syringomyelia. Surgery is the treatment for syringomyelia. Evaluation of the condition is necessary because syringomyelia can remain stationary for long periods of time, and in some cases progress rapidly. Surgery of the spinal cord has certain characteristic risks associated with it, and the benefits of a surgical procedure on the spine have to be weighed against the possible complications associated with any procedure. Surgical treatment is aimed at correcting the condition that allowed the syrinx to form. It is vital to bear in mind that the drainage of a syrinx does not necessarily mean the elimination of the syrinx-related symptoms but rather is aimed at stopping progression. In cases involving an Arnold‚ÄìChiari malformation, the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the cerebellum at the base of the skull and upper cervical spine without entering the brain or spinal cord. This often results in flattening or disappearance of the primary syrinx or cavity, over time, as the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid is restored. If a tumor is causing syringomyelia, removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice, if this is considered to be safe. Surgery results in stabilization or modest improvement in symptoms for most patients. Delay in treatment may result in irreversible spinal cord injury. Recurrence of syringomyelia after surgery may make additional operations necessary; these may not be completely successful over the long term. In some patients it may also be necessary to drain the syrinx, which can be accomplished using a catheter, drainage tubes, and valves. This system is also known as a shunt. Shunts are used in both the communicating and noncommunicating forms of the disorder. First, the surgeon must locate the syrinx. Then, the shunt is placed into it with the other end draining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into a cavity, usually the abdomen. This type of shunt is called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and is particularly useful in cases involving hydrocephalus. By draining syrinx fluid, a shunt can arrest the progression of symptoms and relieve pain, headache, and tightness. Syringomyelia shunts are not always successful and can become blocked as with other central nervous system shunts. The decision to use a shunt requires extensive discussion between doctor and patient, as this procedure carries with it greater risk of injury to the spinal cord, infection, blockage, or hemorrhage and may not necessarily work for all patients. Draining the syrinx more quickly does not produce better outcomes, but a shunt may be required if the fluid in the syrinx is otherwise unable to drain. In the case of trauma- related syringomyelia, the surgeon operates at the level of the initial injury. The syrinx collapses at surgery, but a tube or shunt is usually necessary to prevent re-expansion. =Other= Surgery is not always recommended for syringomyelia patients. For many patients, the main treatment is analgesia. Physicians specializing in pain management can develop a medication and treatment plan to ameliorate pain. Medications to combat any neuropathic pain symptoms such as shooting and stabbing pains (e.g. gabapentin or pregabalin) would be first-line choices. Opiates are usually prescribed for pain for management of this condition. Facet joint injections are not indicated for the treatment of syringomyelia. Drugs have no curative value as a treatment for syringomyelia. Radiation is used rarely, and is of little benefit except in the presence of a tumor. In these cases, it can halt the extension of a cavity and may help to alleviate pain. In the absence of symptoms, syringomyelia is usually not treated. In addition, a physician may recommend not treating the condition in patients of advanced age or in cases where there is no progression of symptoms. Whether treated or not, many patients will be told to avoid activities that involve straining. Since the natural history of syringomyelia is poorly understood, a conservative approach may be recommended. When surgery is not yet advised, patients should be carefully monitored. Periodic MRI's and physical evaluations should be scheduled at the recommendation of a qualified physician.  Research  thumb The precise causes of syringomyelia are still unknown, although blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid has been known to be an important factor since the 1970s. Scientists in the UK and US continue to explore the mechanisms that lead to the formation of syrinxes in the spinal cord. It has been demonstrated that a block of the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Duke University in America and Warwick University are conducting research to explore genetic features of syringomyelia.\\"Information about a Genetic Research Study for Chiari Type I Malformation (CMI) with or without Syringomyelia.\\" Surgical techniques are also being refined by the neurosurgical research community. Successful procedures expand the area around the cerebellum and spinal cord, improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and thereby reducing the syrinx. It is also important to understand the role of birth defects in the development of hindbrain malformations that can lead to syringomyelia, as syringomyelia is a feature of intrauterine life and is also associated with spina bifida. Learning when these defects occur during the development of the fetus can help with the understanding of this and similar disorders, and may lead to preventive treatment that can stop the formation of some birth abnormalities. Diagnostic technology is another area for continued research. MRI has enabled scientists to see the situation within the spine, including syringomyelia, before any symptoms appear. A new technology, known as dynamic MRI, allows investigators to view spinal fluid flow within the syrinx. CT scans allow physicians to see abnormalities in the brain, and other diagnostic tests have also improved greatly with the availability of new, non-toxic, contrast dyes. The Chiari & Syringomyelia Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit organization that was founded in October 2007 with the goal of raising awareness and finding a cure for Chiari malformation, syringomyelia and related disorders. In March 2019 plans were announced to work with the family of the famous golfer to re- brand the organization the Bobby Jones Chiari & Syringomyelia Foundation.

Among his peers and fans, Aragon√©s is widely regarded as \\"the world's fastest cartoonist\\". The Comics Journal has described Aragon√©s as \\"one of the most prolific and brilliant cartoonists of his generation\\". Mad editor Al Feldstein said, \\"He could have drawn the whole magazine if we'd let him.\\" Early life Born in Sant Mateu, Castell√≥n, Spain, Aragon√©s emigrated with his family to France, due to the Spanish Civil War, before settling in Mexico at age 6. Aragon√©s had a passion for art since early childhood. As one anecdote goes, Aragon√©s was once left alone in a room by his parents with a box of crayons. His parents returned sometime later to find that he had covered the wall in hundreds upon hundreds of drawings. Aragon√©s recalled his early difficulties in Mexico, saying, \\"I didn't have too many friends because I had just arrived. You're the new kid, and you have an accent. I've always had an accent ... When the other kids make fun of you, you don't want to get out of the house. So you stay at home, and what do you do? You take pencils and start drawing.\\" Aragon√©s used his drawing skills to assimilate. \\"The earliest money I ever made was with drawings\\", he remembered. \\"The teacher would give us homework, which would consist of copying Chapter Eleven, including the illustrations ... a beetle or a plant, the pistil of a flower, or soldiers ‚Äì that type of thing. All the kids who couldn't draw would leave a square where the drawing was, and I would charge them to draw that. The equivalent of a few pennies ... That's probably why I draw so fast, because I drew so many of them.\\" He made his first professional sale in 1954 when a high school classmate submitted his work to a magazine without telling Aragon√©s. He continued to sell gag cartoons to magazines while studying architecture at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he learned pantomime under the direction of Alejandro Jodorowsky. \\"I joined the class\\", Aragon√©s recalled, \\"not to become a mime but to apply its physical aspects of movement to my comics.\\" In 1962, Aragon√©s moved to the United States. Art collector Jeff Singh spoke with Sergio at a convention and wrote. \\"A friend told me that Sergio's father was a film director/producer in Mexico. I asked about this and it is true. His father didn't want the family on set for fear of actors and workers befriending the family in order to win favor with the father. Among the projects worked on, his father did work for the Irish McCalla TV series Sheena, Queen of the Jungle which was filmed in Mexico (in 1955). On one of the rare occasions Sergio was on set the stuntman didn't show up. Sergio had to put on the Sheena costume and did some stunts which I understand included swinging from a vine and diving into water. He was in his early teens at this time. He said they were pretty distant shots as despite the wig and costume he didn't look at all like Irish. Irish was not on set that day and he lamented never having got to meet her.\\" Arrival in the United States According to the artist, he arrived in New York in 1962 with nothing but 20 dollars and his portfolio of drawings. After working odd jobs around the city, Aragon√©s went to Mad's offices on Madison Avenue hoping to sell some of his cartoons. \\"I didn't think I had anything that belonged in Mad,\\" said Aragon√©s. \\"I didn't have any satire. I didn't have any articles. But everybody was telling me, 'Oh, you should go to Mad.\\" Since his knowledge of English was not very extensive, he asked for the only Mad artist he knew of that spoke Spanish, Cuban-born artist Antonio Proh√≠as, creator of the comic strip \\"Spy vs. Spy\\". Aragon√©s hoped Proh√≠as could serve as an interpreter between him and the Mad editors. According to Aragon√©s, this proved to be a mistake, since Proh√≠as knew even less English than him. Proh√≠as did receive Aragon√©s very enthusiastically and, with difficulty, introduced the young artist to the Mad editors as \\"Sergio, my brother from Mexico,\\" temporarily leading to even further confusion, as the Mad editors thought he was \\"Sergio Proh√≠as.\\" Mad editor Al Feldstein and publisher Bill Gaines liked what they saw, and Aragon√©s became a contributor to the magazine in 1963. His first sale was an assortment of astronaut cartoons which the editors arranged into a themed article. When associate editor Jerry DeFuccio encouraged Aragon√©s to submit more material in the future, the cartoonist took it to heart, producing a full article on motorcycles overnight. He returned to the Mad offices the following morning, and made his second sale. With little money and no connections in America, Aragon√©s became so ubiquitous that publisher Gaines allowed him to sleep overnight in his office. \\"I don't think any other company would have been so generous or friendly,\\" Aragon√©s recalled 57 years later. With the publication of the 500th issue in 2009, Aragon√©s' work had appeared in 424 issues of Mad, second only to Al Jaffee (451 issues). \\"They told me, 'Make Mad your home,'\\" said Aragon√©s, \\"and I took it literally.\\" Marginals The cartoonist has a featured section in every issue called \\"A Mad Look At...\\", typically featuring 4‚Äì5 pages of speechless gag strips that are all related to a single subject, such as \\"Gambling,\\" \\"UFOs\\" or \\"Pizza.\\" Aragon√©s became famous for his wordless \\"drawn-out dramas\\" or \\"marginals\\" which were inserted into the margins and between panels of the magazine. The drawings are both horizontal and vertical, and occasionally extend around corners. Prior to Aragon√©s' arrival at Mad, the magazine had sometimes filled its margins with text jokes under the catch-all heading \\"Marginal Thinking.\\" Aragon√©s convinced Feldstein to use his cartoons by creating a dummy sample issue with his Marginals drawn along the edges. The staff of Mad enjoyed his marginals, but did not expect him to be able to maintain the steady stream of small cartoons needed for each issue. Aragon√©s has provided marginals for every issue of Mad since 1963 except one (his contributions to that issue were lost by the Post Office). Associate Editor Jerry DeFuccio said, \\"Writing the 'Marginal Thinking' marginals had always been a pain in the butt. Sergio made the pain go away.\\"Evanier, Mad Art p. 127 Aragon√©s is a very prolific artist; Al Jaffee once said, \\"Sergio has, quite literally, drawn more cartoons on napkins in restaurants than most cartoonists draw in their entire careers.\\"Evanier, Mad Art pp. 128‚Äì129 In 2002, writer Mark Evanier estimated that Aragon√©s had written and drawn more than 12,000 gag cartoons for Mad alone.Evanier, Mad Art pp. 127‚Äì128 Comic books In 1967, he began writing and illustrating full stories for various DC Comics titles, including The Adventures of Jerry Lewis, Angel and the Ape, Inferior Five, Young Romance, and for various horror anthologies. He wrote or plotted stories that were illustrated by other artists. Aragon√©s helped create DC's Western series Bat Lash and the humor title Plop!. Aragon√©s broke with DC when the company began insisting on work- for-hire contracts; when Aragon√©s balked, an editor tore up Aragon√©s' paycheck in front of his face. He'd been trying obliquely to sell a comic book premise to DC or Marvel, but neither company would allow Aragon√©s to retain the copyright. \\"I didn't want anyone stealing the idea\\", said Aragon√©s, \\"and they weren't able to talk on a theoretical basis.\\" Groo the Wanderer vol. 2 #1 (March 1984) Aragon√©s had created the humorous barbarian comic book Groo the Wanderer with Mark Evanier in the late 1970s, but the character did not appear in print until 1982. Groo was so named because Aragon√©s sought a name which meant nothing in any language. Evanier's role originally was as something of a translator, as Aragon√©s was still somewhat shaky at expressing his ideas in English. Eventually, the two began collaborating on story ideas, and there have been several Groo stories in which Evanier is credited as the sole writer. Aragon√©s has since become fluent in English. The other regular contributors to the comic book are letterer Stan Sakai (himself the creator/artist of Usagi Yojimbo), and colorist Tom Luth. As a creator-owned series, Groo has survived the bankruptcy of a number of publishers, a fact which led to the industry joke that publishing the series was a precursor to a publisher's demise. The title was initially published by Pacific Comics, briefly by Eclipse Comics, then Marvel Comics under their since-discontinued Epic Comics imprint which allowed creators to retain copyrights, then Image Comics, and currently Dark Horse Comics. On December 2, 1982, Marty Feldman died from a heart attack in a hotel room in Mexico City. This occurred during the making of the film Yellowbeard. Aragon√©s, who was filming nearby and was dressed for his role as an armed policeman, had introduced himself to Feldman that night. He encountered Feldman abruptly, startling and frightening him, which may have induced Feldman's heart attack. Aragon√©s has recounted the story with the punchline \\"I killed Marty Feldman\\". The story was converted into a strip in Aragon√©s' issue of DC Comics' Solo. In the early 1980s, Aragon√©s collaborated with the Belgian cartoonist Fran√ßois Walth√©ry on Natacha, l'hotesse de l'air, a well known series from the magazine Spirou. This story was titled \\"Instantan√© pour Caltech\\". Aragon√©s appears in the strip as a police officer character ( / DUPUIS Editor ‚Äì Belgium). Aragon√©s has written and drawn many other comic books including: * \\"Abel's Fables\\", a page of one panel gag comics in House of Secrets featuring Abel. (1971‚Äì1972, DC Comics) * Plop!

Aragon√©s' work can be found in other compilations, including The Big Book of the Weird, Wild West, in which he illustrates a retelling of the Donner Party incident. His cartoons have appeared in a series of paperback editions for Mad. Television In addition to printed work, Aragon√©s has worked in television animation. He worked on the NBC program Speak Up America (1980) where he would draw during the show. His segments were used for many years on the Dick Clark Bloopers programs. Frequent collaborator Mark Evanier related an anecdote from their time on the short-lived 1983 NBC series The Half Hour Comedy Hour, which featured a guest appearance by model Jayne Kennedy: > This was one of the most beautiful women in the world, and she wore this > dress that was very revealing. So much so, the censors wouldn't let us put > her on the air in it without adding some material. So we're all talking to > her, the writers and whoever, just in awe of this woman. And Sergio comes > walking in looking like a homeless person, carrying his portfolio. And Jayne > sees him and she shouts, 'Sergio!' and she runs over and starts kissing him > passionately. They'd worked together before, it turned out. But Johnny > Carson comes walking out into the hallway and he thinks Jayne Kennedy is > being sexually assaulted by a homeless person in the NBC hallways. He came > over to make sure she was okay. She said it was fine, that she knew him, and > I said, 'It's okay, he's a cartoonist.' So Johnny gives that classic look > and he says, 'I knew I should have taken up drawing.' In 2009, Aragon√©s told an interviewer, \\"I'm thinking and laughing all day long. Every time I think of a joke, I'm also telling myself a new joke. It's a great way to live.\\" In 2020, Aragon√©s guest-starred in The Casagrandes episode \\"Mexican Makeover\\" voicing Lupe's pet parrot Paco. Awards Aragon√©s at the 1982 San Diego Comic Con (today called Comic-Con International). Aragon√©s' work has won him numerous awards. He won Shazam Awards for Best Inker (Humor Division) in 1972 for his work on Mad Magazine and for Best Humor Story in 1972 for \\"The Poster Plague\\" from House of Mystery No. 202 with Steve Skeates. Aragon√©s received an Inkpot Award in 1976. He won the Harvey Award Special Award for Humor in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001.

Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market. An early form of trade, barter, saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without the use of money. When either bartering party started to involve precious metals, these gained symbolic as well as practical importance. Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. The invention of money (and later of credit, paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade. In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity‚Äîincluding production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere. For example: different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations. Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location Compare peddling and other types of retail trade: (such as a department store, boutique or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is defined as traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services. Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.  Etymology  Trade is from Middle English trade (\\"path, course of conduct\\"), introduced into English by Hanseatic merchants, from Middle Low German trade (\\"track, course\\"), from Old Saxon trada (\\"spoor, track\\"), from Proto-Germanic *trad≈ç (\\"track, way\\"), and cognate with Old English tredan (\\"to tread\\"). Commerce is derived from the Latin commercium, from cum \\"together\\" and merx, \\"merchandise.\\" History =Prehistory= Trade originated with human communication in prehistoric times. Trading was the main facility of prehistoric people, who bartered goods and services from each other before the innovation of modern-day currency. Peter Watson dates the history of long-distance commerce from circa 150,000 years ago. Watson (2005), Introduction. In the Mediterranean region, the earliest contact between cultures involved members of the species Homo sapiens, principally using the Danube river, at a time beginning 35,000‚Äì30,000 BP.

The Phoenicians were noted sea traders, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea, and as far north as Britain for sources of tin to manufacture bronze. For this purpose they established trade colonies the Greeks called emporia. From the beginning of Greek civilization until the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, a financially lucrative trade brought valuable spice to Europe from the far east, including India and China. Roman commerce allowed its empire to flourish and endure.

Trade, however, continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, the Middle East, India, China, and Southeast Asia. Some trade did occur in the west. For instance, Radhanites were a medieval guild or group (the precise meaning of the word is lost to history) of Jewish merchants who traded between the Christians in Europe and the Muslims of the Near East. Indo-Pacific Austronesian proto-historic and historic maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean The first true maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean was by the Austronesian peoples of Island Southeast Asia, who built the first ocean-going ships. They established trade routes with Southern India and Sri Lanka as early as 1500 BC, ushering an exchange of material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, sewn-plank boats, and paan) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, bananas, and sugarcane); as well as connecting the material cultures of India and China. Indonesians, in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamaran and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the Westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by the first half of the first millennium AD. It continued up to historic times, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road.  Mesoamerica  axe money used as currency in Mesoamerica. It had a fixed worth of 8,000 cacao seeds, which were also used as currency. The emergence of exchange networks in the Pre-Columbian societies of and near to Mexico are known to have occurred within recent years before and after 1500 BCE.K G Hirth ‚Äì American Antiquity Vol. 43, No. 1 (Jan., 1978), pp. 35‚Äì45 Retrieved 2012-06-28 Trade networks reached north to Oasisamerica. There is evidence of established maritime trade with the cultures of northwestern South America and the Caribbean. Middle Ages During the Middle Ages, commerce developed in Europe by trading luxury goods at trade fairs. Wealth became converted into movable wealth or capital. Banking systems developed where money on account was transferred across national boundaries. Hand to hand markets became a feature of town life, and were regulated by town authorities. Western Europe established a complex and expansive trade network with cargo ships being the main workhorse for the movement of goods, Cogs and Hulks are two examples of such cargo ships. Many ports would develop their own extensive trade networks. The English port city of Bristol traded with peoples from what is modern day Iceland, all along the western coast of France, and down to what is now Spain.A map showing the main trade routes for goods within late medieval Europe. During the Middle Ages, Central Asia was the economic center of the world.Beckwith (2011), p. xxiv. The Sogdians dominated the East-West trade route known as the Silk Road after the 4th century CE up to the 8th century CE, with Suyab and Talas ranking among their main centers in the north. They were the main caravan merchants of Central Asia. From the 8th to the 11th century, the Vikings and Varangians traded as they sailed from and to Scandinavia. Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while Varangians to Russia. The Hanseatic League was an alliance of trading cities that maintained a trade monopoly over most of Northern Europe and the Baltic, between the 13th and 17th centuries. =The Age of Sail and the Industrial Revolution= Vasco da Gama pioneered the European Spice trade in 1498 when he reached Calicut after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and helped spur the Age of Discovery in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight, sometimes rivaling gold. From 1070 onward, kingdoms in West Africa became significant members of global trade. This came initially through the movement of gold and other resources sent out by Muslim traders on the Trans-Saharan trading network. Later, West Africa exported gold, spices, cloth, and slaves to European traders such as the Portuguese, Dutch, and English. This was often in exchange for cloth, iron, or cowrie shells which were used locally as currency. Founded in 1352, the Bengal Sultanate was a major trading nation in the world and often referred to by the Europeans as the richest country to trade with.Nanda, J. N (2005). In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Portuguese gained an economic advantage in the Kingdom of Kongo due to different philosophies of trade. Whereas Portuguese traders concentrated on the accumulation of capital, in Kongo spiritual meaning was attached to many objects of trade. According to economic historian Toby Green, in Kongo \\"giving more than receiving was a symbol of spiritual and political power and privilege.\\" In the 16th century, the Seventeen Provinces were the center of free trade, imposing no exchange controls, and advocating the free movement of goods. Trade in the East Indies was dominated by Portugal in the 16th century, the Dutch Republic in the 17th century, and the British in the 18th century. The Spanish Empire developed regular trade links across both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Danzig in the 17th century, a port of the Hanseatic League In 1776, Adam Smith published the paper An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. It criticized Mercantilism, and argued that economic specialization could benefit nations just as much as firms. Since the division of labour was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more productive. Smith said that he considered all rationalizations of import and export controls \\"dupery\\", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries. In 1799, the Dutch East India Company, formerly the world's largest company, became bankrupt, partly due to the rise of competitive free trade. Berber trade with Timbuktu, 1853. = 19th century = In 1817, David Ricardo, James Mill and Robert Torrens showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of comparative advantage. In Principles of Political Economy and Taxation Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in economics: : When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit. The ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to imports. John Stuart Mill proved that a country with monopoly pricing power on the international market could manipulate the terms of trade through maintaining tariffs, and that the response to this might be reciprocity in trade policy. Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier. This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the economic surplus of trade would accrue to a country following reciprocal, rather than completely free, trade policies. This was followed within a few years by the infant industry scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that the government had the duty to protect young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to industrialize and out- compete English exporters. Milton Friedman later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.Price theory Milton Friedman =20th century= The Great Depression was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s. During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators. The lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression causing stagnation and inflation.(secondary) British Broadcasting Corporation ‚Äì history Only during the World War II the recession ended in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the Bretton Woods Agreement, intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions. It set up rules and institutions to regulate the international political economy: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements). These organizations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement. In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to promote free trade.(secondary) M Smith ‚Äì V. Gollancz, 1996 The European Union became the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods and services, the biggest export market for around 80 countries. =21st century= Today, trade is merely a subset within a complex system of companies which try to maximize their profits by offering products and services to the market (which consists both of individuals and other companies) at the lowest production cost. A system of international trade has helped to develop the world economy but, in combination with bilateral or multilateral agreements to lower tariffs or to achieve free trade, has sometimes harmed third-world markets for local products. =Free trade= Free trade advanced further in the late 20th century and early 2000s: * 1992 European Union lifted barriers to internal trade in goods and labour. * January 1, 1994 the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect. * 1994 The GATT Marrakech Agreement specified formation of the WTO. * January 1, 1995 World Trade Organization was created to facilitate free trade, by mandating mutual most favored nation trading status between all signatories. * EC was transformed into the European Union, which accomplished the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2002, through introducing the Euro, and creating this way a real single market between 13 member states as of January 1, 2007. * Int√©r√™ts des nations de l'Europe, d√©v√©lop√©s relativement au commerce (1766)2005, the Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed; It includes the United States and the Dominican Republic.  Perspectives  =Protectionism= Protectionism is the policy of restraining and discouraging trade between states and contrasts with the policy of free trade. This policy often takes the form of tariffs and restrictive quotas. Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the Great Depression and the onset of World War II. =Religion= Islamic teachings encourage trading (and condemn usury or interest).Nomani & Rahnema (1994), p. ?. \\"I want nine out of ten people from my Ummah (nation) as traders\\" and \\"Trader, who did trading in truth, and sold the right quantity and quality of goods, he will stand along with Prophets and Martyrs, on Judgment day\\".\\"O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities, but let there be among you traffic and trade by mutual good-will.\\" and \\"Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury.\\" Judeao-Christian teachings prohibit fraud and dishonest measures, and historically also forbade the charging of interest on loans. =Development of money= Roman denarius The first instances of money were objects with intrinsic value. This is called commodity money and includes any commonly available commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare seashells, whale's teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval Iraq, bread was used as an early form of money. In Mexico under Montezuma, cocoa beans were money. Currency was introduced as standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services. This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years. Numismatists have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of precious metal.Gold was an especially common form of early money, as described in Davies (2002). Trends =Doha rounds= The Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aimed to lower barriers to trade around the world, with a focus on making trade fairer for developing countries. Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich developed countries, represented by the G20, and the major developing countries. Agricultural subsidies are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been the hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on trade facilitation and capacity building. The Doha round began in Doha, Qatar, and negotiations were continued in: Canc√∫n, Mexico; Geneva, Switzerland; and Paris, France and Hong Kong. =China= Beginning around 1978, the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) began an experiment in economic reform. In contrast to the previous Soviet-style centrally planned economy, the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, which led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) Special Economic Zones located along the South-east coast. The reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, price and demand. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008, China's two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion. In 1991 China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, a trade-promotion forum. In 2001, it also joined the World Trade Organization. International trade International trade is the exchange of goods and services across national borders. In most countries, it represents a significant part of GDP. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, Amber Road), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of Industrialization, advanced transportation, globalization, multinational corporations, and outsourcing. Empirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as South Korea, which adopted a policy of export- oriented industrialization, and India, which historically had a more closed policy. South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions. =Trade sanctions= Trade sanctions against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action. An embargo, a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an embargo against Cuba for over 40 years. =Fair trade= The \\"fair trade\\" movement, also known as the \\"trade justice\\" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right. Importing firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of employment and commercial law. Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non- governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements. As such, it is a form of Protectionism.

Classically the term tambourine denotes an instrument with a drumhead, though some variants may not have a head at all. Tambourines are often used with regular percussion sets. They can be mounted, for example on a stand as part of a drum kit (and played with drum sticks), or they can be held in the hand and played by tapping or hitting the instrument. Tambourines come in many shapes with the most common being circular. It is found in many forms of music: Turkish folk music, Greek folk music, Italian folk music, classical music, Persian music, samba, gospel music, pop music, country music, and rock music. History The origin of the tambourine is unknown, but it appears in historical writings as early as 1700 BC and was used by ancient musicians in West Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, Greece and India. The tambourine passed to Europe by way of merchants or musicians.https://www.wpr.org/shows/tambourine-and-music-making-around-globe Tambourines were used in ancient Egypt, where they were known as the tof to the Hebrews, in which the instrument was mainly used in religious contexts. The word tambourine finds its origins in French tambourin, which referred to a long narrow drum used in Provence, the word being a diminutive of tambour \\"drum,\\" altered by influence of Arabic tunbur \\"drum\\". from the Middle Persian word tamb≈´r \\"lute, drum\\".

File:Triumph of Bacchus - Sousse (clipped tympanum).jpgMaenad playing a tympanum. Detail from the Triumph of Dionysus, on a Roman mosaic from Tunisia (3rd century AD) File:Recreation-Pearce- Highsmith-detail-2.jpegGirl playing a tambourine. Detail from Recreation (1896), by Charles Sprague Pearce. Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C. Playing The tambourine can be held in the hand or mounted on a stand, and can be played in numerous ways, from stroking or shaking the jingles to striking it sharply with the hand or a stick or using the tambourine to strike the leg or hip. =Tambourine rolls= There are several ways to achieve a tambourine roll. The easiest method is to rapidly rotate the hand holding the tambourine back and forth, pivoting at the wrist. Thumb roll An advanced playing technique is known as the thumb or finger roll. The middle finger or thumb is moved over the skin or rim of the tambourine, producing a fast roll from the jingles on the instrument. The thumb or middle finger of the hand not holding the tambourine is run around the head of the instrument approximately one centimeter from the rim with some pressure applied. If performed correctly, the finger should bounce along the head rapidly, producing the roll. Usually, the end of the roll is articulated using the heel of the hand or another finger. Beeswax or rosin is commonly smeared around the edges of the head to assist in the technique. These materials increase friction making it easier to execute. A continuous roll can be achieved by moving the thumb in a \\"figure of 8\\" pattern around the head. Popular music Lucie Skeaping playing a tambourine =Europe= Various European folk traditions include the tambourine. The Romani people used the tambourine as a percussion instrument, and it was often passed around the audience to collect money after a performance. In the late 1700s, the tambourine had a surge in popularity in England, with some composers of salon music writing parts for tambourine, indicating as many as 30 different playing strokes or moves. The tambourines of this era often had a circular hole in the frame for the thumb, as one of the moves was to spin the tambourine on the upright thumb. In the late 19th century, The Salvation Army codified the tambourine as one of their important rhythm instruments. They preferred the term \\"timbrel\\" which was taken from the Bible. By 1945, Salvation Army performances often entailed elaborate tambourine choreography performed by squads in para-military style, more for visual appeal than for musicality. =African American influence= Lady Tambourine performs in 2008 at New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in the gospel tent African American slaves were denied drums which might be used for long-distance communication. To supply rhythm in music, they turned to smaller percussion instruments such as the bones and the tambourine, as well as clapping and body percussion. The tambourine could accompany the singing of spirituals, and it was used for celebrations and dancing. The tambourine became one of the main instruments of the American minstrel show in the early 1800s, often performed by whites in blackface such as Ned Christy, or sometimes by actual black performers. On stage, the tambourine and bones players in minstrelsy stood to the far left and far right of the Interlocutor (master of ceremonies) and were titled Brother Tambo and Brother Bones: because of their position they were called the end men. The tambourine was also used in some vaudeville acts, including the 1840s dance and musical performances of Master Juba who was able to elicit a wide range of sounds from the instrument including the chugging of a steam train. Used for Pentecostal praise in revival meetings in the early 20th century, by the 1920s the tambourine was firmly established as the primary percussion instrument of gospel music. The tambourine was played by gospel groups and choirs, and carried prominently by singers who did not otherwise play an instrument, notably by Bessie Jones and Luther Magby. At the same time, the tambourine expanded from gospel music to various forms of African American popular music including blues and jazz. For instance, singer and guitarist Blind Roosevelt Graves was accompanied by his brother Uaroy on tambourine and voice, singing both sacred and secular songs. Singer-songwriter Josh White got his start as a child performing for handouts in the street with an exuberant tambourine performance, beating the instrument's drumhead on his elbows, knees, and head. In the 1950s as gospel elements were incorporated into rhythm and blues by African American singers such as Ray Charles, the tambourine often accompanied the changes. It continued its foray into popular music within the music of Motown. Motown singers and musicians often grew up with gospel music, and they carried the tambourine into pop performance. The Supremes performed with two tambourines ‚Äì more for choreography than percussion ‚Äì played by Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson standing apart from Diana Ross. Jack Ashford's distinctive tambourine playing was a dominant part of the rhythm section on many Motown records, for instance on the Miracles tune \\"Going to a Go-Go\\", and Marvin Gaye's \\"How Sweet It Is\\". Stevie Nicks performing in 1980 on a headless tambourine Inspired by African American examples, musicians of all races have used the tambourine in modern pop music. It was featured in \\"Green Tambourine\\", a busking-oriented song from the Lemon Pipers, a 1960s white American band. Similarly, the Byrds released \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" in 1964, a folk rock and psychedelic rock song about a dealer of illegal drugs. The tambourine part of the song serves to drive the beat forward. Bobbye Hall records on xylophone and headless tambourine in the early 1970s Singers who rarely play an instrument are likely to play the tambourine at concerts: among the most well-known examples are Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison of the Doors, Janis Joplin leading Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Stevie Nicks as part of Fleetwood Mac and as a solo performer. Very often, the instrument used in pop music is the headless tambourine or \\"jingle ring\\", lacking a drum head. The singer should, however, play the tambourine with the overall song arrangement in mind; in some cases, band members have purposely hidden the tambourine from an irresponsible lead singer who disregards the interplay of rhythm. On the other hand, skilled performers such as Jagger have brought a fine sense of timing to their tambourine playing. In the Rolling Stones' 1964 U.S. single of \\"Time Is on My Side\\", the less-known version, Jagger lays the tambourine on the front of the beat while Charlie Watts holds the snare to the back of the beat, which allows the longer decay time of the tambourine to synchronise with the snare at the end. The result is an intentional feeling of running to catch up. In jazz, the tambourine was used prominently but non-traditionally by percussionist Joe Texidor who backed Rahsaan Roland Kirk in 1969 on Volunteered Slavery. In 1960 when Nina Simone wanted to play the old minstrel song \\"Li'l Liza Jane\\" at the Newport Jazz Festival, she said \\"Where's my tambourine?\\", as heard on the album Nina Simone at Newport. Jazz drummer Herlin Riley often takes the stage while beating and shaking a tambourine, and he is featured on the tambourine in Wynton Marsalis's jazz oratorio Blood on the Fields, which tells the story of slavery in the US. Jazz, pop and rock drummers sometimes mount a headless tambourine in the drum kit. Some position the tambourine above the toms in the same manner as a cymbal, for instance, Nathan Followill of Kings of Leon, and Larry Mullen Jr of U2. Bill Ward of Black Sabbath connected a tambourine to a foot pedal, for his left foot to operate like a hi-hat. John Bonham of Led Zeppelin simply mounted a tambourine above the hi-hat for extra sonic colour. The Subdudes, a roots rock group from New Orleans, opted for a tambourine player, Steve Amed√©e, instead of a drummer.https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-subdudes-mn0000475511 In classical music Percussionist in the Philadelphia Youth Orchestra, 2014 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was among the earliest western composers to include the tambourine in his compositions. Since the late eighteenth century it has become more common in western orchestral music, as exemplified in some of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's dance pieces from the Nutcracker Suite.Tchaikovsky, P. 1892. The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a (Danse Trepak). http://ks.petruccimusiclibrary.org/files/imglnks/usimg/5/5a/IMSLP307472-PMLP03607-Trepak- TimpPerc.pdf Gustav Holst's seven-movement orchestral suite The Planets also features the tambourine in several places, especially in the \\"Jupiter\\" movement.Holst, G. 1916. The Planets, Op. 32 (Jupiter). http://ks.petruccimusiclibrary.org/files/imglnks/usimg/5/51/IMSLP53305-PMLP33488-Holst- Planets.Percussion.pdf Georges Bizet's Carmen opera includes the famous \\"Habanera\\" aria which has a series of tambourine strikes in each chorus.Georges Bizet. Carmen. Op√©ra comique en quatre actes. Critical Edition edited by Robert Didion. Ernst Eulenberg Ltd, 1992, 2003 (No. 5 Habanera, p. 99). Similar instruments =Buben= Ukrainian boben Buben (–ë—É–±–µ–Ω in Russian, –ë—É–±–æ–Ω in Ukrainian, boben in Slovenian, buben in Czech, bƒôben in Polish) is a musical instrument of the percussion family similar to a tambourine. A buben consists of a wooden or metal hoop with a tight membrane stretched over one of its sides (some bubens have no membrane at all). Certain kinds of bubens are equipped with clanking metal rings, plates, cymbals, or little bells. It is held in the hand and can be played in numerous ways, from stroking or shaking the jingles to striking it sharply with hand. It is used for rhythmical accompaniment during dances, soloist or choral singing. Buben is often used by some folk and professional bands, as well as orchestras. The name is related to Greek language Œ≤œåŒºŒ≤ŒøœÇ (low and hollow sound) and Œ≤ŒøŒºŒ≤œçŒªŒ∑ (a breed of bees) and related to Indo-Aryan bambharas (bee) and English bee. Buben is known to have existed in many countries since time immemorial, especially in the East. There are many kinds of bubens, including def, daf, or qaval (Azerbaijan), daf or khaval (Armenia), daira (Georgia), doira (Uzbekistan and Tajikistan), daire or def (Iran), bendeir (Arab countries), pandero (Spain). In Kievan Rus, drums and military timpani were referred to as buben.An Iranian woman playing a frame drum, from a painting on the walls of Chehel Sotoun palace, Isfahan, 17th century, Iran. =Daf= A daf () is a large-sized tambourine or Perso-Arabic frame drum used to accompany both popular and classical music in Iran, Azerbaijan, the Arab world, Turkey (where it is called tef), Uzbekistan (where it's called childirma), the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as the Dafli) and Turkmenistan. Daf typically indicates the beat and tempo of the music being played, thus acts like the conductor in the monophonic oriental music. The Persian poet Rudaki, who widely used names of the musical instruments in his poems, mentions the daf and the tambourine (taboorak) in a Ruba'i: A common use of tambourine (Daf) is by Albanians. They are often played by women and bridesmaids in wedding cases to lead the ceremony when bride walks down the aisle. =Pandeiro= Originated in Galicia or Portugal, the pandeiro was brought to Brazil by the Portuguese settlers. It is a hand percussion instrument consisting of a single tension-headed drum with jingles in the frame. It is very typical of more traditional Brazilian music. =Panderoa= The Basque pandero is a folk instrument currently played along with the trikitixa (basque diatonic accordion) in a duo most of the times. Sometimes the players, who play in festivities to enliven the atmosphere or less frequently at onstage performances, sing along. At times the pandero accompanies the alboka or txistu too. Yet these kinds of duos have not always been the case. As attested in 1923, the youth gathered to dance to the rhythm of the bare pandero, with no other music instrument implicated but the player's (a woman's) voice.Arabic riq =Riq= The riq (also spelled riqq or rik) is a type of tambourine used as a traditional instrument in Arabic music.

He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory. Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a botanic laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 of complications of diabetes. Early life Edison as a boy Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port Huron, Michigan after the family moved there in 1854.Edison's Early Years He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804‚Äì1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810‚Äì1871, born in Chenango County, New York).Thomas Edison's Inventive Life; by Joyce Bedi. Retrieved March 31, 2018 His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been \\"Edeson.\\" Edison was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother who used to be a school teacher. He attended school for only a few months. However, one biographer described him as a very curious child who learned most things by reading on his own. As a child, he became fascinated with technology and spent hours working on experiments at home.The Near-Death Experience That Set Thomas Edison on the Road to Fame, Barbara Maranzani, March 5, 2020 Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness. The medical mystery that helped make Thomas Edison an inventor, PBS October 22, 2018 Being completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other, it is alleged that Edison would listen to a music player or piano by clamping his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull. As he got older, Edison believed his hearing loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work. Modern-day historians and medical professionals have suggested he may have had ADHD. The Near-Death Experience That Set Thomas Edison on the Road to Fame, Barbara Maranzani, March 5, 2020 In 1875, at age 28, he enrolled in a four-year chemistry course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.Thomas Edison Is An Innovative Icon, And Here's Why, Odyssey, March 26, 2018 Early career Thomas Edison began his career selling candy, newspapers and vegetables on the trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. He turned a $50 a week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electric and chemical experiments. He became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.Baldwin, p. 37 He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job. Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers. This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world. In 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes‚Äîreading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead‚Äìacid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.Baldwin, pp. 40‚Äì41 His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, , which was granted on June 1, 1869.The Edison Papers, Rutgers University. Retrieved March 20, 2007. Finding little demand for the machine, Edison moved to New York City shortly thereafter. One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home, while Edison worked for Samuel Laws at the Gold Indicator Company. Pope and Edison founded their own company in October 1869, working as electrical engineers and inventors. Edison began developing a multiplex telegraphic system, which could send two messages simultaneously, in 1874.\\"Life of Thomas Alva Edison\\", Inventing Entertainment: The Early Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings of the Edison Companies, Library of Congress. Menlo Park laboratory (1876‚Äì1886) =Research and development facility= Edison's Menlo Park Laboratory, reconstructed at Greenfield Village at Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Edison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results. William Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \\"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\\". Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics. Nearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.Evans, Harold, They Made America. Little, Brown and Company, New York, 2004. . p. 152. In just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \\"a stock of almost every conceivable material\\". A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained \\"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ...\\" and the list goes on. Over his desk Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous quotation: \\"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\\" This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility. In Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application. Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents. =Phonograph= Photograph of Edison with his phonograph (2nd model), taken in Mathew Brady's Washington, D.C. studio in April 1878. Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park,\\" New Jersey. His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \\"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\\".Edison, Thomas A. 1989. Menlo Park: The early years, April 1876 ‚Äì December 1877. Edited by P. B. Israel, K. A. Nier and L. Carlat. Vol. 3, The papers of Thomas A Edison. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Doc. 1117 In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.Baldwin, Neil. 2001. Edison: Inventing the century. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 97‚Äì98 The Washington Post described Edison as a \\"genius\\" and his presentation as \\"a scene... that will live in history\\".Washington Post. 1878. Genius before science. The Washington Post, April 19. Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,Edison, Thomas A. 1877. Telephones or speaking- telegraphs. US patent 203,018 filed December 13, 1877, and issued April 30, 1878. he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders. =Carbon telephone transmitter= In 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a \\"transmitter\\") by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave. Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. The carbon microphone works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.Adrian Hope, 100 Years of Microphone, New Scientist May 11, 1978 Vol. 78, No. 1102, p. 378 His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters inventionIEEE Global History Network: Carbon Transmitter. New Brunswick, NJ: IEEE History Center ) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).David Edward Hughes: Concertinist and Inventor Edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union. In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890 and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s. =Electric light= Thomas Edison's first successful light bulb model, used in public demonstration at Menlo Park, December 1879 In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting.Howard B. Rockman, Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists, John Wiley & Sons ‚Äì 2004, p. 131 He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. However, Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb.The real history of electricity is more gripping than The Current War, The new Scientist, July 26, 2019 In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue developed an efficient light bulb using a coiled platinum filament but the high cost of platinum kept the bulb from becoming a commercial success. Who Invented the Light Bulb? LiveScience, August 17, 2017 Many other inventors had also devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich G√∂bel. These early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate which made them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. In his first attempts to solve these problems, Edison tried using a filament made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. He then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo as the best filament.Thomas A. Edison Papers, Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences Edison continued trying to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \\"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\\". The patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \\"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\\". It was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1,200 hours. U.S. Patent#223898: Electric-Lamp. Issued January 27, 1880. In 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask,\\"Handbook of Research on Venture Capital\\". Colin Mason. Edward Elgar Publishing. January 1, 2012. pg 17 and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \\"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\\" The Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company's new steamship, the Columbia, was the first commercial application for Edison's incandescent light bulb in 1880. Henry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia's new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.Jehl, Francis Menlo Park reminiscences : written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory, Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Whitefish, Mass, Kessinger Publishing, July 1, 2002, p. 564Dalton, Anthony A long, dangerous coastline: shipwreck tales from Alaska to California Heritage House Publishing Company, February 1, 2011 ‚Äì 128 pp.Swann, p. 242. In 1880, Lewis Latimer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation, began working for the United States Electric Lighting Company run by Edison's rival Hiram S. Maxim. While working for Maxim, Latimer invented a process for making carbon filaments for light bulbs and helped install broad- scale lighting systems for New York City, Philadelphia, Montreal, and London. Latimer holds the patent for the electric lamp issued in 1881, and a second patent for the ‚Äúprocess of manufacturing carbons‚Äù (the filament used in incandescent light bulbs), issued in 1882. On October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years. In 1885, Latimer switched camps and started working with Edison. Meet Lewis Latimer, the African American who enlightened Thomas Edison, Grist February 11, 2015 On October 6, 1889, a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \\"a filament of carbon of high resistance\\" was valid. To avoid a possible court battle with yet another competitor, Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain. Mahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison's assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation. In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre. =Electric power distribution= After devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \\"utility\\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.Ahmad Faruqui, Kelly Eakin, Pricing in Competitive Electricity Markets, Springer Science & Business Media ‚Äì 2000, p. 67 On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan. In January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey. =War of currents= Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events, as in this picture from the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition. As Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885‚Äì1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \\"step down\\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House ‚Äì 2004, pp. 54‚Äì60 Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap. Edison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \\"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\\"Maury Klein, The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America, Bloomsbury Publishing US ‚Äì 2008, p. 257 Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The Country By Jill Jonnes p. 146 Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations. Parallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House ‚Äì 2004, p. 143Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US ‚Äì 2009, pp. 139‚Äì140 Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \\"battle of currents\\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator. Thomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson- Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US ‚Äì 2009, p. 268Robert L. Bradley Jr., Edison to Enron: Energy Markets and Political Strategies, John Wiley & Sons ‚Äì 2011, pp. 28‚Äì29 West Orange and Fort Myers (1886‚Äì1931) Thomas A. Edison Industries Exhibit, Primary Battery section, 1915 Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \\"Glenmont\\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought 13 acres of property in Fort Myers, Florida, for roughly $2,750 and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat.Cosden, M. (2015). Edison and Ford in Florida. Arcadia Publishing. The main house and guest house are representative of Italianate architecture and Queen Anne style architecture. The building materials were pre-cut in New England by the Kennebec Framing Company and the Stephen Nye Lumber Company of Fairfield Maine. The materials were then shipped down by boat and were constructed at a cost of $12,000 each, which included the cost of interior furnishings.Edison and Ford Winter Estates. Media kit. Retrieved on 10/9/2019 Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber. Due to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915. Edison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber. Edison's work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark. The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder. After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3‚Äì4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.Growing American Rubber by Mark Finlay During the 1911 New York Electrical show, Edison told representatives of the copper industry it was a shame he didn't have a \\"chunk of it\\". The representatives decided to give a cubic foot of solid copper weighing 486 pounds with their gratitude inscribed on it in appreciation for his part in the \\"continuous stimulation in the copper industry\\". Other inventions and projects =Fluoroscopy= Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images. The fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation; he later died (at the age of 39) of injuries related to the exposure, mediastinal cancer. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \\"Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\\"Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library: Edison fears the hidden perils of the x-rays. New York Worldb/, August 3, 1903, Durham, NC. Nonetheless, his work was important in the development of a technology still used today. =Tasimeter= Edison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation. His impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878. The device was not patented since Edison could find no practical mass-market application for it. =Telegraph improvements= The key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph. =Motion pictures= The June 1894 Leonard‚ÄìCushing bout. Each of the six one-minute rounds recorded by the Kinetoscope was made available to exhibitors for $22.50.Leonard‚ÄìCushing fight Part of the Library of Congress/Inventing Entertainment educational website. Retrieved December 14, 2006. Customers who watched the final round saw Leonard score a knockdown. Edison was granted a patent for the motion picture camera or \\"Kinetograph\\". He did the electromechanical design while his employee William Kennedy Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson. In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891. In April 1896, Thomas Armat's Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film. Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when wealthy American Businessman Irving T. Bush (1869‚Äì1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kin√©toscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-√∂sterreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen-S√ºsswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne. The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kin√©toscope Fran√ßais, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists. On May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kin√©toscope Belge was founded in Brussels. Businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France. Edison's film studio made nearly 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott's Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant. A Day with Thomas Edison (1922) As the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.Siegmund Lubin (1851‚Äì1923), Who's Who of Victorian Cinema. Retrieved August 20, 2007. To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.\\"History of Edison Motion Pictures: Early Edison Motion Picture Production (1892‚Äì1895)\\", Memory.loc.gov, Library of Congress. Retrieved August 20, 2007. In 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929. Edison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. He thought that talkies had \\"spoiled everything\\" for him. \\"There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\\"Reader's Digest, March 1930, pp. 1042‚Äì1044, \\"Living With a Genius\\", condensed from The American Magazine February 1930 His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.\\"Edison Wears Silk Nightshirt, Hates Talkies, Writes Wife\\", Capital Times, October 30, 1930 =Mining= Starting in the late 1870s, Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement. In 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903. A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him. =Rechargeable battery= Share of the Edison Storage Battery Company, issued 19. October 1903 In the late 1890s Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery (at that time called an \\"accumulator\\"). He looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles.David John Cole, Eve Browning, Eve Browning Cole, Fred E. H. Schroeder, Encyclopedia of Modern Everyday Inventions, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, pages 45-46 The then available lead acid rechargeable batteries were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using alkaline instead of acid. He had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides his experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a nickel‚Äìiron battery by the Swedish inventor Waldemar Jungner.Seth Fletcher, Bottled Lightning: Superbatteries, Electric Cars, and the New Lithium Economy, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 10, 2011, pages 14-16 Edison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel‚Äìiron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company and by 1904 it had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of the company was spent, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel‚Äìiron battery was never very successful, by the time it was ready electric cars were disappearing and lead acid batteries had become the standard for tuning over gas powered car starter motors. =Chemicals= At the start of World War I, the American chemical industry was primitive. Most chemicals were imported from Europe. The outbreak of war in August 1914 resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals. One of particular importance to Edison was phenol, which was used to make phonograph records‚Äîpresumably as phenolic resins of the Bakelite type. At the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of coke oven gases or manufactured gas for gas lighting. Phenol could be nitrated to picric acid and converted to ammonium picrate, a shock resistant high explosive suitable for use in artillery shells. A telling of the phenol story is found in The Aspirin Wars.Mann, Charles C. And Plummer, Mark L (1991). The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine, and 100 Years of Rampant Competition. Alfred A. Knopf, NY, , pp. 38‚Äì40 Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of ammonium picrate. Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany. Edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake, facility using processes developed by his chemists.Conot, Robert (1979), A Streak of Luck: The Life & Legend of Thomas Alva Edison, Seaview Books, NY, pp. 413‚Äì414 He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day. Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe. He built two plants to produce raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany. Edison also manufactured aniline dyes, which previously had been supplied by the German dye trust. Other wartime products include xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrax. Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable. In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear. Phenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. Bakelite, the original thermoset plastic, had been invented in 1909. Aspirin, too was a phenol derivative. Invented in 1899 had become a block buster drug. Bayer had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in Rensselaer, New York, but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war. Edison was able to oblige. Bayer relied on Chemische Fabrik von Heyden, in Piscataway, New Jersey, to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin. (See Great Phenol plot.) It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of ammonium picrate. Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses. He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to salicylic acid by Heyden, some of which was exported. Final years and death =Final years= Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Harvey Firestone, respectively. Ft. Myers, Florida, February 11, 1929 Henry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also participated. In 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \\"The Civitan Club is doing things‚Äîbig things‚Äîfor the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\\" He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings. Edison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange. This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit. Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; \\"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\\". He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \\"correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\\" She also said that during one of his periodic \\"great scientific adventures\\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three. Edison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles. =Death= Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, \\"Glenmont\\" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. Rev. Stephen J. Herben officiated at the funeral; Edison is buried behind the home. Edison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.\\"Is Thomas Edison's last breath preserved in a test tube in the Henry Ford Museum?\\", The Straight Dope, September 11, 1987.

Marriages and children On December 25, 1871, at the age of 24, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855‚Äì1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children: * Marion Estelle Edison (1873‚Äì1965), nicknamed \\"Dot\\"Baldwin 1995, p.60 * Thomas Alva Edison Jr. (1876‚Äì1935), nicknamed \\"Dash\\"Baldwin 1995, p.67 * William Leslie Edison (1878‚Äì1937) Inventor, graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 1900.

Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.\\"Thomas Edison's First Wife May Have Died of a Morphine Overdose\\" , Rutgers Today. Retrieved November 18, 2011 Edison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family. Mina Miller Edison in 1906 On February 24, 1886, at the age of 39, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865‚Äì1947) in Akron, Ohio. She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together: * Madeleine Edison (1888‚Äì1979), who married John Eyre Sloane. * Charles Edison (1890‚Äì1969), Governor of New Jersey (1941‚Äì1944), who took over his father's company and experimental laboratories upon his father's death. * Theodore Miller Edison (1898‚Äì1992), (MIT Physics 1923), credited with more than 80 patents. Mina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947. Wanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Edison's son, Thomas Alva Edison Jr., became a problem for his father and his father's business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in snake oil products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as \\"The Latest Edison Discovery\\". The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35 () per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr., suffering from alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his brother. Views =On politics, religion, and metaphysics= This 1910 New York Times Magazine feature states that \\"Nature, the supreme power, (Edison) recognizes and respects, but does not worship. Nature is not merciful and loving, but wholly merciless, indifferent.\\" Edison is quoted as saying \\"I am not an individual‚ÄîI am an aggregate of cells, as, for instance, New York City is an aggregate of individuals. Will New York City go to heaven?\\" Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \\"freethinker\\". Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason. Edison defended Paine's \\"scientific deism\\", saying, \\"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\\" In 1878, Edison joined the Theosophical Society in New Jersey, but according to its founder, H. P. Blavatsky, he was not a very active member. In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated: > Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is > not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me‚Äîthe fabled God of the three > qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love‚ÄîHe also made the fish I > catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come > in? No; nature made us‚Äînature did it all‚Äînot the gods of the religions. Edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter: > You have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the > conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, > what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. > All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our > intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an > entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the > cells of which we are made. He also stated, \\"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\\"The Freethinker (1970), G.W. Foote & Company, Volume 90, p. 147 Nonviolence was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \\"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\\" Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: \\"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\\"Cited in Innovate Like Edison: The Success System of America's Greatest Inventor by Sarah Miller Caldicott, Michael J. Gelb, p. 37. He was a vegetarian but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life. In 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a \\"spirit phone\\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated. Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \\"I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\\" =On the monetary system= Thomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times stating \\"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\\" In the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer. He thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \\"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\\".Edison, 1922 In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned. Awards Portrait of Edison by Abraham Archibald Anderson (1890), National Portrait Gallery The President of the Third French Republic, Jules Gr√©vy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barth√©lemy-Saint- Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (L√©gion d'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881;The same decree awarded German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz with the designation of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, as well as Alexander Graham Bell. The decree preamble cited \\"for services provided to the Congress and to the International Electrical Exhibition\\" Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889. In 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889. In 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute. He was named an Honorable Consulting Engineer at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's fair in 1904. In 1908, Edison received the American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal. In 1915, Edison was awarded Franklin Medal of The Franklin Institute for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries and the well-being of the human race. In 1920, the United States Navy department awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. In 1923, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers created the Edison Medal and he was its first recipient. In 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences. On May 29, 1928, Edison received the Congressional Gold Medal. In 1983, the United States Congress, pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution 140 (Public Law 97‚Äì198), designated February 11, Edison's birthday, as National Inventor's Day. Life magazine (USA), in a special double issue in 1997, placed Edison first in the list of the \\"100 Most Important People in the Last 1000 Years\\", noting that the light bulb he promoted \\"lit up the world\\". In the 2005 television series The Greatest American, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest. In 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award. In 2011, Edison was inducted into the Entrepreneur Walk of Fame and named a Great Floridian by the governor and cabinet of Florida. Tributes =Places and people named for Edison= Thomas Edison commemorative stamp, issued on the 100th anniversary of his birth in 1947 Several places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of Edison, New Jersey. Thomas Edison State University, nationally known for adult learners, is in Trenton, New Jersey. Two community colleges are named for him: Edison State College (now Florida SouthWestern State College) in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edison Community College in Piqua, Ohio. There are numerous high schools named after Edison (see Edison High School) and other schools including Thomas A. Edison Middle School. Footballer Pel√©'s father originally named him Edison, as a tribute to the inventor of the light bulb, but the name was incorrectly listed on his birth certificate as \\"Edson\\". The small town of Alva just east of Fort Myers took Edison's middle name. In 1883, the City Hotel in Sunbury, Pennsylvania was the first building to be lit with Edison's three-wire system. The hotel was renamed The Hotel Edison upon Edison's return to the city on 1922. Lake Thomas A Edison in California was named after Edison to mark the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb. Edison was on hand to turn on the lights at the Hotel Edison in New York City when it opened in 1931. Three bridges around the United States have been named in Edison's honor: the Edison Bridge in New Jersey, the Edison Bridge in Florida, and the Edison Bridge in Ohio. In space, his name is commemorated in asteroid 742 Edisona. Mount Edison in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named after him in 1955. =Museums and memorials= Statue of young Thomas Edison by the railroad tracks in Port Huron, Michigan. The Blue Water Bridge can be seen in the background. In West Orange, New Jersey, the Glenmont estate is maintained and operated by the National Park Service as the Edison National Historic Site, as is his nearby laboratory and workshops including the reconstructed \\"Black Maria\\"‚Äîthe world's first movie studio.

The town has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison's parents, and a monument along the St. Clair River. Edison's influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000. In Detroit, the Edison Memorial Fountain in Grand Circus Park was created to honor his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the light bulb.Edison Memorial Fountain at Buildings of Detroit. Retrieved September 28, 2010. On the same night, The Edison Institute was dedicated in nearby Dearborn. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1969. A bronze statue of Edison was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on September 20 of that year. The Edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor William Allen that had been one of Ohio's two allowed contributions to the collection. =Companies bearing Edison's name= Edison in 1915 * Edison General Electric, merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric * Commonwealth Edison, now part of Exelon * Consolidated Edison * Edison International * Detroit Edison, a unit of DTE Energy * Edison S.p.A., a unit of Italenergia * Trade association the Edison Electric Institute, a lobbying and research group for investor-owned utilities in the United States * Edison Ore-Milling Company * Edison Portland Cement Company * Ohio Edison (merged with Centerior in 1997 to form First Energy) * Southern California Edison =Awards named in honor of Edison= The Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later IEEE, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. It is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually \\"for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts.\\" In the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the Edison Award after him. The award is an annual Dutch music prize, awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry, and is one of the oldest music awards in the world, having been presented since 1960. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers concedes the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award to individual patents since 2000. =Other items named after Edison= The United States Navy named the USS Edison (DD-439), a Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II. In 1962, the Navy commissioned USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine. =In popular culture= Thomas Edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day. Edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of Nikola Tesla. On February 11, 2011, on what would have been Thomas Edison's 164th birthday, Google's homepage featured an animated Google Doodle commemorating his many inventions. When the cursor was hovered over the doodle, a series of mechanisms seemed to move, causing a light bulb to glow.

He was the founder of the Scottish School of Common Sense and played an integral role in the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. A contemporary of David Hume, Reid was also \\"Hume's earliest and fiercest critic\\".See Craig G. Bartholomew and Michael W. Goheen, Christian Philosophy page 138 (Baker Academic, 2013). Life Reid was born in the manse at Strachan, Aberdeenshire, on 26 April 1710 O.S., the son of Lewis Reid (1676‚Äì1762) and his wife Margaret Gregory, first cousin to James Gregory. He was educated at Kincardine Parish School then the O'Neil Grammar School in Kincardine. He went to the University of Aberdeen in 1723 and graduated MA in 1726. He was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland in 1731, when he came of age. He began his career as a minister of the Church of Scotland but ceased to be a minister when he was given a professorship at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1752. He obtained his doctorate and wrote An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (published in 1764). He and his colleagues founded the 'Aberdeen Philosophical Society' which was popularly known as the 'Wise Club' (a literary-philosophical association).See H. Lewis Ulman, The Minutes of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society 1758-1773 (Aberdeen University Press for Aberdeen University Studies Committee, 1990). Shortly after the publication of his first book, he was given the prestigious Professorship of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow when he was called to replace Adam Smith. He resigned from this position in 1781, after which he prepared his university lectures for publication in two books: Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785) and Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind (1788). In 1740 Thomas Reid married his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of the London physician George Reid. His wife and \\"numerous\\" children predeceased him, except for a daughter who married Patrick Carmichael. Reid died of palsy, in Glasgow. He was buried at Blackfriars Church in the grounds of Glasgow College and when the university moved to Gilmorehill in the west of Glasgow, his tombstone was inserted in the main building. Philosophical work =Overview= Reid believed that common sense (in a special philosophical sense of sensus communis) is, or at least should be, at the foundation of all philosophical inquiry. He disagreed with Hume, who asserted that we can never know what an external world consists of as our knowledge is limited to the ideas in the mind, and George Berkeley, who asserted that the external world is merely ideas in the mind. By contrast, Reid claimed that the foundations upon which our sensus communis are built justify our belief that there is an external world. In his day and for some years into the 19th century, he was regarded as more important than Hume.See Craig G. Bartholomew and Michael W. Goheen, Christian Philosophy, page 138 (Baker Academic, 2013). He advocated direct realism, or common sense realism, and argued strongly against the Theory of Ideas advocated by John Locke, Ren√© Descartes, and (in varying forms) nearly all Early Modern philosophers who came after them. He had a great admiration for Hume and had a mutual friend send Hume an early manuscript of Reid's Inquiry. Hume responded that the work \\"is wrote in a lively entertaining manner,\\" although he found \\"there seems to be some Defect in Method\\", and he criticized Reid's doctrine for implying the presence of innate ideas. (pp. 256‚Äì257)Thomas Reid. An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense. Ed. Derek R Brookes. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997. p. 256-257 =Thomas Reid's theory of common sense= Reid's theory of knowledge had a strong influence on his theory of morals. He thought epistemology was an introductory part to practical ethics: When we are confirmed in our common beliefs by philosophy, all we have to do is to act according to them, because we know what is right. His moral philosophy is reminiscent of Roman stoicism in its emphasis on the agency of the subject and self-control. He often quotes Cicero, from whom he adopted the term \\"sensus communis\\". Reid's answer to Hume's sceptical and naturalist arguments was to enumerate a set of principles of common sense (sensus communis) which constitute the foundations of rational thought. Anyone who undertakes a philosophical argument, for example, must implicitly presuppose certain beliefs like, \\"I am talking to a real person,\\" and \\"There is an external world whose laws do not change,\\" among many other positive, substantive claims. For Reid, the belief in the truth of these principles is not rational; rather, reason itself demands these principles as prerequisites, as does the innate \\"constitution\\" of the human mind. It is for this reason (and possibly a mocking attitude toward Hume and Berkeley) that Reid sees belief in the principles of common sense as a litmus test for sanity. For example, in The Intellectual Powers of Man he states, \\"For, before men can reason together, they must agree in first principles; and it is impossible to reason with a man who has no principles in common with you.\\" One of the first principles he goes on to list is that \\"qualities must necessarily be in something that is figured, coloured, hard or soft, that moves or resists. It is not to these qualities, but to that which is the subject of them, that we give the name body. If any man should think fit to deny that these things are qualities, or that they require any subject, I leave him to enjoy his opinion as a man who denies first principles, and is not fit to be reasoned with.\\" Reid also made positive arguments based in phenomenological insight to put forth a novel mixture of direct realism and ordinary language philosophy. In a typical passage in the Intellectual Powers he asserts that when he has a conception of a centaur, the thing he conceives is an animal, and no idea is an animal; therefore, the thing he conceives is not an idea, but a centaur. This point relies both on an account of the subjective experience of conceiving an object and also on an account of what we mean when we use words. Because Reid saw his philosophy as publicly accessible knowledge, available both through introspection and through the proper understanding of how language is used, he saw it as the philosophy of common sense.  Exploring sense and language  Reid started out with a 'common sense' based on a direct experience of an external reality but then proceeded to explore in two directions - external to the senses, and internal to human language - to account more effectively for the role of rationality. Reid saw language as based on an innate capacity pre- dating human consciousness, and acting as an instrument for that consciousness. (In Reid's terms: it is an 'artificial' instrument based on a 'natural' capacity.) On this view, language becomes a means of examining the original form of human cognition. Reid notes that current human language contains two distinct elements: first, the acoustic element, the sounds; and secondly the meanings - which seem to have nothing to do with the sounds as such. This state of the language, which he calls 'artificial', cannot be the primeval one, which he terms 'natural', wherein sound was not an abstract sign, but a concrete gesture or natural sign. Reid looks to the way a child learns language, by imitating sounds, becoming aware of them long before it understands the meaning accorded to the various groups of sounds in the artificial state of contemporary adult speech. If, says Reid, the child needed to understand immediately the conceptual content of the words it hears, it would never learn to speak at all. Here Reid distinguishes between natural and artificial signs: :\\"It is by natural signs chiefly that we give force and energy to language; and the less language has of them, it is the less expressive and persuasive. ... Artificial signs signify, but they do not express; they speak to the intellect, as algebraic characters may do, but the passions and the affections and the will hear them not: these continue dormant and inactive, till we speak to them in the language of nature, to which they are all attention and obedience.\\" (p. 52) His external exploration, regarding the senses, led Reid to his critical distinction between 'sensation' and 'perception'. While we become aware of an object through the senses, the content of that perception is not identical with the sum total of the sensations caused in our consciousness. Thus, while we tend to focus on the object perceived, we pay no attention to the process leading from sensation to perception, which contains the knowledge of the thing as real. How, then, do we receive the conviction of the latter's existence? Reid's answer is, by entering into an immediate intuitive relationship with it, as a child does. In the case of the adult, the focus is on perceiving, but with the child, it is on receiving of the sensations in their living nature. For Reid, the perception of the child is different from the adult, and he states that man must become like a child to get past the artificial perception of the adult, which leads to Hume's view that what we perceive is an illusion. Also, the artist provides a key to the true content of sense experience, as he engages the 'language of nature': :\\"It were easy to show, that the fine arts of the musician, the painter, the actor, and the orator, so far as they are expressive .. are nothing else but the language of nature, which we brought into the world with us, but have unlearned by disuse and so find the greatest difficulty in recovering it.\\" (p. 53) :\\"That without a natural knowledge of the connection between these [natural] signs and the things signified by them, the language could never have been invented and established among men; and, That the fine arts are all founded upon this connection, which we may call the natural language of mankind.\\" (p. 59) Thus, for Reid, common sense was based on the innate capacity of man in an earlier epoch to directly participate in nature, and one we find to some extent in the child and artist, but one that from a philosophical and scientific perspective, we must re-awaken at a higher level in the human mind above nature. Why does Reid believe that perception is the way to recognize? Well, to him \\"an experience is purely subjective and purely negative. It supports the validity of a proposition, only on the fact that I find that it is impossible for me not to hold it for true, to suppose it therefore not true\\" (Reid, 753). To understand this better, it is important to know that Reid divides his definition of perception into two categories: conception, and belief. \\"Conception is Reid's way of saying to visualize an object, so then we can affirm or deny qualities about that thing. Reid believes that beliefs are our direct thoughts of an object, and what that object is\\" (Buras, The Functions of Sensations to Reid). So, to Reid, what we see, what we visualize, what we believe of an object, is that object's true reality. Reid believes in direct objectivity, our senses guide us to what is right since we cannot trust our own thoughts. \\"The worlds of common sense and of philosophy are reciprocally the converse of each other\\" (Reid, 841). Reid believes that Philosophy overcomplicates the question of what is real. So, what does Common Sense actually mean then? Well, \\"common sense is the senses being pulled all together to form one idea\\" (Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid, 164). Common sense (all the senses combined) is how we truly identify the reality of an object; since all that can be perceived about an object, are all pulled into one perception. How do people reach the point of accessing common sense? That's the trick, everyone is born with the ability to access common sense, that is why it is called common sense. \\"The principles of common sense are common to all of humanity,\\" (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid). Common sense works as such: If all men observe an item and believe the same qualities about that item, then the knowledge of that item is universally true. It is common knowledge, which without explanation is held true by other people; so, what is universally seen is universally believed. \\"The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a community, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase of knowledge,\\" (Reid, 155). The combination of the same ideas, of a thing, by multiple people, is what confirms the reality of an object. Reid also believes that the philosophers of his time exaggerated what is truly real. Where most philosophers believe that what we see is not fully what that thing is, for example, Descartes, Reid counters this argument simply by stating that \\"such a hypothesis is no more likely to be true than the common-sensical belief that the world is much the way we perceive it to be,\\" (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid). Reality is what we make it out to be, nothing more. Reid also claimed that this discovery of the link between the natural sign and the thing signified was the basis of natural philosophy and science, as proposed by Bacon in his radical method of discovery of the innate laws of nature: :The great Lord Verulam had a perfect comprehension of this, when he called it an interpretation of nature. No man ever more distinctly understood, or happily expressed the nature and foundation of the philosophic art. What is all we know of mechanics, astronomy, and optics, but connections established by nature and discovered by experience or observation, and consequences deduced from them? (..) What we commonly call natural causes might, with more propriety, be called natural signs, and what we call effects, the things signified. The causes have no proper efficiency or causality, as far as we know; and all we can certainly affirm, is, that nature hath established a constant conjunction between them and the things called their effects; (..). (p. 59)  Influences  It has been claimed that Reid's reputation waned after attacks on the Scottish School of Common Sense by Immanuel Kant (although Kant, only 14 years Reid's junior, also bestowed much praise on Scottish philosophy - Kant attacked the work of Reid, but admitted he had never actually read the works of Thomas Reid) and by John Stuart Mill. But Reid's was the philosophy taught in the colleges of North America during the 19th century and was championed by Victor Cousin, a French philosopher. Justus Buchler has shown that Reid was an important influence on the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, who shared Reid's concern to revalue common sense and whose work links Reid to pragmatism. To Peirce, conceptions of truth and the real involve the notion of a community without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed), and capable of a definite increase of knowledge.Peirce, C. S. (1868), \\"Some Consequences of Four Incapacities\\", Journal of Speculative Philosophy 2, pp. 140‚Äì157, see p. 155 via Google Books. Reprinted, Collected Papers v. 5, paragraphs 264‚Äì317 (see 311), Writings v. 2, pp. 211‚Äì42 (see 239), Essential Peirce v. 1, pp. 28‚Äì55 (see 52). Common sense is socially evolved, open to verification much like scientific method, and constantly evolving, as evidence, perception, and practice warrant, albeit with a slowness that Peirce came only in later years to see, at which point he owned his \\"adhesion, under inevitable modification, to the opinion of...Thomas Reid, in the matter of Common Sense\\".Peirce, C. S. (1905), \\"Issues of Pragmaticism\\", The Monist, v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481‚Äì99, see pp. 484‚Äì5 via Google Books. Reprinted, Collected Papers v. 5, paragraphs 438‚Äì63 (see 444), Essential Peirce v. 2, pp. 346‚Äì59 (see 349) (Peirce called his version \\"critical common-sensism\\"). By contrast, on Reid's concept, the sensus communis is not a social evolutionary product but rather a precondition of the possibility that humans could reason with each other. The work of Thomas Reid influenced the work of Noah Porter and James McCosh in the 19th century United States and is based upon the claim of universal principles of objective truth. Pragmatism is not the development of the work of the Scottish \\"Common Sense\\" School - it is the negation of it. There are clear links between the work of the Scottish Common Sense School and the work of the Oxford Realist philosophers Harold Prichard and Sir William David Ross in the 20th century. Reid's reputation has revived in the wake of the advocacy of common sense as a philosophical method or criterion by G. E. Moore early in the 20th century, and more recently because of the attention given to Reid by contemporary philosophers, in particular philosophers of religion in the school of Reformed epistemology such as William Alston,Alston invokes Reid in his Perceiving God: The Epistemology of Religious Experience (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991) pp. 151‚Äì155; 162‚Äì165. Alvin Plantinga, and Nicholas Wolterstorff,For Wolterstorff's use of Reid in aid of Reformed Epistemology, see his \\"Can Belief in God be Rational if it has no Foundations?\\" in Faith and Rationality (Notre Dame, IN: Notre Dame University Press, 1983) seeking to rebut charges that theistic belief is irrational where it has no doxastic foundations (that is, where that belief is not inferred from other adequately grounded beliefs). He wrote a number of important philosophical works, including Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (1764, Glasgow & London), Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785) and Essays on the Active Powers of Man (1788). In 1844, Schopenhauer praised Reid for explaining that the perception of external objects does not result from the raw data that is received through the five senses: =Other philosophical positions= Though known mainly for his epistemology, Reid is also noted for his views in the theory of action and the metaphysics of personal identity. Reid held an incompatibilist or libertarian notion of freedom, holding that we are capable of free actions of which we are the cause, and for which we are morally appraisable.Essays on the Active Powers, \\"Essay Four: Of the Liberty of Moral Agents\\" Regarding personal identity, he rejected Locke's account that self-consciousness in the form of memory of one's experiences was the basis of a person's being identical with their self over time. Reid held that continuity of memory was neither necessary nor sufficient to make one numerically the same person at different times.Essays on the Intellectual Powers, \\"Essay Three: Of Memory\\". Reid also argued that the operation of our mind connecting sensations with belief in an external world is accounted for only by an intentional Creator. In his natural religion lectures, Reid provides five arguments for the existence of God, focusing on two mainly, the cosmological and design. Reid loves and frequently uses Samuel Clarke's cosmological argument, which says, in short that the universe either has always been, or began to exist, so there must be a cause (or first principle) for both (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). As everything is either necessary or contingent, an Independent being is required for contingency (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). Reid spends even more time on his design argument, but is unclear exactly what he wanted his argument to be, as his lectures only went as far as his students needed. Though there is no perfect interpretation, Reid states that \\"there are in fact the clearest marks of design and wisdom in the works of nature\\" (Cuneo and Woudenberg 291) If something carries marks of design (regularity or variety of structure), there must be an intelligent being behind it (Reid EIP 66). This can't be known by experience, fitting with the casual excellence principle, but the cause can be seen in works of nature (Cuneo and Woudenberg 241). Works * 1764.

It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate; although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional. Hooper produced the film for less than $140,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually acquired by Louis Perano of Bryanston Distributing Company. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was banned in several countries, and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office, equivalent with roughly over $150.8 million as of 2019, selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974. It has since gained a reputation as one of the best and most influential horror films. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons, the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure, and the killing of victims. It led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, prequels, a remake, comic books and video games. Plot Sally Hardesty, her paraplegic brother Franklin, and their friends, Jerry, Kirk, and Pam visit the grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker, who talks about his family who worked at the old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket knife and cuts himself, then takes a single Polaroid picture of Franklin, for which he demands money. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo, and slashes Franklin's left arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refill their vehicle, but the proprietor tells them that the pumps are empty. They continue toward the homestead, intending to return to the gas station once it has received a fuel delivery. When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming-hole, and the couple go to find it. They stumble upon a nearby house, and Kirk calls out for gas, entering through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. Leatherface, a large mute man wearing a mask made from human skin, suddenly appears and kills Kirk with a hammer. Pam enters soon after, and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her, and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He sees the house and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him. With darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs toward the house, and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple upstairs. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window, and flees to the gas station. The proprietor calms her with offers of help, but then ties her up, gags her, and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving at the same time as the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherface's brother. The hitchhiker recognizes Sally, and taunts her. The men torment the bound and gagged Sally while Leatherface, now dressed as a woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the hitchhiker bring down one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs, that of their Grandpa. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer, but he is too weak. In the ensuing struggle, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Leatherface attacks the truck with his chainsaw, and when the driver stops to help he knocks Leatherface down with a pipe wrench, causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes in the back of a passing pickup truck as Leatherface maniacally flails his chainsaw in the air in anger and defeat. Cast *Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty *Paul A.

He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on murderer Ed Gein, who committed his crimes in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).Allon 2002, p. 248Bowen 2004, p. 17 During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface. Hooper has cited changes in the cultural and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the \\"film you are about to see is true\\", was a response to being \\"lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world\\", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and \\"the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War\\". The \\"lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things\\" that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by \\"showing brains spilled all over the road\\", led to his belief that \\"man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film\\". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper while he was in the hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd. Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the screenplay and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel as president and Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits.Bloom 2004, p. 3 Production manager Ron Bozman told most of the cast and crew that he would have to defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value. =Casting= Many of the cast members at the time were relatively unknown actors‚ÄîTexans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow.Macor 2010, pp. 24‚Äì25 Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes. Icelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was selected for the role of Leatherface. He regarded Leatherface as being mentally retarded and having never learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke.Jaworzyn 2004, p. 30 John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits. =Filming= La Frontera to Kingsland, Texas, and restored as a restaurant. The primary filming location was an early 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located. The small budget and concerns over high-cost equipment rentals meant the crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was humid and the cast and crew found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110¬∞F (43 ¬∞C) on July 26. Hansen later recalled, \\"It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn't wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn't have enough money for a second costume. So I wore that [mask] 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month.\\"Jaworzyn 2004, p. 63 The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was mainly shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, low-speed film that required four times more light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming took place in the farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house. The special effects were simple and limited by the budget.Freeland 2002, p. 241 The on-screen blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds \\"Grandpa\\". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood to come out of its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was \\"virtually solid\\" by the last day of shooting.Jaworzyn 2004, pp. 8‚Äì33 The scene in which Leatherface kills Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within of Vail's face.Haines 2003, pp. 114‚Äì115 A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head. Still, the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that \\"everyone hated me by the end of the production\\" and that \\"it just took years for them to kind of cool off.\\" =Post-production= The production exceeded its original $60,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) budget during editing.Jaworzyn 2004, p. 33 Sources differ on the film's final cost, offering figures between $93,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and $300,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted).Bloom 2004, p. 6Rockoff 2002, p. 42 A film production group, Pie in the Sky, partially led by future President of the Texas State Bar Joe K. Longleyhttps://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/they-came-they-sawed/ provided $23,532 (about $ inflation-adjusted) in exchange for 19% of Vortex.Bloom 2004, p. 5 This left Henkel, Hooper and the rest of the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake. Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Distributing Company. David Foster, producer of the 1982 horror film The Thing, arranged for a private screening for some of Bryanston's West Coast executives, and received 1.5% of Vortex's profits and a deferred fee of $500 (about $ inflation-adjusted). On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston agreed to distribute the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, \\"We made a deal with the devil, [sigh], and I guess that, in a way, we got what we deserved.\\" They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),‚Äîand after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid‚Äîonly $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjusted) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.  Release  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre premiered in Austin, Texas, on October 1, 1974, almost a year after filming concluded. It screened nationally in the United States as a Saturday afternoon matin√©e and its false marketing as a \\"true story\\" helped it attract a broad audience. For eight years after 1976, it was annually reissued to first-run theaters, promoted by full-page ads.Bowen 2004, pp. 17‚Äì18 The film eventually grossed more than $30 million in the United States and Canada ($14.4 million in rentals), making it the 12th highest-grossing film initially released in 1974, despite its minuscule budget.Cook 2000, p. 229 Among independent films, it was overtaken in 1978 by John Carpenter's Halloween, which grossed $47 million. Hooper reportedly hoped that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut release print a \\"PG\\" rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore.Worland 2006, p. 298Jaworzyn 2004, p. 40 Instead, it was originally rated \\"X\\". After several minutes were cut, it was resubmitted to the MPAA and received an \\"R\\" rating. A distributor apparently restored the offending material, and at least one theater presented the full version under an \\"R\\". In San Francisco, cinema- goers walked out of theaters in disgust and in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada, were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges. After its initial British release, including a one-year theatrical run in London,Bowen 2004, p. 18 The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially banned on the advice of British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman. While the British ban was in force the word \\"chainsaw\\" itself was barred from movie titles, forcing imitators to rename their films. In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license. The following year the BBFC passed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre for release with an 18 certificate (indicating that it should not be seen or purchased by a person under 18), and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4. The Australian censors refused to classify the 83-minute version of the film in June 1975; the board similarly refused classification of a 77-minute print in December that year. In 1981, an 83-minute version submitted by Greater Union Organization Film Distributors was again refused registration. It was later submitted by Filmways Australia and approved for an \\"R\\" rating in 1984. It was banned for periods in many other countries, including Brazil, Chile, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and West Germany.Chibnall 2002, p. 16Bloom 2004, p. 7 In Sweden, it would also symbolize a video nasty, a discussed topic at the time. Reception =Critical response= The Texas Chain Saw Massacre received a mixed reaction upon its initial release. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"despicable\\" and described Henkel and Hooper as more concerned with creating a realistic atmosphere than with its \\"plastic script\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said it was \\"as violent and gruesome and blood-soaked as the title promises\\", yet praised its acting and technical execution. Donald B. Berrigan of The Cincinnati Enquirer praised the lead performance of Burns: \\"Marilyn Burns, as Sally, deserves a special Academy Award for one of the most sustained and believable acting achievements in movie history.\\" Patrick Taggart of the Austin American-Statesman hailed it as the most important horror film since George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968).Macor 2010, p. 39 Variety found the picture to be well-made, despite what it called the \\"heavy doses of gore\\". John McCarty of Cinefantastique stated that the house featured in the film made the Bates motel \\"look positively pleasant by comparison\\". Revisiting the film in his 1976 article \\"Fashions in Pornography\\" for Harper's Magazine, Stephen Koch found its sadistic violence to be extreme and unimaginative. Critics later frequently praised both the film's aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it managed to be \\"horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)\\", Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it \\"a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing\\". TV Guide thought it was \\"intelligent\\" in its \\"bloodless depiction of violence\\", while Anton Bitel felt the fact that it was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences \\"a punishing assault on the senses\\". In Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of The Austin Chronicle praised the film's \\"subtle touches\\"‚Äîsuch as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas‚Äîand said that what made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality. It has often been described as one of the scariest films of all time. Rex Reed called it the most terrifying film he had ever seen.Muir 2002 p. 17 Empire described it as \\"the most purely horrifying horror movie ever made\\" and called it \\"never less than totally committed to scaring you witless\\". Reminiscing about his first viewing of the film, horror director Wes Craven recalled wondering \\"what kind of Mansonite crazoid\\" could have created such a thing.Bowen 2004, pp. 16‚Äì17 It is a work of \\"cataclysmic terror\\", in the words of horror novelist Stephen King, who declared, \\"I would happily testify to its redeeming social merit in any court in the country.\\" Critic Robin Wood found it one of the few horror films to possess \\"the authentic quality of nightmare\\".Worland 2006, p. 208 Based on 59 reviews published since 2000, the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of critics gave it a positive review, with an average score of 7.89/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"Thanks to a smart script and documentary-style camerawork, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre achieves start-to- finish suspense, making it a classic in low-budget exploitation cinema.\\" =Cultural impact= The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is considered one of the greatest‚Äîand most controversial‚Äîhorror films of all time, and a major influence on the genre. In 1999, Richard Zoglin of Time commented that it had \\"set a new standard for slasher films\\". The Times listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as \\"cheap, grubby and out of control\\", Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times declared that it \\"both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture\\". In his book Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film, David Hogan called it \\"the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is something far more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity.\\" According to Bill Nichols, it \\"achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal\\". Leonard Wolf praised the film as \\"an exquisite work of art\\" and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence. Leatherface has gained a reputation as a significant character in the horror genre, responsible for establishing the use of conventional tools as murder weapons and the image of a large, silent killer devoid of personality. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said, \\"In our collective consciousness, Leatherface and his chainsaw have become as iconic as Freddy and his razors or Jason and his hockey mask.\\" Don Sumner called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a classic that not only introduced a new villain to the horror pantheon but also influenced an entire generation of filmmakers. According to Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of Entertainment Weekly, it laid the foundations for the Halloween, Evil Dead, and Blair Witch horror franchises. Wes Craven crafted his 1977 film The Hills Have Eyes as an homage to Massacre, while Ridley Scott cited Hooper's film as an inspiration for his 1979 film Alien. French director Alexandre Aja credited it as an early influence on his career. Horror filmmaker and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie sees it as a major influence on his work, including his films House of 1000 Corpses (2003) and The Devil's Rejects (2005). The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was selected for the 1975 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight and London Film Festival. In 1976, it won the Special Jury Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in France.Jaworzyn 2004, p. 86 Entertainment Weekly ranked the film sixth on its 2003 list of \\"The Top 50 Cult Films\\". In a 2005 Total Film poll, it was selected as the greatest horror film of all time. It was named among Times top 25 horror films in 2007. In 2008 the film ranked number 199 on Empire magazine's list of \\"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\\". Empire also ranked it 46th in its list of the 50 greatest independent films. In a 2010 Total Film poll, it was again selected as the greatest horror film; the judging panel included veteran horror directors such as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and George A. Romero. In 2010, as well, The Guardian ranked it number 14 on its list of the top 25 horror films. It was also voted the greatest horror film of all time in Slant Magazine 2013 list of the greatest horror films of all time. It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2017 list by Complex and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2017 list by Thrillist. It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2018 list by Consequence of Sound and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2018 list by Esquire. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame in 1990, with director Hooper accepting the award, and it is part of the permanent collection of New York City's Museum of Modern Art. In 2012, the film was named by critics in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound magazine as one of the 250 greatest films. The Academy Film Archive houses the Texas Chain Saw Massacre Collection, which contains over fifty items, including many original elements for the film. Themes and analysis =Contemporary American life= Critic Christopher Sharrett argues that since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963), the American horror film has been defined by the questions it poses \\"about the fundamental validity of the American civilizing process\\",Sharrett 2004, pp. 300‚Äì1 concerns amplified during the 1970s by the \\"delegitimation of authority in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate\\".Sharrett 2004, p. 300 \\"If Psycho began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased underbelly of American Gothic\\", he writes, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre \\"carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcock's film while refusing comforting closure\\".Sharrett 2004, pp. 301‚Äì2 Robin Wood characterizes Leatherface and his family as victims of industrial capitalism, their jobs as slaughterhouse workers having been rendered obsolete by technological advances.Sharrett 2004, p. 308 He states that the picture \\"brings to focus a spirit of negativity ... that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness\\". Naomi Merritt explores the film's representation of \\"cannibalistic capitalism\\" in relation to Georges Bataille's theory of taboo and transgression.Merritt 2010, p. 1 She elaborates on Wood's analysis, stating that the Sawyer family's values \\"reflect, or correspond to, established and interdependent American institutions ... but their embodiment of these social units is perverted and transgressive.\\"Merritt 2010, p. 6 In Kim Newman's view, Hooper's presentation of the Sawyer family during the dinner scene parodies a typical American sitcom family: the gas station owner is the bread-winning father figure; the killer Leatherface is depicted as a bourgeois housewife; the hitchhiker acts as the rebellious teenager. Isabel Cristina Pinedo, author of Recreational Terror: Women and the Pleasures of Horror Film Viewing, states, \\"The horror genre must keep terror and comedy in tension if it is to successfully tread the thin line that separates it from terrorism and parody ... this delicate balance is struck in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which the decaying corpse of Grandpa not only incorporates horrific and humorous effects, but actually uses one to exacerbate the other.\\" =Violence against women= The underlying themes of the film have been the subject of extensive critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence. Stephen Prince comments that the horror is \\"born of the torment of the young woman subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth.\\" As with many horror films, it focuses on the \\"final girl\\" trope‚Äîthe heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters: Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver. Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters.Clover 1993, p. 7 The specific case of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughtered‚Äîhung on a meathook‚Äîand the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture. In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film. She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves. In one study, a group of men were shown five films depicting differing levels of violence against women. On first viewing The Texas Chain Saw Massacre they experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, upon subsequent viewing they found the violence against women less offensive and more enjoyable. Another study, investigating gender-specific perceptions of slasher films, involved 30 male and 30 female university students. One male participant described the screaming, especially Sally's, as the \\"most freaky thing\\" in the film. According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, the lack of explicit violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play a central role in imagining. Nonetheless‚Äîciting its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium‚ÄîStommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level. =Vegetarianism= The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has been described as \\"the ultimate pro-vegetarian film\\" due to its animal rights themes. In a video essay, film critic Rob Ager describes the irony in humans being slaughtered for meat, putting humans in the position of being slaughtered like farm animals. Director Tobe Hooper has confirmed that \\"it's a film about meat\\" and even gave up meat while making the film, saying, \\"In a way I thought the heart of the film was about meat; it‚Äôs about the chain of life and killing sentient beings.\\" Writer-director Guillermo Del Toro became a vegetarian for a time after seeing the film. Post-release  Hollywood Theatre in Portland, Oregon, in July 2014. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has appeared on various home video formats. In the US, it was first released on videotape and CED in the early 1980s by Wizard Video and Vestron Video. The British Board of Film Classification had long since refused a certification for the uncut theatrical version and in 1984 they also refused to certify it for home video, amid a moral panic surrounding \\"video nasties\\". After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States, May 2000 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Australia. In 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls, which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014 a more extensive 4K restoration, supervised by Hooper, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards. In 1982, shortly after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As one of the first horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it. The film has been followed by seven other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006. Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, Spontaneous Combustion.Jaworzyn 2004, p. 188 Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, starring Ren√©e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original. A straight remake, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003. It was followed by a prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, in 2006. A seventh film, Texas Chainsaw 3D, was released on January 4, 2013. It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the previous sequels, or the 2003 remake. Another prequel, Leatherface, was released exclusively to DirecTV on September 21, 2017, before receiving a wider release on video on demand and in limited theaters, simultaneously, in North America on October 20, 2017.

It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire (also named Jeffrey Lebowski) was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped, and he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the ransom money. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, John Turturro and Philip Seymour Hoffman also appear, in supporting roles. The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, \\"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story ‚Äì how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\\" The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers. The Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".  Plot  In 1991 Los Angeles, Jeffrey \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski, a middle-aged bachelor with a penchant for cannabis and bowling, is assaulted by two goons hired by pornographer Jackie Treehorn, demanding money owed by the wife of another Jeffrey Lebowski (the eponymous \\"Big Lebowski\\"). One urinates on the Dude's rug. Eventually, realizing they have the wrong man, they leave. On the advice of his bowling partners Donny Kerabatsos and Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak, the Dude seeks compensation from the other Lebowski, a wealthy, disabled philanthropist who refuses his request. Leaving Lebowski's mansion, the Dude takes a valuable rug and meets Bunny, Lebowski's young trophy wife. Days later, the Dude is told that Bunny has been kidnapped, and Lebowski wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money to find out if the kidnappers are the same people who soiled his rug. The Dude informs Walter and Donny about the kidnapping and suggests that Bunny may have staged her own kidnapping to use the ransom money to pay off her debts; Walter is immediately convinced of this and becomes incredulous at her greed. That night, another pair of thugs knock the Dude unconscious and take his new rug. The kidnappers arrange a meeting, and Walter accompanies the Dude. Still convinced that Bunny \\"kidnapped herself\\", he enacts a plan to give them another briefcase, containing Walter's \\"dirty undies\\", so he and the Dude can keep the ransom money. To the Dude's horror, Walter gives the kidnappers the fake briefcase. After another game of bowling, the Dude's car is stolen with the real briefcase inside. Lebowski's daughter Maude calls the Dude, explaining that she took the rug and invites him to visit her. She plays him a pornographic video revealing Bunny was one of Treehorn's actresses. Agreeing with the Dude's theory that Bunny staged her own abduction, Maude asks the Dude to recover the ransom which her father withdrew from the family's personal foundation. Lebowski confronts the Dude, angry that he failed to deliver the ransom, and shows him a severed toe with green nail polish, presumed to be Bunny's. Three German nihilists threaten the Dude, identifying themselves as the kidnappers; Maude says they are friends of Bunny. The Dude's car is recovered by police, minus the briefcase, but inside the Dude finds the homework of a high school student named Larry Sellers. Walter and the Dude confront Larry at his family's home, and Walter uses a crowbar to wreck a new sports car parked outside which he believes Larry bought with the stolen money. The car's real owner rushes outside and wrecks the Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's. The Dude is forcibly brought to Treehorn, who is seeking Bunny and the money she owes him. Treehorn drugs the Dude's white Russian cocktail, causing him to dream about starring in a Treehorn film about bowling with Maude. Awakening in police custody, the Dude is assaulted by the Malibu police chief. After being kicked out of a cab for hating the Eagles, the Dude is unknowingly passed by Bunny, revealed to still have all of her toes. The Dude returns home to find his bungalow ransacked by Treehorn's goons. He is seduced by Maude, who hopes to conceive a child, assuring him she wants him to have no involvement in its upbringing. She explains that her father has no money of his own, as the family fortune was that of her late mother, who left him none. Having had an epiphany, the Dude has Walter drive him to the Lebowski estate, where Bunny has returned, and the truth of her disappearance is revealed: When Bunny left town on an unannounced trip, her nihilist friends faked her kidnapping to extort money from her husband; Lebowski, who hated his wife, withdrew the ransom from the foundation but kept it for himself, instead giving the Dude a briefcase containing phone books. Walter and the Dude confront Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, so Walter picks him up and throws him out of his wheelchair, thinking he is also faking his paralysis. He isn't. The Dude and his friends return to the bowling alley, where they are confronted by the nihilists who have destroyed the Dude's car. Learning there was never any money, the nihilists try to rob them but Walter violently fends them off. During the scuffle, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack and dies. Some time later, after delivering an informal eulogy to Donny at the beach, Walter accidentally scatters Donny's ashes onto the Dude. They go bowling, and the Dude encounters the film's cowboy narrator, who tells the audience that Maude is pregnant with a \\"little Lebowski\\" and hopes that the Dude and Walter will win their upcoming bowling tournament.  Cast  * Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski. Bridges had heard or was told by the Coen brothers that they had written a screenplay for him. * John Goodman as Walter Sobchak, a Vietnam veteran and bowling partner and friend of \\"The Dude\\". Walter was based, in part, on screenwriter and director John Milius. * Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Jeffrey \\"The Big\\" Lebowski's daughter, a feminist and an avant-garde artist. * Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald \\"Donny\\" Kerabatsos, a bowling partner and friend of \\"The Dude\\". Walter's repeated response, \\"Shut the fuck up, Donny!\\" is a reference to Fargo, in which Buscemi's character was constantly talking and interrupting conversations when he is not paying attention to the story. * David Huddleston as Jeffrey \\"The Big\\" Lebowski, a millionaire philanthropist for whom \\"The Dude\\" is mistaken. * Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, Jeffrey \\"The Big\\" Lebowski's executive assistant. * Tara Reid as Bunny Lebowski, Jeffrey \\"The Big\\" Lebowski's blonde 20s-something trophy wife and former porn video performer (\\"Log Jammin'\\") for Jackie Treehorn Productions. According to Reid, Charlize Theron also tried out for the role. * Philip Moon as Woo, a Jackie Treehorn thug. * Mark Pellegrino as the Blond Treehorn thug. * Peter Stormare, Torsten Voges, and Flea as Uli Kunkel/Karl Hungus, Franz, and Kieffer, the German nihilists: Uli originated on the set of Fargo between Ethan Coen and Stormare, who often spoke in a mock German accent. * Jimmie Dale Gilmore as Smokey, a hippie bowler in the league whom Walter threatens at gunpoint over an attempt to mark his frame an eight despite letting his foot move over the alley line. * Jack Kehler as Marty, The Dude's landlord, who is also a performance artist. * John Turturro as Jesus Quintana. The Coen brothers let Turturro come up with many of his own ideas for the character, like towel-shining the bowling ball and the scene where he dances backward from his bowling alley line, which he says was inspired by Muhammad Ali. * David Thewlis as Knox Harrington, the video artist. * Sam Elliott as The Stranger, a smooth-talking urban cowboy who also serves as the narrator of the film. * Ben Gazzara as big-time porn video producer Jackie Treehorn, to whom Bunny Lebowski owes money. * Jon Polito as Da Fino, a private dick who mistakes the Dude for a \\"brother shamus\\", hired by Bunny's family to return her to them. * Leon Russom as the Malibu police chief * Aimee Mann as Nihilist Woman/Franz's Girlfriend who donates her amputated green nail-polished little toe (proof of Bunny Lebowski's kidnapping). * Lu Elrod as a coffee shop waitress  Production  = Development = The Dude is mostly inspired by Jeff Dowd, an American film producer and political activist the Coen brothers met while they were trying to find distribution for their first feature, Blood Simple. Dowd had been a member of the Seattle Seven, liked to drink White Russians, and was known as \\"The Dude\\". The Dude was also partly based on a friend of the Coen brothers, Peter Exline (now a member of the faculty at USC's School of Cinematic Arts), a Vietnam War veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that \\"tied the room together\\". Exline knew Barry Sonnenfeld from New York University and Sonnenfeld introduced Exline to the Coen brothers while they were trying to raise money for Blood Simple. Exline became friends with the Coens and in 1989, told them all kinds of stories from his own life, including ones about his actor-writer friend Lewis Abernathy (one of the inspirations for Walter), a fellow Vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car. As in the film, Exline's car was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department and Abernathy found an 8th grader's homework under the passenger seat. Exline also belonged to an amateur softball league but the Coens changed it to bowling in the film, because \\"it's a very social sport where you can sit around and drink and smoke while engaging in inane conversation\\". The Coens met filmmaker John Milius, when they were in Los Angeles making Barton Fink and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter. John Milius introduced the Coen Brothers to one of his best friends, Jim Ganzer, who would have been another source of inferences to create Jeff Bridges' character. Also known as the Dude, Ganzer and his gang, typical Malibu surfers, served as inspiration as well for Milius's film Big Wednesday.Sam Bleakley, J. S. Callahan, \\"Surfing Tropical Beats\\", Alison Hodge, 2012, p.133 According to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist Carolee Schneemann, \\"who worked naked from a swing\\", and on Yoko Ono. The character of Jesus Quintana was inspired, in part, by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988, at the Public Theater in a play called Mi Puta Vida in which he played a pederast-type character, \\"so we thought, let's make Turturro a pederast. It'll be something he can really run with,\\" Joel said in an interview. The film's overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, \\"We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling ‚Äì like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes.\\" The use of the Stranger's voice- over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, \\"He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain.\\" The significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, \\"important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless.\\" = Screenplay = The Coen Brothers wrote The Big Lebowski around the same time as Barton Fink. When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, \\"the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter\\", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski \\"is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges\\". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often \\"encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies.\\" In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an \\"effete art-world hanger-on\\", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino. = Pre-production = PolyGram and Working Title Films, who had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with a budget of $15 million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, \\"we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's going to play the role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role.\\" In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually \\"drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude.\\" The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the \\"Gladiator\\" or what they called the \\"Chin Strap\\" and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut. For the film's look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clich√©s like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and for it to be \\"consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy\\", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he \\"came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior\\". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. \\"Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars\\", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a \\"very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it.\\" Cinematographer Roger Deakins discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece. = Principal photography = Actual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks) and the Dude's Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar. According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges \\"was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot.\\" Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on The Lost World: Jurassic Park. She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997 while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech. = Architecture = The scenes in Jackie Treehorn's house were shot in the Sheats-Goldstein Residence, designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills. Deakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, \\"it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty\\" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect. The Coen brothers shot much of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic. To achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera \\"on something like a barbecue spit\\", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. CGI was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball.  Soundtrack  The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a veteran of all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' \\"Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)\\", the Gipsy Kings' cover of \\"Hotel California\\", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, \\"T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac.\\" Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's \\"The Man in Me\\". However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"Dead Flowers\\", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, \\"It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful.\\" Burnett was going to be credited on the film as \\"Music Supervisor\\", but asked his credit to be \\"Music Archivist\\" because he \\"hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management\\". For Joel, \\"the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies\\". Music defines each character. For example, \\"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\\" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was \\"Lujon\\" by Henry Mancini for Jackie Treehorn. \\"The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them\\", remarked Ethan in an interview. The character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, an homage to the band Kraftwerk. The album cover of their record Nagelbett (bed of nails) is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for The Man- Machine and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk song and album. In the lyrics the phrase \\"We believe in nothing\\" is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn's nihilism in the film.  Reception  = Box office = The Big Lebowski received its world premiere at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 1998, at the 1,300-capacity Eccles Theater. It was also screened at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival before opening in North America on March 6, 1998 in 1,207 theaters. It grossed $5.5 million on its opening weekend, finishing up with a gross of $18 million in the United States, just above its US$15 million budget. The film's worldwide gross outside of the US was $28.7 million, bringing its worldwide gross to $46.7 million. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 105 reviews, with an average score of 7.53/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the Coen Brothers, brought to life with strong performances from Goodman and Bridges.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Many critics and audiences have likened the film to a modern Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that revolves around mistaken identity plot devices. Peter Howell, in his review for the Toronto Star, wrote: \\"It's hard to believe that this is the work of a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of Fargo. There's a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps.\\" Howell revised his opinion in a later review, and in 2011 stated that \\"it may just be my favourite Coen Bros. film.\\" Todd McCarthy in Variety magazine wrote: \\"One of the film's indisputable triumphs is its soundtrack, which mixes Carter Burwell's original score with classic pop tunes and some fabulous covers.\\" USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and felt that the Dude was \\"too passive a hero to sustain interest\\", but that there was \\"enough startling brilliance here to suggest that, just like the Dude, those smarty-pants Coens will abide\\". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe praised the Coens and \\"their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana ‚Äì but a sort of neo-Americana that is entirely invented ‚Äì the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. No one does it like them and, it almost goes without saying, no one does it better.\\" Janet Maslin praised Bridges' performance in her review for The New York Times: \\"Mr. Bridges finds a role so right for him that he seems never to have been anywhere else. Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair.\\" Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote: \\"The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year.\\" In a five star review for Empire Magazine, Ian Nathan wrote: \\"For those who delight in the Coens' divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana\\" and \\"In a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \\"weirdly engaging\\". In a 2010 review, Ebert gave The Big Lebowski four stars out of four and added the film to his \\"Great Movies\\" list. However, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in the Chicago Reader: \\"To be sure, The Big Lebowski is packed with show-offy filmmaking and as a result is pretty entertaining. But insofar as it represents a moral position‚Äîand the Coens' relative styling of their figures invariably does‚Äîit's an elitist one, elevating salt-of-the-earth types like Bridges and Goodman ... over everyone else in the movie.\\" Dave Kehr, in his review for the Daily News, criticized the film's premise as a \\"tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film\\". The Guardian criticized the film as \\"a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes. But it does have some terrific jokes.\\"  Legacy  Since its original release, The Big Lebowski has become a cult classic. Ardent fans of the film call themselves \\"achievers\\". Steve Palopoli wrote about the film's emerging cult status in July 2002. He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other. Soon after the article appeared, the programmer for a local midnight film series in Santa Cruz decided to screen The Big Lebowski and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had never happened before. Stars Julianne Moore and Jeff Bridges at the 2011 Lebowski Fest An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in Louisville, Kentucky, United States in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, and has since expanded to several other cities. The festival's main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have even attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event. The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London. Dudeism, a religion devoted largely to spreading the philosophy and lifestyle of the film's main character, was founded in 2005. Also known as The Church of the Latter-Day Dude, the organization has ordained over 220,000 \\"Dudeist Priests\\" all over the world via its website. Two species of African spider are named after the film and main character: Anelosimus biglebowski and Anelosimus dude, both described in 2006. Additionally, an extinct Permian conifer genus is named after the film in honor of its creators. The first species described within this genus in 2007 is based on 270-million-year-old plant fossils from Texas, and is called Lebowskia grandifolia. Entertainment Weekly ranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list. The film was also ranked No. 34 on their list of \\"The Top 50 Cult Films\\" and ranked No. 15 on the magazine's \\"The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83\\" list. In addition, the magazine also ranked The Dude No. 14 in their \\"The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\\" poll. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. The Big Lebowski was voted as the 10th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: \\"The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list.\\" Empire magazine ranked Walter Sobchak No. 49 and the Dude No. 7 in their \\"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\\" poll. Roger Ebert added The Big Lebowski to his list of \\"Great Movies\\" in March 2010. A spin-off based on John Turturro's character, titled The Jesus Rolls, was released in 2019, with Turturro also acting as writer and director. = Use as social and political analysis = The film has been used as a tool for analysis on a number of issues. In September 2008, Slate published an article that interpreted The Big Lebowski as a political critique. The center piece of this viewpoint was that Walter Sobchak is \\"a neocon\\", citing the film's references to then President George H. W. Bush and the first Gulf War. A journal article by Brian Wall, published in the feminist journal Camera Obscura, uses the film to explain Karl Marx's commodity fetishism and the feminist consequences of sexual fetishism.Wall, Brian 2008, Jackie Treehorn Treats Objects Like Women!': Two Types of Fetishism in The Big Lebowski\\", Camera Obscura, Vol. 23 No. 3, pp. 111‚Äì135 In That Rug Really Tied the Room Together, first published in 2001, Joseph Natoli argues that The Dude represents a counter narrative to the post-Reaganomic entrepreneurial rush for \\"return on investment\\" on display in such films as Jerry Maguire and Forrest Gump. It has been used as a carnivalesque critique of society, as an analysis on war and ethics, as a narrative on mass communication and US militarism and other issues.  Home media  Universal Studios Home Entertainment released a \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD on October 18, 2005, with extra features that included an \\"introduction by Mortimer Young\\", \\"Jeff Bridges' Photography\\", \\"Making of The Big Lebowski\\", and \\"Production Notes\\". In addition, a limited-edition \\"Achiever's Edition Gift Set\\" also included The Big Lebowski Bowling Shammy Towel, four Collectible Coasters that included photographs and quotable lines from the film, and eight Exclusive Photo Cards from Jeff Bridges' personal collection. A \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" was released on September 9, 2008 and features all of the extras from the \\"Collector's Edition\\" and \\"The Dude's Life: Strikes and Gutters ... Ups and Downs ... The Dude Abides\\" theatrical trailer (from the first DVD release), \\"The Lebowski Fest: An Achiever's Story\\", \\"Flying Carpets and Bowling Pin Dreams: The Dream Sequences of the Dude\\", \\"Interactive Map\\", \\"Jeff Bridges Photo Book\\", and a \\"Photo Gallery\\". There are both a standard release and a Limited Edition which features \\"Bowling Ball Packaging\\" and is individually numbered. A high-definition version of The Big Lebowski was released by Universal on HD DVD format on June 26, 2007. The film was released in Blu-ray format in Italy by Cecchi Gori. On August 16, 2011, Universal Pictures released The Big Lebowski on Blu-ray. The limited-edition package includes a Jeff Bridges photo book, a ten-years-on retrospective, and an in-depth look at the annual Lebowski Fest. The film is also available in the Blu-ray Coen Brothers box set released in the UK, however this version is region free and will work in any Blu-ray player. For the film's 20th Anniversary, Universal Pictures released a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the film, which was released on October 16, 2018.  Related media  The Coen brothers have stated that they will never make a sequel to The Big Lebowski. Nevertheless, John Turturro expressed interest in reprising his role as Jesus Quintana, and in 2014, he announced that he had requested permission to use the character. In August 2016, it was reported that Turturro would reprise his role as Jesus Quintana in The Jesus Rolls, a spin-off of The Big Lebowski, based on the 1974 French film Going Places, with Turturro starring, writing, and directing. It was released in 2020. The Coen brothers, although having granted Turturro the right to use the character, were not involved, and no other character from The Big Lebowski was featured in the film. On January 24, 2019, Jeff Bridges posted a 5-second clip on Twitter with the statement: \\"Can't be living in the past, man. Stay tuned\\" and showing Bridges as the Dude, walking through a room as a tumbleweed rolls by. The clip was a teaser trailer for an ad during Super Bowl LIII which featured Bridges reprising the role of The Dude for a Stella Artois commercial.

Cook. The film stars Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris, with William Forsythe and Michael Biehn co-starring. It is dedicated to Simpson, who died five months before its release. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but it was nominated for Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing at the 69th Academy Awards, it earned box-office receipts of over $335 million against a production budget of $75 million, and was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1996. In the film, the Pentagon assigns a team comprising an FBI chemist and a former SAS captain with a team of SEALs to break into Alcatraz, where a group of rogue US Force Recon Marines have seized all the tourists on the Island and have threatened to launch nerve gas filled rockets upon San Francisco unless Washington pays $100 million to the next-of- kin of eighty three killed while under their command on missions denied ever to have existed by the Pentagon. Plot A group of rogue U.S. Force Recon Marines, led by disenchanted Brigadier General Frank Hummel and his second-in- command Major Tom Baxter, storm a heavily guarded naval weapons depot and steal a stockpile of deadly VX gas-armed M55 rockets, losing one of their own men in the process. The next day, Hummel and his men, along with newly- recruited Marine Captains Frye and Darrow, seize control of Alcatraz Island, taking eighty-one tourists hostage. Hummel threatens to launch the rockets against San Francisco unless the U.S. government pays him $100 million from a military slush fund, which he will distribute to his men and the families of Recon Marines who died on clandestine missions under his command but whose deaths were not compensated. The Pentagon and FBI develop a plan to retake the island with a U.S. Navy SEAL team led by Commander Anderson, enlisting the FBI's top chemical weapons specialist, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed. FBI Director James Womack is forced to offer a pardon to federal prisoner John Mason in return for information. Mason, a 60-year-old Scottish national imprisoned without charges for two decades, is the only Alcatraz inmate ever to escape the island. After being set up in a hotel, Mason escapes, resulting in a car chase with Goodspeed through the streets of San Francisco. While Mason seeks out his estranged daughter, Jade, Goodspeed arrives, but he covers for Mason by telling Jade that Mason is aiding the FBI. Goodspeed, Mason, and the SEALs infiltrate Alcatraz but Hummel's men are alerted to their presence and ambush them in a shower room. All the SEALs, including Anderson, are killed, leaving only Mason and Goodspeed alive. Mason sees his chance to escape custody and disarms Goodspeed, but is convinced to help defuse the rockets after the Marines use explosive devices to flush them out. They eliminate several teams of Marines and disable twelve of the fifteen rockets by removing their guidance chips. Hummel threatens to execute a hostage if they do not surrender and return the guidance chips; instead, Mason destroys the chips and surrenders to Hummel to try and reason with him as well as buy Goodspeed some time. Though Goodspeed disables another rocket, the Marines capture him. With the incursion team lost, the military initiates their backup plan: an airstrike by F/A-18s with thermite plasma, which will neutralize the poison gas and kill everyone on the island. Mason and Goodspeed escape, after which the former explains why he was held prisoner: he was a British SAS Captain who stole a microfilm containing details of the United States' most closely guarded secrets, refusing to give it up when captured because he knew he would be killed if he did. When the deadline for the transfer of the ransom passes, Hummel is urged by his men to fire one of the rockets; at first he does this, but then redirects it to detonate at sea. Hummel, confronted by Frye and Darrow, declares the mission is over, explaining that it was all an elaborate bluff as he never had any intention of harming innocent lives. Hummel orders them to exit Alcatraz with a few hostages and the remaining rocket to cover their retreat while he assumes blame. Frye and Darrow rebel upon realizing they will not be paid their $1 million apiece, killing Baxter and mortally wounding Hummel‚Äîwho tells Goodspeed where the last rocket is before dying. Darrow and Frye proceed with the plan to fire on San Francisco. Goodspeed seeks out the rocket while Mason deals with the remaining Marines. As the jets approach, Goodspeed disables the rocket before killing both Darrow and Frye. He signals that the threat is over just as one jet drops a bomb; though no hostages are injured, Goodspeed is thrown into the sea by the blast and Mason rescues him. Goodspeed and Mason part ways after Mason reveals the location of the microfilm; Goodspeed fakes Mason's death by telling Womack that he was killed in the bomb explosion. Sometime later, Goodspeed and his newlywed wife Carla are seen stealing the microfilm from a church and driving away. Cast Cast member Michael Biehn signing the cover of the film on DVD in 2012 Production Jonathan Hensleigh participated in writing the script, which became the subject of a dispute with the Writers Guild of America. The spec script (by David Weisberg and Douglas Cook) was reworked by several writers, but other than the original team, Mark Rosner was the only one granted official credit by guild arbitration. The rule is that the credited writing team must contribute 50% of the final script (effectively limiting credits to the screenplay's initial authors, plus one re-write team). Despite their work on the script, neither Hensleigh nor Aaron Sorkin was credited in the film. The director Michael Bay wrote an open letter of protest, in which he criticized the arbitration procedure as a \\"sham\\" and a \\"travesty\\". He said Hensleigh had worked closely with him on the movie and should have received screen credit.Welkos, Robert W. \\"'Cable,' 'Rock' in Disputes on Writing Credits\\". Los Angeles Times, May 21, 1996, p. 1. Quentin Tarantino was also an uncredited screenwriter. Los Angeles-based British screenwriting team Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were brought in at Connery's request to rewrite his lines, but ended up altering much of the film's dialogue. It was Nicolas Cage's idea that his character would not swear; his euphemisms include \\"gee whiz.\\" Bay had worked closely with Ed Harris to develop his character as concretely as possible, later adding a sympathetic edge to Hummel. There were tensions during shooting between director Bay and Walt Disney Studios executives who were supervising the production. On the commentary track for the Criterion Collection DVD, Bay recalls a time when he was preparing to leave the set for a meeting with the executives when he was approached by Sean Connery in golfing attire. Connery, who also produced the film, asked Bay where he was going, and when Bay explained he had a meeting with the executives, Connery asked if he could accompany him. Bay complied and when he arrived in the conference room, the executives' jaws dropped when they saw Connery appear behind him. According to Bay, Connery then stood up for Bay and insisted that he was doing a good job and should be left alone. Most of the film was shot on location in the Alcatraz Prison on Alcatraz Island. As it's governed by the national park service, it wasn't possible to close Alcatraz down, and much of the filming had to accommodate tour parties milling around. The scene in which FBI director Womack is thrown off the balcony was filmed on location at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. The filming led to numerous calls to the hotel by people who saw a man dangling from the balcony.Great Hotels. The Travel Channel The Rock‚Äôs closing scene was shot outside the historic Sacred Heart Chapel in Saticoy, California (Ventura County, California). Controversy =Censorship= In the original UK DVD release, the scene in which Connery throws a knife through Scarpetti's throat and says \\"you must never hesitate\\" to Cage was cut, although the scene was shown on British television. Consequently, a later scene in which Connery says to Cage, \\"I'm rather glad you didn't hesitate too long,\\" lost its impact on viewers who had not seen the first scene. Other cuts included the reduction of multiple gunshot impacts into Gamble's feet in the morgue down to a single hit; a close-up of his screaming face as the air conditioner falls onto him; a sound cut to Mason snapping a Marine's neck and two bloody gunshot wounds (to Hummel and Baxter), both near the end of the film. =Iraqi chemical weapons program= A scene from the film was the basis for incorrect and false descriptions of the Iraqi chemical weapons program. Britain's Secret Intelligence Service was led to believe Saddam Hussein was continuing to produce weapons of mass destruction by a false agent who based his reports on the movie, according to the Chilcot Inquiry. In September 2002, MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove said the agency had acquired information from a new source revealing that Iraq was stepping up production of chemical and biological warfare agents. The source, who was said to have \\"direct access\\", claimed senior staff were working seven days a week while the regime was concentrating a great deal of effort on the production of anthrax. Dearlove told the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), Sir John Scarlett, that they were \\"on the edge of (a) significant intel breakthrough\\" which could be the \\"key to unlock\\" Iraq's weapons programme. However, questions were raised about the agent's claims when it was noticed his description bore a striking resemblance to a scene from the film. \\"It was pointed out that glass containers were not typically used in chemical munitions, and that a popular movie (The Rock) had inaccurately depicted nerve agents being carried in glass beads or spheres,\\" the Chilcot report stated. By February 2003 ‚Äì a month before the invasion of Iraq ‚Äì MI6 concluded that their source had been lying \\"over a period of time\\" but failed to inform No 10 or others, even though UK Prime Minister Tony Blair had been briefed on this intelligence. According to The Independent, the false claims of weapons of mass destructions were the justification for UK's entering the war. The film's co-writer David Weisberg said, \\"What was so amazing was anybody in the poison gas community would immediately know that this was total bullshit ‚Äì such obvious bullshit\\". Weisberg said he was unsurprised a desperate agent might resort to films for inspiration, but dismayed that authorities \\"didn't do apparently the most basic fact-checking or vetting of the information. If you'd just asked a chemical weapons expert, it would have been immediately obvious it was ludicrous\\". Weisberg said he had had some \\"funny emails\\" after the report, but he felt \\"it's not a nice legacy for the film\\". \\"It's tragic that we went to war\\", he concluded.

R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the world at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold. The title names the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin. Although generally known to readers as a trilogy, the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two- volume set along with The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher., letter #126 to Milton Waldman (draft), 10 March 1950 For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955. The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Structurally, the work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material at the end. Some editions print the entire work into a single volume, following the author's original intent. Tolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, religion, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War. The Lord of the Rings in its turn has had a great effect on modern fantasy. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired numerous derivative works including artwork, music, films and television, video games, board games, and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It has been named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read. Plot =The Fellowship of the Ring= Prologue The prologue explains that the book is \\"largely concerned with hobbits\\", and tells of their origins in a migration from the east; of how they smoke \\"pipe-weed\\"; of how the Shire, where most of them live, is organised; and how the narrative follows on from The Hobbit, in which the hobbit Bilbo Baggins finds the Ring, which had been in the possession of the creature Gollum.The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"Prologue\\" Book One Gandalf proves that Frodo's Ring is the One Ring by throwing it into Frodo's fireplace: the hidden text of the Rhyme of the Rings is displayed. Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday and leaves the Shire, leaving the Ring to Frodo Baggins, his cousinAlthough Frodo refers to Bilbo as his \\"uncle\\", the character is introduced in \\"A Long-expected Party\\" as one of Bilbo's younger cousins.

Various details of the frame story appear in the Prologue, its \\"Note on Shire Records\\", and in the Appendices, notably Appendix F. In this frame story, the Red Book is the purported source of Tolkien's other works relating to Middle-earth: The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, and The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Concept and creation =Background= Although a major work in itself, The Lord of the Rings was only the last movement of a much older set of narratives Tolkien had worked on since 1917 encompassing The Silmarillion, in a process he described as mythopoeia. The Lord of the Rings started as a sequel to Tolkien's work The Hobbit, published in 1937. The popularity of The Hobbit had led George Allen & Unwin, the publishers, to request a sequel. Tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly, and responded with several stories he had already developed. Having rejected his contemporary drafts for The Silmarillion, putting Roverandom on hold, and accepting Farmer Giles of Ham, Allen & Unwin continued to ask for more stories about hobbits. =Writing= Persuaded by his publishers, he started \\"a new Hobbit\\" in December 1937. After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter (\\"A Long-Expected Party\\") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title The Lord of the Rings did not arrive until the spring of 1938. Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work. As the story progressed, he brought in elements from The Silmarillion mythology. Writing was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, marked exams to bring in a little extra income, and wrote many drafts., letter #17 to Stanley Unwin, 15 October 1937 Tolkien abandoned The Lord of the Rings during most of 1943 and only restarted it in April 1944, as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force. Tolkien made another major effort in 1946, and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947. The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949. The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J. R. R. Tolkien Collection at Marquette University. =Poetry= Unusually for 20th century novels, the prose narrative is supplemented throughout by over 60 pieces of poetry. These include verse and songs of many genres: for wandering, marching to war, drinking, and having a bath; narrating ancient myths, riddles, prophecies, and magical incantations; and of praise and lament (elegy). Some, such as riddles, charms, elegies, and narrating heroic actions are found in Old English poetry. Scholars have stated that the poetry is essential for the fiction to work aesthetically and thematically, as it adds information not given in the prose, and it brings out characters and their backgrounds. The poetry has been judged to be of high technical skill, reflected in his prose; for instance, he wrote much of Tom Bombadil's speech in metre. =Illustrations= Tolkien's calligraphy of the Rhyme of the Rings was one of the few illustrations in the first edition. Tolkien worked on the text using his maps of Middle-earth as a guide, to ensure the elements of the story fitted together in time and space. He prepared a variety of types of illustration ‚Äì maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover designs, even a facsimile painting of the Book of Mazarbul ‚Äì but only the maps, the inscription on the Ring, and a drawing of the Doors of DurinThe Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 4 \\"A Journey in the Dark\\" were included in the first edition.Letters #141 to Allen & Unwin, 9 October 1953}} The hardback editions sometimes had cover illustrations by Tolkien, sometimes by other artists. According to The New York Times, Barbara Remington's cover designs for Ballantine's paperback editions \\"achieved mass-cult status in the 1960s, particularly on college campuses\\" across America. In the rush to print, Remington had no time to read the book, and surprised Tolkien with details such as a tree with pumpkin-like fruits, and a lion, which was painted out for later editions. =Influences= Beowulfs eotenas [ond] ylfe [ond] orcneas, \\"ogres [and] elves [and] devil-corpses\\" helped to inspire Tolkien to create the Orcs and Elves of Middle-earth. Tolkien drew on a wide array of influences including language, Christianity,, letter #142 to Robert Murray, S. J., 2 December 1953 mythology including the Norse V√∂lsunga saga, archaeology, especially at the Temple of Nodens, ancient and modern literature, and personal experience. He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology;, letter #165 to Houghton Mifflin, 30 June 1955 his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings. He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. Commentators have attempted to identify literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings; he acknowledged that he had enjoyed adventure stories by authors such as John Buchan and Rider Haggard. The Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris was a major influence,, letter #19 to Stanley Unwin, 31 December 1960 and Tolkien undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home. Tolkien stated, too, that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside of Worcestershire near Sarehole Mill, and its urbanisation by the growth of Birmingham,, letter #178 to Allen & Unwin, 12 December 1955, and #303 to Nicholas Thomas, 6 May 1968 and his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War. =Themes= Scholars and critics have identified many themes in the book, including a reversed quest, the struggle of good and evil, death and immortality, fate and free will, the addictive danger of power, and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope and redemptive suffering. There is a common theme throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places, along with hints of providence in descriptions of weather and landscape. Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality., letter #211 to Rhona Beare, 14 October 1958 To those who supposed that the book was an allegory of events in the 20th century, Tolkien replied in the Foreword to the Second Edition that it was not, saying he preferred \\"history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.\\"The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"Foreword to the Second Edition\\" Some commentators have accused the book of being a story about men for boys, with no significant women; or about a purely rural world with no bearing on modern life in cities; of containing no sign of religion; or of racism. All of these charges have been rebutted by other commentators, who note that there are three powerful women in the book, Galadriel, √âowyn, and Arwen; that life, even in rural Hobbiton, is not idealised; that Christianity is a pervasive theme; and that Tolkien was sharply anti-racist both in peacetime and during the Second World War, while Middle-earth is evidently polycultural. Publication history A dispute with his publisher, George Allen & Unwin, led to his offering the work to William Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but Allen & Unwin were unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself \\"urgently wanted cutting\\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952. Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, \\"I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff\\", fearing his work would never see the light of day. For publication, the work was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type-setting and modest anticipated sales: The Fellowship of the Ring (Books I and II), The Two Towers (Books III and IV), and The Return of the King (Books V and VI plus six appendices). Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped ‚Äì on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published The Fellowship of the Ring on 21 October 1954, The Two Towers on 21 April 1955, and The Return of the King on 5 January 1956.The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Rings] (publication history) The Return of the King was especially delayed as Tolkien revised the ending and preparing appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the title The Return of the King, believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher's preference.\\"From Book to Script\\", The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Appendices (DVD). New Line Cinema. 2002. Tolkien wrote that the title The Two Towers \\"can be left ambiguous,\\", letter #140 to Rayner Unwin, 17 August 1953 but considered naming the two as Orthanc and Barad-d√ªr, Minas Tirith and Barad-d√ªr, or Orthanc and the Tower of Cirith Ungol., letter #143 to Rayner Unwin, 22 January 1954 However, a month later he wrote a note published at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring and later drew a cover illustration, both of which identified the pair as Minas Morgul and Orthanc.\\"The second part is called The Two Towers, since the events recounted in it are dominated by Orthanc, ..., and the fortress of Minas Morgul...\\" Tolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g. The Lord of the Rings: Vol. 1, The Ring Sets Out and The Ring Goes South; Vol. 2, The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring and The End of the Third Age. However, these individual book titles were dropped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien suggested the volume titles: Vol. 1, The Shadow Grows; Vol. 2, The Ring in the Shadow; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring or The Return of the King., letter #137, #140, #143 all to Rayner Unwin, his publisher, in 1953-4 Because the three-volume binding was so widely distributed, the work is often referred to as the Lord of the Rings \\"trilogy\\". In a letter to the poet W. H. Auden, who famously reviewed the final volume in 1956, Tolkien himself made use of the term \\"trilogy\\" for the work, letter #163 to W. H. Auden, 7 June 1955 though he did at other times consider this incorrect, as it was written and conceived as a single book., letter #149 to Rayner Unwin, 9 September 1954 It is often called a novel; however, Tolkien objected to this term as he viewed it as a heroic romance., letter #239 to Peter Szabo Szentmihalyi, draft, October 1971 The books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits. It has ultimately become one of the best-selling novels ever written, with 50 million copies sold by 2003 and over 150 million copies sold by 2007. The work was published in the UK by Allen & Unwin until 1990, when the publisher and its assets were acquired by HarperCollins. =Editions and revisions= In the early 1960s Donald A. Wollheim, science fiction editor of the paperback publisher Ace Books, claimed that The Lord of the Rings was not protected in the United States under American copyright law because Houghton Mifflin, the US hardcover publisher, had neglected to copyright the work in the United States. Then, in 1965, Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without paying royalties to him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection. Grass-roots pressure from these fans became so great that Ace Books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien., letters #270, #273 and #277 Barbara Remington's cover illustrations for the Ballantine paperback version \\"achieved mass-cult status\\" on American college campuses in the 1960s. They were parodied by Michael K. Frith's cover design for the 1969 Bored of the Rings. Authorized editions followed from Ballantine Books and Houghton Mifflin to tremendous commercial success. Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an unquestioned US copyright. This text became the Second Edition of The Lord of the Rings, published in 1965. The first Ballantine paperback edition was printed in October that year, selling a quarter of a million copies within ten months. On 4 September 1966, the novel debuted on The New York Timess Paperback Bestsellers list as number three, and was number one by 4 December, a position it held for eight weeks.Medievalist Comics and the American Century Houghton Mifflin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by Tolkien, and corrections supervised by Christopher Tolkien, which resulted, after some initial glitches, in a computer-based unified text.\\"Notes on the text\\" pp. xi‚Äìxiii, Douglas A. Anderson, in the 1994 HarperCollins edition of The Fellowship of the Ring. In 2004, for the 50th Anniversary Edition, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, under supervision from Christopher Tolkien, studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inconsistencies as possible, some of which had been introduced by well-meaning compositors of the first printing in 1954, and never been corrected. The 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers. Yet more corrections were made in the 60th Anniversary Edition in 2014. Several editions, including the 50th Anniversary Edition, print the whole work in one volume, with the result that pagination varies widely over the various editions. =Posthumous publication of drafts= From 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of The Lord of The Rings, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6‚Äì9 of his History of Middle-earth series. The four volumes carry the titles The Return of the Shadow, The Treason of Isengard, The War of the Ring, and Sauron Defeated. =Translations= The work has been translated, with varying degrees of success, into at least 38, and reportedly at least 70, languages. Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by √Öke Ohlmarks,, letters #228 and #229 to Allen & Unwin, 24 January 1961 and 23 February 1961 Tolkien wrote a \\"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\\" (1967). Because The Lord of the Rings purports to be a translation of the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch, with the English language representing the Westron of the \\"original\\", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance. Reception =1950s= Early reviews for The Lord of the Rings were mixed. The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \\"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\\". The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \\"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them.\\" The New York Herald Tribune appeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were \\"destined to outlast our time\\". W. H. Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \\"masterpiece\\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost. Kenneth F. Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, \\"... if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear\\". Even within Tolkien's literary group, The Inklings, the work had a mixed reception. Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings,Dyson's actual comment, bowdlerized in the TV version, was \\"Not another fucking Elf!\\" whereas C. S. Lewis had very different feelings, writing, \\"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.\\" Lewis observed that the writing is rich, in that some of the 'good' characters have darker sides, and likewise some of the villains have \\"good impulses\\".C. S. Lewis, quoted in Christina Scull & Wayne Hammond (2006), The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide, HarperCollins, article 'The Lord of the Rings', ¬ß Reviews, p. 549; Despite the mixed reviews and the lack of a paperback until the 1960s, The Lord of the Rings initially sold well in hardback. =Later= Judith Shulevitz, writing in The New York Times, criticized the \\"pedantry\\" of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he \\"formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself\\". The critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in The New Republic, criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself were, according to Jenkyns, \\"anemic, and lacking in fibre\\". The science fiction author David Brin interprets the work as holding unquestioning devotion to a traditional hierarchical social structure. In his essay \\"Epic Pooh\\", fantasy author Michael Moorcock critiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the \\"paternalism\\" of the narrative voice and the power structures in the narrative. Tom Shippey, like Tolkien an English philologist, notes the wide gulf between Tolkien's supporters, both popular and academic, and his literary detractors, and attempts to explain in detail both why the literary establishment disliked The Lord of the Rings, and the work's subtlety, themes, and merits, including the impression of depth that it conveys. =Awards= In 1957, The Lord of the Rings was awarded the International Fantasy Award. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped The Lord of the Rings become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys. In the 2003 \\"Big Read\\" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the \\"Nation's best- loved book\\". In similar 2004 polls both Germany and Australia chose The Lord of the Rings as their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite \\"book of the millennium\\". In 2019, the BBC News listed The Lord of the Rings on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Adaptations The Lord of the Rings has been adapted for film, radio, stage, and television. = Radio = The book has been adapted for radio four times. In 1955 and 1956, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a 13-part radio adaptation of the story. In the 1960s radio station WBAI produced a short radio adaptation. A 1979 dramatization of The Lord of the Rings was broadcast in the United States and subsequently issued on tape and CD. In 1981, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a new dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments. = Film = A variety of filmmakers considered adapting Tolkien's book, among them Stanley Kubrick, who thought it unfilmable,See also interview in \\"Show\\" magazine vol. 1, Number 1 1970 Michelangelo Antonioni, Heinz Edelmann, and John Boorman.Taylor, Patrick (19 January 2014).

In 1978, Ralph Bakshi made an animated film version covering The Fellowship of the Ring and part of The Two Towers, to mostly poor reviews. In 1980, Rankin/Bass released an animated TV special based on the closing chapters of The Return of the King, gaining mixed reviews. A far more successful adaptation was Peter Jackson's live action The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, produced by New Line Cinema and released in three instalments as The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). All three parts won multiple Academy Awards, including consecutive Best Picture nominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one-billion- dollar barrier and won a total of 11 Oscars (something only two other films in history, Ben-Hur and Titanic, have accomplished), including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.The Return of the King peak positions *U.S. and Canada: *Worldwide: Commentators including Tolkien scholars, literary critics and film critics are divided on how faithfully Jackson adapted Tolkien's work, or whether a film version is inevitably different, and if so the reasons for any changes, and the effectiveness of the result. The Hunt for Gollum, a 2009 film by Chris Bouchard, and the 2009 Born of Hope, written by Paula DiSante and directed by Kate Madison, are fan films based on details in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings. In 2017, Amazon acquired the global television rights to The Lord of the Rings for a multi-season television series of new stories set before The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, based on J.R.R. Tolkien's writings about events of the Second Age of Middle-earth. = Stage = In 1990, Recorded Books published an audio version of The Lord of the Rings, read by the British actor Rob Inglis. A large-scale musical theatre adaptation, The Lord of the Rings, was first staged in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2006 and opened in London in June 2007; it was a commercial failure. = Television = A variety of attempts at televising the work have been made on different scales in various countries. A Swedish live action television film, Sagan om ringen, was broadcast in 1971.K-Special, \\"I trollkarlens hatt \\" (at 24m30s), Sveriges television, 23 October 2015. Retrieved 26 October 2015. In Finland, a live action television miniseries, Hobitit, was broadcast in 1993 based on The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. , Amazon Studios is in production on The Lord of the Rings, a multi-season television series set before the War of the Ring. Legacy =Influence on fantasy = The enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy. Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day. The opus has spawned many imitations, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called \\"the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read\\". The Legend of Zelda, which popularized the action-adventure game genre in the 1980s, was inspired by The Lord of the Rings among other fantasy books. Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features several races from The Lord of the Rings, including halflings (hobbits), elves, dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, lead designer of the game, maintained that he was influenced very little by The Lord of the Rings, stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game. Because Dungeons & Dragons has gone on to influence many popular role-playing video games, the influence of The Lord of the Rings extends to many of them, with titles such as Dragon Quest, the Ultima series, EverQuest, the Warcraft series, and The Elder Scrolls series of games as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself. =Music= In 1965, the songwriter Donald Swann, best known for his collaboration with Michael Flanders as Flanders & Swann, set six poems from The Lord of the Rings and one from The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (\\"Errantry\\") to music. When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for \\"Nam√°ri√´\\" (Galadriel's lament) a setting reminiscent of plain chant, which Swann accepted.Tolkien had recorded a version of his theme on a friend's tape recorder in 1952. This was later issued by Caedmon Records in 1975 as part of J.R.R. Tolkien reads and sings The Lord of the Rings (LP recording TC1478). The songs were published in 1967 as The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle, and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year by Caedmon Records as Poems and Songs of Middle Earth. Rock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrically inspired by the fantasy-embracing counter-culture of the time. The British rock band Led Zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to The Lord of the Rings, such as mentioning Gollum and Mordor in \\"Ramble On\\", the Misty Mountains in \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", and Ringwraiths in \\"The Battle of Evermore\\". In 1970, the Swedish musician Bo Hansson released an instrumental concept album entitled Sagan om ringen (\\"The Saga of the Ring\\", the title of the Swedish translation at the time). The album was subsequently released internationally as Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings in 1972. From the 1980s onwards, many heavy metal acts have been influenced by Tolkien. In 1988, the Dutch composer and trombonist Johan de Meij completed his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It had 5 movements, titled \\"Gandalf\\", \\"Lothl√≥rien\\", \\"Gollum\\", \\"Journey in the Dark\\", and \\"Hobbits\\". =Impact on popular culture= \\"Welcome to Hobbiton\\" sign in Matamata, New Zealand, where Peter Jackson's film version was shot The Lord of the Rings has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially during the 1960s and 1970s, when young people embraced it as a countercultural saga. \\"Frodo Lives!\\" and \\"Gandalf for President\\" were two phrases popular amongst United States Tolkien fans during this time. Its impact is such that the words \\"Tolkienian\\" and \\"Tolkienesque\\" have entered the Oxford English Dictionary, and many of his fantasy terms, formerly little- known in English, such as \\"Orc\\" and \\"Warg\\", have become widespread in that domain. Among its effects are numerous parodies, especially Harvard Lampoon Bored of the Rings, which has had the distinction of remaining continuously in print from its publication in 1969, and of being translated into at least 11 languages. In 1969, Tolkien sold the merchandising rights to The Lord of The Rings (and The Hobbit) to United Artists under an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of ¬£10,000 plus a 7.5% royalty after costs, payable to Allen & Unwin and the author. In 1976, three years after the author's death, United Artists sold the rights to Saul Zaentz Company, who now trade as Tolkien Enterprises. Since then all \\"authorised\\" merchandise has been signed off by Tolkien Enterprises, although the intellectual property rights of the specific likenesses of characters and other imagery from various adaptations is generally held by the adaptors. Outside any commercial exploitation from adaptations, from the late 1960s onwards there has been an increasing variety of original licensed merchandise, from posters and calendars created by illustrators such as Barbara Remington. The work was named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read. In 2015, the BBC ranked The Lord of the Rings 26th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels.

They were among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and voice along with his erratic stage persona, and the group was widely regarded as an important part of the era's counterculture. The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, itself a reference to a quote by William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records, the Doors with Morrison released six albums in five years, some of which are considered among the greatest of all time, including The Doors (1967), Strange Days (1967), and L.A. Woman (1971). They were one of the most successful bands during that time and by 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles. Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. They released three more albums in the 1970s, two of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison, and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as the Doors of the 21st Century. Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek‚ÄìKrieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013. The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs. In the official DVD Dance on Fire features in the credits of the song 'Riders on the Storm': \\"They would become the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold and platinum LPs\\". According to the RIAA, they have sold 33 million records in the US and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\". In 1993, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. History =Origins (July 1965 ‚Äì August 1966)= The Doors logo, designed by an Elektra Records assistant, first appeared on their 1967 debut album. The Doors began with a meeting between acquaintances Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek, both of whom had attended the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, on Venice Beach in July 1965. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs. Morrison said: \\"I was taking notes at a fantastic rock'n'roll concert going on in my head\\" and with Manzarek's encouragement sang \\"Moonlight Drive\\". The members came from a varied musical background of jazz, rock, blues, and folk idioms. Keyboardist Manzarek was in a band called Rick & the Ravens with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer John Densmore was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes. In August 1965, Densmore joined the group, which had been renamed the Doors. The five (Morrison having previously joined the band), along with bass player Patty Sullivan recorded a six-song demo on September 2, 1965 at World Pacific Studios, Los Angeles, California (officially made available much later in October 1997 on the Doors' Box Set CD release). This has circulated widely since then as a bootleg recording. The band took their name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, itself derived from a line in William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: \\"If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite\\". In mid-1965, after Manzarek's two brothers left, guitarist Robby Krieger joined. Whisky a Go Go From February to May 1966, the group had a residency at the \\"rundown\\" and \\"sleazy\\" Los Angeles club London Fog, appearing on the bill with \\"Rhonda Lane Exotic Dancer\\". The experience gave Morrison confidence to perform in front of a live audience, and the band as a whole to develop and, in some cases, lengthen their songs and work \\"The End\\" and \\"Light My Fire\\" into the pieces that would appear on their debut album. Ray Manzarek would later say that at the London Fog the band \\"became this collective entity, this unit of oneness ... that is where the magic began to happen.\\" The Doors soon graduated to the more esteemed Whisky a Go Go, where they were the house band (starting from May 1966), supporting acts including Van Morrison's group Them. On their last night together the two bands joined up for \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" and a twenty-minute jam session of Them's \\"Gloria\\". On August 10, 1966, they were spotted by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman, who was present at the recommendation of Love singer Arthur Lee, whose group was with Elektra Records. After Holzman and producer Paul A. Rothchild saw two sets of the band playing at the Whisky a Go Go, they signed them to the Elektra Records label on August 18 ‚Äì the start of a long and successful partnership with Rothchild and sound engineer Bruce Botnick. The Doors were fired from the Whisky on August 21, 1966 when Morrison added an explicit retelling and profanity-laden version of the Greek myth of Oedipus during \\"The End\\". =The Doors and Strange Days (August 1966 ‚Äì December 1967)= The Doors performing at Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival in 1967 The band recorded their first album from August 24 to 31, 1966, at Sunset Sound Recording Studios. The debut album, The Doors, was released in the first week of January 1967. It included most of the major songs from their set, including the nearly 12-minute musical drama \\"The End\\". In November 1966, Mark Abramson directed a promotional film for the lead single \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\\". To promote the single, the Doors made several television appearances such as on Shebang, a Los Angeles TV show, miming to \\"Break On Through\\". In early 1967, the Doors appeared on The Clay Cole Show (which aired on Saturday evenings at 6 pm on WPIX Channel 11 out of NYC) where they performed their single \\"Break On Through\\". Since \\"Break on Through\\" was not very successful on the radio, the band turned to \\"Light My Fire\\". \\"Light My Fire\\" became the first single from Elektra Records to reach number one on the 'Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, selling over one million copies. From March 7 to 11, 1967, the Doors performed at the Matrix Club in San Francisco, California. The March 7 and 10 shows were recorded by a co- owner of The Matrix, Peter Abram. These recordings are notable as they are among the earliest live recordings of the band to circulate. On November 18, 2008, the Doors published a compilation of these recordings, Live at the Matrix 1967, on the band's boutique Bright Midnight Archives label. The Doors appeared on American television on August 25, 1967, guest-starring on the variety TV series Malibu U, performing \\"Light My Fire\\". They did not appear live. The band is seen on a beach and is performing the song in playback. The music video did not gain any commercial success and the performance was more or less forgotten. It was not until they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show that they gained attention on television. Danish television in 1968 The Doors made their international television debut in May 1967, recording a version of \\"The End\\" for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) at O'Keefe Centre in Toronto. But after its initial broadcasts, the performance remained unreleased except in bootleg form until the release of The Doors Soundstage Performances DVD in 2002. On September 17, 1967, the Doors gave a memorable performance of \\"Light My Fire\\" on The Ed Sullivan Show. According to Ray Manzarek, network executives asked that the word \\"higher\\" be removed. The group appeared to acquiesce, but performed the song in its original form, because either they had never intended to comply with the request or Jim Morrison was nervous and forgot to make the change (Manzarek has given conflicting accounts). Either way, \\"higher\\" was sung out on national television, and the show's host, Ed Sullivan, canceled another six shows that had been planned. After the program's producer told the band they would never play on the show again, Jim Morrison reportedly replied: \\"Hey man. We just did the Sullivan Show.\\" On December 24, the Doors performed \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Moonlight Drive\\" live for The Jonathan Winters Show. Their performance was taped for later broadcast. From December 26 to 28, the group played at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco; during one set the band stopped performing to watch themselves on The Jonathan Winters Show on a TV set wheeled onto the stage. The Doors spent several weeks in Sunset Studios in Los Angeles recording their second album, Strange Days, experimenting with the new technology, notably the Moog synthesizer they now had available. The commercial success of Strange Days was middling, peaking at number three on the Billboard album chart but quickly dropping, along with a series of underperforming singles. The chorus from the album's single \\"People Are Strange\\" inspired the name of the 2009 documentary of the Doors, When You're Strange. Although session musician Larry Knechtel had been featured on bass on several tracks on the band's debut album, Strange Days was the first Doors album recorded with a studio musician on bass on most of the tracks, and this continued on all subsequent studio albums. Manzarek explained that his keyboard bass was well-suited for live situations but that it lacked the \\"articulation\\" needed for studio recording. Douglass Lubahn played on Strange Days and the next two albums; but the band used several other musicians for this role, often using more than one bassist on the same album. Kerry Magness, Leroy Vinnegar, Harvey Brooks, Ray Neopolitan, Lonnie Mack, Jerry Scheff, Jack Conrad (who played a major role in the post Morrison years touring with the group in 1971 and 1972), Chris Ethridge, Charles Larkey and Leland Sklar are credited as bassists who worked with the band. =New Haven incident (December 1967)= New Haven On December 9, 1967, the Doors performed a now infamous concert at New Haven Arena in New Haven, Connecticut, which ended abruptly when Morrison was arrested by local police. Morrison became the first rock artist to be arrested onstage during a concert performance. Morrison had been kissing a female fan backstage in a bathroom shower stall prior to the start of the concert when a police officer happened upon them. Unaware that he was the lead singer of the band about to perform, the officer told Morrison and the female to leave, to which Morrison said, \\"Eat it.\\" The policeman took out a can of mace and warned Morrison, \\"Last chance\\", to which Morrison replied, \\"Last chance to eat it.\\" There is some discrepancy as to what happened next: according to No One Here Gets Out Alive, the female ran away and Morrison was maced; but Manzarek recounts in his book that both Jim and the fan were sprayed. The Doors' main act was delayed for an hour while Jim recovered, after which The Doors took the stage very late. According to an authenticated fan account that Robby Krieger posted to his Facebook page, the police still did not consider the issue resolved, and wanted to charge him. Halfway through the first set, Morrison proceeded to create an improvised song (as depicted in the Oliver Stone movie) about his experience with the \\"little men in blue\\". It was an obscenity-laced account to the audience, describing what had happened backstage and taunting the police, who were surrounding the stage. The concert was abruptly ended when Morrison was dragged offstage by the police. The audience, which was already restless from waiting so long for the band to perform, became unruly. Morrison was taken to a local police station, photographed and booked on charges of inciting a riot, indecency and public obscenity. Charges against Morrison, as well as those against three journalists also arrested in the incident (Mike Zwerin, Yvonne Chabrier and Tim Page), were dropped several weeks later for lack of evidence. =Waiting for the Sun (April‚ÄìDecember 1968)= Cobo Arena, Detroit Recording of the group's third album in April 1968 was marred by tension as a result of Morrison's increasing dependence on alcohol and the rejection of the 17-minute \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" by band producer Paul Rothchild, who considered the work was not commercial enough. Approaching the height of their popularity, the Doors played a series of outdoor shows that led to frenzied scenes between fans and police, particularly at Chicago Coliseum on May 10. The band began to branch out from their initial form for this third LP, and because they had exhausted their original repertoire, they began writing new material. Waiting for the Sun became their first and only US No. 1 LP, and the single \\"Hello, I Love You\\" (one of the six songs performed by the band on their 1965 Aura Records demo) was their second US No. 1 single. Following the 1968 release of \\"Hello, I Love You\\", the publisher of the Kinks' 1964 hit \\"All Day and All of the Night\\" announced they were planning legal action against the Doors for copyright infringement; however, songwriter Ray Davies ultimately chose not to sue.Hinmen, Doug. The Kinks: All Day and All of the Night (2004): 119‚Äì120 Kinks guitarist Dave Davies was particularly irritated by the similarity. In concert, Morrison was occasionally dismissive of the song, leaving the vocals to Manzarek, as can be seen in the documentary The Doors Are Open. A month after a riotous concert at the Singer Bowl in New York, the group flew to Britain for their first performance outside North America. They held a press conference at the ICA Gallery in London and played shows at the Roundhouse. The results of the trip were broadcast on Granada TV's The Doors Are Open, later released on video. They played dates in Europe, along with Jefferson Airplane, including a show in Amsterdam where Morrison collapsed on stage after a drug binge (including marijuana, hashish and unspecified pills). The group flew back to the US and played nine more US dates before returning to work in November on their fourth LP. They ended the year with a successful new single, \\"Touch Me\\" (released in December 1968), which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 in the Cashbox Top 100 in early 1969 (the band's third and last American number-one single). =Miami incident (March 1969)= profanity and indecent exposure On March 1, 1969, at the Dinner Key Auditorium in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, the Doors gave the most controversial performance of their career, one that nearly \\"derailed the band\\". The auditorium was a converted seaplane hangar that had no air conditioning on that hot night, and the seats had been removed by the promoter to boost ticket sales. Morrison had been drinking all day and had missed connecting flights to Miami. By the time he arrived, drunk, the concert was over an hour late. The restless crowd of 12,000, packed into a facility designed to hold 7,000, was subjected to undue silences in Morrison's singing straining the music from the beginning of the performance. Morrison had recently attended a play by an experimental theater group the Living Theatre and was inspired by their \\"antagonistic\\" style of performance art. Morrison taunted the crowd with messages of both love and hate, saying, \\"Love me. I can't take it no more without no good love. I want some lovin'. Ain't nobody gonna love my ass?\\" and alternately, \\"You're all a bunch of fuckin' idiots!\\" and screaming \\"What are you gonna do about it?\\" over and over again. As the band began their second song, \\"Touch Me\\", Morrison started shouting in protest, forcing the band to a halt. At one point, Morrison removed the hat of an onstage police officer and threw it into the crowd; the officer removed Morrison's hat and threw it. Manager Bill Siddons recalled, \\"The gig was a bizarre, circus-like thing, there was this guy carrying a sheep and the wildest people that I'd ever seen.\\" Equipment chief Vince Treanor said, \\"Somebody jumped up and poured champagne on Jim so he took his shirt off, he was soaking wet. 'Let's see a little skin, let's get naked,' he said, and the audience started taking their clothes off.\\" Having removed his shirt, Morrison held it in front of his groin area and started to make hand movements behind it. Manzarek described the incident as a mass \\"religious hallucination\\". On March 5, the Dade County Sheriff's office issued a warrant for Morrison's arrest, claiming Morrison had exposed his penis while on stage, shouted obscenities to the crowd, simulated oral sex on guitarist Robby Krieger, and was drunk at the time of his performance. Morrison turned down a plea bargain that required the Doors to perform a free Miami concert. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail with hard labor, and ordered to pay a $500 fine. Morrison remained free, pending an appeal of his conviction, and died before the matter was legally resolved. In 2007 Florida Governor Charlie Crist suggested the possibility of a posthumous pardon for Morrison, which was announced as successful on December 9, 2010. Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek have denied the allegation that Morrison exposed himself on stage that night. =The Soft Parade (May‚ÄìJuly 1969)= The Doors' fourth album, The Soft Parade, released in July 1969, contained brass and string arrangements. The lead single, \\"Touch Me\\", featured saxophonist Curtis Amy. While the band was trying to maintain their previous momentum, efforts to expand their sound gave the album an experimental feel, causing critics to attack their musical integrity. According to John Densmore in his biography Riders On The Storm individual writing credits were noted for the first time because of Morrison's reluctance to sing the lyrics of Robby Krieger's song \\"Tell All the People\\". Morrison's drinking made him difficult and unreliable, and the recording sessions dragged on for months. Studio costs piled up, and the Doors came close to disintegrating. Despite all this, the album was immensely successful, becoming the band's fourth hit album. =Morrison Hotel and Absolutely Live (November 1969 ‚Äì December 1970)= Photo by Henry Diltz used on the cover of Morrison Hotel During the recording of their next album, Morrison Hotel, in November 1969, Morrison again found himself in trouble with the law after harassing airline staff during a flight to Phoenix, Arizona to see the Rolling Stones in concert. Both Morrison and his friend and traveling companion Tom Baker were charged with \\"interfering with the flight of an intercontinental aircraft and public drunkenness\\". If convicted of the most serious charge, Morrison could have faced a ten-year federal prison sentence for the incident. The charges were dropped in April 1970 after an airline stewardess reversed her testimony to say she mistakenly identified Morrison as Baker. The Doors staged a return to form with their 1970 LP Morrison Hotel, their fifth album. Featuring a consistent hard rock sound, the album's opener was \\"Roadhouse Blues\\". The record reached No. 4 in the United States and revived their status among their core fanbase and the rock press. Dave Marsh, the editor of Creem magazine, said of the album: \\"the most horrifying rock and roll I have ever heard. When they're good, they're simply unbeatable. I know this is the best record I've listened to ... so far\\". Rock Magazine called it \\"without any doubt their ballsiest (and best) album to date\\". Circus magazine praised it as \\"possibly the best album yet from the Doors\\" and \\"good hard, evil rock, and one of the best albums released this decade\\". The album also saw Jim Morrison returning as main songwriter, writing or co-writing all of the album's tracks. The 40th anniversary CD reissue of Morrison Hotel contains outtakes and alternative takes, including different versions of \\"The Spy\\" and \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" (with Lonnie Mack on bass guitar and the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian on harmonica). In July 1970, the Doors released their first live album, Absolutely Live, which peaked at No. 8. The album includes the first release of \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\". Although the Doors continued to face de facto bans in more conservative American markets and earned new bans at Salt Lake City's Salt Palace and Detroit's Cobo Hall following tumultuous concerts, the band managed to play 18 concerts in the United States, Mexico and Canada following the Miami incident in 1969, and 23 dates in the United States and Canada throughout the first half of 1970. During Morrison's trial in Miami, the group made it to the Isle of Wight Festival on August 29. They performed alongside Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Joni Mitchell, Jethro Tull, Taste, Leonard Cohen, Miles Davis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Sly and the Family Stone. Two songs from the show were featured in the 1995 documentary Message to Love. On December 8, 1970, his 27th birthday, Morrison recorded another poetry session. Part of this would end up on An American Prayer in 1978 with music, and is currently in the possession of the Courson family. Shortly thereafter, the Roadhouse Blues Tour to promote their upcoming album would comprise only three dates. Two concerts were held in Dallas on December 11. During the Doors' last public performance with Morrison, at The Warehouse in New Orleans, on December 12, 1970, Morrison apparently had a breakdown on stage. Midway through the set he slammed the microphone numerous times into the stage floor until the platform beneath was destroyed, then sat down and refused to perform for the remainder of the show. Drummer John Densmore recalls the incident in his biography Riders On the Storm, where, after the show he met with Ray and Robby; they decided to end their live act, citing their mutual agreement that Morrison was ready to retire from performing. =L.A. Woman and Morrison's death (December 1970 ‚Äì July 1971)= Jim Morrison's grave at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris Despite Morrison's conviction and the fallout from their appearance in New Orleans, The Doors set out to reclaim their status as a premier act with L.A. Woman in 1971. The album included rhythm guitarist Marc Benno on several tracks and prominently featured bassist Jerry Scheff, best known for his work in Elvis Presley's TCB Band. Despite a comparatively low Billboard chart peak at No. 9, L.A. Woman contained two Top 20 hits and went on to be their second best-selling studio album, surpassed in sales only by their debut. The album explored their R&B; roots, although during rehearsals they had a falling-out with Paul Rothchild, who was dissatisfied with the band's effort. Denouncing \\"Love Her Madly\\" as \\"cocktail lounge music\\", he quit and handed the production to Bruce Botnick and the Doors. The title track and two singles (\\"Love Her Madly\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm\\") remain mainstays of rock radio programming, with the last of these being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its special significance to recorded music. In the song \\"L.A. Woman\\", Jim Morrison makes an anagram of his name to chant \\"Mr. Mojo Risin\\". During the sessions, a short clip of the band performing \\"Crawling King Snake\\" was filmed. As far as is known, this is the last clip of the Doors performing with Morrison. On March 13, 1971, following the recording of L.A. Woman, Morrison took a leave of absence from the Doors and moved to Paris with Pamela Courson. He had visited the city the previous summer; he was found dead in the bath on July 3, 1971 by Courson. The absence of an official autopsy, combined with the death certificate having no reason of death besides heart failure, have left many questions regarding the cause of death. Morrison was buried in the \\"Poets' Corner\\" of P√®re Lachaise Cemetery on July 7. The epitaph on his headstone bears the Greek inscription \\"ŒöŒëŒ§Œë Œ§ŒüŒù ŒîŒëŒôŒúŒüŒùŒë ŒïŒëŒ•Œ§ŒüŒ•\\", literally meaning \\"According to his own daim≈çn\\" and usually interpreted as \\"True to his own spirit\\". Morrison died at age 27, the same age as several other famous rock stars in the 27 Club. In 1974, Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson also died at the age of 27. After Morrison =Other Voices and Full Circle (July 1971 ‚Äì January 1973)= Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek in 1971 L.A. Womans follow up album, Other Voices was being planned when Morrison died. The band was hopeful he would return from his Paris trip to complete the album. The surviving members initially considered replacing Morrison with a new singer but instead, Krieger and Manzarek took over lead vocal duties. Other Voices was recorded from June to August 1971, and was released in October 1971. It featured the single \\"Tightrope Ride\\", which received some radio airplay. The trio began performing again with additional supporting members on November 12, 1971 at Pershing Municipal Auditorium in Lincoln, Nebraska, followed by shows in Carnegie Hall on November 23, 1971, and the Hollywood Palladium on November 26, 1971. The recordings for Full Circle took place a year later after Other Voices during the spring of 1972, and the album was released in August 1972. For the tours during this period, the Doors enlisted Jack Conrad on bass (who had played on several tracks on both \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle\\") as well as Bobby Ray Henson on rhythm guitar. They began a European tour covering France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, including an appearance on the German show Beat- Club. The group disbanded in 1973. =Reunions= The third post-Morrison album, An American Prayer, was released in 1978. It consisted of the band adding musical backing tracks to previously recorded spoken word performances of Morrison reciting his poetry. The record was a commercial success, acquiring a platinum certificate. An American Prayer was re-mastered and re- released with bonus tracks in 1995. The three played together on Krieger's 1982 album Versions. In 1993, the Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the ceremony Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore reunited once again to perform \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"Light My Fire\\". Eddie Vedder filled in on lead vocals, while Don Was played bass. For the 1997 boxed set, the surviving members of the Doors once again reunited to complete \\"Orange County Suite\\". The track was one that Morrison had written and recorded, providing vocals and piano. The Doors reunited in 2000 to perform on VH1's Storytellers. For the live performance, the band was joined by Angelo Barbera and numerous guest vocalists, including Ian Astbury (of the Cult), Scott Weiland, Scott Stapp, Perry Farrell, Pat Monahan and Travis Meeks. Following the recording the Storytellers: A Celebration, the band members joined to record music for the Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors tribute album. On May 29, 2007, Perry Farrell's group the Satellite Party released its first album Ultra Payloaded on Columbia Records. The album features \\"Woman in the Window\\", a new song with music and a pre-recorded vocal performance provided by Jim Morrison. \\"I like to say this is the first new Doors track of the 21st century\\", Ray Manzarek said of a new song he recorded with Robby Krieger, John Densmore and DJ/producer Skrillex (Sonny Moore). The recording session and song are part of a documentary film, Re:GENERATION, that recruited five popular DJs/producers to work with artists from five separate genres and had them record new music. Manzarek and Skrillex had an immediate musical connection. \\"Sonny plays his beat, all he had to do was play the one thing. I listened to it and I said, ‚ÄòHoly shit, that's strong,‚Äô\\" Manzarek says. \\"Basically, it's a variation on ‚ÄòMilestones‚Äô, by Miles Davis, and if I do say so myself, sounds fucking great, hot as hell.\\" The track, called \\"Breakn' a Sweat\\", was included on Skrillex's EP Bangarang. In 2013, the remaining members of the Doors recorded with rapper Tech N9ne for the song \\"Strange 2013\\", appearing on his album Something Else, which features new instrumentation by the band and samples of Jim Morrison's vocals from the song \\"Strange Days\\". In their final collaboration before Manzarek's death, the three surviving Doors provided backing for poet Michael C. Ford's album Look Each Other in The Ears. February 12, 2016, at The Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, John Densmore and Robby Krieger reunited for the first time in 15 years to perform in tribute to Ray and benefit Stand Up to Cancer. That day would have been Ray's 76th birthday. The night featured Exene Cervenka and John Doe of the band X, Rami Jaffee of the Foo Fighters, Stone Temple Pilots‚Äô Robert Deleo, Jane's Addiction's Stephen Perkins, Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara, Andrew Watt, among others. After the Doors After Morrison died in 1971, Krieger and Densmore formed the Butts Band as a consequence of trying to find a new lead singer to replace Morrison. The surviving Doors members went to London looking for a new lead singer because they were unable to recruit in the US. The Butts Band formed in 1973, signing with Blue Thumb records. They began working on their first album titled Butts Band that was released the same year. They disbanded in 1975 after the second album. Phil Chen, who played bass on the band's second album, would later join Robby once again with Manzarek‚ÄìKrieger. Manzarek made three solo albums from 1974 to 1983 and formed a band called Nite City in 1975, which released two albums from 1977 to 1978. Krieger released six solo albums from 1977 to 2010. All of the ex-Doors solo albums have met with mixed reviews. In recent years Densmore formed a jazz band called Tribaljazz and they released a self-titled album in 2006. In 2002, Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger formed a new version of the Doors which they called the Doors of the 21st Century. After legal battles over use of the Doors name with drummer John Densmore in February 2003 who filed an injunction against his former bandmates, they changed their name several times and ultimately toured under the name \\"Manzarek‚ÄìKrieger\\" or \\"Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of the Doors\\". In July 2007, John Densmore said he refused to play with the band unless it was fronted by Eddie Vedder because Densmore claimed Vedder was on Morrison's singing level. The group was dedicated to performing the music of the Doors and Jim Morrison. The band performed in Mexico, Bolivia, France, Israel, Russia, Italy, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Austria in 2011 On May 20, 2013, Ray Manzarek died at a hospital in Rosenheim, Germany, at the age of 74 due to complications related to bile duct cancer. Robby Krieger and John Densmore, the two remaining living Doors members, came together February 12, 2016 to honor Ray Manzarek called \\"A Celebration For Ray Manzarek.\\" All proceeds went to \\"Stand Up to Cancer.\\" Legacy Beginning in the late 1970s, there was a sustained revival of interest in the Doors which created a new generation of fans. The origin of the revival is traced to the release of the album An American Prayer in late 1978 which contained a live version of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" that received considerable airplay on album- oriented rock radio stations. In 1979 the song \\"The End\\" was featured in dramatic fashion in the film Apocalypse Now and the following year a best- selling biography of Morrison, No One Here Gets Out Alive, was published. The Doors' first album, The Doors, re-entered the Billboard 200 album chart in September 1980 and Elektra Records reported the Doors' albums were selling better than in any year since their original release. In response a new compilation album, Greatest Hits, was released in October 1980. The album peaked at No. 17 in Billboard and remained on the chart for nearly two years. The revival continued in 1983 with the release of Alive, She Cried, an album of previously unreleased live recordings. The track \\"Gloria\\" reached No. 18 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart and the video was in heavy rotation on MTV. Another compilation album, The Best of the Doors was released in 1987 and went on to be certified Diamond in 2007 by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 10 million certified units. A second revival, attracting another generation of fans, occurred in 1991 following the release of the film The Doors, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer as Morrison. Stone created the script from over a hundred interviews of people who were in Jim Morrison's life. He designed the movie by picking the songs and then adding the appropriate scripts to them. The original band members did not like the film's portrayal of the events. In the book The Doors, Manzarek states, \\"That Oliver Stone thing did real damage to the guy I knew: Jim Morrison, the poet.\\" In addition, Manzarek claims that he wanted the movie to be about all four members of the band, not only Morrison. Densmore said, \\"A third of it's fiction.\\" In the same volume, Krieger agrees with the other two, but also says, \\"It could have been a lot worse.\\" The film's soundtrack album reached No. 8 on the Billboard album chart and Greatest Hits and The Best of the Doors re-entered the chart, with the latter reaching a new peak position of No. 32.

The group, whose best-known line-up comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, are regarded as the most influential band of all time. They were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements. Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \\"Love Me Do\\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \\"Beatlemania\\", the band acquired the nickname \\"the Fab Four\\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \\"fifth Beatle\\". By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \\"British Invasion\\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced records of greater complexity, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \\"the White Album\\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active. The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They are the best-selling act in the US, with certified sales of 183 million units. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboards list of the all-time most successful artists on the Billboard Hot 100. The band received seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.  History  = 1957‚Äì1963: Formation, Hamburg, and UK popularity = In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that another local group were already using the name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus,; . and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist. By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to the Beatles. Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, and for this they auditioned and hired drummer Pete Best in mid- August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, departed Liverpool for Hamburg four days later, contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for what would be a 3¬Ω-month residency. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: \\"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life ... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\\" Koschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fianc√©e Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles. During the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \\"exi\\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records. As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year. Credited to \\"Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers\\", the single \\"My Bonnie\\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the Musikmarkt chart. After the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing Merseybeat movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night. In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at The Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist. He later recalled: \\"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence ... [a] star quality.\\" Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg. Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what was later determined as a brain haemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment \\"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\\" However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label. alt=A flight of stone steps leads from an asphalt car park up to the main entrance of a white two- story building. The ground floor has two sash windows, the first floor has three shorter sash windows. Two more windows are visible at basement level. The decorative stonework around the doors and windows is painted grey. Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\". Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No. 1.\\" In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums ‚Äì including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change ‚Äì stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ....\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality.\\" = 1963‚Äì1966: Beatlemania and touring years =  Please Please Me and With the Beatles  The band's logo was designed by Ivor Arbiter On 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut LP, Please Please Me. The album was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles. Martin originally considered recording the Beatles' debut LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a \\"live\\" album with minimal production in \\"a single marathon session at Abbey Road\\". After the moderate success of \\"Love Me Do\\", the single \\"Please Please Me\\" met with a more emphatic reception. Released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album of the same name, the song reached number one on every UK chart except Record Retailer, where it peaked at number two. Recalling how the Beatles \\"rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out Please Please Me in a day\\", AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments, \\"Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins.\\" Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time; he and McCartney were \\"just writing songs √† la Everly Brothers, √† la Buddy Holly, pop songs with no more thought of them than that ‚Äì to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant.\\" Released in March 1963, the album initiated a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the United Kingdom through to 1970 reached number one. The band's third single, \\"From Me to You\\", came out in April and was also a chart-topping hit, starting an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number-one singles for the Beatles, including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years. Issued in August, the band's fourth single, \\"She Loves You\\", achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time, selling three-quarters of a million copies in under four weeks. It became their first single to sell a million copies, and remained the biggest-selling record in the UK until 1978. Their commercial success brought increased media exposure, to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time, inspiring even more interest. The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year: a four-week tour that began in February, the Beatles' first nationwide, preceded three-week tours in March and May‚ÄìJune. As their popularity spread, a frenzied adulation of the group took hold. Greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans, the press dubbed the phenomenon \\"Beatlemania\\". Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \\"by audience demand\\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US. A similar situation arose during their May‚ÄìJune tour with Roy Orbison. alt=Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Swedish pop singer McCartney, Harrison, Swedish pop singer Lill-Babs and Lennon on the set of the Swedish television show Drop-In, 30 October 1963 In late October, the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962. On their return to the UK on 31 October, several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers, as well as representatives from the BBC, also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events. The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks. In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth. Please Please Me maintained the top position on the Record Retailer chart for 30 weeks, only to be displaced by its follow-up, With the Beatles, which EMI released on 22 November to record advance orders of 270,000 copies. The LP topped a half-million albums sold in one week. Recorded between July and October, With the Beatles made better use of studio production techniques than its predecessor. It held the top spot for 21 weeks with a chart life of 40 weeks. Erlewine described the LP as \\"a sequel of the highest order ‚Äì one that betters the original\\". In a reversal of then standard practice, EMI released the album ahead of the impending single \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", with the song excluded to maximise the single's sales. The album caught the attention of music critic William Mann of The Times, who suggested that Lennon and McCartney were \\"the outstanding English composers of 1963\\". The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music, lending it respectability. With the Beatles became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies, a figure previously reached only by the 1958 South Pacific soundtrack. When writing the sleeve notes for the album, the band's press officer, Tony Barrow, used the superlative the \\"fabulous foursome\\", which the media widely adopted as \\"the Fab Four\\".  First visit to the United States and the British Invasion  EMI's American subsidiary, Capitol Records, hindered the Beatles' releases in the United States for more than a year by initially declining to issue their music, including their first three singles. Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some of the songs in 1963, but not all. Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album Introducing... The Beatles, culled from most of the songs of Parlophone's Please Please Me, but a management shake-up led to the album not being released. Then when it surfaced that the label did not report royalties on their sales, the licence Vee-Jay signed with EMI was voided. A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single \\"She Loves You\\". The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia by Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the \\"Rate-a-Record\\" segment of American Bandstand, but it failed to catch on nationally. The Beatles arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport, 7 February 1964 Epstein brought a demo copy of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" to Capitol's Brown Meggs who signed the band and arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC, in Washington, DC, obtained a copy of the British single \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" in mid-December 1963 and began playing it on-air. Taped copies of the song soon circulated among other radio stations throughout the US. This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to bring forward the release of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" by three weeks. Issued on 26 December, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" sold a million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January. In its wake, Vee-Jay released Introducing... The Beatles to go along with Capitol's debut album, Meet the Beatles!, while Swan reactivated production of \\"She Loves You\\". alt=The Beatles with The Beatles with Ed Sullivan, February 1964 On 7 February 1964, the Beatles left the UK with an estimated 4,000 fans gathered at Heathrow, waving and screaming as the aircraft took off. Upon landing at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, an uproarious crowd estimated at 3,000 greeted them. They gave their first live US television performance two days later on The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households, or 34 percent of the American population. Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was \\"the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television \\". The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a largely negative critical consensus in the US, but a day later at their first US concert, Beatlemania erupted at the Washington Coliseum. Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall. The band flew to Florida, where they appeared on the weekly Ed Sullivan Show a second time, before another 70 million viewers, before returning to the UK on 22 February. The Beatles' first visit to the US took place when the nation were still mourning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the previous November. Commentators often suggest that for many, particularly the young, the Beatles' performances reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that momentarily faded in the wake of the assassination, and helped make way for the revolutionary social changes to come in the decade. Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture. The group's popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, and many other UK acts subsequently made their American debuts, successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion. The Beatles' success in the US opened the door for a successive string of British beat groups and pop acts such as the Dave Clark Five, the Animals, Petula Clark, the Kinks, and the Rolling Stones to achieve success in America. During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five.  A Hard Day's Night  Capitol Records' lack of interest throughout 1963 did not go unnoticed, and a competitor, United Artists Records, encouraged their film division to offer the Beatles a three-motion-picture deal, primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks in the US. Directed by Richard Lester, A Hard Day's Night involved the band for six weeks in March‚ÄìApril 1964 as they played themselves in a musical comedy. The film premiered in London and New York in July and August, respectively, and was an international success, with some critics drawing a comparison with the Marx Brothers. United Artists released a full soundtrack album for the North American market, combining Beatles songs and Martin's orchestral score; elsewhere, the group's third studio LP, A Hard Day's Night, contained songs from the film on side one and other new recordings on side two. According to Erlewine, the album saw them \\"truly coming into their own as a band. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound, filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies.\\" That \\"ringing guitar\\" sound was primarily the product of Harrison's 12-string electric Rickenbacker, a prototype given to him by the manufacturer, which made its debut on the record. 1964 world tour, meeting Bob Dylan, and stand on civil rights McCartney, Harrison and Lennon performing on Dutch TV in 1964 Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York. In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' ‚Äì kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture. During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with racial segregation in the country at the time. When informed that the venue for their 11 September concert, the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida, was segregated, the Beatles said they would refuse to perform unless the audience was integrated. Lennon stated: \\"We never play to segregated audiences and we aren't going to start now ... I'd sooner lose our appearance money.\\" City officials relented and agreed to allow an integrated show. The group also cancelled their reservations at the whites-only Hotel George Washington in Jacksonville. For their subsequent US tours in 1965 and 1966, the Beatles included clauses in contracts stipulating that shows be integrated.  Beatles for Sale, Help! and Rubber Soul  According to Gould, the Beatles' fourth studio LP, Beatles for Sale, evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions. They had intended the album, recorded between August and October 1964, to continue the format established by A Hard Day's Night which, unlike their first two LPs, contained only original songs. They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album, however, and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts, Lennon admitted, \\"Material's becoming a hell of a problem\\". As a result, six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album. Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney songwriting partnership. In early 1965, following a dinner with Lennon, Harrison and their wives, Harrison's dentist, John Riley, secretly added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: \\"It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned for a month or two.\\" He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \\"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time ‚Äì these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\\" McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that \\"it opened my eyes\\" and \\"made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society\\". Help! with (from the rear) Harrison, McCartney, Lennon and (largely obscured) Starr Controversy erupted in June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II appointed all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated them for the award. In protest ‚Äì the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders ‚Äì some conservative MBE recipients returned their insignia. In July, the Beatles' second film, Help!, was released, again directed by Lester. Described as \\"mainly a relentless spoof of Bond\\", it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band. McCartney said: \\"Help! was great but it wasn't our film ‚Äì we were sort of guest stars. It was fun, but basically, as an idea for a film, it was a bit wrong.\\" The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: \\"Help!\\" and \\"Ticket to Ride\\". The Help! album, the group's fifth studio LP, mirrored A Hard Day's Night by featuring soundtrack songs on side one and additional songs from the same sessions on side two. The LP contained all original material save for two covers, \\"Act Naturally\\" and \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\"; they were the last covers the band would include on an album, except for Let It Be brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song \\"Maggie Mae\\". The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on Help! and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements, including a string quartet on the pop ballad \\"Yesterday\\". Composed by and sung by McCartney ‚Äì none of the other Beatles perform on the recording ‚Äì \\"Yesterday\\" has inspired the most cover versions of any song ever written. With Help!, the Beatles became the first rock group to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The band at a press conference in Minnesota in August 1965, shortly after playing at Shea Stadium in New York The group's third US tour opened with a performance before a world-record crowd of 55,600 at New York's Shea Stadium on 15 August ‚Äì \\"perhaps the most famous of all Beatles' concerts\\", in Lewisohn's description. A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities. At a show in Atlanta, the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers. Towards the end of the tour, they met with Elvis Presley, a foundational musical influence on the band, who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills. September 1965 saw the launch of an American Saturday-morning cartoon series, The Beatles, that echoed A Hard Day's Night slapstick antics over its two-year original run. The series was a historical milestone as the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real, living people. In mid-October, the Beatles entered the recording studio; for the first time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, \\"we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own.\\" Released in December, Rubber Soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy, a development that NEMS executive Peter Brown attributed to the band members' \\"now habitual use of marijuana\\". Lennon referred to Rubber Soul as \\"the pot album\\" and Starr said: \\"Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently.\\" After Help!s foray into classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning. While some of Rubber Souls songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, the album also included distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit. \\"In My Life\\", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney catalogue. Harrison called Rubber Soul his \\"favourite album\\" and Starr referred to it as \\"the departure record\\". McCartney has said, \\"We'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.\\" However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group ‚Äì \\"the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious\\", he wrote, and \\"as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right\\". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Rubber Soul fifth among \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\", and AllMusic's Richie Unterberger describes it as \\"one of the classic folk-rock records\\". Controversies, Revolver and final tour Capitol Records, from December 1963 when it began issuing Beatles recordings for the US market, exercised complete control over format, compiling distinct US albums from the band's recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles. In June 1966, the Capitol LP Yesterday and Today caused an uproar with its cover, which portrayed the grinning Beatles dressed in butcher's overalls, accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls. According to Beatles biographer Bill Harry, it has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way Capitol had \\"butchered\\" the US versions of the band's albums. Thousands of copies of the LP had a new cover pasted over the original; an unpeeled \\"first-state\\" copy fetched $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. In England, meanwhile, Harrison met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, who agreed to train him on the instrument. During a tour of the Philippines the month after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time. Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \\"Christianity will go\\", Lennon had said. \\"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\\" His comments went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed them five months later, it sparked a controversy with Christians in America's conservative Bible Belt region. The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context. At a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" He claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\" Released in August, a week before the Beatles' final tour, Revolver marked another artistic step forward for the group. The album featured sophisticated songwriting, studio experimentation, and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles, ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelia. Abandoning the customary group photograph, its Aubrey Beardsley-inspired cover ‚Äì designed by Klaus Voormann, a friend of the band since their Hamburg days ‚Äì was a monochrome collage and line drawing caricature of the group. The album was preceded by the single \\"Paperback Writer\\", backed by \\"Rain\\". Short promotional films were made for both songs; described by cultural historian Saul Austerlitz as \\"among the first true music videos\\", they aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June. Among the experimental songs that Revolver featured was \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data. McCartney's \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as \\"a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song\\". Harrison's emergence as a songwriter was reflected in three of his compositions appearing on the record. Among these, \\"Taxman\\", which opened the album, marked the first example of the Beatles making a political statement through their music. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time. San Francisco's Candlestick Park (pictured in the early 1960s) was the venue for the Beatles' final concert before a paying audience. As preparations were made for a tour of the US, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last. The band performed none of their new songs on the tour. In Chris Ingham's description, they were very much \\"studio creations ... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts.\\" The band's concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of four years dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally. =1966‚Äì1970: Studio years= Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Front cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, \\"the most famous cover of any music album, and one of the most imitated images in the world\\" Freed from the burden of touring, the Beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, beginning in late November 1966. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, the album's recording took over 700 hours. He recalled the band's insistence \\"that everything on Sgt. Pepper had to be different. We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins. We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around.\\" Parts of \\"A Day in the Life\\" featured a 40-piece orchestra. The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side single \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\"/\\"Penny Lane\\" in February 1967; the Sgt. Pepper LP followed with a rush-release in May. The musical complexity of the records, created using relatively primitive four-track recording technology, astounded contemporary artists. Among music critics, acclaim for the album was virtually universal. Gould writes: In the wake of Sgt. Pepper, the underground and mainstream press widely publicised the Beatles as leaders of youth culture, as well as \\"lifestyle revolutionaries\\". The album was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were \\"listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy\\". The elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their \\"brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms\\" as a knowingly \\"anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment\\" display. Sgt. Pepper topped the UK charts for 23 consecutive weeks, with a further four weeks at number one in the period through to February 1968. With 2.5 million copies sold within three months of its release, Sgt. Peppers initial commercial success exceeded that of all previous Beatles albums. It sustained its immense popularity into the 21st century while breaking numerous sales records. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Sgt. Pepper at number one on its list of the greatest albums of all time. Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine The Beatles filming their \\"I Am the Walrus\\" sequence for the Magical Mystery Tour film Two Beatles film projects were conceived within weeks of completing Sgt. Pepper: Magical Mystery Tour, a one-hour television film, and Yellow Submarine, an animated feature-length film produced by United Artists. The group began recording music for the former in late April 1967, but the project then lay dormant as they focused on recording songs for the latter. On 25 June, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single \\"All You Need Is Love\\" to an estimated 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. The Beatles' use of psychedelic drugs was at its height during that summer. In July and August, the group pursued interests related to similar utopian-based ideology, including a week-long investigation into the possibility of starting an island-based commune off the coast of Greece. On 24 August, the group were introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London. The next day, they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. On 27 August, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: \\"We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've fuckin' had it now.'\\" Harrison's then-wife Pattie Boyd remembered that \\"Paul and George were in complete shock. I don't think it could have been worse if they had heard that their own fathers had dropped dead.\\" During a band meeting in September, McCartney recommended that the band proceed with Magical Mystery Tour. The Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play (EP) in early December 1967. It was the first example of a double EP in the UK. The record carried on the psychedelic vein of Sgt. Pepper, however, in line with the band's wishes, the packaging reinforced the idea that the release was a film soundtrack rather than a follow-up to Sgt. Pepper. In the US, the soundtrack appeared as an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles. In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP, and it is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums. Magical Mystery Tour first aired on Boxing Day to an audience of approximately 15 million. Largely directed by McCartney, the film was the band's first critical failure in the UK. It was dismissed as \\"blatant rubbish\\" by the Daily Express; the Daily Mail called it \\"a colossal conceit\\"; and The Guardian labelled the film \\"a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience\\". Gould describes it as \\"a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus\\". Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film. The group were less involved with Yellow Submarine, which only featured the band appearing as themselves for a short live-action segment. Premiering in July 1968, the film featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs, including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film. Critics praised the film for its music, humour and innovative visual style. A soundtrack LP was issued seven months later; it contained those four new songs, the title track (already issued on Revolver), \\"All You Need Is Love\\" (already issued as a single and on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin. India retreat, Apple Corps and the White Album In February 1968, the Beatles travelled to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, India, to take part in a three- month meditation \\"Guide Course\\". Their time in India marked one of the band's most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs, including a majority of those on their next album. However, Starr left after only ten days, unable to stomach the food, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to question when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \\"Maharishi\\", renamed \\"Sexy Sadie\\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \\"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\\" In May, Lennon and McCartney travelled to New York for the public unveiling of the Beatles' new business venture, Apple Corps. It was initially formed several months earlier as part of a plan to create a tax-effective business structure, but the band then desired to extend the corporation to other pursuits, including record distribution, peace activism, and education. McCartney described Apple as \\"rather like a Western communism\\". The enterprise drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects handled largely by members of the Beatles' entourage, who were given their jobs regardless of talent and experience. Among its numerous subsidiaries were Apple Electronics, established to foster technological innovations with Magic Alex at the head, and Apple Retailing, which opened the short-lived Apple Boutique in London. Harrison later said, \\"Basically, it was chaos ... John and Paul got carried away with the idea and blew millions, and Ringo and I just had to go along with it.\\" Richard Hamilton \\"in direct contrast to Sgt. Pepper\\", while also suggesting a \\"clean slate\\" From late May to mid-October 1968, the group recorded what became The Beatles, a double LP commonly known as \\"the White Album\\" for its virtually featureless cover. During this time, relations between the members grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, leaving his bandmates to record \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" and \\"Dear Prudence\\" as a trio. Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" he scorned as \\"granny music shit\\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio. McCartney has recalled that the album \\"wasn't a pleasant one to make\\". He and Lennon identified the sessions as the start of the band's break- up. With the record, the band executed a wider range of musical styles and broke with their recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre. During the sessions, the group upgraded to an eight-track tape console, which made it easier for them to layer tracks piecemeal, while the members often recorded independently of each other, affording the album a reputation as a collection of solo recordings rather than a unified group effort. Describing the double album, Lennon later said: \\"Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it. [It's] John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band.\\" The sessions also produced the Beatles' longest song yet, \\"Hey Jude\\", released in August as a non-album single with \\"Revolution\\". Issued in November, the White Album was the band's first Apple Records album release, although EMI continued to own their recordings. The record attracted more than 2 million advance orders, selling nearly 4 million copies in the US in little over a month, and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations. Its lyric content was the focus of much analysis by the counterculture. Despite its popularity, reviewers were largely confused by the album's content, and it failed to inspire the level of critical writing that Sgt. Pepper had. General critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the White Album, and in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time.  Abbey Road, Let It Be and separation  Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before Abbey Road. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \\"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time ‚Äì on record and on film\\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin said that the project was \\"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \\"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\\", and Harrison, \\"the low of all-time\\". Irritated by McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \\"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. His bandmates agreed, and it was decided to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film. American soul musician Billy Preston (pictured in 1971) was, for a short time, considered a fifth Beatle during the recording of Get Back. To alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \\"Get Back\\" single ‚Äì the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release. After the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum. Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row, London, on 30 January 1969. Five weeks later, engineer Glyn Johns, whom Lewisohn describes as Get Backs \\"uncredited producer\\", began work assembling an album, given \\"free rein\\" as the band \\"all but washed their hands of the entire project\\". Let It Be rooftop concert New strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs. Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke; McCartney wanted Lee and John Eastman ‚Äì father and brother, respectively, of Linda Eastman, whom McCartney married on 12 March. Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers. Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost. On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band, the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' lawyers. McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles. Martin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album, as the Get Back sessions had been \\"a miserable experience\\" and he had \\"thought it was the end of the road for all of us\\". The primary recording sessions for Abbey Road began on 2 July. Lennon, who rejected Martin's proposed format of a \\"continuously moving piece of music\\", wanted his and McCartney's songs to occupy separate sides of the album. The eventual format, with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley, was McCartney's suggested compromise. Emerick noted that the replacement of the studio's valve mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound, leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its \\"kinder, gentler\\" feel relative to their previous albums. On 4 July, the first solo single by a Beatle was released: Lennon's \\"Give Peace a Chance\\", credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The completion and mixing of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" on 20 August was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio. On 8 September, while Starr was in hospital, the other band members met to discuss recording a new album. They considered a different approach to songwriting by ending the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney pretense and having four compositions apiece from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, with two from Starr and a lead single around Christmas. On 20 September, Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album. Released on 26 September, Abbey Road sold four million copies within three months and topped the UK charts for a total of seventeen weeks. Its second track, the ballad \\"Something\\", was issued as a single ‚Äì the only Harrison composition that appeared as a Beatles A-side. Abbey Road received mixed reviews, although the medley met with general acclaim. Unterberger considers it \\"a fitting swan song for the group\\", containing \\"some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record\\". Musicologist and author Ian MacDonald calls the album \\"erratic and often hollow\\", despite the \\"semblance of unity and coherence\\" offered by the medley. Martin singled it out as his favourite Beatles album; Lennon said it was \\"competent\\" but had \\"no life in it\\". For the still unfinished Get Back album, one last song, Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\", was recorded on 3 January 1970. Lennon, in Denmark at the time, did not participate. In March, rejecting the work Johns had done on the project, now retitled Let It Be, Klein gave the session tapes to American producer Phil Spector, who had recently produced Lennon's solo single \\"Instant Karma!\\" In addition to remixing the material, Spector edited, spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as \\"live\\". McCartney was unhappy with the producer's approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", which involved a fourteen-voice choir and 36-piece instrumental ensemble. McCartney's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored, and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April, a week before the release of his first, self-titled solo album. On 8 May 1970, Let It Be was released. Its accompanying single, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", was the Beatles' last; it was released in the US, but not in the UK. The Let It Be documentary film followed later that month, and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. Sunday Telegraph critic Penelope Gilliatt called it \\"a very bad film and a touching one ... about the breaking apart of this reassuring, geometrically perfect, once apparently ageless family of siblings\\". Several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks. Describing Let It Be as the \\"only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews\\", Unterberger calls it \\"on the whole underrated\\"; he singles out \\"some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I've Got a Feeling' and 'Dig a Pony'\\", and praises \\"Let It Be\\", \\"Get Back\\", and \\"the folky 'Two of Us', with John and Paul harmonising together\\". McCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles' contractual partnership on 31 December 1970. Legal disputes continued long after their break-up, and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 December 1974, when Lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. = 1970‚Äìpresent: After the break-up =  1970s  Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970. Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the others; Starr's Ringo (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs. With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971. Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as A Toot and a Snore in '74, Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again. Two double-LP sets of the Beatles' greatest hits, compiled by Klein, 1962‚Äì1966 and 1967‚Äì1970, were released in 1973, at first under the Apple Records imprint. Commonly known as the \\"Red Album\\" and \\"Blue Album\\", respectively, each has earned a Multi- Platinum certification in the US and a Platinum certification in the UK. Between 1976 and 1982, EMI/Capitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the ex-Beatles, starting with the double-disc compilation Rock 'n' Roll Music. The only one to feature previously unreleased material was The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl (1977); the first officially issued concert recordings by the group, it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours. The music and enduring fame of the Beatles were commercially exploited in various other ways, again often outside their creative control. In April 1974, the musical John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert, written by Willy Russell and featuring singer Barbara Dickson, opened in London. It included, with permission from Northern Songs, eleven Lennon-McCartney compositions and one by Harrison, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\". Displeased with the production's use of his song, Harrison withdrew his permission to use it. Later that year, the off-Broadway musical Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road opened. All This and World War II (1976) was an unorthodox nonfiction film that combined newsreel footage with covers of Beatles songs by performers ranging from Elton John and Keith Moon to the London Symphony Orchestra. The Broadway musical Beatlemania, an unauthorised nostalgia revue, opened in early 1977 and proved popular, spinning off five separate touring productions. In 1979, the band sued the producers, settling for several million dollars in damages. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978), a musical film starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, was a commercial failure and an \\"artistic fiasco\\", according to Ingham. Accompanying the wave of Beatles nostalgia and persistent reunion rumours in the US during the 1970s, several entrepreneurs made public offers to the Beatles for a reunion concert. Promoter Bill Sargent first offered the Beatles $10 million for a reunion concert in 1974. He raised his offer to $30 million in January 1976 and then to $50 million the following month.Peter Brennan 9 May 1976 San Antonio Express. Retrieved on 6 April 2018Cliff Radel 20 June 1976 The Cincinnati Enquirer. Retrieved on 6 April 2018 On 24 April 1976, during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live, producer Lorne Michaels jokingly offered the Beatles $3,000 to reunite on the show. Lennon and McCartney were watching the live broadcast at Lennon's apartment at the Dakota in New York, which was within driving distance of the NBC studio where the show was being broadcast. The former bandmates briefly entertained the idea of going to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but decided not to.  1980s  In December 1980, Lennon was shot and killed outside his New York City apartment. Harrison rewrote the lyrics of his song \\"All Those Years Ago\\" in Lennon's honour. With Starr on drums and McCartney and his wife, Linda, contributing backing vocals, the song was released as a single in May 1981. McCartney's own tribute, \\"Here Today\\", appeared on his Tug of War album in April 1982. In 1987, Harrison's Cloud Nine album included \\"When We Was Fab\\", a song about the Beatlemania era. When the Beatles' studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987, their catalogue was standardised throughout the world, establishing a canon of the twelve original studio LPs as issued in the UK plus the US LP version of Magical Mystery Tour. All the remaining material from the singles and EPs that had not appeared on these thirteen studio albums was gathered on the two-volume compilation Past Masters (1988). Except for the Red and Blue albums, EMI deleted all its other Beatles compilations ‚Äì including the Hollywood Bowl record ‚Äì from its catalogue. In 1988, the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. Harrison and Starr attended the ceremony with Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and his two sons, Julian and Sean. McCartney declined to attend, citing unresolved \\"business differences\\" that would make him \\"feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion\\". The following year, EMI/Capitol settled a decade-long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties, clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material.  1990s  Live at the BBC, the first official release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project. Anthology was the culmination of work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title The Long and Winding Road. Documenting their history in the band's own words, the Anthology project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s. During 1995‚Äì96, the project yielded a television miniseries, an eight-volume video set, and three two-CD/three-LP box sets featuring artwork by Klaus Voormann. Two songs based on Lennon demos, \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\", were issued as new Beatles singles. The releases were commercially successful and the television series was viewed by an estimated 400 million people. In 1999, to coincide with the re-release of the 1968 film Yellow Submarine, an expanded soundtrack album, Yellow Submarine Songtrack, was issued.  2000s  The Beatles' 1, a compilation album of the band's British and American number-one hits, was released on 13 November 2000. It became the fastest-selling album of all time, with 3.6 million sold in its first week and 13 million within a month. It topped albums charts in at least 28 countries. The compilation had sold 31 million copies globally by April 2009. Harrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison's death. In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived version of the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main differences from the Spector- produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006; The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music's original American release. As a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue, Love, George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band's recordings to create what Martin called \\"a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period\\". The show premiered in June 2006, and the Love album was released that November. In April 2009, Starr performed three songs with McCartney at a benefit concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall and organised by McCartney. Starr and McCartney introduced the video game alt=A photograph of two older men, one using a microphone, in front of a large electronic display On 9 September 2009, the Beatles' entire back catalogue was reissued following an extensive digital remastering process that lasted four years. Stereo editions of all twelve original UK studio albums, along with Magical Mystery Tour and the Past Masters compilation, were released on compact disc both individually and as a box set. A second collection, The Beatles in Mono, included remastered versions of every Beatles album released in true mono along with the original 1965 stereo mixes of Help! and Rubber Soul (both of which Martin had remixed for the 1987 editions). The Beatles: Rock Band, a music video game in the Rock Band series, was issued on the same day. In December 2009, the band's catalogue was officially released in FLAC and MP3 format in a limited edition of 30,000 USB flash drives.  2010s  Owing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services. Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name \\"Apple\\" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI \\"want[s] something we're not prepared to give them\\". In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, Past Masters, and the \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes. In 2012, EMI's recorded music operations were sold to Universal Music Group. In order for Universal Music to acquire EMI, the European Union, for antitrust reasons, forced EMI to spin off assets including Parlophone. Universal was allowed to keep the Beatles' recorded music catalogue, managed by Capitol Records under its Capitol Music Group division. The entire original Beatles album catalogue was also reissued on vinyl in 2012; available either individually or as a box set. In 2013, a second volume of BBC recordings, titled On Air ‚Äì Live at the BBC Volume 2, was released. That December saw the release of another 59 Beatles recordings on iTunes. The set, titled The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963, had the opportunity to gain a 70-year copyright extension conditional on the songs being published at least once before the end of 2013. Apple Records released the recordings on 17 December to prevent them from going into the public domain and had them taken down from iTunes later that same day. Fan reactions to the release were mixed, with one blogger saying \\"the hardcore Beatles collectors who are trying to obtain everything will already have these.\\" On 26 January 2014, McCartney and Starr performed together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The following day, The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles television special was taped in the Los Angeles Convention Center's West Hall. It aired on 9 February, the exact date of ‚Äì and at the same time, and on the same network as ‚Äì the original broadcast of the Beatles' first US television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, 50 years earlier. The special included performances of Beatles songs by current artists as well as by McCartney and Starr, archival footage, and interviews with the two surviving ex-Beatles carried out by David Letterman at the Ed Sullivan Theater. In December 2015, the Beatles released their catalogue for streaming on various streaming music services including Spotify and Apple Music. In September 2016, the documentary film The Beatles: Eight Days a Week was released. Directed by Ron Howard, it chronicled the Beatles' career during their touring years from 1962 to 1966, from their performances in Liverpool's the Cavern Club in 1961 to their final concert in San Francisco in 1966. The film was released theatrically on 15 September in the UK and the US, and started streaming on Hulu on 17 September. It received several awards and nominations, including for Best Documentary at the 70th British Academy Film Awards and the Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special at the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. An expanded, remixed and remastered version of The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl was released on 9 September, to coincide with the release of the film. On 18 May 2017, Sirius XM Radio launched a 24/7 radio channel, The Beatles Channel. A week later, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was reissued with new stereo mixes and unreleased material for the album's 50th anniversary. Similar box sets were released for The Beatles in November 2018, and Abbey Road in September 2019. On the first week of October 2019, Abbey Road returned to number one on the UK Albums Chart. The Beatles broke their own record for the album with the longest gap between topping the charts as Abbey Road hit the top spot 50 years after its original release.  2020s  In August 2021, The Beatles: Get Back, a new documentary film directed by Peter Jackson utilising footage captured for what became the Let It Be film, will be released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in the US and Canada, with a global release to follow.  Musical style and development  In Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever, Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution: In The Beatles as Musicians, Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \\"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed ‚Äì as a means to entertain ‚Äì a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\\" Ian MacDonald describes McCartney as \\"a natural melodist ‚Äì a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \\"vertical\\", employing wide, consonant intervals which express his \\"extrovert energy and optimism\\". Conversely, Lennon's \\"sedentary, ironic personality\\" is reflected in a \\"horizontal\\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \\"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\\" MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \\"characterful lines and textural colourings\\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \\"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\\". = Influences = The band's earliest influences include Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs. Of Presley, Lennon said, \\"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\\" Other early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison and the Everly Brothers. The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including Bob Dylan, the Who, Frank Zappa, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Byrds and the Beach Boys, whose 1966 album Pet Sounds amazed and inspired McCartney. Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \\"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\\" Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years. = Genres = Originating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music. Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of Beatles for Sale, \\"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\\", while Gould credits Rubber Soul as \\"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\\". H√∂fner \\"violin\\" bass guitar and Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar, models played by McCartney and Harrison, respectively; the Vox AC30 amplifier behind them is the model the Beatles used during performances in the early 1960s.alt=Two electric guitars, a light brown violin-shaped bass and a darker brown guitar resting against a Vox amplifier Although the 1965 song \\"Yesterday\\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes: \\"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\\" They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; Sgt. Peppers \\"She's Leaving Home\\", for instance, is \\"cast in the of a sentimental Victorian ballad\\", Gould writes, \\"its words and music filled with the clich√©s of musical melodrama\\". The band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \\"Rain\\", described by Martin Strong as \\"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\\". Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (recorded before \\"Rain\\"), \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and \\"I Am the Walrus\\". The influence of Indian classical music was evident in Harrison's \\"The Inner Light\\", \\"Love You To\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\" ‚Äì Gould describes the latter two as attempts \\"to replicate the raga form in miniature\\". Innovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \\"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song ‚Äì more sophisticated than pop ... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song ‚Äì classical or vernacular ‚Äì that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\\" Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \\"the Beatles ... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\\" Author Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \\"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained in parallel their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\\" As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \\"Revolution 9\\" (whose musique concr√®te approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's country song \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", Harrison's rock ballad \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", and the \\"proto-metal roar\\" of McCartney's \\"Helter Skelter\\". = Contribution of George Martin = Martin (second from right) in the studio with the Beatles in the mid-1960s George Martin's close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \\"fifth Beatle\\". He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \\"an informal music teacher\\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould. Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \\"Yesterday\\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \\"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\\", in MacDonald's description. Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \\"something baroque\\" to a particular recording. In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and brass. Collaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \\"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!' is an outstanding example.\\" Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence: Harrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: \\"I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness ‚Äì we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.\\" = In the studio = Making innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards ‚Äì any of these might be incorporated into their music. Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from Rubber Soul and, especially, Revolver onwards. Along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects, unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, double tracking and vari-speed recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and the swarmandal in \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\". They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" intro, and the clavioline, an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\".  Legacy  Former Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \\"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original ... [I]n the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \\"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\\", and \\"the first advance in popular music since the War\\". They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people whom they most associated with UK culture. Their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \\"pre-Beatles\\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \\"filler\\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \\"major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion. According to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \\"more popular than Jesus\\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \\"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\\". Other commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness. Referring to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show Leopold states: \\"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\\" According to Gilmore: Established in 2009, Global Beatles Day is an annual holiday on 25 June each year that honours and celebrates the ideals of the Beatles. The date was chosen to commemorate the date the group participated in the BBC programme Our World in 1967, performing \\"All You Need Is Love\\" broadcast to an international audience.  Awards and achievements  In 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be (1970). The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. The best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 600 million units . They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years. They ranked number one on Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 183 million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. On 16 January each year, beginning in 2001, people celebrate World Beatles Day under UNESCO. This date has direct relation to the opening of The Cavern Club in 1957. Five asteroids, 4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney, 4149 Harrison, 4150 Starr and 8749 Beatles are named after the Beatles. In 2007, the Beatles became the first band to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.

The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion ‚Äì 19 or 20% ‚Äì and Brian Epstein's ‚Äì 9 or 10% ‚Äì which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee. In 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75 million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5 million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25 million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000. At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973. Harrison created Harrisongs to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\". The songs on which Starr received co- writing credit before 1968, such as \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\", were also Northern Songs copyrights. Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with Apple Publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Something\\". That year, as well, Starr created Startling Music, which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\". In March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television (ATV), founded by impresario Lew Grade, without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding. The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \\"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City.\\" By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973. In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969. In 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, Associated Communications Corporation (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30 million. According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \\"separate off\\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for ¬£20 million, giving the ex-Beatle \\"a week or so\\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a ¬£5 million bid that was rejected. According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of ¬£21‚Äì25 million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a takeover by Australian business magnate Robert Holmes √† Court for ¬£60 million. In 1985, Michael Jackson purchased ATV for a reported $47.5 million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights. In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110 million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony, creating a new company, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world. In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750 million. Despite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%. Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs ‚Äì \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\" ‚Äì were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in 1978, and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications. On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in the United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.

(other than breach of contract) that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. It can include intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, financial losses, injuries, invasion of privacy, and many other things. Tort law involves claims in an action seeking to obtain a private civil remedy, typically money damages. Tort claims may be compared to criminal law, which deals with criminal wrongs that are punishable by the state. A wrongful act, such as an assault and battery, may result in both a civil lawsuit and a criminal prosecution, although in the U.S., the civil and criminal legal systems are separate. Tort law may also be contrasted with contract law, which also provides civil remedies after breach of duty that arises from a contract; but whereas the contractual obligation is one agreed to by the parties, obligations in both tort and criminal law are more fundamental and are imposed regardless of whether the parties have a contract. In both contract and tort, successful claimants must show that they have suffered foreseeable loss or harm as a direct result of the breach of duty.  Terminology  The person who commits the act is called a tortfeasor. Although crimes may be torts, the cause of legal action in civil torts is not necessarily the result of criminal action; the harm in civil torts may be due to negligence, which does not amount to criminal negligence. The victim of the harm can recover their loss as damages in a lawsuit. In order to prevail, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, commonly referred to as the injured party, must show that the actions or lack of action was the legally recognizable cause of the harm. The equivalent of tort in civil law jurisdictions is \\"delict\\". Legal injuries are not limited to physical injuries and may include emotional, economic, or reputational injuries as well as violations of privacy, property, or constitutional rights. Torts comprise such varied topics as automobile accidents, false imprisonment, defamation, product liability, copyright infringement, and environmental pollution (toxic torts). Compared to criminal cases, tort lawsuits have a lower burden of proof, namely \\"preponderance of evidence\\", rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. Sometimes a claimant may prevail in a tort case even if the defendant who allegedly caused harm were acquitted in an earlier criminal trial. For example, O. J. Simpson was acquitted in criminal court of murder but later found liable for the tort of wrongful death. Both tort law and criminal law may impose liability where there is: * intentional action * reckless behaviour * carelessness * product liability (without negligence) in the US & the EU * \\"innocence\\" (or blameless inadvertence) provided there is strict liability.  History  Roman law contained provisions for torts in the form of delict, which later influenced the civil law jurisdictions in Continental Europe, but a distinctive body of law arose in the common law word traced to English tort law. The word 'tort' was first used in a legal context in the 1580s, although different words were used for similar concepts prior to this time. = Medieval period = Torts and crimes at common law originate in the Germanic system of compensatory fines for wrongs (OE unriht), with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs. In Anglo-Saxon law, most wrongs required payment in money or in kind (b≈çt, literally 'remedy') to the wronged person or their clan.See Medieval Sourcebook: The Anglo-Saxon Dooms, 560‚Äì975. Internet Medieval Source Book by Fordham University. Wƒ´te (literally 'blame, fault') was paid to the king or holder of a court for disturbances of public order. Weregild, which was a murder fine based on a victim's worth, was intended to prevent blood feuds.Malone WS. (1970). Ruminations on the Role of Fault in the History of the Common Law of Torts. Louisiana Law Review. Some wrongs in later law codes were botleas 'without remedy' (e.g. theft, open murder, arson, treason against one's lord), that is, unable to be compensated, and those convicted of a botleas crime were at the king's mercy.Bruce R. O'Brien, \\"Anglo-Saxon Law\\", in The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History, vol. 1 (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009), 179. Items or creatures which caused death were also destroyed as deodands. Assessing intention was a matter for the court, but Alfred the Great's Doom Book did distinguish unintentional injuries from intentional ones, whereas culpability depended on status, age, and gender. After the Norman Conquest, fines were paid only to courts or the king, and quickly became a revenue source. A wrong became known as a tort or trespass, and there arose a division between civil pleas and pleas of the crown.David Ibbetson, \\"Tort: English Common Law\\", in The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History, vol. 5 (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009), 467. The petty assizes (i.e. of novel disseisin, of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The trespass action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for slander, breach of contract, or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts so that in the 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made de cursu (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the \\"appeal of felony\\", or assize of novel disseisin, or replevin. Later, after the Statute of Westminster 1285, in the 1360s, the \\"trespass on the case\\" action arose for when the defendant did not direct force. As its scope increased, it became simply \\"action on the case\\". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case. In 1401, the English case Beaulieu v Finglam imposed strict liability for the escape of fire; additionally, strict liability was imposed for the release of cattle. Negligently handling fire was of particular importance in these societies given capacity for destruction and relatively limited firefighting resources. Liability for common carrier, which arose around 1400, was also emphasized in the medieval period. Unintentional injuries were relatively infrequent in the medieval period. As transportation improved and carriages became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, collisions and carelessness became more prominent in court records. In general, scholars of England such as William Blackstone took a hostile view to litigation, and rules against champerty and maintenance and vexatious litigation existed.Sebok A. (2011). What is Wrong with Wrongdoing. Florida State University Law Review. The restriction on assignment of a cause of action is a related rule based on public policy. = English influence = The right of victims to receive redress was regarded by later English scholars as one of the rights of Englishmen.Goldberg JCP. (2005). The constitutional status of tort law: Due process and the right to a law for the redress of wrongs. Yale Law Journal. Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, which was published in the late 18th century, contained a volume on \\"private wrongs\\" as torts and even used the word tort in a few places. = United States influence = United States tort law was influenced by English law and Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, with several state constitutions specifically providing for redress for torts in addition to reception statutes which adopted English law. However, tort law was viewed as relatively undeveloped by the mid-19th century; the first American treatise on torts was published in the 1860s but the subject became particularly established when Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr wrote on the subject in the 1880s. Holmes' writings have been described as the \\"first serious attempt in the common law world to give torts both a coherent structure and a distinctive substantive domain\\",Goldberg JCP, Zipursky BC. (2010). Torts as Wrongs. Texas Law Review. although Holmes' summary of the history of torts has been critically reviewed.Michael L. Rustad, Thomas F. Lambert Jr.. Book Review of: A Revisionist History of Tort Law: from Holmesian Realism to Neoclassical Rationalism . Suffolk University Law School. The 1928 US case of Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co. heavily influenced the British judges in the 1932 House of Lords case of Donoghue v Stevenson. = Modern development = The law of torts for various jurisdictions has developed independently. In the case of the United States, a survey of trial lawyers pointed to several modern developments, including strict liability for products based on Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, the limitation of various immunities (e.g. sovereign immunity, charitable immunity), comparative negligence, broader rules for admitting evidence, increased damages for emotional distress, and toxic torts and class action lawsuits. However, there has also been a reaction in terms of tort reform, which in some cases have been struck down as violating state constitutions, and federal preemption of state laws.American Association for Justice (1996). Top 10 in torts: evolution in the common law.. Modern torts are heavily affected by insurance and insurance law, as most cases are settled through claims adjustment rather than by trial, and are defended by insurance lawyers, with the insurance policy, a deep pocket limit, setting a ceiling on the possible payment.Goldberg JCP. (2008). Ten Half-Truths About Tort Law. Valparaiso University Law Review.  Comparative law  In the international comparison of modern tort law, common law jurisdictions based upon English tort law have foundational differences from civil law jurisdiction, which may be based on the Roman concept of delict. Even among common law countries, however, significant differences exist. For example, in England legal fees of the winner are paid by the loser (the English rule versus the American rule of attorney fees). Common law systems include United States tort law, Australian tort law, Canadian tort law, Irish tort law, and Scots Law of Delict. The Jewish law of rabbinic damages is another example although tort in Israeli law is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by British Mandate of Palestine authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947. There is more apparent split between the Commonwealth countries (principally England, Canada and Australia) and the United States.Cane P. (2012). Searching for United States Tort Law in the Antipode. Pepperdine Law Review. The United States has been perceived as particularly prone to filing tort lawsuits even relative to other common law countries, although this perception has been criticized and debated.Atiyah PS. (1987). Tort Law and the Alternatives: Some Anglo-American Comparisons. Duke Law Journal. As of 1987, class actions were relatively uncommon outside of the United States. As of 1987, English law was less generous to the plaintiff in the following ways: contingent fee arrangements were restricted, English judges tried more decisions and set damages rather than juries, wrongful death lawsuits were relatively restricted, punitive damages were relatively unavailable, the collateral source rule was restricted, and strict liability, such as for product liability, was relatively unavailable. England's welfare state, such as free healthcare through National Health Service, may limit lawsuits. On the other hand, as of 1987 England had no workers compensation system and lawsuits due to workplace injuries were relatively common and facilitated by trade unions, whereas in the United States the system of workers' compensation insurance provides for compensation an employee who is injured at work even if the employee was at fault for the injury, but otherwise prohibits most lawsuits against the employer (although lawsuits against third parties who are responsible for the injury, such as the manufacturer of a defective ladder on which the employee was injured) are permitted. The United States also has faced a rise in no- fault insurance for automobile liability in several states. In England, ombudsmen may also take cases which could alternatively become tort lawsuits. When comparing Australia and the United States, Australia's tort law is similarly state law; however, there is a federal common law for torts unlike the United States. The influence of United States law on Australia has been limited. However, United States law may have influenced Australia's development of strict liability claims for products indirectly through legislation affected by European Union, and in the 1990s class actions were introduced in Australia. Australia has universal healthcare and 'welfare state' systems which relieve injured persons (and others) from having to pay their medical expenses and also limit lawsuits. In New Zealand, a no-fault accident compensation system has limited the development of personal injury tort law.  Conflict of laws  In certain instances, different jurisdictions' law may apply to a tort, in which case rules have developed for which law to apply. This occurs particularly in the United States, where each of the 50 states may have different state laws, but also may occur in other countries with a federal system of states, or internationally.  Categories  Torts may be categorized in several ways, with a particularly common division between negligent and intentional torts. Quasi-torts are unusual tort actions. Particularly in the United States, \\"collateral tort\\" is used to refer to torts in labour law such as intentional infliction of emotional distress (\\"outrage\\");Chamallas M, Vriggins JB. (2010). The Measure of Injury: Race, Gender, and Tort Law, p. 68. or wrongful dismissal; these evolving causes of action are debated and overlap with contract law or other legal areas to some degree.Gergen M. (1995). Grudging Defense of the Role of the Collateral Torts in Wrongful Termination Litigation Employment. Texas Law Review. The most common action in tort is negligence. The tort of negligence provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the United States. Negligence actions include claims coming primarily from car accidents and personal injury accidents of many kinds, including clinical negligence, worker's negligence and so forth. Product liability cases, such as those involving warranties, may also be considered negligence actions or, particularly in the United States, may apply regardless of negligence or intention through strict liability. Intentional torts include, among others, certain torts arising from the occupation or use of land. The tort of nuisance, for example, involves strict liability for a neighbor who interferes with another's enjoyment of his real property. Trespass allows owners to sue for entrances by a person (or his structure, such as an overhanging building) on their land. Several intentional torts do not involve land. Examples include false imprisonment, the tort of unlawfully arresting or detaining someone, and defamation (in some jurisdictions split into libel and slander), where false information is broadcast and damages the plaintiff's reputation. Other intentional torts include Battery, Assault, Trespass to Chattels, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Misrepresentation, and Alienation of Affections. In some cases, the development of tort law has spurred lawmakers to create alternative solutions to disputes. For example, in some areas, workers' compensation laws arose as a legislative response to court rulings restricting the extent to which employees could sue their employers in respect of injuries sustained during employment. In other cases, legal commentary has led to the development of new causes of action outside the traditional common law torts. These are loosely grouped into quasi-torts or liability torts. = Negligence = Negligence is a tort which arises from the breach of the duty of care owed by one person to another from the perspective of a reasonable person. Although credited as appearing in the United States in Brown v. Kendall, the later Scottish case of Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562, followed in England, brought England into line with the United States and established the 'tort of negligence' as opposed to negligence as a component in specific actions.Ferrari F. (1994). Donoghue v. Stevenson's 60th Anniversary. Annual Survey of International & Comparative Law. In Donoghue, Mrs. Donoghue drank from an opaque bottle containing a decomposed snail and claimed that it had made her ill. She could not sue Mr. Stevenson for damages for breach of contract and instead sued for negligence. The majority determined that the definition of negligence can be divided into four component parts that the plaintiff must prove to establish negligence. The elements in determining the liability for negligence are: * The plaintiff was owed a duty of care through a special relationship (e.g. doctor-patient) or some other principle * There was a dereliction or breach of that duty * The tortfeasor directly caused the injury [but for the defendant's actions, the plaintiff would not have suffered an injury]. * The plaintiff suffered damage as a result of that breach * The damage was not too remote; there was proximate cause to show the breach caused the damage In certain cases, negligence can be assumed under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (Latin for \\"the thing itself speaks\\"); particularly in the United States, a related concept is negligence per se.Twerski. (2009). Third Restatement of Torts: Issue One: Article: Negligence Per Se and Res Ipsa Loquitur: Kissing Cousins. Wake Forest Law Review. Prepublication copy. For example, in the business realm, the auditor has a duty of care to the company they are auditing - that the documents created are a true and reliable representation of the company's financial position. However, as per Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd v. Peat Marwick Hungerfords, such auditors do NOT provide a duty of care to third parties who rely on their reports. An exception is where the auditor provides the third party with a privity letter, explicitly stating the third party can rely on the report for a specific purpose. In such cases, the privity letter establishes a duty of care. (2009) 11 Legal Issues In Business 17. The case Chapman v Hearse added to the precedent of negligence where in previous cases reasonable foreseeability was applied narrowly to include all predictable actions, Chapman v Hearse extended this to include all damages of the same nature which could be reasonably foreseen.Chapman v Hearse (1961) 106 CLR 112  Proximate cause  Proximate cause means that you must be able to show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for..Ch. 12, Proximate or legal cause LexisNexis Study Outline. The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a superseding intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later, he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if, after the accident, the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury. = Intentional torts = Intentional torts are any intentional acts that are reasonably foreseeable to cause harm to an individual, and that do so. Intentional torts have several subcategories: *Torts against the person include assault, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud, although the latter is also an economic tort. *Property torts involve any intentional interference with the property rights of the claimant (plaintiff). Those commonly recognized include trespass to land, trespass to chattels (personal property), and conversion. An intentional tort requires an overt act, some form of intent, and causation. In most cases, transferred intent, which occurs when the defendant intends to injure an individual but actually ends up injuring another individual, will satisfy the intent requirement. Causation can be satisfied as long as the defendant was a substantial factor in causing the harm. = Statutory torts = A statutory tort is like any other, in that it imposes duties on private or public parties, however they are created by the legislature, not the courts. For example, the European Union's Product Liability Directive imposes strict liability for defective products that harm people; such strict liability is not uncommon although not necessarily statutory. As another example, in England common law liability of a landowner to guests or trespassers was replaced by the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957; a similar situation occurred in the U.S. State of California in which a judicial common law rule established in Rowland v. Christian was amended through a 1985 statute.Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery, 19 Cal. 4th 714 (1998). Statutory torts also spread across workplace health and safety laws and health and safety in food. In some cases federal or state statutes may preempt tort actions, which is particularly discussed in terms of the U.S. FDA Preemption;Glantz LH, Annas GJ. (2008). The FDA, Preemption, and the Supreme Court. New England Journal of Medicine. although actions in the United States for medical devices are preempted due to Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc. (2008), actions for medical drugs are not due to Wyeth v. Levine (2009). = Nuisance = \\"Nuisance\\" is traditionally used to describe an activity which is harmful or annoying to others such as indecent conduct or a rubbish heap. Nuisances either affect private individuals (private nuisance) or the general public (public nuisance). The claimant can sue for most acts that interfere with their use and enjoyment of their land. In English law, whether activity was an illegal nuisance depended upon the area and whether the activity was \\"for the benefit of the commonwealth\\", with richer areas subject to a greater expectation of cleanliness and quiet.Cavert W. (2009). Right to Clean Air? Coal Smoke, Property, and Nuisance Law in Early Modern London World Conference on Environmental History. The case Jones v Powell (1629) provides an early example, in which a person's professional papers were damaged by the vapors of a neighboring brewery. Although the outcome of this case is unclear, Whitelocke of the Court of the King's Bench is recorded as saying that since the water supply in area was already contaminated, the nuisance was not actionable as it is \\"better that they should be spoiled than that the commonwealth stand in need of good liquor\\". In English law, a related category of tort liability was created in the case of Rylands v Fletcher (1868): strict liability was established for a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals as long as the cause was not remote. In Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc (1994), chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's water reservoirs. The Rylands rule remains in use in England and Wales. In Australian law, it has been merged into negligence.Burnie Port Authority v General Jones Pty Ltd = Defamation = Defamation is tarnishing the reputation of someone; it has two varieties, slander and libel. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is printed or broadcast defamation. The two otherwise share the same features: making a factual assertion for which evidence does not exist. Defamation does not affect or hinder the voicing of opinions, but does occupy the same fields as rights to free speech in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Related to defamation in the U.S. are the actions for misappropriation of publicity, invasion of privacy, and disclosure. Abuse of process and malicious prosecution are often classified as dignitary torts as well. = Business torts = Business torts (i.e., economic torts) typically involve commercial transactions, and include tortious interference with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. Negligent misrepresentation torts are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation in that there is no privity of contract; these torts are likely to involve pure economic loss which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the \\"foreseeability\\" doctrine.Christie GC. (1996). The Uneasy Place of Principle in Tort Law. Duke Law Review. The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently appliedBarton RJ. (2000). Drowning in a Sea of Contract: Application of The Economic Loss Rule to Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation Claims. William and Mary Law Review. and began in 1965 from a California case involving strict liability for product defects; in 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the doctrine in East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Deleval, Inc. In 2010, the supreme court of the U.S. state of Washington replaced the economic loss doctrine with an \\"independent duty doctrine\\". Economic antitrust torts have been somewhat submerged by modern competition law. However, in the United States, private parties are permitted in certain circumstances to sue for anticompetitive practices, including under federal or state statutes or on the basis of common law tortious interference, which may be based upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß766.Saferstein HI. (1990). The Ascendancy of Business Tort Claims in Antitrust Practice. Antitrust Law Journal. Federal laws include the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 followed by the Clayton Antitrust Act which restrict cartels and through Federal Trade Commission regulate mergers and acquisitions. In the European Union, articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply but allowing private actions to enforce antitrust laws is under discussion. Negligent misrepresentation as tort where no contractual privity exists was disallowed in England by Derry v Peek [1889]; however, this position was overturned in Hedley Byrne v Heller in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a \\"special relationship\\" existed between the plaintiff and defendant. United States courts and scholars \\"paid lip-service\\" to Derry; however, scholars such as William Prosser argued that it was misinterpreted by English courts. The case of Ultramares Corporation v. Touche (1932) limited the liability of an auditor to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s. The Restatement (Second) of Torts expanded liability to \\"foreseeable\\" users rather than specifically identified \\"foreseen\\" users of the information, dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as accountants, architects, attorneys, and surveyors. As of 1989, most U.S. jurisdictions follow either the Ultramares approach or the Restatement approach.Ballam DE. (1989). The Expanding Scope of the Tort of Negligent Misrepresentation. Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review. The tort of deceit for inducement into a contract is a tort in English law, but in practice has been replaced by actions under Misrepresentation Act 1967.Chen-Wishart M. (2007). Contract Law. Oxford University Press. In the United States, similar torts existed but have become superseded to some degree by contract law and the pure economic loss rule. Historically (and to some degree today), fraudulent (but not negligent) misrepresentation involving damages for economic loss may be awarded under the \\"benefit-of-the-bargain\\" rule (damages identical to expectation damages in contracts) which awards the plaintiff the difference between the value represented and the actual value. Beginning with Stiles v. White (1846) in Massachusetts, this rule spread across the country as a majority rule with the \\"out-of-pocket damages\\" rule as a minority rule.Lens JW. (2011). Honest Confusion: The Purpose of Compensatory Damages in Tort and Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Kansas Law Review. Although the damages under the \\"benefit- of-the-bargain\\" are described as compensatory, the plaintiff is left better off than before the transaction. Since the economic loss rule would eliminate these benefits if applied strictly, there is an exception to allow the misrepresentation tort if not related to a contract.  Liability, defenses, and remedies  Indirect liability may arise due to some involvement, notably through joint and several liability doctrines as well as forms of secondary liability. Liability may arise through enterprise liability. Other concepts include market share liability. = Vicarious liability = In certain cases, a person might be liable for their employee or child under the law of agency through the doctrine of respondeat superior. For example, if a shop employee spilled cleaning liquid on the supermarket floor and a victim fell and suffered injuries, the plaintiff might be able to sue either the employee or the employer. There is considerable academic debate about whether vicarious liability is justified on no better basis than the search for a solvent defendant, or whether it is well founded on the theory of efficient risk allocation. = Defenses = A successful defense absolves the defendant from full or partial liability for damages. Apart from proof that there was no breach of duty, there are three principal defenses to tortious liability.  Consent and warning  Typically, a victim cannot hold another liable if the victim has implicitly or explicitly consented to engage in a risky activity. This is frequently summarized by the maxim \\"volenti non fit injuria\\" (Latin: \\"to a willing person, no injury is done\\" or \\"no injury is done to a person who consents\\"). In many cases, those engaging in risky activities will be asked to sign a waiver releasing another party from liability. For example, spectators to certain sports are assumed to accept a risk of injury, such as a hockey puck or baseball striking a member of the audience. Warnings by the defendant may also provide a defense depending upon the jurisdiction and circumstances. This issue arises, for example, in the duty of care that landowners have for guests or trespasses, known as occupiers' liability.  Comparative or contributory negligence  If the victim has contributed to causing their own harm through negligent or irresponsible actions, the damages may be reduced or eliminated entirely. The English case Butterfield v. Forrester (1809) established this defense. In England, this \\"contributory negligence\\" became a partial defense, but in the United States, any fault by the victim completely eliminated any damages.Little WBL. (2007). \\"It is Much Easier to Find Fault With Others, Than to be Faultless Ourselves\\": Contributory Negligence as a Bar to a Claim for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability . Campbell Law Review. This meant that if the plaintiff was 1% at fault, the victim would lose the entire lawsuit. This was viewed as unnecessarily harsh and therefore amended to a comparative negligence system in many states; as of 2007 contributory negligence exists in only a few states such as North Carolina and Maryland. In comparative negligence, the victim's damages are reduced according to the degree of fault. Comparative negligence has been criticized as allowing a plaintiff who is recklessly 95% negligent to recover 5% of the damages from the defendant. Economists have further criticized comparative negligence as not encouraging precaution under the calculus of negligence. In response, many states now have a 50% rule where the plaintiff recovers nothing if the plaintiff is more than 50% responsible.  Illegality  If the claimant is involved in wrongdoing at the time the alleged negligence occurred, this may extinguish or reduce the defendant's liability. The legal maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio, Latin for \\"no right of action arises from a despicable cause\\". Thus, if a burglar is verbally challenged by the property owner and sustains injury when jumping from a second story window to escape apprehension, there is no cause of action against the property owner even though that injury would not have been sustained but for the property owner's intervention.  Other defenses and immunities  Historically, immunity has been granted to governments under sovereign immunity and to charitable organizations under charitable immunity, although these have eroded in the United States. Various laws limit liability when giving aid to a person in need; liability can arise from a failure to help due to the duty to rescue. = Remedies = The main remedy against tortious loss is compensation in damages or money. In a limited range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defense against the tort of battery. Further, in the case of a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction, such as in the English case Miller v Jackson (1977). This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some Australian jurisdictions can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.Currie, S., & Cameron, D. (2000), \\"Your Law\\", Nelson Thomson Learning, Melbourne, p. 225  Theory and reform  Scholars and lawyers have identified conflicting aims for the law of tort, to some extent reflected in the different types of damages awarded by the courts: compensatory, aggravated, and punitive. British scholar Glanville Williams notes four possible bases on which different torts rested: appeasement, justice, deterrence and compensation.Williams, G. [1951] \\"The Aims of the Law of Tort\\", Current Legal Problems 137 From the late 1950s a group of legally oriented economists and economically oriented lawyers known as law and economics scholars emphasized incentives and deterrence, and identified the aim of tort as being the efficient distribution of risk. Ronald Coase, a principal proponent, argued in The Problem of Social Cost (1960) that the aim of tort law, when transaction costs are high, should be to reflect as closely as possible the allocation of risk and liability at which private parties arrive when transaction costs are low., reprinted in , online version Since the mid-to-late 20th century, calls for reform of tort law have come from various perspectives. Some calls for reform stress the difficulties encountered by potential claimants. For example, because not all people who have accidents can find solvent defendants from which to recover damages in the courts, P. S. Atiyah has called the situation a \\"damages lottery\\".Atiyah, P. S. (1997) The Damages Lottery Consequently, in New Zealand, the government in the 1960s established a no-fault system of state compensation for accidents. Similar proposals have been the subject of command papers in the UK and much academic debate. In the U.S., reform has typically limited the scope of tort law and damages available, such as limiting joint and several liability, the collateral source rule, or capping noneconomic damages for emotional distress or punitive damages. These reform statutes are sometimes rejected as unconstitutional under the state constitutions by state supreme courts,Schwartz VE. (1997). Who Should Make America's Tort Law: Courts Or Legislatures? . Also see Publication record. Washington Legal Foundation. with the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution possibly also relevant.Competing Tort Law Forums: Courts vs. Legislatures. Coben & Associates. Theoretical and policy considerations are central to fixing liability for pure economic loss and of public bodies.  Relationship to contract law  Tort is sometimes viewed as the causes of action which are not defined in other areas such as contract or fiduciary law.Harpwood V. (2009). Modern Tort Law, 7th Edition. Routledge. Ch. 1 available as sample. However, tort and contract law are similar in that both involve a breach of duties, and in modern law these duties have blurred and it may not be clear whether an action \\"sounds in tort or contract\\"; if both apply and different standards apply for each (such as a statute of limitations), courts will determine which is the \\"gravamen\\" (the most applicable). Circumstances such as those involving professional negligence may involve both torts and contracts. The choice may affect time limits or damages, particularly given that damages are typically relatively limited in contract cases while in tort cases noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering may be awarded. Punitive damages are relatively uncommon in contractual cases versus tort cases. However, compensation for defective but not unsafe products is typically available only through contractual actions through the law of warranty. In the United Kingdom, plaintiffs in professional negligence cases have some degree of choice in which law while in commercial transactions contract law applies; in unusual cases, intangible losses have been awarded in contract law cases. The English case Hadley v. Baxendale (1854), which was adopted in the United States, split contract and tort damages by foreseeability of the damages when the contract was made. In the United States, the pure economic loss rule was adopted to further prevent negligence lawsuits in breach of contract cases. This \\"economic loss rule\\" was adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States East River Steamship Corp V Transamerica Delaval Inc. (1986) and expanded across the country in a non-uniform manner, leading to confusion. Among other examples, the tort of insurance bad faith arises out of a contractual relationship, and \\"collateral torts\\" such as wrongful dismissal involving possible overlap with labour law contracts.  Overlap with criminal law  There is some overlap between criminal law and tort. For example, in English law an assault is both a crime and a tort (a form of trespass to the person). A tort allows a person, usually the victim, to obtain a remedy that serves their own purposes (for example by the payment of damages to a person injured in a car accident, or the obtaining of injunctive relief to stop a person interfering with their business). Criminal actions on the other hand are pursued not to obtain remedies to assist a personalthough often criminal courts do have power to grant such remediesbut to remove their liberty on the state's behalf. This explains why incarceration is usually available as a penalty for serious crimes, but not usually for torts. In early common law, the distinction between crime and tort was not distinct.Simmons KW. (2007). The Crime/Tort Distinction: Legal Doctrine And Normative Perspectives. Widener Law Review. The more severe penalties available in criminal law also means that it requires a higher burden of proof to be discharged than the related tort. For example, in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that O. J. Simpson had committed the crime of murder; but in a later civil trial, the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of preponderance of the evidence required to prove the tort of wrongful death.Rufo v. Simpson, 86 Cal. App. 4th 573 (2001). Many jurisdictions, especially the US, retain punitive elements in tort damages, for example in anti-trust and consumer-related torts, making tort blur the line with criminal acts. Also there are situations where, particularly if the defendant ignores the orders of the court, a plaintiff can obtain a punitive remedy against the defendant, including imprisonment. Some torts may have a public elementfor example, public nuisanceand sometimes actions in tort will be brought by a public body. Also, while criminal law is primarily punitive, many jurisdictions have developed forms of monetary compensation or restitution which criminal courts can directly order the defendant to pay to the victim.  Law and economics  William M. Landes, Richard A. Posner, and Steven Shavell have initiated a line of research in the law and economics literature that is focused on identifying the effects of tort law on people's behavior. These studies often make use of concepts that were developed in the field of game theory.

Electricity consumption and living standards are highly correlated. Electrification is believed to be the most important engineering achievement of the 20th century. Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , techne, \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , -logia) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics. Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno- progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.  Definition and usage  The spread of paper and printing to the West, as in this printing press, helped scientists and politicians communicate their ideas easily, leading to the Age of Enlightenment; an example of technology as cultural force. The use of the term \\"technology\\" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts or to allude to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861). The term \\"technology\\" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of Technik into \\"technology.\\" In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between technik and technologie that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as \\"technology.\\" By the 1930s, \\"technology\\" referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves. In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that \\"technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.\\" Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as the things that people make and use. More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of \\"technique\\" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi). Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: \\"the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems\\" and \\"a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology.\\" Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 \\"Real World of Technology\\" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is \\"practice, the way we do things around here.\\" The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole.See, for example, Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as \\"the pursuit of life by means other than life,\\" and as \\"organized inorganic matter.\\" Stiegler has more recently stated that biotechnology can no longer be defined as \\"organized inorganic matter,\\" given that it is, rather, \\"the reorganization of the organic.\\" Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology. W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as \\"a means to fulfill a human purpose.\\" The invention of integrated circuits and the microprocessor (here, an Intel 4004 chip from 1971) led to the modern computer revolution. The word \\"technology\\" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as \\"medical technology\\" or \\"space technology,\\" it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. \\"State-of- the-art technology\\" refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field. Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of mathematics, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor. Science, engineering, and technology Antoine Lavoisier experimenting with combustion generated by amplified sun light The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety. Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result. Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference. The exact relations between science and technology, in particular, have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply \\"applied science\\" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, Science ‚Äì The Endless Frontier: \\"New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature ... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.\\" In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology is a result of scientific research. History =Paleolithic (2.5 Ma ‚Äì 10 ka)= chopper The use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution. Early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal, with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans. Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history. Approximately 50,000 years ago, the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged, believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language. Stone tools Hand axes from the Acheulian period A Clovis point, made via pressure flaking Hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago. The earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock, but approximately 75,000 years ago, pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work. Fire The discovery and use of fire, a simple energy source with many profound uses, was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind. The exact date of its discovery is not known; evidence of burnt animal bones at the Cradle of Humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1 Ma; scholarly consensus indicates that Homo erectus had controlled fire by between 500 and 400 ka. Fire, fueled with wood and charcoal, allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten. Clothing and shelter Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were clothing and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380 ka, humans were constructing temporary wood huts. Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to migrate out of Africa by 200 ka and into other continents such as Eurasia. = Neolithic through classical antiquity (10 ka ‚Äì 300 CE) = An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools Human's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the Neolithic Period (\\"New Stone Age\\"). The invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms. This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland. Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as nomadic ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer economy. With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization. What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as Uruk, and the first civilizations, such as Sumer, is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation, are all thought to have played a role. Metal tools Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided, for the first time, the ability to smelt and forge gold, copper, silver, and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times (about 10 ka). Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass (about 4000 BCE). The first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1800 BCE. Energy and transport The wheel was invented circa 4000 BCE. Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to the 8th-millennium BCE. From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and \\"catch\\" basins. The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation. Gibson Technology GL458 According to archaeologists, the wheel was invented around 4000 BCE probably independently and nearly simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day Iraq), the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe. Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4000 BCE. The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about 3500 BCE; however, the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made. More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia. The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. The ancient Sumerians used the potter's wheel and may have invented it. A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around 3429 BCE, and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area. Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources. The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around 3000 BCE. The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur, dating to circa 4000 BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury, England, dating to around the same time period. The first long-distance road, which came into use around 3500 BCE, spanned 1,500 miles from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea, but was not paved and was only partially maintained. In around 2000 BCE, the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a fifty- kilometer (thirty-mile) road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island, through the mountains, to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island. Unlike the earlier road, the Minoan road was completely paved. Plumbing Photograph of the Pont du Gard in France, one of the most famous ancient Roman aqueducts Ancient Minoan private homes had running water. A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos. Several Minoan private homes also had toilets, which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain. The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets, which emptied into an extensive sewage system. The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima; construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today. The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts, which were used to transport water across long distances. The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE. The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE. Put together, the Roman aqueducts extended over 450 kilometers, but less than seventy kilometers of this was above ground and supported by arches. = Medieval and modern history (300 CE ‚Äì present) = The card catalog, a technology developed in the 19th century, became ubiquitous in the 20th century. Innovations continued through the Middle Ages with innovations such as silk-manufacture (introduced into Europe after centuries of development in Asia), the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the 5th-century fall of the Roman Empire. Medieval technology saw the use of simple machines (such as the lever, the screw, and the pulley) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the wheelbarrow, windmills and clocks, and a system of universities developed and spread scientific ideas and practices. The Renaissance era produced many innovations, including the printing press (which facilitated the communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with science, beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. Advances in technology in this era allowed a more reliable supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods. The automobile revolutionized personal transportation. Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transport, driven by the discovery of steam power and the widespread application of the factory system. Technology took another step in a second industrial revolution ( to ) with the harnessing of electricity to allow such innovations as the electric motor, light bulb, and countless others. Scientific advances and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and developments in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering. The rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supplies. Communication improved with the invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio and television. The late-19th and early-20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile. F-15 and F-16 flying over Kuwaiti oil fires during the Gulf War in 1991. The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In physics, the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Computers were invented and later miniaturized using transistors and integrated circuits. Information technology subsequently led to the birth in the 1980s of the Internet, which ushered in the current Information Age. Humans started to explore space with satellites (late 1950s, later used for telecommunication) and in manned missions (1960s) going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as open-heart surgery and later stem-cell therapy along with new medications and treatments. Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain some of the newer technologies, and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education ‚Äì their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have developed to support them, including engineering, medicine, and computer science; and other fields have become more complex, such as construction, transportation, and architecture. Philosophy =Technicism= Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies. Taken to an extreme, technicism \\"reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientific‚Äìtechnological methods and tools.\\" In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma, connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority. =Optimism= Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism, which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good. Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed. Singularitarians believe in some sort of \\"accelerating change\\"; that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology, and that this will culminate in a \\"Singularity\\" after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite; hence the term. Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary, but prominent futurist Ray Kurzweil estimates the Singularity will occur in 2045. Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical epoch, (2) the life epoch, (3) the human/brain epoch, (4) the technology epoch, (5) the artificial intelligence epoch, and (6) the universal colonization epoch. Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of speeding up precedes it. Each epoch takes a shorter time, which means the whole history of the universe is one giant Singularity event. Some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and techno-utopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support. Some have described Karl Marx as a techno-optimist. =Skepticism and critics= Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812 On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like Herbert Marcuse and John Zerzan, who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health. Many, such as the Luddites and prominent philosopher Martin Heidegger, hold serious, although not entirely, deterministic reservations about technology (see \\"The Question Concerning Technology\\"). According to Heidegger scholars Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa, \\"Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.' What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow.\\" Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. In Goethe's Faust, Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by Philip K. Dick and William Gibson and films such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity. The late cultural critic Neil Postman distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called \\"technopolies,\\" societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values, and world-views. Darin Barney has written about technology's impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology. Nikolas Kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology, such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and robotics. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. Francis Fukuyama, J√ºrgen Habermas, William Joy, and Michael Sandel). Another prominent critic of technology is Hubert Dreyfus, who has published books such as On the Internet and What Computers Still Can't Do. A more infamous anti-technological treatise is Industrial Society and Its Future, written by the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure. There are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology, such as self- identified off-gridders.Vannini, Phillip, and Jonathan Taggart. \\"Voluntary simplicity, involuntary complexities, and the pull of remove: The radical ruralities of off-grid lifestyles.\\" Environment and Planning A 45.2 (2013): 295-311. =Appropriate technology= The notion of appropriate technology was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as E.F. Schumacher and Jacques Ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern. =Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century= This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries. In his article, Jared Bernstein, a Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, questions the widespread idea that automation, and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem. His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning unemployment and declining wages. He uses two main arguments to defend his point. First, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, automation threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that \\"requires flexibility judgment and common sense\\" remain hard to replace with machines. Second, studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades. Therefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about \\"bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income, and opportunity.\\" For people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience fatigue and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns. Continuous studies have shown that increased BMI and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising frequently.7.Kim JH 2010 ~Kim JH, Lau C, Cheuk K-K, Kan P, Hui HL, Griffiths SM.

In this context, mass media and technology have a negative impact on people, on both their mental and physical health. =Complex technological systems= Thomas P. Hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently. What is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies? Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, \\"Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity\\".Hughes, Thomas P. (2004) \\"Introduction: Complex Technology\\" (1‚Äì11) in \\"Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture\\" This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking \\"technologies,\\" but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems. Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that engineers, scientists, and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned. For instance, Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts: \\"Internet- centrism\\" and \\"solutionism.\\" Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to Alexis Madrigal's review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to \\"unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address.\\" Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology. Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed ‚Äì especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues. Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers‚Äô new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science \\"[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions.\\" Other animal species This adult gorilla uses a branch as a walking stick to gauge the water's depth, an example of technology usage by non-human primates. The use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans. These include primates such as chimpanzees, some dolphin communities, and crows. Considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control, we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams, or bees and their honeycombs. The ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo. However, the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees using tools for foraging: some of the tools used include leaf sponges, termite fishing probes, pestles and levers. West African chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts, as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista, Brazil. Future technology Theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology is uncertain. In 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping \\"GNR Revolution\\" of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics, with robotics being the most important of the three.

Published in 1954, it elaborates on his psychedelic experience under the influence of mescaline in May 1953. Huxley recalls the insights he experienced, ranging from the \\"purely aesthetic\\" to \\"sacramental vision\\",Huxley, Aldous (1954) The Doors of Perception, Chatto and Windus, p. 15 and reflects on their philosophical and psychological implications. In 1956, he published Heaven and Hell, another essay which elaborates these reflections further. The two works have since often been published together as one book; the title of both comes from William Blake's 1793 book The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.\\"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.‚Äù William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell The Doors of Perception provoked strong reactions for its evaluation of psychedelic drugs as facilitators of mystical insight with great potential benefits for science, art, and religion. While many found the argument compelling, others including writer Thomas Mann, Vedantic monk Swami Prabhavananda, philosopher Martin Buber and scholar Robert Charles Zaehner countered that the effects of mescaline are subjective and should not be conflated with objective religious mysticism. Huxley himself continued to take psychedelics until his death and adjusted his understanding, which also impacted his 1962 final novel Island.  Background  = Mescaline (Peyote and San Pedro Cactus) = Mescaline is the principal active psychedelic agent of the peyote and San Pedro cacti, which have been used in Native American religious ceremonies for thousands of years.Lower Pecos and Coahuila peyote: new radiocarbon dates. Terry M, Steelman KL, Guilderson T, Dering P, Rowe MW. J Archaeological Science. 2006;33:1017‚Äì1021. A German pharmacologist, Arthur Heffter, isolated the alkaloids in the peyote cactus in 1897. These included mescaline, which he showed through a combination of animal and self-experiments was the compound responsible for the psychoactive properties of the plant. In 1919, Ernst Sp√§th, another German chemist, synthesised the drug.About Dr. Arthur Heffter Hefter Research Institute Site Although personal accounts of taking the cactus had been written by psychologists such as Weir Mitchell in the US and Havelock Ellis in the UK during the 1890s, the German-American Heinrich Kluver was the first to systematically study its psychological effects in a small book called Mescal and Mechanisms of Hallucinations published in 1928. The book stated that the drug could be used to research the unconscious mind. = Peyote as entheogen drug = 227x227px In the 1930s, an American anthropologist Weston La Barre, published The Peyote Cult, the first study of the ritual use of peyote as an entheogen drug amongst the Huichol people of western Mexico. La Barre noted that the Native American users of the cactus took it to obtain visions for prophecy, healing and inner strength.Powell, Simon G Mescaline, An Overview Most psychiatric research projects into the drug in the 1930s and early 1940s tended to look at the role of the drug in mimicking psychosis.Grob, Charles S. Psychiatric Research with Hallucinogens: What have we learned?  The Psychotomimetic Model Yearbook for Ethnomedicine and the Study of Consciousness, Issue 3, 1994 In 1947 however, the US Navy undertook Project Chatter, which examined the potential for the drug as a truth revealing agent. In the early 1950s, when Huxley wrote his book, mescaline was still regarded as a research chemical rather than a drug and was listed in the Parke-Davis catalogue with no controls.Jay, Mike (2010) High Society: The Central Role of Mind-Altering Drugs in History, Science, and Culture P. 103 Park Street Press, Mescaline also played a paramount part in influencing the beat generation of poets and writers of the later 1940s to the early 1960s. Most notable, William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg‚Äîall of whom were respected contemporary beat artists of their generation. Theirs and many other contemporary artists' works were heavily influenced by over-the- counter forms of mescaline during this time, due to its potency and attainability. Huxley had been interested in spiritual matters and had used alternative therapies for some time. In 1936 he told TS Eliot that he was starting to meditate,Letter to T.S. Eliot, 8 July 1936; Smith, Letters of Aldous Huxley, pp. 405‚Äì6 and he used other therapies too; the Alexander Technique and the Bates Method of seeing had particular importance in guiding him through personal crises.Dunaway, David King, p. 133 In the late 1930s he had become interested in the spiritual teaching of Vedanta and in 1945 he published The Perennial Philosophy, which set out a philosophy that he believed was found amongst mystics of all religions. He had known for some time of visionary experience achieved by taking drugs in certain religions. = Research by Humphry Osmond = Huxley had first heard of peyote use in ceremonies of the Native American Church in New Mexico, soon after coming to the United States in 1937.Woodcock, George (1972) Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A study of Aldous Huxley, p. 274, Faber & Faber, He first became aware of the cactus's active ingredient, mescaline, after reading an academic paper written by Humphry Osmond, a British psychiatrist working at Weyburn Mental Hospital, Saskatchewan, in early 1952. Osmond's paper set out results from his research into schizophrenia, using mescaline that he had been undertaking with colleagues, doctors Abram Hoffer and John Smythies.Bedford, Sybille (1974) Aldous Huxley: A Biography, Volume Two: 1939‚Äì1963 p. 144, Chatto & Windus, In the epilogue to his novel The Devils of Loudun, published earlier that year, Huxley had written that drugs were \\"toxic short cuts to self- transcendence‚Äù.Huxley, Aldous (1952), The Devils of Loudun, Chatto & Windus For the Canadian writer George Woodcock, Huxley had changed his opinion because mescaline was not addictive and appeared to be without unpleasant physical or mental side-effects. Further, he had found that hypnosis, autohypnosis and meditation had apparently failed to produce the results he wanted.Woodcock (1972) p. 275  Huxley's experience with mescaline  After reading Osmond's paper, Huxley sent him a letter on Thursday, 10 April 1952, expressing interest in the research and putting himself forward as an experimental subject. His letter explained his motivations as being rooted in an idea that the brain is a reducing valve that restricts consciousness, and hoping mescaline might help access a greater degree of awareness (an idea he later included in the book).Bedford (1974) p. 144 Reflecting on his stated motivations, Woodcock wrote that Huxley had realised that the ways to enlightenment were many, including prayer and meditation. He hoped drugs might also break down the barriers of the ego, and both draw him closer to spiritual enlightenment and satisfy his quest as a seeker of knowledge.Woodcock (1972) p. 274 In a second letter on Saturday, 19 April, Huxley invited Osmond to stay while he was visiting Los Angeles to attend the American Psychiatric Association convention.Bedford (1974) p. 142 He also wrote that he looked forward to the mescaline experience and reassured Osmond that his doctor did not object to his taking it. Huxley had invited his friend, the writer Gerald Heard, to participate in the experiment; although Heard was too busy this time, he did join him for a session in November of that year.Murray, Nicholas (2003) Aldous Huxley, p. 399, Abacus = Day of the experiment = Osmond arrived at Huxley's house in West Hollywood on Sunday, 3 May 1953, and recorded his impressions of the famous author as a tolerant and kind man, although he had expected otherwise. The psychiatrist had misgivings about giving the drug to Huxley, and wrote, \\"I did not relish the possibility, however remote, of being the man who drove Aldous Huxley mad,\\" but instead found him an ideal subject. Huxley was \\"shrewd, matter-of-fact and to the point\\" and his wife Maria \\"eminently sensible\\".Bedford(1974) p. 145 Overall, they all liked each other, which was very important when administering the drug. The mescaline was slow to take effect, but Osmond saw that after two and a half hours the drug was working and after three hours Huxley was responding well.Murray (2003) p. 399 The experience lasted eight hours and both Osmond and Maria remained with him throughout.Bedford (1974) p. 145 The experience started in Huxley's study before the party made a seven block trip to The Owl Drug (Rexall) store, known as World's Biggest Drugstore, at the corner of Beverly and La Cienega Boulevards. Huxley was particularly fond of the shop and the large variety of products available there (in stark contrast to the much smaller selection in English chemist's shops). There he considered a variety of paintings in art books. For one of his friends, Huxley's poor eyesight manifested in both a great desire to see and a strong interest in painting, which influenced the strong visual and artistic nature of his experience.Peggy Kiskadden in Dunaway, David King (1998) Aldous Huxley recollected: an oral history, p. 97 Rowman Altamira After returning home to listen to music, eat, and walk in the garden, a friend drove the threesome to the hills overlooking the city. Photographs show Huxley standing, alternately arms on hips and outstretched with a grin on his face. Finally, they returned home and to ordinary consciousness.Dunaway, David King (1989), pp. 228‚Äì300 One of Huxley‚Äôs friends who met him on the day said that despite writing about wearing flannel trousers, he was actually wearing blue jeans. Huxley admitted to having changed the fabric as Maria thought he should be better dressed for his readers.Bedford (1974) p. 163 Osmond later said he had a photo of the day that showed Huxley wearing flannels.Murray (2003) p. 401 = Compilation of the book = One of the copies of William Blake's unique hand painted editions, created for the original printing of the poem. The line from which Huxley draws the title is in the second to last stanza. This image represents Copy H, Plate 14 of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell which is currently held at The Fitzwilliam Museum. After Osmond's departure, Huxley and Maria left to go on a three-week, car trip around the national parks of the North West of the USA. After returning to Los Angeles, he took a month to write the book.Bedford (1974) p. 146 The Doors of Perception was the first book Huxley dedicated to his wife Maria.Murray (2003) p. 400 Harold Raymond, at his publisher Chatto and Windus, said of the manuscript, \\"You are the most articulate guinea pig that any scientist could hope to engage.\\" The title was taken from William Blake's poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: > If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as > it is: Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things > thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.Blake, William (1790) The Marriage of > Heaven and Hell Plate 14 Huxley had used Blake's metaphor in The Doors of Perception while discussing the paintings of Vermeer and the Nain brothers, and previously in The Perennial Philosophy, once in relation to the use of mortification as a means to remove persistent spiritual myopia and secondly to refer to the absence of separation in spiritual vision.Huxley, Aldous (1990) The Perennial Philosophy, pp. 107, 189, Perennial, Blake had a resounding impact on Huxley, he shared many of Blake's earlier revelations and interests in art and literature. In the early 1950s, Huxley had suffered a debilitating attack of the eye condition iritis. This increased his concern for his already poor eyesight and much of his work in the early part of the decade had featured metaphors of vision and sight.Dunaway, David King (1989) p. 283  Synopsis  After a brief overview of research into mescaline, Huxley recounts that he was given 4/10 of a gram at 11:00 am one day in May 1953. Huxley writes that he hoped to gain insight into extraordinary states of mind and expected to see brightly coloured visionary landscapes. When he only sees lights and shapes, he puts this down to being a bad visualiser; however, he experiences a great change in his perception of the external world.Huxley (1954) p. 11 By 12:30 pm, a vase of flowers becomes the \\"miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence\\". The experience, he asserts, is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but simply \\"is\\". He likens it to Meister Eckhart's \\"istigheit\\" or \\"is-ness\\", and Plato's \\"Being\\" but not separated from \\"Becoming\\". He feels he understands the Hindu concept of Satchitananda, as well as the Zen koan that, \\"the dharma body of the Buddha is in the hedge\\" and Buddhist suchness. In this state, Huxley explains he didn't have an \\"I\\", but instead a \\"not-I\\". Meaning and existence, pattern and colour become more significant than spatial relationships and time. Duration is replaced by a perpetual present.Huxley (1954) p. 15 Reflecting on the experience afterwards, Huxley finds himself in agreement with philosopher C. D. Broad that to enable us to live, the brain and nervous system eliminate unessential information from the totality of the 'Mind at Large'.Huxley (1954) pp. 16‚Äì7 The Milkmaid by Johannes Vermeer. \\"That mysterious artist was truly gifted with the vision that perceives the Dharma- Body as the hedge at the bottom of the garden\\", reflected Huxley. In summary, Huxley writes that the ability to think straight is not reduced while under the influence of mescaline, visual impressions are intensified, and the human experimenter will see no reason for action because the experience is so fascinating.Huxley (1954) p. 19 Temporarily leaving the chronological flow, he mentions that four or five hours into the experience he was taken to the World's Biggest Drug Store (WBDS), where he was presented with books on art. In one book, the dress in Botticelli's Judith provokes a reflection on drapery as a major artistic theme as it allows painters to include the abstract in representational art, to create mood, and also to represent the mystery of pure being.Huxley (1954) pp. 21‚Äì25 Huxley feels that human affairs are somewhat irrelevant whilst on mescaline and attempts to shed light on this by reflecting on paintings featuring people.Huxley (1954) p. 27 C√©zanne's Self- portrait with a straw hat seems incredibly pretentious, while Vermeer's human still lifes (also, the Le Nain brothers and Vuillard) are the nearest to reflecting this not-self state.Huxley (1954) pp. 29‚Äì33 For Huxley, the reconciliation of these cleansed perceptions with humanity reflects the age old debate between active and contemplative life, known as the way of Martha and the way of Mary. As Huxley believes that contemplation should also include action and charity, he concludes that the experience represents contemplation at its height, but not its fullness. Correct behaviour and alertness are needed. Nonetheless, Huxley maintains that even quietistic contemplation has an ethical value, because it is concerned with negative virtues and acts to channel the transcendent into the world.Huxley (1954) p. 33 Red Hot Poker flowers in Huxley's garden were \\"so passionately alive that they seemed to be standing on the very brink of utterance\\". After listening to Mozart's C-Minor Piano Concerto, Gesualdo's madrigals and Alban Berg's Lyric Suite,Huxley (1954) pp. 39‚Äì40 Huxley heads into the garden. Outside, the garden chairs take on such an immense intensity that he fears being overwhelmed; this gives him an insight into madness. He reflects that spiritual literature, including the works of Jakob B√∂hme, William Law and the Tibetan Book of the Dead, talks of these pains and terrors. Huxley speculates that schizophrenia is the inability to escape from this reality into the world of common sense and thus help would be essential.Huxley (1954) pp. 41‚Äì46 After lunch and the drive to the WBDS he returns home and to his ordinary state of mind. His final insight is taken from Buddhist scripture: that within sameness there is difference, although that difference is not different from sameness.Huxley (1954) p. 48 The book finishes with Huxley's final reflections on the meaning of his experience. Firstly, the urge to transcend one's self is universal through times and cultures (and was characterised by H. G. Wells as The Door in the Wall).Huxley (1954) p. 49 He reasons that better, healthier \\"doors\\" are needed than alcohol and tobacco. Mescaline has the advantage of not provoking violence in takers, but its effects last an inconveniently long time and some users can have negative reactions. Ideally, self-transcendence would be found in religion, but Huxley feels that it is unlikely that this will ever happen. Christianity and mescaline seem well-suited for each other; the Native American Church for instance uses the drug as a sacrament, where its use combines religious feeling with decorum.Huxley (1954) pp. 55‚Äì58 Huxley concludes that mescaline is not enlightenment or the Beatific vision, but a \\"gratuitous grace\\" (a term taken from Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica).Huxley (1954) p. 63 It is not necessary but helpful, especially so for the intellectual, who can become the victim of words and symbols. Although systematic reasoning is important, direct perception has intrinsic value too. Finally, Huxley maintains that the person who has this experience will be transformed for the better.  Reception  The book met with a variety of responses, both positive and negative, from writers in the fields of literature, psychiatry, philosophy and religion. These included a symposium published in The Saturday Review magazine with the unlikely title of, Mescalin ‚Äì An Answer to Cigarettes, including contributions from Huxley; J.S. Slotkin, a professor of Anthropology; and a physician, Dr. W.C. Cutting.LaBarre, Weston \\"Twenty Years of Peyote Studies\\", Current Anthropology, Vol. 1, No. 1, (Jan. 1960) pp. 45‚Äì60 =Literature= For the Scottish poet, Edwin Muir ‚ÄúMr. Huxley's experiment is extraordinary, and is beautifully described‚Äù.Huxley, Aldous (1954) Dust Jacket Thomas Mann, the author and friend of Huxley, believed the book demonstrated Huxley's escapism. He thought that while escapism found in mysticism might be honourable, drugs were not. Huxley's 'aesthetic self-indulgence' and indifference to humanity would lead to suffering or stupidity; Mann concluded the book was irresponsible, if not quite immoral, to encourage young people to try the drug.Watt, Conrad (1997) Aldous Huxley, pp. 394‚Äì395 Routledge For Huxley's biographer and friend, the author Sybille Bedford, the book combined sincerity with simplicity, passion with detachment.Bedford (1974) p. 155 \\"It reflects the heart and mind open to meet the given, ready, even longing, to accept the wonderful. The Doors is a quiet book. It is also one that postulates a goodwill ‚Äì the choice once more of the nobler hypothesis. It turned out, for certain temperaments, a seductive book.‚ÄùBedford, Sybille (1974) p. 156 For biographer David King Dunaway, The Doors of Perception, along with The Art of Seeing, can be seen as the closest Huxley ever came to autobiographical writing.Dunaway, David King (1989) p. 297 =Psychiatry= William Sargant, the controversial British psychiatrist, reviewed the book for The British Medical Journal and particularly focused on Huxley's reflections on schizophrenia. He wrote that the book brought to life the mental suffering of schizophrenics, which should make psychiatrists uneasy about their failure to relieve this. Also, he hoped that the book would encourage the investigation of the physiological, rather than psychological, aspects of psychiatry.Sargant, William \\"Chemical Mysticism\\", British Medical Journal, Vol. 1, No. 4869 (1 May 1954), p. 1024 Other medical researchers questioned the validity of Huxley's account. According to Roland Fisher, book contained \\"99 percent Aldous Huxley and only one half gram mescaline\\".Roland Fisher (from Canada) quoted in Louis Cholden, ed. Lysergic Acid Diethylamide and Mescaline in Experimental Psychiatry, p. 67, Grune and Stratton, 1956 Joost A.M. Meerloo found Huxley's reactions \\"not necessarily the same as... other people's experiences.\\"Meerloo, Joost A.M. Medication into Submission: The Danger of Therapeutic Coercion, Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases, 1955, 122: 353‚Äì360 For Steven J. Novak, The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell redefined taking mescaline as a mystical experience with possible psychotherapeutic benefits, where physicians had previously thought of the drug in terms of mimicking a psychotic episode, known as psychotomimetic.Novak, Steven J. LSD before Leary: Sidney Cohen's Critique of 1950s Psychedelic Drug Research, Isis, Vol. 88, No. 1 (Mar. 1997), pp. 87‚Äì110 The popularity of the book also affected research into these drugs, because researchers needed a random sample of subjects with no preconceptions about the drug to conduct experiments, and these became very difficult to find.Novak, Steven J. (1997) = Philosophy and religion = Huxley‚Äôs friend and spiritual mentor, the Vedantic monk Swami Prabhavananda, thought that mescaline was an illegitimate path to enlightenment, a \\"deadly heresy\\" as Christopher Isherwood put it. Other thinkers expressed similar apprehensions.  Martin Buber  Martin Buber, the Jewish religious philosopher, attacked Huxley's notion that mescaline allowed a person to participate in \\"common being\\", and held that the drug ushered users \\"merely into a strictly private sphere\\". Buber believed the drug experiences to be holidays \\"from the person participating in the community of logos and cosmos‚Äîholidays from the very uncomfortable reminder to verify oneself as such a person.\\" For Buber man must master, withstand and alter his situation, or even leave it, \\"but the fugitive flight out of the claim of the situation into situationlessness is no legitimate affair of man.\\"Buber, Martin (1965) The Knowledge of Man: Selected Essays ed Maurice S. Friedman, Harper & Row  Robert Charles Zaehner  Robert Charles Zaehner, a professor at Oxford University, formed one of the fullest and earliest critiques of The Doors of Perception from a religious and philosophical perspective. In 1954, Zaehner published an article called The Menace of Mescaline, in which he asserted that \\"artificial interference with consciousness\\" could have nothing to do with the Christian \\"Beatific Vision\\".Richards, William A. \\"Entheogens in the Study of Religious Experiences: Current Status\\", Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 44, No. 4 (Winter, 2005), pp. 377‚Äì389 Zaehner expanded on these criticisms in his book Mysticism Sacred and Profane (1957), which also acts as a theistic riposte to what he sees as the monism of Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy. Although he acknowledged the importance of The Doors of Perception as a challenge to people interested in religious experience,Zaehner, RC (1957) Mysticism Sacred and Profane, Clarendon Press, p. 3 he pointed out what he saw as inconsistencies and self-contradictions.Zaehner p. 25 Zaehner concludes that Huxley's apprehensions under mescaline are affected by his deep familiarity with Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism. So the experience may not be the same for others who take the drug and do not have this background, although they will undoubtedly experience a transformation of sensation.Zaehner p. 3 Zaehner himself was a convert to Catholicism. That the longing to transcend oneself is \\"one of the principal appetites of the soul\\"Huxley, Aldous (1955), The Doors of Perception, p. 49 is questioned by Zaehner. There are still people who do not feel this desire to escape themselves,Zaehner p. 18 and religion itself need not mean escaping from the ego.Zaehner, p. 26 Zaehner criticises what he sees as Huxley's apparent call for all religious people to use drugs (including alcohol) as part of their practices.Zaehner p. 19 Quoting St Paul's proscriptions against drunkenness in church, in 1 Corinthians xi, Zaehner makes the point that artificial ecstatic states and spiritual union with God are not the same. Holding that there are similarities between the experience on mescaline, the mania in a manic-depressive psychosis and the visions of God of a mystical saint suggests, for Zaehner, that the saint's visions must be the same as those of a lunatic.Zaehner, Introduction p.xi The personality is dissipated into the world, for Huxley on mescaline and people in a manic state, which is similar to the experience of nature mystics.Zaehner p. 28 However, this experience is different from the theistic mystic who is absorbed into a God, who is quite different from the objective world. The appendices to Mysticism Sacred and Profane include three accounts of mescaline experiences, including those of Zaehner himself. He writes that he was transported into a world of farcical meaninglessness and that the experience was interesting and funny, but not religious. Soon after the publication of his book, Huxley wrote to Harold Raymond at Chatto and Windus that he thought it strange that when Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton wrote the praises of alcohol they were still considered good Christians, while anyone who suggested other routes to self-transcendence was accused of being a drug addict and perverter of mankind.Murray (2003) p. 403 Later Huxley responded to Zaehner in an article published in 1961: \\"For most of those to whom the experiences have been vouchsafed, their value is self-evident. By Dr. Zaehner, the author of Mysticism, Sacred and Profane, their deliberate induction is regarded as immoral. To which his colleague, Professor Price, retorts in effect, 'Speak for yourself!'\\".Huxley, Aldous, Eds. Horowitz, Michael and Palmer, Cynthia Moksha: Aldous Huxley's Classic Writings on Psychedelics and the Visionary Experience, p. 214. Park Street Press,  Huston Smith  Professor of religion and philosophy Huston Smith argued that Mysticism Sacred and Profane had not fully examined and refuted Huxley's claims made in The Doors of Perception.Huston Smith (1964) Do Drugs Have Religious Import? The Journal of Philosophy, 61, 18 Smith claims that consciousness-changing substances have been linked with religion both throughout history and across the world, and further it is possible that many religious perspectives had their origins in them, which were later forgotten. Acknowledging that personality, preparation and environment all play a role in the effects of the drugs, Huston Smith draws attention to evidence that suggests that a religious outcome of the experience may not be restricted to one of Huxley's temperament. Further, because Zaehner's experience was not religious, does not prove that none will be. Contrary to Zaehner, Huston Smith draws attention to evidence suggesting that these drugs can facilitate theistic mystical experience. As the descriptions of naturally occurring and drug-stimulated mystical experiences cannot be distinguished phenomenologically, Huston Smith regards Zaehner's position in Mysticism Sacred and Profane, as a product of the conflict between science and religion ‚Äì that religion tends to ignore the findings of science. Nonetheless, although these drugs may produce a religious experience, they need not produce a religious life, unless set within a context of faith and discipline. Finally, he concludes that psychedelic drugs should not be forgotten in relation to religion because the phenomenon of religious awe, or the encounter with the holy, is declining and religion cannot survive long in its absence.  Later experience  Huxley later wrote that the \\"things which had entirely filled my attention on that first occasion [chronicled in The Doors of Perception], I now perceived to be temptations ‚Äì temptations to escape from the central reality into a false, or at least imperfect and partial Nirvanas of beauty and mere knowledge.\\" Huxley continued to take these substances several times a year until his death,Dunaway, David King (1989) p. 300 but with a serious and temperate frame of mind.Dunaway, David King (1989) p. 327 He refused to talk about the substances outside scientific meetings,Dunaway, David King (1989) p. 298 turned down an invitation to talk about them on TVDunaway, David King (1989) p. 330 and refused the leadership of a foundation devoted to the study of psychedelics, explaining that they were only one of his diverse number of interests.Dunaway, David King (1989) p. 369 For Philip Thody, a professor of French literature, Huxley's revelations made him conscious of the objections that had been put forward to his theory of mysticism set out in Eyeless in Gaza and Grey Eminence, and consequently Island reveals a more humane philosophy.Thody, Philip (1973) Aldous Huxley Leaders of Modern Thought, Studio Vista, However, this change in perspective may lie elsewhere. In October 1955, Huxley had an experience while on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in The Doors of Perception. He decided his previous experiments, the ones detailed in Doors and Heaven and Hell, had been \\"temptations to escape from the central reality into false, or at least imperfect and partial Nirvanas of beauty and mere knowledge.\\"Stevens, Jay (1998) Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream, pp. 56‚Äì57, Grove Press, He wrote in a letter to Humphry Osmond, that he experienced \\"the direct, total awareness, from the inside, so to say, of Love as the primary and fundamental cosmic fact. ... I was this fact; or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that this fact occupied the place where I had been.\\"Letter to Humphry Osmond, 24 October 1955. in Achera Huxley, Laura (1969) This Timeless Moment. P.139, Chatto & Windus The experience made its way into the final chapter of Island.Achera Huxley, p. 146 This raised a troublesome point. Was it better to pursue a course of careful psychological experimentation.... or was the real value of these drugs to \\"stimulate the most basic kind of religious ecstasy\\"?  Influence  A variety of influences have been claimed for the book. The psychedelic proselytiser Timothy Leary was given the book by a colleague soon after returning from Mexico where he had first taken psilocybin mushrooms in the summer of 1960. He found that The Doors of Perception corroborated what he had experienced 'and more too'.Leary, Timothy (1968) High Priest, New World Publishing Leary soon set up a meeting with Huxley and the two became friendly. The book can also be seen as a part of the history of entheogenic model of understanding these drugs, that sees them within a spiritual context.Richard, William A. \\"Entheogens in the Study of Religious Experiences: Current Status\\", Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 44, No. 4 (Winter, 2005), pp. 377‚Äì389 = William Blake = William Blake (Born in London, 28 November 1757 ‚Äì 12 August 1827) who inspired the book's title and writing style, was an influential English artist most notable for his paintings and poetry. The Doors of Perception was originally a metaphor written by Blake, used in his 1790 book, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. The metaphor was used to represent Blake's feelings about mankind's limited perception of the reality around them; \\"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.‚ÄùWilliam Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell  Cultural references  *This book was the influence behind Jim Morrison naming his band The Doors in 1965. *In his 2014 Scientific American article, skeptic Michael Shermer closed his story about an \\"anomalous and mystifying event[s] that suggest the existence of the paranormal or supernatural\\" with the statement advising that \\"we should not shut the doors of perception when they may be opened to us to marvel in the mysterious.\\" The event was that his wife's grandfather's transistor radio, which had been broken, started playing without being touched just before their wedding ceremony.Michael Shermer: The Radio (To The Best of Our Knowledge podcast, aired Oct 28, 2017, published to YouTube on Oct 31, 2017) *In the 2016 film Doctor Strange, Stan Lee's character is seen reading the book.

Terraforming or terraformation (literally, \\"Earth-shaping\\") of a planet, moon, or other body is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying its atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be similar to the environment of Earth to make it habitable by Earth-like life. The concept of terraforming developed from both science fiction and actual science. The term was coined by Jack Williamson in a science-fiction short story (\\"Collision Orbit\\") published during 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction, but the concept may pre-date this work. Even if the environment of a planet could be altered deliberately, the feasibility of creating an unconstrained planetary environment that mimics Earth on another planet has yet to be verified. Mars is usually considered to be the most likely candidate for terraforming. Much study has been done concerning the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and NASA has even hosted debates on the subject. Several potential methods of altering the climate of Mars may fall within humanity's technological capabilities, but at present the economic resources required to do so are far beyond that which any government or society is willing to allocate to it. The long timescales and practicality of terraforming are the subject of debate. Other unanswered questions relate to the ethics, logistics, economics, politics, and methodology of altering the environment of an extraterrestrial world. History of scholarly study The astronomer Carl Sagan proposed the planetary engineering of Venus in an article published in the journal Science in 1961. Sagan imagined seeding the atmosphere of Venus with algae, which would convert water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide into organic compounds. As this process removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect would be reduced until surface temperatures dropped to \\"comfortable\\" levels. The resulting carbon, Sagan supposed, would be incinerated by the high surface temperatures of Venus, and thus be sequestered in the form of \\"graphite or some involatile form of carbon\\" on the planet's surface.Sagan 1997, pp. 276‚Äì7. However, later discoveries about the conditions on Venus made this particular approach impossible. One problem is that the clouds of Venus are composed of a highly concentrated sulfuric acid solution. Even if atmospheric algae could thrive in the hostile environment of Venus's upper atmosphere, an even more insurmountable problem is that its atmosphere is simply far too thick‚Äîthe high atmospheric pressure would result in an \\"atmosphere of nearly pure molecular oxygen\\" and cause the planet's surface to be thickly covered in fine graphite powder. This volatile combination could not be sustained through time. Any carbon that was fixed in organic form would be liberated as carbon dioxide again through combustion, \\"short-circuiting\\" the terraforming process. Sagan also visualized making Mars habitable for human life in \\"Planetary Engineering on Mars\\" (1973), an article published in the journal Icarus. Three years later, NASA addressed the issue of planetary engineering officially in a study, but used the term \\"planetary ecosynthesis\\" instead. The study concluded that it was possible for Mars to support life and be made into a habitable planet. The first conference session on terraforming, then referred to as \\"Planetary Modeling\\", was organized that same year. In March 1979, NASA engineer and author James Oberg organized the First Terraforming Colloquium, a special session at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. Oberg popularized the terraforming concepts discussed at the colloquium to the general public in his book New Earths (1981). Not until 1982 was the word terraforming used in the title of a published journal article. Planetologist Christopher McKay wrote \\"Terraforming Mars\\", a paper for the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society. The paper discussed the prospects of a self- regulating Martian biosphere, and McKay's use of the word has since become the preferred term. In 1984, James Lovelock and Michael Allaby published The Greening of Mars. Lovelock's book was one of the first to describe a novel method of warming Mars, where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are added to the atmosphere. Motivated by Lovelock's book, biophysicist Robert Haynes worked behind the scenes to promote terraforming, and contributed the neologism Ecopoiesis,Haynes, RH (1990), \\"Ecce Ecopoiesis: Playing God on Mars\\", in MacNiven, D. (1990-07-13), Moral Expertise: studies in practical and professional ethics, Routledge. pp. 161‚Äì163. . forming the word from the Greek , oikos, \\"house\\",. and , poiesis, \\"production\\".. Ecopoiesis refers to the origin of an ecosystem. In the context of space exploration, Haynes describes ecopoiesis as the \\"fabrication of a sustainable ecosystem on a currently lifeless, sterile planet\\". Fogg defines ecopoiesis as a type of planetary engineering and is one of the first stages of terraformation. This primary stage of ecosystem creation is usually restricted to the initial seeding of microbial life. A 2019 opinion piece by Lopez, Peixoto and Rosado has reintroduced microbiology as a necessary component of any possible colonization strategy based on the principles of microbial symbiosis and their beneficial ecosystem services. As conditions approach that of Earth, plant life could be brought in, and this will accelerate the production of oxygen, theoretically making the planet eventually able to support animal life. =Aspects and definitions= In 1985, Martyn J. Fogg started publishing several articles on terraforming. He also served as editor for a full issue on terraforming for the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in 1992. In his book Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments (1995), Fogg proposed the following definitions for different aspects related to terraforming: * Planetary engineering: the application of technology for the purpose of influencing the global properties of a planet. * Geoengineering: planetary engineering applied specifically to Earth. It includes only those macroengineering concepts that deal with the alteration of some global parameter, such as the greenhouse effect, atmospheric composition, insolation or impact flux. * Terraforming: a process of planetary engineering, specifically directed at enhancing the capacity of an extraterrestrial planetary environment to support life as we know it. The ultimate achievement in terraforming would be to create an open planetary ecosystem emulating all the functions of the biosphere of Earth, one that would be fully habitable for human beings. Fogg also devised definitions for candidate planets of varying degrees of human compatibility:Fogg, 1996 * Habitable Planet (HP): A world with an environment sufficiently similar to Earth as to allow comfortable and free human habitation. * Biocompatible Planet (BP): A planet possessing the necessary physical parameters for life to flourish on its surface. If initially lifeless, then such a world could host a biosphere of considerable complexity without the need for terraforming. * Easily Terraformable Planet (ETP): A planet that might be rendered biocompatible, or possibly habitable, and maintained so by modest planetary engineering techniques and with the limited resources of a starship or robot precursor mission. Fogg suggests that Mars was a biologically compatible planet in its youth, but is not now in any of these three categories, because it can only be terraformed with greater difficulty. Habitability requirements An absolute requirement for life is an energy source, but the notion of planetary habitability implies that many other geophysical, geochemical, and astrophysical criteria must be met before the surface of an astronomical body is able to support life. Of particular interest is the set of factors that has sustained complex, multicellular animals in addition to simpler organisms on Earth. Research and theory in this regard is a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology. In its astrobiology roadmap, NASA has defined the principal habitability criteria as \\"extended regions of liquid water, conditions favorable for the assembly of complex organic molecules, and energy sources to sustain metabolism.\\" Preliminary stages Once conditions become more suitable for life of the introduced species, the importation of microbial life could begin. As conditions approach that of Earth, plant life could also be brought in. This would accelerate the production of oxygen, which theoretically would make the planet eventually able to support animal life. Prospective targets =Mars= Artist's conception of a terraformed Mars In many respects, Mars is the most Earth-like planet in the Solar System.Read and Lewis 2004, p.16Kargel 2004, pp. 185‚Äì6. It is thought that Mars once had a more Earth-like environment early in its history, with a thicker atmosphere and abundant water that was lost over the course of hundreds of millions of years.Kargel 2004, 99ff The exact mechanism of this loss is still unclear, though three mechanisms in particular seem likely: First, whenever surface water is present, carbon dioxide () reacts with rocks to form carbonates, thus drawing atmosphere off and binding it to the planetary surface. On Earth, this process is counteracted when plate tectonics works to cause volcanic eruptions that vent carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. On Mars, the lack of such tectonic activity worked to prevent the recycling of gases locked up in sediments.Forget, Costard & Lognonn√© 2007, pp. 80‚Äì2. Second, the lack of a magnetosphere around Mars may have allowed the solar wind to gradually erode the atmosphere. Convection within the core of Mars, which is made mostly of iron, originally generated a magnetic field. However the dynamo ceased to function long ago,Schubert, Turcotte & Olson 2001, p. 692 and the magnetic field of Mars has largely disappeared, probably due to \\"... loss of core heat, solidification of most of the core, and/or changes in the mantle convection regime.\\" Results from the NASA MAVEN mission show that the atmosphere is removed primarily due to Coronal Mass Ejection events, where outbursts of high-velocity protons from the sun impact the atmosphere. Mars does still retain a limited magnetosphere that covers approximately 40% of its surface. Rather than uniformly covering and protecting the atmosphere from solar wind, however, the magnetic field takes the form of a collection of smaller, umbrella-shaped fields, mainly clustered together around the planet's southern hemisphere.Solar Wind, 2008 Finally, between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago, asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the surface environment of objects in the Solar System. The low gravity of Mars suggests that these impacts could have ejected much of the Martian atmosphere into deep space.Forget, Costard & Lognonn√© 2007, pp. 80. Terraforming Mars would entail two major interlaced changes: building the atmosphere and heating it.Faure & Mensing 2007, p. 252. A thicker atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide would trap incoming solar radiation. Because the raised temperature would add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the two processes would augment each other. Carbon dioxide alone would not suffice to sustain a temperature above the freezing point of water, so a mixture of specialized greenhouse molecules might be manufactured. =Venus= Artist's conception of a terraformed Venus Terraforming Venus requires two major changes; removing most of the planet's dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and reducing the planet's surface temperature. These goals are closely interrelated, because Venus's extreme temperature is thought to be due to the greenhouse effect caused by its dense atmosphere. Sequestering the atmospheric carbon would likely solve the temperature problem as well. =Moon= Artist's conception of the Moon (foreground) and Mercury (background) terraformed Although the gravity on Earth's moon is too low to hold an atmosphere for geological spans of time, if given one, it would retain it for spans of time that are long compared to human lifespans. LandisLandis, Geoffrey (1990) \\"Air Pollution on the Moon,\\" Analog, June. and othersBenford, Greg (2014) \\"How to Terraform the Moon\\", Slate, July 14. Retrieved 30 January 2017Williams, Matt (2016) \\"How Do We Terraform the Moon\\", Universe Today, 31 March. Retrieved 30 January 2017 have thus proposed that it could be feasible to terraform the moon, although not all agree with that proposal.Dorminey, Bruce (2016) \\"Why The Moon Should Never Be Terraformed\\", Forbes, July 27. Retrieved 30 January 2017 Landis estimates that a 1 PSI atmosphere of pure oxygen on the moon would require on the order of two hundred trillion tons of oxygen, and suggests it could be produced by reducing the oxygen from an amount of lunar rock equivalent to a cube about fifty kilometers on an edge. Alternatively, he suggests that the water content of \\"fifty to a hundred comets\\" the size of Halley's comet would do the job, \\"assuming that the water doesn't splash away when the comets hit the moon.\\" Likewise, Benford calculates that terraforming the moon would require \\"about 100 comets the size of Halley's.\\" =Earth= It has been recently proposed that due to the effects of climate change, an interventionist program might be designed to return Earth to its usual and more benign climate parameters. In order to achieve this, multiple solutions have been proposed, such as the management of solar radiation, the sequestration of carbon dioxide using geoengineering methods and the design and release of climate altering genetically engineered organisms. =Other bodies in the Solar System= Other possible candidates for terraforming (possibly only partial or paraterraforming) include Titan, Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and even Mercury, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and the dwarf planet Ceres. Other possibilities =Biological terraforming= Many proposals for planetary engineering involve the use of genetically engineered bacteria. As synthetic biology matures over the coming decades it may become possible to build designer organisms from scratch that directly manufacture desired products efficiently. Lisa Nip, Ph.D. candidate at the MIT Media Lab's Molecular Machines group, said that by synthetic biology, scientists could genetically engineer humans, plants and bacteria to create Earth-like conditions on another planet. Gary King, microbiologist at Louisiana State University studying the most extreme organisms on Earth, notes that \\"synthetic biology has given us a remarkable toolkit that can be used to manufacture new kinds of organisms specially suited for the systems we want to plan for\\" and outlines the prospects for terraforming, saying \\"we'll want to investigate our chosen microbes, find the genes that code for the survival and terraforming properties that we want (like radiation and drought resistance), and then use that knowledge to genetically engineer specifically Martian-designed microbes\\". He sees the project's biggest bottleneck in the ability to genetically tweak and tailor the right microbes, estimating that this hurdle could take \\"a decade or more\\" to be solved. He also notes that it would be best to develop \\"not a single kind microbe but a suite of several that work together\\". DARPA is researching using photosynthesizing plants, bacteria, and algae grown directly on the Mars surface that could warm up and thicken its atmosphere. In 2015 the agency and some of its research partners have created a software called DTA GView ‚àí a 'Google Maps of genomes', in which genomes of several organisms can be pulled up on the program to immediately show a list of known genes and where they are located in the genome. According to Alicia Jackson, deputy director of DARPA's Biological Technologies Office by this they have developed a \\"technological toolkit to transform not just hostile places here on Earth, but to go into space not just to visit, but to stay\\". =Paraterraforming= Also known as the \\"worldhouse\\" concept, paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which encompasses most of the planet's usable area.Taylor, 1992 The enclosure would consist of a transparent roof held one or more kilometers above the surface, pressurized with a breathable atmosphere, and anchored with tension towers and cables at regular intervals. The worldhouse concept is similar to the concept of a domed habitat, but one which covers all (or most) of the planet. =Adapting humans= It has also been suggested that instead of or in addition to terraforming a hostile environment humans might adapt to these places by the use of genetic engineering, biotechnology and cybernetic enhancements. Issues =Solar radiation= The lack of a magnetosphere on Mars means the red planet is constantly blasted with solar radiation. Earth has a well formed magnetosphere that makes all life on earth possible. This also makes any kind of travel to Mars (or anywhere else) near impossible. Humans staying on Mars for even the shortest time would be reduced to living well beneath the planet's surface. This issue is conveniently left out of interstellar travel discussions among NASA, Space X and other organizations that rely heavily on the prospect of future travel to Mars. =Ethical issues= There is a philosophical debate within biology and ecology as to whether terraforming other worlds is an ethical endeavor. From the point of view of a cosmocentric ethic, this involves balancing the need for the preservation of human life against the intrinsic value of existing planetary ecologies.MacNiven 1995 On the pro-terraforming side of the argument, there are those like Robert Zubrin, Martyn J. Fogg, Richard L. S. Taylor and the late Carl Sagan who believe that it is humanity's moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for life, as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth.Robert Zubrin, The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must, pp. 248‚Äì249, Simon & Schuster/Touchstone, 1996, Fogg 2000 They also point out that Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become extinct. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life. The opposing argument posits that terraforming would be an unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may be better off without human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it to our own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans.Christopher McKay and Robert Zubrin, \\"Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?\\", pp. 177‚Äì182, in On to Mars: Colonizing a New World, Apogee Books Space Series, 2002, Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference. =Economic issues= The initial cost of such projects as planetary terraforming would be gargantuan, and the infrastructure of such an enterprise would have to be built from scratch. Such technology is not yet developed, let alone financially feasible at the moment. John Hickman has pointed out that almost none of the current schemes for terraforming incorporate economic strategies, and most of their models and expectations seem highly optimistic. =Political issues= National pride, rivalries between nations, and the politics of public relations have in the past been the primary motivations for shaping space projects.Thompson 2001 p. 108 It is reasonable to assume that these factors would also be present in planetary terraforming efforts. In popular culture Terraforming is a common concept in science fiction, ranging from television, movies and novels to video games. See also       Notes   References   Dalrymple, G. Brent (2004).

A trial de novo is usually ordered by an appellate court when the original trial failed to make a determination in a manner dictated by law. Common law In common law systems, one feature that distinguishes an appellate proceeding from a trial de novo is that new evidence may not ordinarily be presented in an appeal, though there are rare instances when it may be allowed‚Äîusually evidence that came to light only after the trial and could not, in all diligence, have been presented in the lower court. The general rule, however, is that an appeal must be based solely on \\"points of law\\", and not on \\"points of fact\\". Appeals are frequently based on a claim that the trial judge or jury did not allow or appreciate all the facts; if that claim is successful the appeal judges will often order a trial \\"de novo\\". In order to protect the individual's rights against double jeopardy, ordering a trial \\"de novo\\" is often the exclusive right of an appeal judge. For example, a system may relegate a claim of a certain amount to a judge but preserve the right to a new trial before a jury. In American Federal Court systems, \\"de novo\\" can also refer to a standard of review for courts of appeal. Sometimes, particularly potent issues are brought before an appeals court, such as a constitutional determination made by a lower court, or summary judgment granted by a lower court. When this sort of issue is on appeal, the court of appeals will review the lower court decision \\"de novo\\" or from the beginning. In this process, the panel of judges for the court of appeals will review the lower court's reasoning and fact-finding from the beginning, based on the record. This is a high level of scrutiny that is more likely to result in reversal or remand of an issue. This is in contrast to more relaxed standards of review such as \\"clearly erroneous\\" or \\"substantial evidence.\\" These relaxed standards usually do not result in reversals, as the court of appeals grants more deference to the judgment of the lower courts. =United Kingdom= In UK law, appeals to the Crown Court against convictions in the Magistrates Court are held de novo. De novo review refers to the appellate court's authority to review the trial court's conclusions on questions of the application, interpretation, and construction of law. Generally, the proper standard of review for employee benefit decisions, such as the denial of benefit claims, is de novo. Also, where the appellate court undertakes judicial review of compulsory arbitration proceedings that were required by statute, the reviewing court must conduct a de novo review of the interpretation and application of the law by the arbitrators. =United States= In the United States, some states provide for bench trials only for small claims, traffic offenses, and criminal offenses with a penalty of imprisonment of less than six months, then provide the ability to appeal a loss to the trial court of general jurisdiction for a brand-new trial. Unlike the appellate court which only examines the issues raised in the original trial, in a trial de novo a brand new trial takes place. The Supreme Court of Virginia said this in Santen v. Tuthill, 265 Va. 492 (2003), about the practice of an appeal from district court trial de novo to circuit court: \\"This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to 'annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.'\\". Some states use a system combining aspects of traditional appeal and absolute trial de novo; for instance, in New Jersey, decisions in minor criminal and traffic cases heard in the state's Municipal Courts may be appealed to the Law Division, Criminal Part of the Superior Court for \\"trial de novo on the record,\\" in which the Law Division makes new findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the record produced in the Municipal Court's trial (i.e. based on the transcript of the Municipal Court proceeding and any physical or documentary evidence presented to the Municipal Court), but does not hold any evidentiary hearings itself.N.J. Ct. R. 3:23-8(a)(2)State v. Loce, 267 N.J. Super. 102, 104 (Law Div. 1991) It is often used in the review of administrative proceedings or the judgements of a small claims court. If the determination made by a lower body is overturned, it may be renewed de novo in the review process (this is usually before it reaches the court system). Sometimes administrative decisions may be reviewed by the courts on a de novo basis.

G. Wells, published in 1895 and written as a frame narrative. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward through time. The term \\"time machine\\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device. The Time Machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions and many comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions. History Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled \\"The Chronic Argonauts\\" (1888). This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for The Time Machine. Wells frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the Pall Mall Gazette until the publisher asked him if he could instead write a serial novel on the same theme. Wells readily agreed and was paid ¬£100 (equal to about ¬£ today) on its publication by Heinemann in 1895, which first published the story in serial form in the January to May numbers of The New Review (newly under the nominal editorship of W. E. Henley). Henry Holt and Company published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript) on 7 May 1895; Heinemann published an English edition on 29 May. These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the \\"Holt text\\" and \\"Heinemann text\\", respectively. Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text. The story reflects Wells's own socialist political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about industrial relations. It is also influenced by Ray Lankester's theories about social degeneration and shares many elements with Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Vril, the Power of the Coming Race (1871). Other science fiction works of the period, including Edward Bellamy's novel Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (1888) and the later film Metropolis (1927), dealt with similar themes. Based on Wells's personal experiences and childhood, the working class literally spent a lot of their time underground. His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father's shop. Later, his own mother would work as a housekeeper in a house with tunnels below, where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters. A medical journal published in 1905 would focus on these living quarters for servants in poorly ventilated dark basements. In his early teens, Wells became a draper's apprentice, having to work in a basement for hours on end. This work is an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre. The portion of the novella that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places The Time Machine within the realm of eschatology, i.e. the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind. Plot The Time Machine was reprinted in Two Complete Science-Adventure Books in 1951 The book's protagonist is a Victorian English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller. Similarly, with but one exception (a man named Filby) none of the dinner guests present are ever identified by name, but rather by profession (for example, \\"the Psychologist\\") or physical description (for example, \\"the Very Young Man\\"). The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and demonstrates a tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator. In the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device. At first he thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into the future. He continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden. The Time Traveller stops in A.D. 802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, and adhere to a fruit-based diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline. They appear happy and carefree but fear the dark, and particularly moonless nights. Observing them, he finds that they give no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances, possibly because the thought of it alone frightens them into silence. He speculates that they are a peaceful society. After exploring the area around the Eloi's residences, the Time Traveller reaches the top of a hill overlooking London. He concludes that the entire planet has become a garden, with little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of thousands of years prior. Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Exploring one of many \\"wells\\" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak. Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure dubbed \\"The Palace of Green Porcelain\\", which turns out to be a derelict museum. Here, the Time Traveller finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night. They are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, whereby Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire and the Time Traveller is devastated over his loss. The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: Menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies, in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out. Overwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left. He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Time Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time. However, the narrator reveals that he has waited three years before writing and stating the Time Traveller has not returned from his journey. Deleted text A section from the eleventh chapter of the serial published in New Review (May 1895) was deleted from the book. It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells's editor, William Ernest Henley, who wanted Wells to \\"oblige your editor\\" by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of \\"the ultimate degeneracy\\" of humanity. \\"There was a slight struggle,\\" Wells later recalled, \\"between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to put a little 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text.\\" This portion of the story was published elsewhere as \\"The Grey Man\\". The deleted text was also published by Forrest J Ackerman in an issue of the American edition of Perry Rhodan. The deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the Traveller's escape from the Morlocks. He finds himself in the distant future in a frost covered moorland with simple grasses and black bushes, populated with furry, hopping herbivores resembling kangaroos. He stuns or kills one with a rock, and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans / Eloi / Morlocks. A gigantic, centipede-like arthropod approaches and the Traveller flees into the next day, finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid. The Dover Press and Easton Press editions of the novella restore this deleted segment. Scholarship Significant scholarly commentary on The Time Machine began from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells's early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi's The Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances) and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas's The Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians). Much critical and textual work was done in the 1970s, including the tracing of the very complex publication history of the text, its drafts, and unpublished fragments. =Academic publications= A further resurgence in scholarship came around the time of the novella's centenary in 1995, and a major outcome of this was the 1995 conference and substantial anthology of academic papers, which was collected in print as H.G. Wells‚Äôs Perennial Time Machine. This publication then allowed the development of a guide-book for academic study at Master's and Ph.D. level: H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide. The scholarly journal The Wellsian has published around twenty articles on The Time Machine, and a U.S. academic journal The Undying Fire, devoted to H.G. Wells studies, has published three articles since its inception in 2002. =Subtext of the names Eloi and Morlock= The name Eloi is the Hebrew plural for Elohim, or lesser gods, in the Old Testament. Wells's source for the name Morlock is less clear. It may refer to the Canaanite god Moloch associated with child sacrifice. The name Morlock may also be a play on mollocks ‚Äì what miners might call themselves ‚Äì or a Scots word for rubbish, or a reference to the Morlacchi community in Dalmatia. =Symbols= The Time Machine can be read as a symbolic novel. The time machine itself can be viewed as a symbol, and there are several symbols in the narrative, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire. * The statue of the Sphinx is the place where the Morlocks hide the time machine and references the Sphinx in the story of Oedipus who gives a riddle that he must first solve before he can pass. The Sphinx appeared on the cover of the first London edition as requested by Wells and would have been familiar to his readers. * The white flowers can symbolize Weena's devotion and innocence and contrast with the machinery of the time machine. They are the only proof that the Time Traveller's story is true. * Fire symbolizes civilization: the Time Traveller uses it to ward off the Morlocks, but it escapes his control and turns into a forest fire. Adaptations = Radio and audio = Escape radio broadcasts The CBS radio anthology Escape adapted The Time Machine twice, in 1948 starring Jeff Corey, and again in 1950 starring Lawrence Dobkin as the traveller. A script adapted by Irving Ravetch was used in both episodes. The Time Traveller was named Dudley and was accompanied by his skeptical friend Fowler as they traveled to the year 100,080. 1994 Alien Voices audio drama In 1994, an audio drama was released on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starring Leonard Nimoy as the Time Traveller (named John in this adaptation) and John de Lancie as David Filby. John de Lancie's children, Owen de Lancie and Keegan de Lancie, played the parts of the Eloi. The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the story than several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.  7th Voyage  In 2000, Alan Young read The Time Machine for 7th Voyage Productions, Inc., in 2016 to celebrate the 120th Anniversary of H.G. Wells's novella. 2009 BBC Radio 3 broadcast Robert Glenister starred as the Time Traveller, with William Gaunt as H. G. Wells in a new 100-minute radio dramatisation by Philip Osment, directed by Jeremy Mortimer as part of a BBC Radio Science Fiction season. This was the first adaptation of the novella for British radio. It was first broadcast on 22 February 2009 on BBC Radio 3 and later published as a 2-CD BBC audio book. The other cast members were: *Donnla Hughes as Martha *Gunnar Cauthery as Young H. G. Wells *Stephen Critchlow as Filby, friend of the young Wells *Chris Pavlo as Bennett, friend of the young Wells *Manjeet Mann as Mrs. Watchett, the Traveller's housemaid *Jill Crado as Weena, one of the Eloi and the Traveller's partner *Robert Lonsdale, Inam Mirza, and Dan Starkey as other characters The adaptation retained the nameless status of the Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the American journalist, Martha, whilst firewatching on the roof of Broadcasting House during the Blitz. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30 million AD at the end of the universe before disappearing or dying there. Big Finish On 5 September 2017, Big Finish Productions released an adaptation of The Time Machine. This adaptation was written by Marc Platt, and starred Ben Miles as the Time Traveller. Platt explained in an interview that adapting The Time Machine to audio was not much different from writing Doctor Who, and that he could see where some of the roots of early Doctor Who came from. = Film adaptations =  1949 BBC teleplay  The first visual adaptation of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from Alexandra Palace on 25 January 1949 by the BBC, which starred Russell Napier as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book. 1960 film In 1960, the novella was made into an American science fiction film, also known promotionally as H.G. Wells's The Time Machine. The film starred Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux. The film was produced and directed by George Pal, who also filmed a 1953 version of Wells's The War of the Worlds. The film won an Academy Award for time-lapse photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly. In 1993, Rod Taylor hosted Time Machine: The Journey Back reuniting him with Alan Young and Whit Bissell, featuring the only sequel to Mr. Pal's classic film, written by the original screenwriter, David Duncan. In the special were Academy Award-winners special effect artists Wah Chang and Gene Warren. 1978 television film Sunn Classic Pictures produced a television film version of The Time Machine as a part of their \\"Classics Illustrated\\" series in 1978. It was a modernization of the Wells's story, making the Time Traveller a 1970s scientist working for a fictional US defence contractor, \\"the Mega Corporation\\". Dr. Neil Perry (John Beck), the Time Traveller, is described as one of Mega's most reliable contributors by his senior co-worker Branly (Whit Bissell, an alumnus of the 1960 adaptation). Perry's skill is demonstrated by his rapid reprogramming of an off-course missile, averting a disaster that could destroy Los Angeles. His reputation secures a grant of $20 million for his time machine project. Although nearing completion, the corporation wants Perry to put the project on hold so that he can head a military weapon development project. Perry accelerates work on the time machine, permitting him to test it before being forced to work on the new project. 2002 film The 1960 film was remade in 2002, starring Guy Pearce as the Time Traveller, a mechanical engineering professor named Alexander Hartdegen, Mark Addy as his colleague David Filby, Sienna Guillory as Alex's ill-fated fianc√©e Emma, Phyllida Law as Mrs. Watchit, and Jeremy Irons as the Uber-Morlock. Playing a quick cameo as a shopkeeper was Alan Young, who featured in the 1960 film. (H.G. Wells himself can also be said to have a \\"cameo\\" appearance, in the form of a photograph on the wall of Alex's home, near the front door.) The film was directed by Wells's great-grandson Simon Wells, with an even more revised plot that incorporated the ideas of paradoxes and changing the past. The place is changed from Richmond, Surrey, to downtown New York City, where the Time Traveller moves forward in time to find answers to his questions on 'Practical Application of Time Travel;' first in 2030 New York, to witness an orbital lunar catastrophe in 2037, before moving on to 802,701 for the main plot. He later briefly finds himself in 635,427,810 with toxic clouds and a world laid waste (presumably by the Morlocks) with devastation and Morlock artifacts stretching out to the horizon. It was met with mixed reviews and earned $56 million before VHS/DVD sales. The Time Machine used a design that was very reminiscent of the one in the Pal film but was much larger and employed polished turned brass construction, along with rotating glass reminiscent of the Fresnel lenses common to lighthouses. (In Wells's original book, the Time Traveller mentioned his 'scientific papers on optics'). Hartdegen becomes involved with a female Eloi named Mara, played by Samantha Mumba, who essentially takes the place of Weena, from the earlier versions of the story. In this film, the Eloi have, as a tradition, preserved a \\"stone language\\" that is identical to English. The Morlocks are much more barbaric and agile, and the Time Traveller has a direct impact on the plot. = Derivative work = Time After Time (1979 film) In Time After Time, H.G. Wells invents a time machine and shows it to some friends in a manner similar to the first part of the novella. He does not know that one of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which prevents the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 TV series of the same name. =Comics= Classics Illustrated was the first to adapt The Time Machine into a comic book format, issuing an American edition in July 1956. The Classics Illustrated version was published in French by Classiques Illustres in Dec 1957, and Classics Illustrated Strato Publications (Australian) in 1957, and Kuvitettuja Klassikkoja (a Finnish edition) in November 1957. There were also Classics Illustrated Greek editions in 1976, Swedish in 1987, German in 1992 and 2001, and a Canadian reprint of the English edition in 2008. In 1976, Marvel Comics published a new version of The Time Machine, as #2 in their Marvel Classics Comics series, with art by Alex Ni√±o. (This adaptation was originally published in 1973 by Pendulum Press as part of their Pendulum Now Age Classics series; it was colorized and reprinted by Marvel in 1976.) In 1977, Polish painter Waldemar Andrzejewski adapted the novel as a 22-page comic book, written in Polish by Antoni Wolski. From April 1990, Eternity Comics published a three-issue miniseries adaptation of The Time Machine, written by Bill Spangler and illustrated by John Ross ‚Äî this was collected as a trade paperback graphic novel in 1991. In 2018, US imprint Insight Comics published an adaptation of the novel, as part of their \\"H. G. Wells\\" series of comic books. Sequels by other authors Wells's novella has become one of the cornerstones of science-fiction literature. As a result, it has spawned many offspring. Works expanding on Wells's story include: * La Belle Valence by Th√©o Varlet and Andr√© Blandin (1923) in which a squadron of World War I soldiers find the Time Machine and are transported back to the Spanish town of Valencia in the 14th century. Translated by Brian Stableford as Timeslip Troopers (2012). * Die R√ºckkehr der Zeitmaschine (1946) by Egon Friedell was the first direct sequel. It dwells heavily on the technical details of the machine and the time-paradoxes it might cause when the time machine was used to visit the past. After visiting a futuristic 1995 where London is in the sky and the weather is created by companies, as well as the year 2123 where he meets two Egyptians who study history using intuition instead of actual science, the time traveler, who is given the name James MacMorton, travels to the past and ends up weeks before the time machine was built, causing it to disappear. He is forced to use the miniature version of his time machine, which already existed at that time, to send telegraphic messages through time to a friend (the author), instructing him to send him things that will allow him to build a new machine. After returning to the present, he tells his friend what happened. The 24,000-word German original was translated into English by Eddy C. Bertin in the 1940s and eventually published in paperback as The Return of the Time Machine (1972, DAW). *The Hertford Manuscript by Richard Cowper, first published in 1976. It features a \\"manuscript\\", which reports the Time Traveller's activities after the end of the original story. According to this manuscript, the Time Traveller disappeared, because his Time Machine had been damaged by the Morlocks without him knowing it. He only found out when it stopped operating during his next attempted time travel. He found himself on 27 August 1665, in London during the outbreak of the Great Plague of London. The rest of the novel is devoted to his efforts to repair the Time Machine and leave this time period before getting infected with the disease. He also has an encounter with Robert Hooke. He eventually dies of the disease on 20 September 1665. The story gives a list of subsequent owners of the manuscript until 1976. It also gives the name of the Time Traveller as Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18 June 1894. * The Space Machine by Christopher Priest, first published in 1976. Because of the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies, for a time machine to stay in one spot on Earth as it travels through time, it must also follow the Earth's trajectory through space. In Priest's book, a travelling salesman damages a Time Machine similar to the original, and arrives on Mars, just before the start of the invasion described in The War of the Worlds. H.G. Wells appears as a minor character. * Morlock Night by K. W. Jeter, first published in 1979. A steampunk fantasy novel in which the Morlocks, having studied the Traveller's machine, duplicate it and invade Victorian London. This culminates in Westminster Abbey being used as a butcher shop of human beings by the Morlocks in the 20th century, and a total disruption and collapse of the time stream. There the hero and Merlin must find ‚Äì and destroy ‚Äì the Time Machine, to restore the time stream and history. * Time Machine II by George Pal and Joe Morhaim, published in 1981. The Time Traveller, named George, and the pregnant Weena try to return to his time, but instead land in the London Blitz, dying during a bombing raid. Their newborn son is rescued by an American ambulance driver and grows up in the United States under the name Christopher Jones. Sought out by the lookalike son of James Filby, Jones goes to England to collect his inheritance, leading ultimately to George's journals, and the Time Machine's original plans. He builds his own machine with 1970s upgrades and seeks his parents in the future. Pal also worked on a detailed synopsis for a third sequel, which was partly filmed for a 1980s U.S. TV special on the making of Pal's film version of The Time Machine, using the original actors. This third sequel, the plot of which does not seem to fit with Pal's second, opens with the Time Traveller enjoying a happy life with Weena, in a future world in which the Morlocks have died out. He and his son return to save Filby in World War I. This act changes the future, causing the nuclear war not to happen. He and his son are thus cut off from Weena in the far future. The Time Traveller thus has to solve a dilemma ‚Äì allow his friend to die, and cause the later death of millions, or give up Weena forever. * The Man Who Loved Morlocks (1981) and The Truth about Weena (1998) are two different sequels, the former a novel and the latter a short story, by David J. Lake. Each of them concerns the Time Traveller's return to the future. In the former, he discovers that he cannot enter any period in time he has already visited, forcing him to travel into the further future, where he finds love with a woman whose race evolved from Morlock stock. In the latter, he is accompanied by Wells and succeeds in rescuing Weena and bringing her back to the 1890s, where her political ideas cause a peaceful revolution. * The Time Ships, by Stephen Baxter, first published in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original's publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller's desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted by the fact that he has changed history (by telling his tale to his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the multiverse as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind's far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many nods to the prehistory of Wells's story in the names of characters and chapters. * In \\"The Richmond Enigma\\" by John DeChancie, Sherlock Holmes investigates the disappearance of the Time Traveler, a contemporary and, in this story, a distant relative. The intervention of Holmes and Watson succeeds in calling back the missing Time Traveler, who has resolved to prevent the time machine's existence, out of concern for the danger it could make possible. The story appeared in Sherlock Holmes in Orbit (1995), John DeChancie, \\"The Richmond Enigma,\\" Sherlock Holmes in Orbit, DAW Books, New York: 1995 * The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel by Joe R. Lansdale, first published in The Long Ones (1999). In this story, the Time Traveller accidentally damages the space-time continuum and is transformed into the vampire-like Dark Rider. * The 2003 short story \\"On the Surface\\" by Robert J. Sawyer begins with this quote from the Wells original: \\"I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it [the time machine] to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose.\\" In the Sawyer story, the Morlocks develop a fleet of time machines and use them to conquer the same far future Wells depicted at the end of the original, by which time, because the sun has grown red and dim and thus no longer blinds them, they can reclaim the surface of the world. * The Time Traveller and his machine appear in the story Allan and the Sundered Veil by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, which acts as a prequel to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One. The Time Traveller shares an adventure with fellow literary icons Allan Quatermain, John Carter, and Randolph Carter. * David Haden's novelette The Time Machine: A Sequel (2010) is a direct sequel, picking up where the original finished. The Time Traveller goes back to rescue Weena but finds the Eloi less simple than he first imagined, and time travel far more complicated. * Simon Baxter's novel The British Empire: Psychic Battalions Against the Morlocks (2010) imagines a steampunk/cyberpunk future in which the British Empire has remained the dominant world force until the Morlocks arrive from the future. * Hal Colebatch's Time-Machine Troopers (2011) (Acashic Publishers) is twice the length of the original. In it, the Time Traveller returns to the future world about 18 years after the time he escaped from the Morlocks, taking with him Robert Baden-Powell, the real-world founder of the Boy Scout movement. They set out to teach the Eloi self- reliance and self-defence against the Morlocks, but the Morlocks capture them. H.G. Wells and Winston Churchill are also featured as characters. *Paul Schullery's The Time Traveller's Tale: Chronicle of a Morlock Captivity (2012) continues the story in the voice and manner of the original Wells book. After many years' absence, the Time Traveller returns and describes his further adventures. His attempts to mobilize the Eloi in their own defense against the Morlocks failed when he was captured by the Morlocks. Much of the book is occupied with his deeply unsettling discoveries about the Morlock / Eloi symbiosis, his gradual assimilation into Morlock society, and his ultimately successful attempt to discover the true cause of humanity's catastrophic transformation into two such tragic races. * The Great Illustrated Classics in 1992 published an adaptation of Wells's novella that adds an extra destination to the Time Traveller's adventure: Stopping in 2200 AD on his way back home, he becomes caught up in a civil war between factions of a technocratic society that was established to avert ecological catastrophe. * Beyond the Time Machine by Burt Libe (2002). The first of two Time Machine sequels written by American writer Burt Libe, it continues the story of the Time Traveller: where he finally settles down, including his rescue of Weena and his subsequent family with her. Highlighted are exploits of his daughters Narra and her younger sister Belinda; coping with their 33rd-Century existence; considering their unusual past and far-Future heritage. Doing some time travelling of their own, the daughters revisit 802,701 A.D., discovering that the so-called dual-specie Eloi and Morlock inhabitants actually are far more complex and complicated than their father's initial appraisal. * Tangles in Time by Burt Libe (2005). The second of two Time Machine sequels written by American writer Burt Libe, it continues the story of younger daughter Belinda, now grown at age 22. Her father (the original Time Traveller) has just died from old age, and she and Weena (her mother) now must decide what to do with the rest of their lives. Weena makes a very unusual decision, leaving Belinda to search for her own place in time. Also, with further time travel, she locates her two long-lost brothers, previously thought to be dead; she also meets and rescues a young man from the far future, finding herself involved in a very confusing relationship. The Time Traveller Although the Time Traveller's real name is never given in the original novella, other sources have named him: *The 1960 film named him H. George Wells, although he was only called George in dialogue. *In the 1978 telefilm version of the story, the Time Traveller (this time a modern-day American) is named Dr. Neil Perry. *H.G. Wells' great- grandson, Simon Wells, directed a 2002 remake where the Time Traveller's name is Alexander Hartdegen. *In The Time Ships, Stephen Baxter's sequel to The Time Machine, the Time Traveller encounters his younger self via time travel. His younger self reacts with embarrassment to his older self's knowledge of his real names: \\"I held up my hand; I had an inspiration. \\"No. I will use‚Äîif you will permit‚ÄîMoses.\\" He took a deep pull on his brandy, and gazed at me with genuine anger in his grey eyes. \\"How do you know about that?\\" Moses‚Äîmy hated first name, for which I had been endlessly tormented at school‚Äîand which I had kept a secret since leaving home!\\"Baxter, Stephen. The Time Ships (HarperPrism, 1995), p. 137. This is a reference to H.G. Wells's story \\"The Chronic Argonauts\\", the story which grew into The Time Machine, in which the inventor of the Time Machine is named Dr. Moses Nebogipfel; the surname of Wells's first inventor graces another character in Baxter's book (see above). *Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life by Philip Jos√© Farmer gives the Time Traveller's name as Bruce Clarke Wildman. *The Rook comic book series gives the Time Traveller's name as Adam Dane. *In the Doctor Who comic strip story \\"The Eternal Present\\", the character of Theophilus Tolliver is implied to be the Time Traveller of Wells's novella. Also featured in Doctor Who is Wells, himself, appearing in the television serial Timelash. The events of this story are portrayed as having inspired Wells to write The Time Machine. *In Episode 11, Season 1, of US television series Legends of Tomorrow the team travels back in time to the Old West in hopes to hide from the Time Masters. During their stay there the character Martin Stein saves a boy's life with modern medicine. After a fighting scene that reveals their whole team to be from the future, Martin Stein learns that the name of the boy he saved is Herbert George Wells. \\"You're H.G. Wells?\\" he asks him, the boy replies \\"H.G.Wells, I like that name\\", implying that they inspired the stories that he wrote and also the name he goes by. *The Hertford Manuscript by Richard Cowper names the Time Traveller as Dr. Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18 June 1894, and who was part of the same social and political circle as Wells ‚Äì in particular, the Fabian Society. *The Space Machine by Christopher Priest gives the Time Traveller's name as William Reynolds. *Sherlock Holmes & The Coils of Time by Ralph E. Vaughan gives the Time Traveller's name as Moesen Maddoc. *The I.C.E. role- playing game supplement Time Riders suggests that the Time Traveller's name is Ashleigh Holmes.

The group was founded by Tom Verlaine, Richard Lloyd, Billy Ficca, and Richard Hell. An early fixture of CBGB and the 1970s New York rock scene, the band is considered influential in the development of punk and alternative music. Although they recorded in a stripped-down, guitar-based manner similar to their punk contemporaries, Television's music was by comparison clean, improvisational, and technically proficient, drawing influence from avant- garde jazz and 1960s rock. The group's debut album, Marquee Moon, is often considered one of the defining releases of the post-punk era.  History  = Early history and formation = Television's roots can be traced to the teenage friendship between Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. The duo met at Sanford School in Hockessin, Delaware, from which they ran away. Both moved to New York, separately, in the early 1970s, aspiring to be poets. Their first group together was the Neon Boys, consisting of Verlaine on guitar and vocals, Hell on bass and vocals and Billy Ficca on drums. The group lasted from late 1972 to late 1973. A 7-inch record featuring \\"That's All I Know (Right Now)\\" and \\"Love Comes in Spurts\\" was released in 1980. In late 1973 the group reformed, calling themselves Television and recruiting Richard Lloyd as a second guitarist. Their first gig was at the Townhouse Theatre, on March 2, 1974. Their manager, Terry Ork, persuaded CBGB owner Hilly Kristal to give the band a regular gig at his club, where they reportedly constructed their first stage. After playing several gigs at CBGB in early 1974, they played at Max's Kansas City and other clubs, returning to CBGB in January 1975, where they established a significant cult following. = Departure of Richard Hell and debut release = Initially, songwriting was split almost evenly between Hell and Verlaine, Lloyd being an infrequent contributor as well. However, friction began to develop as Verlaine, Lloyd, and Ficca became increasingly confident and adept with both instruments and composition, while Hell remained defiantly untrained in his approach. Verlaine, feeling that Hell's frenzied onstage demeanor was upstaging his songs, reportedly told him to \\"stop jumping around\\" during the songs and occasionally refused to play Hell's songs, such as \\"Blank Generation\\", in concert. This conflict, as well as one of their songs being picked up by Island Records, led Hell to leave the group and take some of his songs with him. He co-founded the Heartbreakers in 1975 with former New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan, later forming Richard Hell and the Voidoids. Fred Smith, briefly of Blondie, replaced Hell as Television's bassist. Television made their vinyl debut in 1975 with \\"Little Johnny Jewel\\" (Parts One and Two), a 7-inch single on the independent label Ork Records, owned by their manager, Terry Ork. Richard Lloyd apparently disagreed with the selection of this song, preferring \\"O Mi Amore\\" for their debut, to the extent that he seriously considered leaving the band. Reportedly Pere Ubu guitarist Peter Laughner auditioned for his spot during this time. = Marquee Moon, Adventure and break-up (1977‚Äì78) = Television's first album, Marquee Moon, was received positively by music critics and audiences and entered the Billboard 200 albums chart ‚Äì it also sold well in Europe and reached the Top 30 in many countries there. Upon its initial release in 1977, Roy Trakin wrote in the SoHo Weekly \\"forget everything you've heard about Television, forget punk, forget New York, forget CBGB's ... hell, forget rock and roll‚Äîthis is the real item.\\" Critics have since ranked the album number 83 on cable music channel VH1's 2000 list of the 100 Greatest Albums of Rock and Roll and number 128 on Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was ranked number two in Uncut magazine's \\"100 Greatest Debut Records\\" and number 3 on Pitchfork Media's list of the best albums of the 1970s. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes that the album was \\"revolutionary\\" and composed \\"entirely of tense garage rockers that spiral into heady intellectual territory, which is achieved through the group's long, interweaving instrumental sections.\\" Television's second album, Adventure, was recorded and released in 1978. Softer and more reflective than their debut album, Adventure was well received by critics despite modest sales. The members' independent and strongly held artistic visions, along with Richard Lloyd's drug abuse, led to the band's break-up in July 1978. Both Lloyd and Verlaine pursued solo careers, while Ficca became the drummer for the new wave band The Waitresses. = Reformation (1992‚Äìpresent) = Television reformed in 1992, released a self-titled third album and have performed live sporadically thereafter. Since being wooed back on stage together for the 2001 All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands, England, they've played a number of dates around the world and continue to perform on an irregular basis. In 2007, Richard Lloyd announced he would be amicably leaving the band after a midsummer show in New York City's Central Park. Due to an extended hospital stay recovering from pneumonia, he was unable to make the Central Park concert. Jimmy Rip substituted for him that day and was subsequently asked to join the band full- time in Lloyd's place. On July 7, 2011, the new lineup performed at the Beco 203 music festival in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In an MTV Brazil Television interview, the band confirmed that an album with about ten new tracks was close to being finished, but as of 2020, that album has not surfaced.  Musical style and influences  As with many emerging punk bands, the Velvet Underground was a strong influence. Television also drew inspiration from minimalist composers such as Steve Reich. Tom Verlaine has often cited the influence of surf bands the Ventures and Dick Dale to Television's approach to the guitar, and he has also expressed a fondness for the bands Love and Buffalo Springfield, two groups noted for their dual-guitar interplay. Television's ties to punk were underscored by their late '60s garage rock leanings, as the band often covered the Count Five's \\"Psychotic Reaction\\" and the 13th Floor Elevators' \\"Fire Engine\\" in concert. Lester Bangs heard in Television's music the influence of Quicksilver Messenger Service, noting a similarity between Verlaine's guitar playing and John Cipollina's. Tom Verlaine has downplayed the comparison, citing the Ventures as a more apt reference point. Though Verlaine and Lloyd were nominally \\"rhythm\\" and \\"lead\\" guitarists, they often rendered such labels obsolete by crafting interlocking parts, where the ostensible rhythm role could be as intriguing as the lead. Al Handa writes, \\"In Television's case, Lloyd was the guitarist who affected the tonality of the music more often than not, and Verlaine and the rhythm section the ones who gave the ear its anchor and familiar musical elements. Listen only to Lloyd, and you can hear some truly off the wall ideas being played.\\" The opening of the song \\"Marquee Moon\\" from the album of the same name displays the band's characteristic interlocking melodic and rhythmic guitar lines.

For example, in North America, \\"channel 2\\" refers to the terrestrial or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable- distributed channels depending on the location and service provider Depending on the multinational bandplan for a given regional n, analog television channels are typically 6, 7, or 8 MHz in bandwidth, and therefore television channel frequencies vary as well. Channel numbering is also different. Digital terrestrial television channels are the same as their analog predecessors for legacy reasons, however through multiplexing, each physical radio frequency (RF) channel can carry several digital subchannels. On satellites, each transponder normally carries one channel, however multiple small, independent channels can be on one transponder, with some loss of bandwidth due to the need for guard bands between unrelated transmissions. ISDB, used in Japan and Brazil, has a similar segmented mode. Preventing interference between terrestrial channels in the same area is accomplished by skipping at least one channel between two analog stations' frequency allocations. Where channel numbers are sequential, frequencies are not contiguous, such as channel 6 to 7 skip from VHF low to high band, and channel 13 to 14 jump to UHF. On cable TV, it is possible to use adjacent channels only because they are all at the same power, something which could only be done terrestrially if the two stations were transmitted at the same power and height from the same location. For DTT, selectivity is inherently better, therefore channels adjacent (either to analog or digital stations) can be used even in the same area. Other meanings Commonly, the term \\"television channel\\" is used to mean a television station or its pay television counterpart (both outlined below). Sometimes, especially outside the U.S. and in the context of pay television, it is used instead of the term television network, which otherwise (in its technical use above) describes a group of geographically-distributed television stations that share affiliation/ownership and some or all of their programming with one another. This terminology may be muddled somewhat in other jurisdictions, for instance Europe, where terrestrial channels are commonly mapped from physical channels to common numerical positions (i.e. BBC One does not broadcast on any particular \\"channel 1\\" but is nonetheless mapped to the \\"1\\" input on most British television sets). On digital platforms, such (location) channels are usually arbitrary and changeable, due to virtual channels. =Television station= A television station is a type of terrestrial station that broadcasts both audio and video to television receivers in a particular area. Traditionally, TV stations made their broadcasts by sending specially-encoded radio signals over the air, called terrestrial television. Individual television stations are usually granted licenses by a government agency to use a particular section of the radio spectrum (a channel) through which they send their signals. Some stations use LPTV broadcast translators to retransmit to further areas. Many television stations are now in the process of converting from analogue terrestrial (NTSC, PAL or SECAM) broadcast, to digital terrestrial (ATSC broadcast, DVB or ISDB). =Non-terrestrial television channels= Because some regions have had difficulty picking up terrestrial television signals (particularly in mountainous areas), alternative means of distribution such as direct-to-home satellite and cable television have been introduced. Television channels specifically built to run on cable or satellite blur the line between TV station and TV network. That fact led some early cable channels to call themselves superstations. Satellite and cable have created changes. Local programming TV stations in an area can sign-up or even be required to be carried on cable, but content providers like TLC cannot. They are not licensed to run broadcast equipment like a station, and they do not regularly provide content to licensed broadcasters either. Furthermore, a distributor like TNT may start producing its own programming, and shows presented exclusively on pay-TV by one distributor may be syndicated to terrestrial stations. The cost of creating a nationwide channel has been reduced and there has been a huge increase in the number of such channels, with most catering to a small group. See also: significantly viewed. From the definitions above, use of the terms \\"network\\" or \\"station\\" in reference to nationwide cable or satellite channels is technically inaccurate. However, this is an arbitrary, inconsequential distinction, and varies from company to company. Indeed, the term \\"cable network\\" has entered into common usage in the United States in reference to such channels, even with the existence of direct broadcast satellite. There is even some geographical separation among \\"national\\" pay television channels in the U.S., be it programming (e.g., the Fox Sports group of regional sports channels, which share several programs), or simply regionalized advertising inserted by the local cable company. Should a legal distinction be necessary between a (location) channel as defined above and a television channel in this sense, the terms \\"programming service\\" (e.g.) or \\"programming undertaking\\" (for instance,) may be used instead of the latter definition.

The first series, broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951, was titled Crazy People; subsequent series had the title The Goon Show. The show's chief creator and main writer was Spike Milligan. The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop, many of which were reused by other shows for decades. Many elements of the show satirised contemporary life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and film. The show was released internationally through the BBC Transcription Services (TS). It was heard regularly from the 1950s in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Canada, although these TS versions were frequently edited to avoid controversial subjects. In the United States, NBC began broadcasting the programme on its radio network from the mid-1950s. Subversive and absurdist, The Goon Show exercised a considerable influence on the development of British and American comedy and popular culture. It was cited as a major influence by the Beatles, the American comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre,:4,5,61 and the British comedy troupe Monty Python.Chapman, G., Cleese, J., Gilliam, T., Idle, E., Jones, T., & Palin, M. (2004). Edited by Bob McCabe. The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons. London: Orion. Chapman's posthumous input via collateral sources. ; Background The series was devised and written by Spike Milligan with the regular collaboration of other writers including Larry Stephens (contributing to around 140 episodes), Eric Sykes (who co-wrote most of the episodes in Series 5), Maurice Wiltshire and John Antrobus, initially under the supervision of Jimmy Grafton. Milligan and Harry Secombe became friends while serving in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first encountered Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe was sitting in a small wireless truck: \\"Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, and in the middle of it all the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody see a gun?' It was Milligan.\\" Secombe's answer to that question was \\"What colour was it?\\" Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.:20 The group first formed at Jimmy Grafton's London public house called \\"Grafton's\\" in the late 1940s.There is some confusion in the literature about the actual name of the pub (e.g. Scudamore 1985, McCann 2006). It was \\"Grafton's\\" according to The Goon Show Companion, Wilmot/Grafton, not the \\"Grafton Arms\\" Sellers had already d√©buted with the BBC, Secombe was often heard on Variety Bandbox, Milligan was writing for and acting in the high-profile BBC show Hip-Hip-Hoo-Roy with Derek Roy, and Michael Bentine, who appeared in the first series, had just begun appearing in Charlie Chester's peak-time radio show Stand Easy. The four clicked immediately. \\"It was always a relief to get away from the theatre and join in the revels at Grafton's on a Sunday night,\\" said Secombe years later.Artists and Raspberries, Pan; 1997. P72 They took to calling themselves \\"The Goons\\" and started recording their pub goings-on with a Pickersgill aluminium disk recorder. The BBC producer, Pat Dixon heard a tape and took interest in the group. He pressed the BBC for a long term contract for the gang, knowing that it would secure Sellers for more than just seasonal work, something for which the BBC had been aiming. The BBC acquiesced and ordered an initial series, though without much enthusiasm. The series had its premiere in May 1951 and audience figures grew rapidly, from around 370,000 to nearly two million by the end of the 17th show. No recordings of any episode of this series are known to have survived. The BBC commissioned a second series and a number of other changes occurred. The musical interludes were shortened, and Max Geldray joined the lineup. Peter Eton, from the BBC's drama department, replaced Dennis Main Wilson as producer. Eton brought stricter discipline to the show's production. He was also an expert at sound effects and microphone technique, ensuring that the show became a far more dynamic listening experience. However, a few episodes into the series Milligan suffered a major nervous breakdown. He was hospitalised in early December 1952,:136-139 just before the broadcast of episode five, but it, and the following episode, had already been written, and the next 12 episodes were co-written by Stephens and Grafton. Milligan was absent as a performer for about two months, returning for episode 17, broadcast in early March 1953. As with Series 2, all episodes were co- written by Milligan and Stephens and edited by Jimmy Grafton. Bentine left the show at the end of series 2, citing a desire to pursue solo projects, although there had been an increasing degree of creative tension between him and Milligan.There are three or four versions of this story regarding the split. Jimmy Grafton's account is in The Goon Show Companion p.39; Secombe's account is in Arias and Raspberries p.208; Milligan's account changed over the years and the bitterness shows in the interview Now That's Funny p.16; and Bentine's account is in The Story of the Goons p.30 and also in his autobiography \\"The Reluctant Jester\\" (1992), p.321 of the paperback edition. Milligan blamed his breakdown and the collapse of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required. (a)p.13 His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. \\"owing to the complexities of the technical side, the BBC were wanting the scripts delivered earlier and earlier - so that the boffins in the electronics department etc. could experiment with the new noises\\" (e)pp.205-206 All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series. \\"Writing the third season of The Goon Show in 1952, he suffered a relapse. 'I went into a psychiatric home and even while I was there I kept on writing these bloody shows. I had a wife and two kids to support, you see. That was the bottom line.' Inside, he had a full manic episode, including a hallucination that a lion was sitting on the wardrobe.\\" The BBC however made sure he was surrounded by accomplished radio comedy writers ‚Äî Sykes, Stephens, Antrobus, Wiltshire, and Grafton ‚Äî so many of the problems caused by his ill health were skilfully covered over by composite scripts. Many senior BBC staff were variously bemused and befuddled by the show's surreal humour and it has been reported that senior programme executives erroneously referred to it as The Go On Show or even The Coon Show. The show's title was inspired, according to Spike Milligan, by Alice the Goon, a character from the Popeye comic. Alternative Several of the Goons' nonsense songs were recorded in the late 1950s such as the \\"Ying Tong Song\\", number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1956. The radio show had high audience ratings in Britain at its peak; tickets for the recording sessions at the BBC's Camden Theatre (now known as KOKO) in London were constantly over-subscribed and the various character voices and catchphrases from the show quickly became part of the vernacular. The series has remained consistently popular ever since, with the show being broadcast weekly by Australia's ABC network as late as 2012. The show is also broadcast upon BBC Radio 4 Extra. The blue plaque from the old Camden Theatre, now Koko, the site of the recording of The Last Goon Show of All. The scripts exist mostly in fan-transcribed versions via dedicated websites. Although three booksMilligan, Spike. (1973) The Goon Show Scripts. London: SphereMilligan, Spike. (1987) The Lost Goon Shows. London: Robson were published containing selected scripts, they are out of print, and typically available only in libraries or second- hand. Some more recent biographical books contain selected scripts. There were 10 series in total, plus an additional series called Vintage Goons, recorded at the same time as the eighth series, which featured recordings of redevelopments (by Milligan) of short sketches from early shows which had not been recorded by transcription services. The first series had 17 episodes plus one special, Cinderella (1951); the second series had 25 episodes, (1952); the third series had 25 episodes plus one special - The Coronation Special (1952‚Äì53); the fourth series had 30 episodes plus one special, Archie In Goonland (1953‚Äì54); the fifth series had 26 episodes plus one special - The Starlings (1954‚Äì55); the sixth series had 27 episodes plus three specials, (1955‚Äì56); the seventh series had 25 episodes plus two specials, (1956‚Äì57); the eighth series had 26 episodes, (1957‚Äì58); the Vintage Goons were re- performances of 14 episodes from series four; the ninth series had 17 episodes, (1958‚Äì59); and the tenth series had six episodes, (1959‚Äì1960). Format Throughout its history, each episode of The Goon Show, which usually ran just under 30 minutes, was essentially structured as a comedy- variety programme, consisting of scripted comedy segments alternating with musical interludes. The first two series were mostly produced by Dennis Main Wilson; none of the episodes was given an individual title and these early shows were loosely structured and consisted of four or five unconnected sketches, separated by musical items. According to later producer Peter Eton, the musical segments took up around half the programme.:113 In this formative phase the show co-starred Milligan (who played only minor roles in the early shows), Sellers, Secombe and Michael Bentine as the nominal 'hero' of each episode, madcap inventor Dr Osric Pureheart.:124 Musical performances were by virtuoso jazz harmonica player Max Geldray, singer Ray Ellington and his quartet (both of whom were recruited by Dixon) and vocal group the Stargazers, but they left after Episode 6 of Series 2, and for the remaining episodes Secombe filled in, singing a straight vocal number.:124 Incidental, theme and backing music was provided by Stanley Black and the BBC Dance Orchestra.:127 Series 2 also saw the first appearances of popular characters Minnie Bannister (Milligan) and Henry Crun (Sellers). From Series 3, The Goon Show (as it was now officially titled) gradually settled into its 'classic' format. Milligan, Stephens and Grafton began to work within a narrative structure and by the second half of Series 4 each episode typically consisted of three acts linked by a continuing plot,:143 with Geldray performing between Acts I and II and Ellington between Acts II and III. Almost all the principal and occasional characters were now performed by Milligan and Sellers, with Secombe usually playing only Neddie Seagoon, who had replaced Pureheart as the hero of most of the stories. The closing theme, backing for Geldray and incidental music was now provided by a big band of freelance musicians under the direction of Wally Stott, who had been writing for the show since the first series.:127 After the end of Series 3, original announcer Andrew Timothy was replaced (at the suggestion of John Snagge) by Wallace Greenslade,:127 who provided spoken narrative links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts. From Series 3 onwards, the principal character roles were: *Neddie Seagoon (Secombe) *Eccles (Milligan) *Bluebottle (Sellers) *Henry Crun (Sellers) *Minnie Bannister (Milligan) *Hercules Grytpype-Thynne (Sellers) *Count Jim Moriarty (Milligan) *Major Denis Bloodnok (Sellers) Secondary characters were the \\"Indians\\", Banerjee and Lalkaka, the servant Abdul/Singez Thingz, Willium \\"Mate\\" Cobblers, Cyril, Jim Spriggs, Little Jim, Flowerdew and Chief Ellinga/The Red Bladder - both played by Ray Ellington. There were also occasional guest stars including senior BBC announcer John Snagge, and actors Valentine Dyall, Dick Emery, Kenneth Connor, Dennis Price and Bernard Miles. The traditional plots involved Grytpype-Thynne and Moriarty getting Neddie Seagoon involved in some far-fetched plan, and meeting the other cast members along the way. Many characters had regular catchphrases which quickly moved into the vernacular; among the best known are: * \\"He's fallen in the water!\\" (Little Jim) * \\"You dirty, rotten swine, you! You have deaded me!\\" (Bluebottle) * \\"You can't get the wood, you know.\\" (Henry, Minnie) * \\"You silly, twisted boy, you.\\" (Grytpype-Thynne) * \\"You can't park 'ere, mate\\" (Willium) ‚Äì Milligan's dig at officious BBC commissionaires. * \\"Ying Tong Iddle I Po\\" (various) ‚Äì which became the basis for a novelty hit as \\"Ying Tong Song\\" =Surrealism= The Goon Show has been variously described as \\"avant- garde\\", \\"surrealist\\", \\"abstract\\", and \\"four dimensional\\". The show played games with the medium of radio itself. Whole scenes were written in which characters would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, but it would be another character who had left the room. That character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.This example is from \\"Tales of Montmartre\\", 18th episode of the 6th series. The show paved the way for surreal and alternative humour, as acknowledged by comedians such as Eddie Izzard.:vii The surreality was part of the attraction for Sellers, and this exacerbated his mental instability especially during the third series. Many of the sequences have been cited as being visionary in the way that they challenged the traditional conventions of comedy. In the Pythons' autobiography, Terry Jones states \\"The Goons of course were my favourite. It was the surreality of the imagery and the speed of the comedy that I loved - the way they broke up the conventions of radio and played with the very nature of the medium.\\" This is reiterated by Michael Palin and John Cleese. Cleese recalls listening to The Goon Show as a teenager in the mid-1950s \\"and being absolutely amazed by its surreal humour. It came at a key stage in my own development and I never missed a show\\". =Music and sound effects= Orchestral introductions, links and accompaniment were provided by a hand- picked big band made up of London-based session musicians. The arrangements and musical direction were done by Wally Stott from the third to the 10th series. Stott produced many arrangements and link passages, further improved by the first-class sound quality the BBC engineers managed to achieve. Members of the band featured prominently in the comedy proceedings, particularly jazz trombonist George Chisholm who frequently played Scots characters. The show's concluding music was usually either \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" or a truncated and ironic rendition of the Alte Kameraden (Old Comrades') march, followed by Max Geldray and the Ray Ellington Quartet playing \\"Crazy Rhythm\\" as play-out music. In keeping with the variety requirements of the BBC's \\"light entertainment\\" format, The Goon Show scripts were structured in three acts, separated by two musical interludes. These were provided by the Ray Ellington Quartet ‚Äì who performed a mixture of jazz, rhythm & blues and calypso songs ‚Äì and by harmonica virtuoso Max Geldray who performed mostly middle of the road numbers and jazz standards of the 30s and 40s accompanied by the big band. Both Ellington and Geldray also made occasional cameo appearances; Ellington was often drafted in to play stereotypical \\"black\\" roles such as a tribal chieftain, native bearer or Major Bloodnok's nemesis (and counterpoint to Bloodnok's affliction) \\"The Red Bladder\\". It was in its use of pre-recorded and live sound effects that The Goon Show broke the most new ground. Part of the problem was that \\"not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head ‚Äì he just knew when it had not yet happened\\".:205 An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard ‚Äì which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled \\"Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone.\\" One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking (\\"So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!\\").:205Harry Secombe, in Ventham (2002) p.19. The socks-filled-with-custard story has been frequently cited since at least the 1970s, when it was reiterated in newspaper articles Secombe noted that \\"Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each ‚Äì chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens ‚Äì all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects.\\" An FX instruction in one script read \\"Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do\\". Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.:205 Milligan's relationship with BBC managers preparing for the recording of episodes was often acrimonious and resulted in rows, and Milligan later agreed that he was a diva during this time, adding \\"I was trying to shake the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were a knock on the door and tramps on gravel‚Äì that was it, and I tried to transform it.\\". Many of the sound effects created for later programmes featured innovative production techniques borrowed from the realm of musique concr√®te, and using the then new technology of magnetic tape. Many of these sequences involved the use of complex multiple edits, echo and reverberation and the deliberate slowing down, speeding up or reversing of tapes. One of the most famous was the legendary \\"Bloodnok's Stomach\\" sound effect, created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to represent the sound of Major Bloodnok's digestive system in action, which included a variety of inexplicable gurgling and explosive noises. Lewis (1995, p. 218) states Bloodnok's stomach \\"was achieved by overlaying burps, whoops from oscillators, water splashes, cork-like pops, and light artillery blasts\\".

Several of the words and phrases invented for the show soon entered common usage, the most famous being the word lurgi. In the episode \\"Lurgi Strikes Britain\\", Spike Milligan introduced the fictional malady of Lurgi (sometimes spelled Lurgy), which has survived into modern usage to mean the common cold, or any miscellaneous or non-specific illness (often preceded by the adjective \\"dreaded\\"). The symptoms of Lurgi included the uncontrollable urge to cry \\"Eeeeyack-a-boo\\", though even during the episode the ailment proved to be an extortionate attempt to sell brass band musical instruments. Milligan was later to make up his own definition in Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan, where Jim Hawkins' mother describes it as \\"like brown spots of shit on the liver\\". =Brandyyy!= Alcohol was strictly forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk in turn was fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase \\"round the back for the old brandy!\\" or \\"the old Marlon Brando\\" was used to announce the exit of one or more characters, or a break for music. In \\"The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy\\" (Series 9, Episode 4), Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, \\"I wonder where he keeps that stuff!\\". In \\"The Scarlet Capsule\\" (Series 9, Episode 14), Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of \\"Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there\\" was \\"The introductions he gives me...\\". In \\"The Moon Show\\" (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating \\"Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!\\", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail \\"MATE!\\" in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing. =Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb!= During radio programmes of the 1920s and 1930s, the background noise for crowd scenes was often achieved by a moderately large group of people mumbling \\"rhubarb\\" under their breath with random inflections. This was often parodied by Milligan, who would try to get the same effect with only three or four people, clearly intoning the word rather than mumbling. After some time, Secombe began throwing in \\"custard\\" during these scenes (for example, in \\"The Fear of Wages and Wings Over Dagenham\\", where the phrase was amended to 'flying rhubarb'). =Raspberry blowing= As well as being used as a comic device randomly inserted into different sketches to avoid silence, the blowing of raspberries entered the Goons as Harry Secombe's signal to the other actors that he was going to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter. In the Goons' musical recording \\"The Ying-Tong Song\\", Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone. Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title \\"Donkey\\" on the label. Approximating possibly the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show \\"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\\" as a sound to accompany an oyster opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts. This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke. Examples include The Last Goon Show of All during which Neddie shouts old jokes into a fuel tank in order to \\"start the show\\". Years later, Milligan collaborated with Ronnie Barker on The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town in which the credits read, \\"Raspberries professionally blown by Spike Milligan\\". David Jason has also claimed to have produced the sound effect and indeed was credited with this in the second segment of Ronnie Barker's LWT series Six Dates with Barker (1971). =\\"Trapped in a piano\\"= In several shows, one character, typically either Henry Crun or Minnie Bannister, would be found trapped in a piano. In The Mystery of the Fake Neddie Seagoon, Crun was inside a piano and his speech was accompanied by suitable piano noises. In The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI, Moriarty is hiding in a piano disguised as one of the strings. Gritpype-Thynne plays a \\"do-re-mi\\" scale to find him - Moriarty is \\"me\\". The \\"in a piano\\" joke was re-used one last time in The Last Goon Show of All. =Other references= Sometimes characters were introduced as \\"scion of the house of Rowton\\", or \\"member of Rowton House\\". This was a reference to the \\"Rowton Houses\\", which were hostels for working men in London. Films The following films were a product of Goon activity: *Let's Go Crazy (1951) *Penny Points to Paradise (1951) *Down Among the Z Men (1952) (with Bentine) *The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn (1956) A two-reeler starring Milligan, Sellers and Dick Emery *The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film (1959) A surreal one-reeler short subject starring Milligan and Sellers and directed by Dick Lester  Later revivals  =Books= Spike Milligan teamed up with illustrator Pete Clarke to produce two books of comic strip Goons. The stories were slightly modified versions of classic Goon shows. *The Goon Cartoons (1982) \\"The Last Goon Show of All\\", \\"The Affair of the Lone Banana\\", \\"The Scarlet Capsule\\", \\"The Pevensey Bay Disaster\\" *More Goon Cartoons (1983) \\"The Case of the Vanishing Room\\", \\"The Case of the Missing C.D.

A brief moment from that recreation is seen in the trailer for that film. =Stage= *Ying Tong: A Walk with the Goons Ying Tong is a play written by Roy Smiles which is set partly in a radio studio, partly in a mental asylum and partly in Spike Milligan's mind. It recreates the Goons recording the show, but part way through Spike has a mental breakdown and is committed to an asylum. While it features all of the Goons throughout (although Bentine is mentioned, the fourth character represents Wallace Greenslade), the focus is on Milligan and his breakdown. *Birmingham Comedy Festival Birmingham Comedy Festival produced a theatre production as part of their festival in 2014 staging two Milligan Goon Show scripts, The Canal and The Phantom Head Shaver (of Brighton).Laws, Roz. \\"Birmingham Comedy Festival gets under way with a recreation of The Goon Show\\", Birmingham Mail, 26 September 2014. Retrieved on 24 April. The festival produced a second touring production in 2017 featuring two more Milligan scripts, The House Of Teeth and The Jet Propelled Guided NAAFI.Sutherland, Gill. \\"The Goons come to Stratford\\", Stratford-Upon-Herald, 8 February 2017. Retrieved on 24 April. Both runs were sanctioned by Norma Farnes and Spike Milligan Productions. *Apollo Theatre Company Touring in late 2018 in the UK, Apollo Theatre Company in conjunction with Spike Milligan Productions recreated three episodes of The Goon Show - The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler, Tails of Men's Shirts, and The Phantom Head Shaver - with recreations of the original scripts. Co-producer Norma Farnes, Milligan‚Äôs ex-manager, agreed to the use of the material on the basis the production was respectful of the scripts. The roles of Sellers, Milligan, and Secombe were played by Julian McDowell, Colin Elmer and Clive Greenwood and the production was directed by McDowell and Tim Astley. =Radio and television= *The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d (TV, 1956) and The Idiot Weekly (radio, 1958‚Äì1962) The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d, which starred Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate Goon Show humour to television. Made for Associated-Rediffusion during 1956 and only broadcast in the London area, it was mainly written by Milligan, with contributions from other writers in the Associated London Scripts cooperative including Dave Freeman and Terry Nation, with Eric Sykes as script editor. The Idiot Weekly (1958‚Äì1962) was an Australian radio comedy series written by and starring Milligan with an Australian supporting cast including Ray Barrett and John Bluthal. It was made for the ABC during Milligan's numerous visits to Australia, where his family had emigrated. Milligan adapted some Goon Show scripts and included his Goon Show characters (notably Eccles) in many episodes. Six episodes of The Idiot Weekly were remade by the BBC as The Omar Khayyam Show in 1963. *The Telegoons (1963‚Äì1964) The Telegoons (1963‚Äì1964) was a 15-minute BBC puppet show featuring the voices of Milligan, Secombe and Sellers and adapted from the radio scripts. 26 episodes were made. The series was briefly repeated immediately after its original run, and all episodes are known to survive, having been unofficially released online. *The Goon Show - The Whistling Spy Enigma (Secombe & Friends) (1966) Recorded for Harry Secombe's six-part comedy series, of which only a portion was actually used for the original broadcast, this was similar to Tales of Men's Shirts as a re- enactment of a radio play for television. Whilst initially it was thought that only the portion used in the TV show survived, a full copy of the performance was found by the British Film Institute. *The Goon Show - Tales of Men's Shirts (1968) Essentially a re-enactment of a radio performance, the three Goons were joined by John Cleese as announcer for a special shown on Thames Television. An almost-complete copy of this broadcast is held by the British Film Institute. *The Last Goon Show of All (1972) In 1972, the Goons reunited to perform The Last Goon Show of All *Goon Again (2001) In 2001, the BBC recorded a \\"new\\" Goon Show, Goon Again, featuring Andy Secombe (son of Harry), Jon Glover and Jeffrey Holland, with Christopher Timothy (son of Andrew Timothy) announcing and Lance Ellington (son of Ray Ellington) singing, based on two lost series 3 episodes from 1953, The Story of Civilisation and The Plymouth Ho Armada, both written by Milligan and Stephens. =Records= The Goons made a number of records including \\"I'm Walking Backwards for Christmas\\" (originally sung by Milligan in the show to fill in during a musicians' strike), and \\"Bloodnok's Rock and Roll Call\\", the B-side of which, the \\"Ying Tong Song\\", soon became more popular and was reissued as an A-side in the mid-1970s, becoming a surprise novelty hit. The last time all three Goons worked together was in 1978 when they recorded two new songs, \\"The Raspberry Song\\" and \\"Rhymes\\". *Bridge on the River Wye (Parlophone 1962) A 1962 comedy LP with Milligan and Sellers as well as Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller. A spoof of the film The Bridge on the River Kwai, it was originally recorded under that name. However, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Thus some clever editing of the recording by future Beatles producer George Martin removed the K every time the word Kwai was uttered, creating Bridge on the River Wye. The LP is based on The Goon Shows African Incident (30 December 1957),:183 which featured Sellers' vocal impersonation of Alec Guinness. Lewis' (1995, pp. 205‚Äì206) gives a good account of this background. *How to Win an Election (1964) In 1964, Milligan, Secombe and Sellers lent their voices to a comedy LP, How to Win an Election (or Not Lose by Much), which was written by Leslie Bricusse. It was not exactly a Goons reunion because Sellers was in Hollywood and had to record his lines separately. The album was reissued on CD in 1997. Impact on comedy and culture In George Perry's book The Life of Python (1999) he comments: \\"In the Britain of 1950, humour was derived from three main sources: print, film and radio, and despite the advent of television, throughout the 1950s radio remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy. In this period, two radio comedy shows exercised a profound influence. The first was Take It From Here, with its polished professionalism. The other was The Goon Show, with its absurdity, manic surreality and unpredictability.\\" On the influence of The Goons, Eric Sykes wrote that in the post-World War II years, \\"other shows came along but 'The House of Comedy' needed electricity. Then, out of the blue ... The Goons ...Spike Milligan simply blew the roof off, and lit the whole place with sunshine. At a cursory glance, The Goon Show was merely quick-fire delivery of extremely funny lines mouthed by eccentric characters, but this was only the froth. In The Goon Show, Spike was unknowingly portraying every facet of the British psyche\\". p.137 Sykes and Milligan, along with Ray Galton, Alan Simpson, Frankie Howerd and Stanley (\\"Scruffy\\") Dale, co-founded the writers' cooperative Associated London Scripts (ALS), which over time included others including Larry Stephens. In his book Spike & Co, Graham McCann says \\"the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show...would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Young Ones, Vic Reeves Big Night Out, The League of Gentlemen, Brass Eye and countless other strange and bold new comedies\\". Other ALS- related comedies such as Sykes and A..., Hancock's Half Hour, Steptoe and Son, Beyond Our Ken, and Round The Horne influenced their own genres of comedy.:344‚Äì345 Eddie Izzard notes that the Goons and Milligan in particular \\"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'.\\":vii John Cleese notes that \\"In comedy, there are a very small number of defining moments when somebody comes along and genuinely creates a breakthrough, takes us into territory where nobody has been before. The only experiences to which I can compare my own discovery of the Goons are going to see N. F. Simpson's play One Way Pendulum ... or, later on, hearing Peter Cook for the first time. They were just light years ahead of everyone else.\\":151 =The Beatles= The Goons made a considerable impact on the humour of the Beatles, especially John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book The Goon Show Scripts for The New York Times. He wrote: \\"I was 12 when The Goon Show first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof that the world was insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called The Daily Howl. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to The Goon Show.\\" Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers. In a discussion of an accidentally Goonish nature, about introducing the next song during the 1963 BBC production of Pop Go The Beatles, Lennon is also recorded as quipping \\"Love these Goon shows\\". This was included in the double album and CD titled Live at the BBC (side 4, track 10 of the LP; track 62 of CD). =Firesign Theatre= The NBC radio network broadcast the programme in the United States in the mid-1950s. In 1965, Peter Bergman met and befriended Milligan during the time he worked in England on the BBC television program Not So Much a Program, More a Way of Life. He also saw the Beatles in concert, which gave him the inspiration to form a four-man comedy group. When he returned to the US the next year to host the radio show Radio Free Oz on KPFK-FM in Los Angeles, he teamed with Philip Proctor, Phil Austin, and David Ossman to form the Firesign Theatre. Proctor, Austin, and Ossman were big fans of the Monitor broadcasts of the Goon Show. According to Ossman: =Monty Python= Among the influences on Monty Python, the members of the comedy team are described as being \\"indebted to BBC radio comedy, and particularly to the Goon Show.\\" The future members of Monty Python were fans, and on many occasions they expressed their collective debt to Milligan and The Goons. Scudamore cites an interview for example, in which John Cleese stated \\"the Goon Show influenced us enormously\\".:170 He reiterates this point in his contribution to Ventham's book: \\"We all loved The Goon Show in the Monty Python Team: it ignited some energy in us. It was more a spirit that was passed on, rather than any particular technique. The point is that once somebody has crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it is terribly easy for everybody else to cross it\\".:151 Similarly, in the introduction to Graham Chapman's posthumous anthology (2006, p. xvii) Yoakum notes that while other radio comedies influenced Chapman, \\"the show that truly astounded Graham, and was a major influence on his comedy was The Goon Show.\\" And on page 23 Chapman states: \\"from about the age of seven or eight I used to be an avid listener to a radio programme called The Goon Show. In fact, at that stage I wanted to be a Goon\\". In their episode Election Night Special, the Pythons gave an appreciative nod to their forebears. When one of the onscreen elections reporters asks his companion, \\"What do you make of the nylon dog cardigan and plastic mule rest?\\" a voice offstage yells, \\"There's no such thing!\\" to which the reporter replies, \\"Thank you, Spike.\\" Deaths Peter Sellers died on 24 July 1980, aged 54. Michael Bentine died on 26 November 1996, aged 74. Harry Secombe died on 11 April 2001, aged 79. Milligan claimed to be relieved that Secombe had died before him, because had he died before Secombe then Secombe would have been in a position to sing at his funeral. Terence \\"Spike\\" Milligan died on 27 February 2002, aged 83; Secombe ended up singing at his funeral anyway, as a recording. Two years later Milligan's wish to have the words \\"I told you I was ill\\" inscribed on his gravestone was finally granted, although the church would only agree if the words were written in Irish, as .

Voiced by Julie Kavner, she first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. Marge is the matriarch of the Simpson family. With her husband Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top \\"TV moms\\". She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons‚Äîincluding video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books‚Äîand inspired an entire line of merchandise. Marge's distinctive blue beehive hairstyle was inspired by a combination of the Bride's in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, who was a member of the original cast of The Tracey Ullman Show, was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992. She was also nominated for an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in The Simpsons Movie. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Role in The Simpsons The Simpsons uses a floating timeline (the characters do not physically age), and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Marge Simpson is the wife of Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. She was raised by her parents, Jacqueline and Clancy Bouvier. She has a pair of sisters, the joyless Patty and Selma, both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer. In \\"The Way We Was\\" (season two, 1991), it is revealed via flashback that Marge attended Springfield High School, and in her final year met Homer Simpson, after they both were sent to detention‚ÄîHomer for smoking in the bathroom with Barney, and Marge for burning her bra in a feminist protest. She was at first wary of Homer, but agreed to go to the prom with him, although she ended up going with Artie Ziff after Homer received tutoring lessons as a means to get to know her better, while knowing that she needed to sleep for a school meet. However, she regretted going with Artie when he started to pressure her to have sex after prom. At the end of the evening, while Artie drove her home after receiving a slap, she spied Homer walking along the side of the road with the corsage meant for her. After hearing her parents voicing their negative opinions about Homer, she took her own car and went back to give him a ride. She then told Homer she should've gone to the prom with him and he fixes her snapped shoulder strap with the corsage. During the ride, he tells her he will hug her and kiss her and never be able to let her go. After the two had been dating for several years, Marge discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and she and Homer were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line. Bart was born soon after, and the couple bought their first house. The episode \\"That '90s Show\\" (season 19, 2008) contradicted much of the established back-story; for example, it was revealed that Marge and Homer were childless in the early 1990s although past episodes had suggested Bart and Lisa were born in the 1980s. As with many Simpsons characters, Marge's age and birthday changes to serve the story. In season one (1990) episodes \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" and \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", Marge was said to be 34. In \\"Homer's Paternity Coot\\" (season 17, 2006), Marge states that Emerald would have been her birthstone if she had been born three months later, placing her birthday sometime in February. In \\"Regarding Margie\\" (season 17, 2006), Homer mentioned that Marge was his age, meaning she could have been anywhere between 36 and 40. During this episode (Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore), Lisa questions Homer's memory of Marge's birthday. When he cannot remember, Marge yells that it is in May. In the season eighteen episode \\"Marge Gamer\\" she states that she and actor Randy Quaid share the same birthdate (October 1). Marge has been nonworking for most of the series, choosing to be a homemaker and take care of her family. However, she has held several one-episode jobs in the course of the series. These include working as a nuclear technician alongside Homer at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in \\"Marge Gets a Job\\" (season four, 1992); selling houses in \\"Realty Bites\\" (season nine, 1997); owning her own pretzel business in \\"The Twisted World of Marge Simpson\\" (season eight, 1997), and working at an erotic bakery in \\"Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes\\" (season 20, 2008). While Marge has never expressed discontent with her role as a homemaker, she has become bored with it. In \\"The Springfield Connection\\" (season six, 1995), Marge decided that she needed more excitement in her life and became a police officer. However, by the end of the episode, she became upset with the corruption in the force and quit. Character =Creation= alt=A man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone. Matt Groening first conceived Marge and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret \\"Marge\\" Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, \\"It's really weird to have people think you're a cartoon.\\" Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue. Marge debuted with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Network. Marge and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show. Matt Groening believes that episodes featuring Marge are among the most difficult episodes to write. Bill Oakley believes that the \\"junior\\" writers are usually given Marge episodes because he and writing partner Josh Weinstein were given several to write during their first season.Groening, Matt; Oakley, Bill. (2004). Commentary for \\"Marge in Chains\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so David M. Stern decided to write a Marge episode, which became \\"Homer Alone\\" (season three, 1992). He felt that they could achieve a \\"deeper vein\\" of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved.Stern, David M. in a letter that is read on the commentary by Dan Castellaneta. (2003). Commentary for \\"Lisa the Greek\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. =Design= The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for \\"Fear of Flying\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly in the middle of the sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used.Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005). \\"A Bit From the Animators\\", Illustrated Commentary for \\"Summer of 4 Ft. 2\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.Groening, Matt.

Marge's voice is performed by Julie Kavner, who also does the voices of Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma. Kavner had been part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member Dan Castellaneta to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors. Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it \\"destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people.\\" Kavner takes recording sessions seriously and feels that voice acting is \\"a little more limiting than live acting. And I have nothing to do with my character's movement.\\" Marge's raspy voice is only slightly different from Kavner's, who has a \\"honeyed gravel voice\\" which she says is due to \\"a bump on [her] vocal cords.\\" While Marge is her most famous character, Kavner's favorite characters to voice are Patty and Selma because \\"they're really funny and sad at the same time.\\" In The Simpsons Movie, some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted. Until 1998, Kavner was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Kavner earned $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Kavner and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. =Personality= Marge is generally a stereotypical sitcom mother, and she also plays the \\"long-suffering wife\\" who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in \\"Homer Alone\\" (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown. After spending time at \\"Rancho Relaxo\\", during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often. Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she \\"put[s] up with a lot in [their] marriage,\\" and has left Homer or thrown him out of the house on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is \\"Secrets of a Successful Marriage\\" (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is \\"complete and utter dependence.\\" At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he \\"really [does] make a gal feel needed.\\" Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer. Marge in her first televised appearance in \\"Good Night\\". Marge is more caring, understanding, and nurturing toward Bart than Homer, but she refers to him as \\"a handful\\" and is often embarrassed by his antics. In \\"Marge Be Not Proud\\" (season seven, 1995), she felt she was mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her \\"over-mothering\\", but as she started acting more distant towards him, he felt guilty about it and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her \\"special little guy\\" and has defended him on many occasions. She once said \\"I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing ... Of course, it makes him do bad things.\\" Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge. Marge maintains a good relationship with her mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma, though they disapprove of Homer and are vocal about it. Marge has tolerated their criticism, but has occasionally lost patience with them, once referring to them as \\"ghouls.\\" Marge's late father Clancy is rarely referred to in the series and has had speaking parts in only two episodes. It was revealed in \\"Fear of Flying\\" (season six, 1994) that Clancy told Marge that he was a pilot, but in reality, he was a flight attendant. Marge discovered this one day and developed aerophobia. In \\"Jazzy and the Pussycats\\" (season 18, 2006), Homer casually mentions that they once attended his funeral. It was finally revealed that Clancy died of lung cancer in season 27 episode \\"Puffless\\". Marge believes she has higher morals than most other characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent The Itchy & Scratchy Show and being a prominent member of the \\"Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene.\\" She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, but many of the townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms. Marge is the only member of the family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In \\"Homer the Heretic\\" (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him \\"don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win.\\". Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with her daughter, Lisa, who is a feminist. In \\"Lisa the Skeptic\\" (season nine, 1997), an \\"angel skeleton\\" is discovered, much to the skepticism of Lisa. As Lisa rants about the people who believe it is an angel, Marge informs her that she also believes it is an angel. She tells Lisa, \\"There has to be more life than just what we see, everyone needs something to believe in.\\" In spite of her highly debatable moral stances, Marge struggles with vices, such as a gambling addiction. While Marge has learned to cope with her addiction, it has never completely disappeared and remains an underlying problem that is referenced occasionally on the show.Reiss, Mike. (2003). Commentary for \\"Lisa the Greek\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox Politically, Marge generally aligns with the Democratic Party, having supported the candidacy of her state's progressive governor Mary Bailey, and voted for Jimmy Carter in both of his presidential elections. Reception In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of the Simpson family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards, Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Marge in the season three episode \\"I Married Marge\\". In 2004, Kavner and Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer) won a Young Artist Award for \\"Most Popular Mom & Dad in a TV Series\\". For her performance in The Simpsons Movie, Kavner was nominated for \\"Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature\\" at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm from Ratatouille. Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she \\"gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever.\\" Various episodes in which Marge is prominently featured have been nominated for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, including \\"The Way We Weren't\\" in 2004 and \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\", which won the award in 1990. In 2000, Marge and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. Marge has been ranked highly in lists of the top television mothers of all time. She was ranked first on Entertainment Weekly's list in 1994; first on Fox News' list in 2005; eighth on CityNews' list in 2008; and was included in Time's list of the \\"10 Best Moms Ever\\". In a 2004 poll in the United Kingdom, Marge was named the \\"most respected mother\\" by respondents. Still in 2004, Marge was ranked third in a poll conducted by the Opinion Research Company. In May 2012, Marge was one of the 12 moms chosen by users of iVillage on their list of \\"Mommy Dearest: The TV Moms You Love\\". AOL has named Marge the 24th \\"Most Memorable Female TV Character\\". Her relationship with Homer was included in TV Guide list of \\"The Best TV Couples of All Time\\". Religious writer Kenneth Briggs has written that \\"Marge is my candidate for sainthood ... She lives in the real world, she lives with crises, with flawed people. She forgives and she makes her own mistakes. She is a forgiving, loving person ... absolutely saintly.\\" Cultural influence The edition of October 1, 1990 of People included an interview with then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: \\"She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. \\"It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen,\\" she says, \\"but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean.\\" The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: \\"Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking at a picture of you ... depicted on a plastic cup ... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family ‚Äî Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie ‚Äî are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example for the rest of the country. Please forgive a loose tongue.\\"Brooks, James L. (2004). \\"Bush vs. Simpson\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In 2002, opponents of the Seattle Monorail Project planned on showing the episode \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\" at a protest event. Following complaints, 20th Century Fox sent a letter to the event organizers ordering that the episode not be shown due to copyright laws. In 2004, Marge appeared on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom for the Alternative Christmas message, which is annually broadcast at the same time that Queen Elizabeth II gives her Christmas message. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Marge and the four other members of the Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while the show is still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. =Merchandising= Marge is depicted in much The Simpsons-related merchandise, including T-shirts, baseball caps, bumper stickers, cardboard stand-ups, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons, dolls, posters and figurines. She has appeared in each of The Simpsons video games, including The Simpsons Game, released in 2007. Besides the television series, Marge regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics, which were first published on November 29, 1993, and are issued monthly. Marge also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. Marge appeared in a 2005 advertisement for Dove Styling, where her normal beehive hair was exchanged for a more stylish look for a series of ads featuring several popular cartoon women. In April 2004, Marge appeared on the cover of Maxim. She also appeared on the cover of the November 2009 issue of Playboy, becoming the first cartoon character to appear on the cover. The cover and a three-page picture spread, as well as a story inside entitled The Devil in Marge Simpson, commemomorated the 20th anniversary of The Simpsons, but is also part of a plan to appeal to younger readers. Darine Stern's picture on the October 1971 cover served as the inspiration for Playboy's November 2009 cover.

Truth is usually held to be the opposite of falsity. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the sciences, law, journalism, and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. Most commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. This is called the correspondence theory of truth. Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. There are many different questions about the nature of truth which are still the subject of contemporary debates, such as: How do we define truth? Is it even possible to give an informative definition of truth? What things are truthbearers and are therefore capable of being true or false? Are truth and falsity bivalent, or are there other truth values? What are the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsity? What role does truth play in constituting knowledge? And is truth always absolute, or can it be relative to one's perspective? Definition and etymology An angel carrying the banner of \\"Truth\\", Roslin, Midlothian The English word truth is derived from Old English tr√≠ew√æ, tr√©ow√æ, tr√Ωw√æ, Middle English trew√æe, cognate to Old High German triuwida, Old Norse trygg√∞. Like troth, it is a -th nominalisation of the adjective true (Old English tr√©owe). The English word true is from Old English (West Saxon) (ge)tr√≠ewe, tr√©owe, cognate to Old Saxon (gi)tr√ªui, Old High German (ga)triuwu (Modern German treu \\"faithful\\"), Old Norse tryggr, Gothic triggws,see Holtzmann's law for the -ww- : -gg- alternation. all from a Proto-Germanic *trewwj- \\"having good faith\\", perhaps ultimately from PIE *dru- \\"tree\\", on the notion of \\"steadfast as an oak\\" (e.g., Sanskrit dƒÅÃÅru \\"(piece of) wood\\"). Old Norse ', \\"faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief\\"A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic, Geir T. Zo√´ga (1910), Northvegr.org (archaic English troth \\"loyalty, honesty, good faith\\", compare '). Thus, 'truth' involves both the quality of \\"faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity\\",OED on true has \\"Steadfast in adherence to a commander or friend, to a principle or cause, to one's promises, faith, etc.; firm in allegiance; faithful, loyal, constant, trusty; Honest, honourable, upright, virtuous, trustworthy; free from deceit, sincere, truthful \\" besides \\"Conformity with fact; agreement with reality; accuracy, correctness, verity; Consistent with fact; agreeing with the reality; representing the thing as it is; Real, genuine; rightly answering to the description; properly so called; not counterfeit, spurious, or imaginary.\\" and that of \\"agreement with fact or reality\\", in Anglo-Saxon expressed by s≈ç√æ (Modern English sooth). All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth \\"fidelity\\" and truth \\"factuality\\". To express \\"factuality\\", North Germanic opted for nouns derived from sanna \\"to assert, affirm\\", while continental West Germanic (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of w√¢ra \\"faith, trust, pact\\" (cognate to Slavic vƒõra \\"(religious) faith\\", but influenced by Latin verus). Romance languages use terms following the Latin veritas, while the Greek aletheia, Russian pravda, South Slavic istina and Sanskrit sat have separate etymological origins. In some modern contexts, the word \\"truth\\" is used to refer to fidelity to an original or standard. It can also be used in the context of being \\"true to oneself\\" in the sense of acting with authenticity. Major theories The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Supp., \\"Truth\\", auth: Michael Williams, pp. 572‚Äì73 (Macmillan, 1996)Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), Truth, Oxford University Press, Oxford. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work. Theories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. More recently developed \\"deflationary\\" or \\"minimalist\\" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like true to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its nature. Minimalist reasoning realises truth as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.Horwich, Paul, Truth, (2nd edition, 1988),Field, Hartry, Truth and the Absence of Fact (2001). =Substantive= Correspondence Correspondence theories emphasize that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, p. 223 (Macmillan, 1969). Prior uses Bertrand Russell's wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name. This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223‚Äì24 (Macmillan, 1969). This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to \\"things\\" by whether it accurately describes those \\"things\\". A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas: \\"Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus\\" (\\"Truth is the adequation of things and intellect\\"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol. 2, \\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, Macmillan, 1969, p. 224.\\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, I. Q.16, A.2 arg. 2. Aquinas also restated the theory as: \\"A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality\\".\\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (citing De Veritate Q.1, A.1‚Äì3 and Summa Theologiae, I. Q.16). Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as \\"objective reality\\" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.See, e.g., Bradley, F.H., \\"On Truth and Copying\\", in Blackburn, et al. (eds., 1999),Truth, 31‚Äì45. Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ff. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on \\"Moore's Correspondence Theory\\", 225‚Äì26, \\"Russell's Correspondence Theory\\", 226‚Äì27, \\"Remsey and Later Wittgenstein\\", 228‚Äì29, \\"Tarski's Semantic Theory\\", 230‚Äì31. For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The German word Zeitgeist is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may \\"know\\" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in agglutinative languages). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate truth predicate. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is Alfred Tarski, whose semantic theory is summarized further below in this article.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ff. Macmillan, 1969. See the section on \\"Tarski's Semantic Theory\\", 230‚Äì31. Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth. Coherence Walter Seymour Allward's Veritas (Truth) outside Supreme Court of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario Canada For coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.Immanuel Kant, for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of Leibniz and Spinoza are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity. A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole. Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system. Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of formal systems in logic and mathematics.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Coherence Theory of Truth\\", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 130‚Äì31 (Macmillan, 1969) However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate axiomatically independent and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various alternative geometries. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the natural world, empirical data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Coherence Theory of Truth\\", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131‚Äì33, see esp., section on \\"Epistemological assumptions\\" (Macmillan, 1969) Coherence theories distinguish the thought of rationalist philosophers, particularly of Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, along with the British philosopher F. H. Bradley.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Coherence Theory of Truth\\", auth: Alan R. White, p. 130 They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of logical positivism, notably Otto Neurath and Carl Hempel. Pragmatic The three most influential forms of the pragmatic theory of truth were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol. 5, \\"Pragmatic Theory of Truth\\", 427 (Macmillan, 1969). Peirce defines truth as follows: \\"Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.\\"Peirce, C.S. (1901), \\"Truth and Falsity and Error\\" (in part), pp. 716‚Äì20 in James Mark Baldwin, ed., Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled \\"Logical\\", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials \\"(C.S.P.)\\", see Google Books Eprint. Reprinted, Collected Papers v. 5, pp. 565‚Äì73. This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as fallibilism and \\"reference to the future\\", are essential to a proper conception of truth. Although Peirce uses words like concordance and correspondence to describe one aspect of the pragmatic sign relation, he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than nominal definitions, which he accords a lower status than real definitions. William James's version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that \\"the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving.\\"James, William, The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism', (1909). By this, James meant that truth is a quality, the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, \\"pragmatic\\"). John Dewey, less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that inquiry, whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time if openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol.2, \\"Dewey, John\\", auth Richard J. Bernstein, p. 383 (Macmillan, 1969) Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by William Ernest Hocking, this variation is known as \\"negative pragmatism\\". Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.Sahakian, W.S. & Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, New York: Barnes & Noble, 1966, Richard Feynman also ascribed to it: \\"We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.\\"Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, New York: Random House, 1994, . This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey. For Peirce, the idea of \\"... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ...\\" fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing. As Feynman noted, an idea or theory \\"... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right.\\" Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is \\"self-corrective\\" over time. Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the coherence theory of truth in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience. The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity. As Feynman said, \\"... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.\\"Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, p. 150. Constructivist Social constructivism holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as \\"constructed,\\" because it does not reflect any external \\"transcendent\\" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold). Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender, are socially constructed. Giambattista Vico was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's epistemological orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom‚Äîverum ipsum factum‚Äî\\"truth itself is constructed\\". Hegel and Marx were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is \\"in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history\\" and ideological knowledge is \\"an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement\\". Consensus Consensus theory holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a subset thereof consisting of more than one person. Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of \\"truth\\" is the philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas.See, e.g., Habermas, J√ºrgen, Knowledge and Human Interests (English translation, 1972). Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.See, e.g., Habermas, J√ºrgen, Knowledge and Human Interests (English translation, 1972), esp. Part III, pp. 187 ff. Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher Nicholas Rescher.Rescher, Nicholas, Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus (1995). In the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the hadith in which Muhammad states, \\"My community will never agree upon an error\\"Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (4:2167), ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings. =Minimalist= Deflationary Modern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term truth does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of truth predicates (e.g., that some particular thing \\"...is true\\") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century. From this point of view, to assert that \\"'2 + 2 = 4' is true\\" is logically equivalent to asserting that \\"2 + 2 = 4\\", and the phrase \\"is true\\" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described: * as deflationary theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words \\"true\\" or truth, * as disquotational theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or * as minimalist theories of truth.Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), Truth in the Introductory section of the book. Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that \\"[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis.\\" Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it does appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., Semantic paradoxes, and below.) In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate \\"is true\\", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence: :Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc. This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: What Michael says is true.Richard Kirkham, Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction, MIT Press, 1992. Performative Attributed to P. F. Strawson is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say \\"'Snow is white' is true\\" is to perform the speech act of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the wedding couple say \\"I do\\" at the appropriate time in a wedding, they are performing the act of taking the other to be their lawful wedded spouse. They are not describing themselves as taking the other, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such \\"illocutionary acts\\" is J. L. Austin, \\"How to Do Things With Words\\"J. L. Austin, \\"How to Do Things With Words\\". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975). Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: \\"To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement. When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.' The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'\\"Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Vol. 6: Performative Theory of Truth, auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969) Redundancy and related According to the redundancy theory of truth, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. For example, making the assertion that \\" 'Snow is white' is true\\" is equivalent to asserting \\"Snow is white\\". Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held that the use of words like fact and truth was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a \\"linguistic muddle\\".Ramsey, F.P. (1927), \\"Facts and Propositions\\", Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153‚Äì70. Reprinted, pp. 34‚Äì51 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) \\"Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey\\", The British Journal for the History of Philosophy 12(4), pp. 705‚Äì18. A variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of Tarski's schema: To say that '\\"P\\" is true' is to say that P. A version of this theory was defended by C. J. F. Williams in his book What is Truth? Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims. They argue that sentences like \\"That's true\\", when said in response to \\"It's raining\\", are prosentences, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. In the same way that it means the same as my dog in the sentence My dog was hungry, so I fed it, That's true is supposed to mean the same as It's raining‚Äîif you say the latter and I then say the former. These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is not a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion \\"P\\" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as \\"that's true.\\" Deflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise. Consider the analogy between the sentence \\"Snow is white\\" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense. To a minimalist, saying \\"Snow is white is true\\" is the same as saying \\"Snow is white,\\" but to say \\"Snow White is true\\" is not the same as saying \\"Snow White.\\" Philosophical skepticism Philosophical skepticism is generally any questioning attitude or doubt towards one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions.\\"Philosophical views are typically classed as skeptical when they involve advancing some degree of doubt regarding claims that are elsewhere taken for granted.\\" utm.edu The primary target of philosophical skepticism is epistemology, but it can be applied to any domain, such as the supernatural, morality (moral skepticism), and religion (skepticism about the existence of God). Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the \\"big questions\\" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. Religious skepticism is \\"doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)\\". Scientific skepticism concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to systematic investigation using the scientific method, to discover empirical evidence for them. =Pluralist= Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about. Some of the pragmatic theories, such as those by Charles Peirce and William James, included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories. Crispin Wright argued in his 1992 book Truth and Objectivity that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility.Truth and Objectivity, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1992. Michael Lynch, in a 2009 book Truth as One and Many, argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.Truth as One and Many (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009). =Most-believed= According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean towards deflationary theories and 14% epistemic theories. Formal theories serpent (1896). Olin Levi Warner, Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C. =Logic= Logic is concerned with the patterns in reason that can help tell us if a proposition is true or not. Logicians use formal languages to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system. A logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worldsLudwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a fact (also called a synthetic claim or a contingency) which is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as \\"If p and q, then p\\" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the symbols and words in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue. Degrees of truth in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with bivalent logic (or binary logic), three-valued logic, and other forms of finite-valued logic. Truth in logic can be represented using numbers comprising a continuous range, typically between 0 and 1, as with fuzzy logic and other forms of infinite-valued logic., Editorial In general, the concept of representing truth using more than two values is known as many- valued logic. =Mathematics= There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics. They are the model theory of truth and the proof theory of truth.Penelope Maddy; Realism in Mathematics; Series: Clarendon Paperbacks; Paperback: 216 pages; Publisher: Oxford University Press, US (1992); . Historically, with the nineteenth century development of Boolean algebra mathematical models of logic began to treat \\"truth\\", also represented as \\"T\\" or \\"1\\", as an arbitrary constant. \\"Falsity\\" is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as \\"F\\" or \\"0\\". In propositional logic, these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of axioms and rules of inference, often given in the form of truth tables. In addition, from at least the time of Hilbert's program at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of G√∂del's incompleteness theorems and the development of the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were generally assumed to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.Elliott Mendelson; Introduction to Mathematical Logic; Series: Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications; Hardcover: 469 pages; Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 5 edition (August 11, 2009); . The works of Kurt G√∂del, Alan Turing, and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system.See, e.g., Chaitin, Gregory L., The Limits of Mathematics (1997) esp. 89 ff. Two examples of the latter can be found in Hilbert's problems. Work on Hilbert's 10th problem led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific Diophantine equations for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution,M. Davis. \\"Hilbert's Tenth Problem is Unsolvable.\\" American Mathematical Monthly 80, pp. 233‚Äì69, 1973 or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, Hilbert's first problem was on the continuum hypothesis.Yandell, Benjamin H.. The Honors Class. Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers (2002). G√∂del and Paul Cohen showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard axioms of set theory.Chaitin, Gregory L., The Limits of Mathematics (1997) 1‚Äì28, 89 ff. In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom. G√∂del thought that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of intuition, an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics and perhaps best considered in the realm of human comprehension and communication, but commented: =Tarski's semantics= The semantic theory of truth has as its general case for a given language: :'P' is true if and only if P where 'P' refers to the sentence (the sentence's name), and P is just the sentence itself. Tarski's theory of truth (named after Alfred Tarski) was developed for formal languages, such as formal logic. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression is true could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an object language, the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain paradoxical sentences such as, \\"This sentence is not true\\". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. Donald Davidson used it as the foundation of his truth-conditional semantics and linked it to radical interpretation in a form of coherentism. Bertrand Russell is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, Russell's paradox. Russell and Whitehead attempted to solve these problems in Principia Mathematica by putting statements into a hierarchy of types, wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy. This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible type systems that have yet to be resolved to this day. =Kripke's semantics= Kripke's theory of truth (named after Saul Kripke) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows: * Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression \\"is true\\" (or \\"is false\\"). So The barn is big is included in the subset, but not \\" The barn is big is true\\", nor problematic sentences such as \\"This sentence is false\\". * Define truth just for the sentences in that subset. * Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So \\"The barn is big is true\\" is now included, but not either \\"This sentence is false\\" nor \\"'The barn is big is true' is true\\". * Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for The barn is big; then for \\"The barn is big is true\\"; then for \\"'The barn is big is true' is true\\", and so on. Notice that truth never gets defined for sentences like This sentence is false, since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are \\"ungrounded.\\" Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the principle of bivalence: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the liar paradox, the paradox is dissolved.Kripke, Saul. \\"Outline of a Theory of Truth\\", Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690‚Äì716 However, it has been shown by G√∂del that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in G√∂del's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea‚Äîmanifested by the diagonal lemma‚Äîis the basis for Tarski's theorem that truth cannot be consistently defined. It has thus been claimedKeith Simmons, Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993 that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by acceptable methods used in mathematical logic. Folk beliefs The truth predicate \\"P is true\\" has great practical value in human language, allowing us to efficiently endorse or impeach claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect (Gricean) conversational implications. Individuals or societies will sometime punish \\"false\\" statements to deter falsehoods; the oldest surviving law text, the Code of Ur-Nammu, lists penalties for false accusations of sorcery or adultery, as well as for committing perjury in court. Even four- year-old children can pass simple \\"false belief\\" tests and successfully assess that another individual's belief diverges from reality in a specific way;Wellman, Henry M., David Cross, and Julanne Watson. \\"Meta‚Äêanalysis of theory‚Äêof‚Äêmind development: the truth about false belief.\\" Child development 72.3 (2001): 655‚Äì84. by adulthood we have strong implicit intuitions about \\"truth\\" that form a \\"folk theory\\" of truth. These intuitions include:Lynch, Michael P. \\"Alethic functionalism and our folk theory of truth.\\" Synthese 145.1 (2005): 29‚Äì43. * Capture (T-in): If P, then P is true * Release (T-out): If P is true, then P * Noncontradiction: A statement can't be both true and false * Normativity: It is usually good to believe what is true * False beliefs: The notion that believing a statement doesn't necessarily make it true Like many folk theories, our folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any formal system that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth (also known as the T-schema), and that also respects classical logic, is provably inconsistent and succumbs to the liar paradox or to a similar contradiction.Bueno, Ot√°vio, and Mark Colyvan. \\"Logical non- apriorism and the law of non-contradiction.\\" The law of non-contradiction: New philosophical essays (2004): 156‚Äì75. Notable views La V√©rit√© \\"Truth\\" by Jules Joseph Lefebvre =Ancient philosophy= Ancient Greece =Socratic philosophy= Socrates', Plato's and Aristotle's ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle stated: \\"To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true\\".David, Marion (2005). \\"Correspondence Theory of Truth\\" in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy proceeds to say of Aristotle: > [...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in > the Categories (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of \\"underlying things\\" that > make statements true and implies that these \\"things\\" (pragmata) are > logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not > sitting). Most influential is his claim in De Interpretatione (16a3) that > thoughts are \\"likenesses\\" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines > truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that > such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...] Similar statements can also be found in Plato's dialogues (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist 263b). The Stoics conceived truth as accessible from impressions via cognitive grasping. =Non-Socratic philosophy= Many other Greek philosophers maintained that truth was either not accessible to mortals, or of greatly limited accessibility, forming early philosophical skepticism. Among these were Xenophanes, Democritus, and Pyrrho. =Medieval philosophy= Avicenna (980‚Äì1037) In early Islamic philosophy, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work Kitab Al-Shifa The Book of Healing, Book I, Chapter 8, as: Avicenna elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6: However, this definition is merely a rendering of the medieval Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet. A modern translation of the original Arabic text states: Aquinas (1225‚Äì1274) Reevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas stated in his Disputed Questions on Truth: Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).\\"Veritas supra ens fundatur\\" (Truth is founded on being). Disputed Questions on Truth, 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3. Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his Summa I.16.1: Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the Creator God who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; reality) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the senses, then through the understanding and the judgement done by reason. For Aquinas, human intelligence (\\"intus\\", within and \\"legere\\", to read) has the capability to reach the essence and existence of things because it has a non-material, spiritual element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability. Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages Richard Firth Green examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his A Crisis of Truth, and concludes that roughly during the reign of Richard II of England the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance Romance literature, changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in Derek Pearsall's summary). Whereas truth (the \\"trouthe\\" of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight) was first \\"an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons\\", in Ricardian England it \\"transforms...into a political truth in which truth is understood to reside in documents\\". =Modern philosophy= Kant (1724‚Äì1804) Immanuel Kant Immanuel Kant endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth. Kant writes in the Critique of Pure Reason: \\"The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed\\".Kant, Immanuel (1781/1787), Critique of Pure Reason. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82. However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures: > [...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its > object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to > count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the > object with my cognition, however, only by cognizing it. Hence my cognition > is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for > truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can > ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my > cognition of the object. The ancients called such a circle in explanation a > diallelon. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this > mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it > is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so > appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to > establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as > witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the > solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and > for every man. [...]Kant, Immanuel (1801), The J√§sche Logic, in Lectures on > Logic. Translated and edited by J. Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge > University Press, 1992), pp. 557‚Äì58. This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain objects and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.Alberto Vanzo, \\"Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth\\", Kant- Studien, 101 (2010), pp. 147‚Äì66. Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is \\"impossible without qualification and for every man\\". Hegel (1770‚Äì1831) Georg Hegel distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the mechanics of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. \\"Truth is its own self-movement within itself.\\"\\"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst.\\" The Phenomenology of Spirit, Preface, ¬∂ 48 Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of dialectical triplicity toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. Chalyb√§us used the terms \\"thesis\\", \\"antithesis\\", and \\"synthesis\\" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity. The \\"thesis\\" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an \\"antithesis\\" occurs which opposes the \\"thesis.\\" In turn, the \\"synthesis\\" appears when the \\"thesis\\" and \\"antithesis\\" become reconciled and a higher level of truth is obtained. This \\"synthesis\\" thereby becomes a \\"thesis,\\" which will again necessitate an \\"antithesis,\\" requiring a new \\"synthesis\\" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the Absolute Spirit moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite God. Schopenhauer (1788‚Äì1860) For Arthur Schopenhauer,On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, ¬ß¬ß 29‚Äì33 a judgment is a combination or separation of two or more concepts. If a judgment is to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground). Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has material truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or formal. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has transcendental truth. Kierkegaard (1813‚Äì1855) When S√∏ren Kierkegaard, as his character Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, he does not advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.Kierkegaard, S√∏ren. Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992 While objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.Watts, Michael. Kierkegaard, Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003 Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900) Friedrich Nietzsche believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the will to power of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the will to power, and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in Beyond Good and Evil, \\"The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species- preserving, perhaps even species-breeding...\\" (aphorism 4). He proposed the will to power as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life- affirming and sincere perspective one could have. Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows: > [...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, \\"On Truth and > Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\\" (\\"√úber Wahrheit und L√ºge im au√üermoralischen > Sinn\\") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the > idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call \\"truth\\" is only \\"a > mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.\\" His view at this > time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: > concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into > images; \\"truth\\" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for > merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and > consistence. [...]Robert Wicks, Friedrich Nietzsche ‚Äì Early Writings: > 1872‚Äì1876, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2008 Edition), > Edward N. Zalta (ed.) Separately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent Western intellectual tradition: \\"But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests‚Äîthat even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'...\\" Heidegger (1889‚Äì1976) Other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to Martin Heidegger, the original meaning and essence of truth in Ancient Greece was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, aletheia.http://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin- Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the Latin term veritas. Whitehead (1861‚Äì1947) Alfred North Whitehead, a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: \\"There are no whole truths; all truths are half- truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil\\".Alfred North Whitehead, Dialogues, 1954: Prologue. The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since half-truths are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion. Peirce (1839‚Äì1914) Pragmatists like C. S. Peirce take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and discovering truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human inquiry would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: \\"The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth...\\" Nishida (1870‚Äì1945) According to Kitaro Nishida, \\"knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing.\\"John Maraldo, Nishida Kitar√¥ ‚Äì Self-Awareness, in: The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) Fromm (1900‚Äì1980) Erich Fromm finds that trying to discuss truth as \\"absolute truth\\" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on \\"optimal truth\\". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in \\"a strange and powerful world\\". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in \\"Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics\\" (1947), from which excerpts are included below. : the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where \\"it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles\\". : In that respect, \\"a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result\\". The history of science is \\"a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation.\\" : As a result \\"the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period.\\" Fromm furthermore notes that \\"different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth\\" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth. Foucault (1926‚Äì1984) Quid Est Veritas? Christ and Pilate, by Nikolai Ge. Truth, says Michel Foucault, is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an \\"objective\\" quality. He prefers not to use the term truth itself but \\"Regimes of Truth\\". In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure. Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of Nietzsche. Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various episteme throughout history.Foucault, M. \\"The Order of Things\\", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966) Baudrillard (1929‚Äì2007) Jean Baudrillard considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something. He took his cue from iconoclasts whom he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist.Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: Michigan University Press, 1994. Baudrillard wrote in \\"Precession of the Simulacra\\": ::The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth‚Äîit is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true. ::‚ÄîEcclesiastesBaudrillard, Jean. \\"Simulacra and Simulations\\", in Selected Writings , ed. Mark Poster, Stanford University Press, 1988; 166 ffBaudrillard's attribution of this quote to Ecclesiastes is deliberately fictional. \\"Baudrillard attributes this quote to Ecclesiastes. However, the quote is a fabrication (see Jean Baudrillard. Cool Memories III, 1991‚Äì95. London: Verso, 1997). Editor's note: In Fragments: Conversations With Fran√ßois L'Yvonnet. New York: Routledge, 2004:11, Baudrillard acknowledges this 'Borges-like' fabrication.\\" Cited in footnote #4 in Smith, Richard G., \\"Lights, Camera, Action: Baudrillard and the Performance of Representations\\" , International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 1 (January 2005) Some examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the \\"truth\\" that society is free; scandals (e.g., Watergate) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate. =Theological views= Hinduism In Hinduism, Truth is defined as \\"unchangeable\\", \\"that which has no distortion\\", \\"that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person\\", \\"that which pervades the universe in all its constancy\\". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of India: \\"Satyameva Jayate\\" (Truth alone wins), as well as \\"Satyam muktaye\\" (Truth liberates), \\"Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam\\" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), \\"When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him (patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36), \\"The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!\\" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1‚Äì4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15‚Äì18), Truth is superior to silence (Manusmriti), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like \\"ultra\\" or \\"highest,\\" or more literally \\"truest,\\" connoting purity and excellence. For example, satyaloka is the \\"highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the \\"golden age\\" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on. Buddhism In Buddhism, particularly in the Mahayana tradition, the notion of truth is often divided into the Two Truths Doctrine, which consists of relative or conventional truth and ultimate truth. The former refers to truth that is based on common understanding among ordinary people and is accepted as a practical basis for communication of higher truths. Ultimate truth necessarily transcends logic in the sphere of ordinary experience, and recognizes such phenomena as illusory. MƒÅdhyamaka philosophy asserts that any doctrine can be analyzed with both divisions of truth. Affirmation and negation belong to relative and absolute truth respectively. Political law is regarded as relative, while religious law is absolute. Christianity Christianity has a soteriological view of truth. According to the Bible in John 14:6, Jesus is quoted as having said \\"I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\\".

He had previously served as the second vice president of the United States between 1797 and 1801. The principal author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was a proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, motivating American colonists to break from the Kingdom of Great Britain and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level. During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Continental Congress that adopted the Declaration, drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator, and served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the American Revolutionary War. In May 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first Secretary of State under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the provocative Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts. As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, Jefferson promoted a western expansionist policy, organizing the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the nation's land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. Jefferson was reelected in 1804. His second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. Jefferson, while primarily a planter, lawyer and politician, mastered many disciplines, which ranged from surveying and mathematics to horticulture and mechanics. He was an architect in the classical tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his presidency of the American Philosophical Society; he shunned organized religion but was influenced by both Christianity and deism. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people. Among his books is Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800.Bernstein, Richard B. (May 6, 2004). Thomas Jefferson: The Revolution of Ideas. Oxford University Press, p. 78. Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment. During his lifetime Jefferson owned over 600 slaves. As a wealthy landholder, he had slaves in his household and on his plantations. For decades historians have debated the Jefferson-Hemings connection. Modern scholars conclude that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his slave Sally Hemings, a mixed-race woman, who was a half-sister to his late wife, and that he probably fathered at least one, and likely all, of her children. After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Along with Millard Fillmore who founded the University at Buffalo, he is one of only two U.S. presidents to found a university. Jefferson died on Independence Day, July 4, 1826. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia. Although some modern scholars have been critical of Jefferson and slavery, Jefferson continues to rank highly, among the top ten U.S. presidents. Early life and career Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, Old Style, Julian calendar), at the family home in Shadwell in the Colony of Virginia, the third of ten children.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 18. He was of English, and possibly Welsh, descent and was born a British subject.Malone, 1948, pp. 5‚Äì6. His father Peter Jefferson was a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen; his mother was Jane Randolph. Peter Jefferson moved his family to Tuckahoe Plantation in 1745 upon the death of William Randolph, the plantation's owner and Jefferson's friend, who in his will had named him guardian of his children. The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell in 1752, where Peter died in 1757; his estate was divided between his sons Thomas and Randolph.Malone, 1948, pp. 31‚Äì33. Thomas inherited approximately of land, including Monticello. He assumed full authority over his property at age 21.Malone, 1948, pp. 437‚Äì40. =Education, early family life= Wren Building, College of William & Mary where Jefferson studied Jefferson began his education beside the Randolph children with tutors at Tuckahoe.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 19. Thomas' father, Peter, was self-taught, and regretting not having a formal education, he entered Thomas into an English school early, at age five. In 1752, at age nine, he began attending a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister and also began studying the natural world, which he grew to love. At this time he began studying Latin, Greek, and French, while also learning to ride horses. Thomas also read books from his father's modest library.Bowers, 1945, p.12‚Äì13 He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by the Reverend James Maury near Gordonsville, Virginia, where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury's family.Peterson, 1970, pp. 7‚Äì9. During this period Jefferson came to know and befriended various American Indians, including the famous Cherokee chief Ontasset√© who often stopped at Shadwell to visit, on their way to Williamsburg to trade.Bowers, 1945, p. 13Meacham, p. 36 During the two years Jefferson was with the Maury family, he traveled to Williamsburg and was a guest of Colonel Dandridge, father of Martha Washington. In Williamsburg the young Jefferson met and came to admire Patrick Henry, who was eight years his senior, sharing a common interest of violin playing.Bowers, 1945, p. 14‚Äì15 Jefferson entered the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, at age 16 and studied mathematics, metaphysics, and philosophy under professor William Small. Small introduced Jefferson to George Wythe and Francis Fauquier along with British Empiricists including John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton. Small, Wythe, and Fauquier recognized Jefferson as a man of exceptional ability and included him in their inner circle where he became a regular member of their Friday dinner parties where politics and philosophy were discussed. Jefferson later wrote that he \\"heard more common good sense, more rational & philosophical conversations than in all the rest of my life\\".Boles, 2017, p. 17; Bowers,1945, p. 25 During his first year at the college he was given more to parties and dancing and was not very frugal with his expenditures; during his second year, regretting that he had squandered away much time and money, he applied himself to fifteen hours of study a day. Bowers,1945, pp. 22‚Äì23; Boles, 2017, p. 18 Jefferson improved his French and Greek and his skill at the violin. He graduated two years after starting in 1762. He read the law under Wythe's tutelage to obtain his law license while working as a law clerk in his office.Meacham, 2012, pp. 29, 39. He also read a wide variety of English classics and political works.Meacham, 2012, pp. 19, 28‚Äì29. Jefferson was well read in a broad variety of subjects, which along with law and philosophy, included history, natural law, natural religion, ethics, and several areas in science, including agriculture. Overall, he drew very deeply on the philosophers. During the years of study under the watchful eye of Wythe, Jefferson authored a survey of his extensive readings in his Commonplace Book.Chinard, 1926, book cover Wythe was so impressed with Jefferson, that he would later bequeath his entire library to Jefferson.Bowers, 1945, pp.32‚Äì34; Boles, 2017, p. 19; The year 1765 was an eventful one in Jefferson's family. In July, his sister Martha married his close friend and college companion Dabney Carr, which greatly pleased Jefferson. In October, he mourned his sister Jane's unexpected death at age 25 and wrote a farewell epitaph in Latin.Meacham, 2012, p. 37 Jefferson treasured his books and amassed a total of three libraries in his lifetime. The first, a library of 200 volumes started in his youth which included books inherited from his father and left to him by George Wythe,Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 42. was destroyed when his Shadwell home burned in a 1770 fire. Nevertheless, he had replenished his collection with 1,250 titles by 1773, and it grew to almost 6,500 volumes by 1814.Ferling, 2000, p. 43. After the British burned the Library of Congress during the War of 1812, he sold this second library to the U.S. government to jumpstart the Library of Congress collection, for the price of $23,950. Jefferson used a portion of the money secured by the sale to pay off some of his large debt, remitting $10,500 to William Short and $4,870 to John Barnes of Georgetown. However, he soon resumed collecting for his personal library, writing to John Adams, \\"I cannot live without books.\\"Library of CongressBoles, 2017, p. 458 He began to construct a new library of his personal favorites and by the time of his death a decade later it had grown to almost 2,000 volumes. =Lawyer and House of Burgesses= House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, Virginia, where Jefferson served 1769‚Äì1775 Jefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767 and then lived with his mother at Shadwell.Meacham, 2012, pp. 11, 49. In addition to practicing law, Jefferson represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1769 until 1775.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 40. He pursued reforms to slavery. He introduced legislation in 1769 allowing masters to take control over the emancipation of slaves, taking discretion away from the royal governor and General Court. He persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation's passage, but reaction was strongly negative.Meacham, 2012, pp. 47‚Äì49. Jefferson took seven cases for freedom-seeking slavesGordon-Reed, 2008, p. 348. and waived his fee for one client, who claimed that he should be freed before the statutory age of thirty-one required for emancipation in cases with inter-racial grandparents.Gordon-Reed, 2008, pp. 99‚Äì100. He invoked the Natural Law to argue, \\"everyone comes into the world with a right to his own person and using it at his own will ... This is what is called personal liberty, and is given him by the author of nature, because it is necessary for his own sustenance.\\" The judge cut him off and ruled against his client. As a consolation, Jefferson gave his client some money, conceivably used to aid his escape shortly thereafter. He later incorporated this sentiment into the Declaration of Independence.Meacham, 2012, p. 49. He also took on 68 cases for the General Court of Virginia in 1767, in addition to three notable cases: Howell v. Netherland (1770), Bolling v. Bolling (1771), and Blair v. Blair (1772).Konig, David T., Encyclopedia Virginia The British Parliament passed the Intolerable Acts in 1774, and Jefferson wrote a resolution calling for a \\"Day of Fasting and Prayer\\" in protest, as well as a boycott of all British goods. His resolution was later expanded into A Summary View of the Rights of British America, in which he argued that people have the right to govern themselves.Meacham, 2012, pp. 71‚Äì73. =Monticello, marriage, and family= Jefferson's home Monticello in Virginia In 1768, Jefferson began constructing his primary residence Monticello (Italian for \\"Little Mountain\\") on a hilltop overlooking his plantation. He spent most of his adult life designing Monticello as architect and was quoted as saying, \\"Architecture is my delight, and putting up, and pulling down, one of my favorite amusements.\\" Construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters, assisted by Jefferson's slaves.TJF: Monticello (House) FAQ ‚Äì \\"Who built the house?\\" He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770. Turning Monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the Palladian style was his perennial project.Ellis, 1996, pp. 142‚Äì44. On January 1, 1772, Jefferson married his third cousin Martha Wayles Skelton, the 23-year-old widow of Bathurst Skelton, and she moved into the South Pavilion.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 47.Roberts, 1993 She was a frequent hostess for Jefferson and managed the large household. Biographer Dumas Malone described the marriage as the happiest period of Jefferson's life.Malone, 1948, p. 53. Martha read widely, did fine needlework, and was a skilled pianist; Jefferson often accompanied her on the violin or cello.Malone, 1948, pp. 47, 158. During their ten years of marriage, Martha bore six children: Martha \\"Patsy\\" (1772‚Äì1836); Jane (1774‚Äì1775); a son who lived for only a few weeks in 1777; Mary Wayles \\"Polly\\" (1778‚Äì1804); Lucy Elizabeth (1780‚Äì1781); and another Lucy Elizabeth (1782‚Äì1784). Only Martha and Mary survived more than a few years.White House Archives Jefferson's daughter Martha Martha's father John Wayles died in 1773, and the couple inherited 135 slaves, , and the estate's debts. The debts took Jefferson years to satisfy, contributing to his financial problems. Martha later suffered from ill health, including diabetes, and frequent childbirth further weakened her. Her mother had died young, and Martha lived with two stepmothers as a girl. A few months after the birth of her last child, she died on September 6, 1782, at the age of 33 with Jefferson at her bedside. Shortly before her death, Martha made Jefferson promise never to marry again, telling him that she could not bear to have another mother raise her children.Gordon-Reed, 2008, p. 145; Meacham, 2012, p. 53. Jefferson was grief-stricken by her death, relentlessly pacing back and forth, nearly to the point of exhaustion. He emerged after three weeks, taking long rambling rides on secluded roads with his daughter Martha, by her description \\"a solitary witness to many a violent burst of grief\\".Halliday, 2009, pp. 48‚Äì53. After working as Secretary of State (1790‚Äì93), he returned to Monticello and initiated a remodeling based on the architectural concepts which he had acquired in Europe. The work continued throughout most of his presidency, being finished in 1809.TJF:Monticello ConstructionBernstein, 2003, p. 109. Political career 1775‚Äì1800 =Declaration of Independence= U.S. Declaration of Independence ‚Äì 1823 facsimile of the engrossed copy Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. The document's social and political ideals were proposed by Jefferson before the inauguration of Washington.Bowers, 1945, p. v At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 77. Jefferson chose his words for the Declaration in June 1775, shortly after the war had begun, where the idea of independence from Britain had long since become popular among the colonies. He was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, as well as by the writings of Locke and Montesquieu.Meacham, 2012, pp. 103‚Äì04. He sought out John Adams, an emerging leader of the Congress.Peterson, 1970, p. 87. They became close friends and Adams supported Jefferson's appointment to the Committee of Five formed to draft a declaration of independence in furtherance of the Lee Resolution passed by the Congress, which declared the United Colonies independent. The committee initially thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson. Jefferson consulted with other committee members over the next seventeen days and drew on his own proposed draft of the Virginia Constitution, George Mason's draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, and other sources.Maier, 1997, p. 104. The other committee members made some changes, and a final draft was presented to the Congress on June 28, 1776.Meacham, 2012, p. 105. The declaration was introduced on Friday, June 28, and Congress began debate over its contents on Monday, July 1, resulting in the omission of a fourth of the text,Shipler, David K., The Paragraph Missing From The Declaration of Independence, The Shipler Report, July 4, 2020 including a passage critical of King George III and \\"Jefferson‚Äôs anti-slavery clause\\".Ellis, 1996, p. 50. Jefferson resented the changes, but he did not speak publicly about the revisions. On July 4, 1776, the Congress ratified the Declaration, and delegates signed it on August 2; in doing so, they were committing an act of treason against the Crown.Meacham, 2012, p. 110. Jefferson's preamble is regarded as an enduring statement of human rights, and the phrase \\"all men are created equal\\" has been called \\"one of the best-known sentences in the English language\\" containing \\"the most potent and consequential words in American history\\".Ellis, 2008, pp. 55‚Äì56. =Virginia state legislator and governor= Governor's Palace, Governor Jefferson's residence in Williamsburg At the start of the Revolution, Jefferson was a Colonel and was named commander of the Albemarle County Militia on September 26, 1775.Brodie, 1974, p. 112. He was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing a state constitution was a priority.Peterson, 1970, pp. 101‚Äì02, 114, 140.Ferling, 2004, p. 26. For nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which forbade state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 102; Bernstein, 2003, p. 42. The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican church, but both were later revived by James Madison.Peterson, 1970, pp. 134, 142; Bernstein, 2003, pp. 68‚Äì69. In 1778, Jefferson was given the task of revising the state's laws. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to streamline the judicial system. Jefferson's proposed statutes provided for general education, which he considered the basis of \\"republican government\\". He had become alarmed that Virginia's powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy. He took the lead in abolishing what he called \\"feudal and unnatural distinctions.\\" He targeted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which the oldest son inherited all the land. The entail laws made it perpetual: the one who inherited the land could not sell it, but had to bequeath it to his oldest son. As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern (\\"Tidewater\\") tobacco areas. During the Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the states that had them. Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 134. He transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond, and introduced measures for public education, religious freedom, and revision of inheritance laws.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 137. During General Benedict Arnold's 1781 invasion of Virginia, Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of the British forces, and the city was burned to the ground.Peterson, 1970, pp. 234‚Äì38.Meacham, 2012, pp. 133‚Äì35; Ellis, 1996, p. 66; Gordon-Reed, 2008, pp. 136‚Äì37. Jefferson sent an emergency dispatch to Colonel Sampson Mathews, whose militia was traveling nearby, to thwart Arnold's efforts.\\"From Thomas Jefferson to Sampson Mathews, 12 January 1781 Founders Online, National Archives,\\" last modified July 11, 2019, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-04-02-0417. [Original source: The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 4, October 1, 1780 ‚Äì February 24, 1781, ed. Julian P. Boyd. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1951, p. 343] During this time, Jefferson was living with friends in the surrounding counties of Richmond. One of these friends was William Fleming, a college friend of his. Jefferson stayed at least one night at his plantation Summerville in Chesterfield County. General Charles Cornwallis that spring dispatched a cavalry force led by Banastre Tarleton to capture Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello, but Jack Jouett of the Virginia militia thwarted the British plan. Jefferson escaped to Poplar Forest, his plantation to the west.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 157. When the General Assembly reconvened in June 1781, it conducted an inquiry into Jefferson's actions which eventually concluded that Jefferson had acted with honor‚Äîbut he was not re- elected.Meacham, 2012, pp. 140‚Äì42. In April of the same year, his daughter Lucy died at age one. A second daughter of that name was born the following year, but she died at age three.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 263. =Notes on the State of Virginia= Jefferson received a letter of inquiry in 1780 about the geography, history, and government of Virginia from French diplomat Fran√ßois Barb√©-Marbois, who was gathering data on the United States. Jefferson included his written responses in a book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1785).Tucker, 1837, v. 1, pp. 165‚Äì66. He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography.Shuffelton, 1999 The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar. Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy and wrote at length about slavery, miscegenation, and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved.Notes on the State of Virginia, p. 149; Burstein, 2006, p. 146. He also wrote of his views on the American Indian and considered them as equals in body and mind to European settlers.Notes on the State of Virginia, 1853, Query XITJF: Thomas Jefferson's Enlightenment and American Indians Notes was first published in 1785 in French and appeared in English in 1787.Bernstein, 2004, p. 78. Biographer George Tucker considered the work \\"surprising in the extent of the information which a single individual had been thus able to acquire, as to the physical features of the state\\",Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 166. and Merrill D. Peterson described it as an accomplishment for which all Americans should be grateful.Peterson, 1970, ch. 5. =Member of Congress= Independence Hall Assembly Room where Jefferson served in Congress The United States formed a Congress of the Confederation following victory in the Revolutionary War and a peace treaty with Great Britain in 1783, to which Jefferson was appointed as a Virginia delegate. He was a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates and recommended an American currency based on the decimal system which was adopted.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, pp. 172‚Äì73. He advised the formation of the Committee of the States to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess.Peterson, 1970, p. 275. The Committee met when Congress adjourned, but disagreements rendered it dysfunctional.Rayner, 1834, p. 207. In the Congress's 1783‚Äì84 session, Jefferson acted as chairman of committees to establish a viable system of government for the new Republic and to propose a policy for the settlement of the western territories. Jefferson was the principal author of the Land Ordinance of 1784, whereby Virginia ceded to the national government the vast area that it claimed northwest of the Ohio River. He insisted that this territory should not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states, but that it should be divided into sections which could become states. He plotted borders for nine new states in their initial stages and wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation's territories. Congress made extensive revisions, including rejection of the ban on slavery.Peterson, 1960, pp. 189‚Äì90.Finkelman, 1989, pp. 21‚Äì51. The provisions banning slavery were known later as the \\"Jefferson Proviso;\\" they were modified and implemented three years later in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and became the law for the entire Northwest. =Minister to France= Portrait of Thomas Jefferson while in London in 1786 by Mather Brown In 1784, Jefferson was sent by the Congress of the Confederation to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris as Minister Plenipotentiary for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce with Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia, Denmark, Saxony, Hamburg, Spain, Portugal, Naples, Sardinia, The Pope, Venice, Genoa, Tuscany, the Sublime Porte, Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.\\"Enclosure I: Commission for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce, 16 May 1784,\\" Founders Online, National Archives, last modified June 13, 2018, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-07-02-0214. [Original source: The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 7, March 2, 1784 ‚Äì February 25, 1785, ed. Julian P. Boyd. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1953, pp. 262‚Äì265.] Some believed that the recently widowed Jefferson was depressed and that the assignment would distract him from his wife's death.Peterson, 1970, pp. 289‚Äì94. With his young daughter Patsy and two servants, he departed in July 1784, arriving in Paris the next month.Stewart, 1997, p. 39.Meacham, 2012, p. 180. Less than a year later he was assigned the additional duty of succeeding Franklin as Minister to France. French foreign minister Count de Vergennes commented, \\"You replace Monsieur Franklin, I hear.\\" Jefferson replied, \\"I succeed. No man can replace him.\\"McCullough, 2001, p. 330. During his five years in Paris, Jefferson played a leading role in shaping the foreign policy of the United States.Bowers, 1945, pp.vii-viii Jefferson had Patsy educated at the Pentemont Abbey. In 1786, he met and fell in love with Maria Cosway, an accomplished‚Äîand married‚ÄîItalian-English musician of 27. They saw each other frequently over a period of six weeks. She returned to Great Britain, but they maintained a lifelong correspondence.TJF: Maria Cosway (Engraving) Jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child, nine-year-old Polly, in June 1787, who was accompanied on her voyage by a young slave from Monticello, Sally Hemings. Jefferson had taken her older brother James Hemings to Paris as part of his domestic staff, and had him trained in French cuisine.Gordon-Reed, 2008, pp. 156, 164‚Äì68. According to Sally's son, Madison Hemings, the 16-year-old Sally and Jefferson began a sexual relationship in Paris, where she became pregnant. According to his account, Hemings agreed to return to the United States only after Jefferson promised to free her children when they came of age. While in France, Jefferson became a regular companion of the Marquis de Lafayette, a French hero of the American Revolutionary War, and Jefferson used his influence to procure trade agreements with France.Bowers, 1945, p. 328.Burstein, 2010, p. 120. As the French Revolution began, Jefferson allowed his Paris residence, the H√¥tel de Langeac, to be used for meetings by Lafayette and other republicans. He was in Paris during the storming of the Bastille and consulted with Lafayette while the latter drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.Meacham, 2012, pp. 222‚Äì23. Jefferson often found his mail opened by postmasters, so he invented his own enciphering device, the \\"Wheel Cipher\\"; he wrote important communications in code for the rest of his career.TJF: Coded Messages Jefferson left Paris for America in September 1789, intending to return soon; however, President George Washington appointed him the country's first Secretary of State, forcing him to remain in the nation's capital.Ellis, 1996, pp. 116‚Äì17. Jefferson remained a firm supporter of the French Revolution while opposing its more violent elements.Ellis, 1996, p. 110; Wood, 2010, pp. 179‚Äì81. =Secretary of State= Thomas Jefferson in 1791 at 49 by Charles Willson Peale Soon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted Washington's invitation to serve as Secretary of State.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 334. Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital. Jefferson opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of various states' debts by the federal government.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, pp. 364‚Äì69. Hamilton also had bold plans to establish the national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet. Jefferson later left the cabinet voluntarily.Chernow, 2004, p. 427. The second major issue was the capital's permanent location. Hamilton favored a capital close to the major commercial centers of the Northeast, while Washington, Jefferson, and other agrarians wanted it located to the south.Cooke, 1970, pp. 523‚Äì45. After lengthy deadlock, the Compromise of 1790 was struck, permanently locating the capital on the Potomac River, and the federal government assumed the war debts of all thirteen states. While serving in the government in Philadelphia, Jefferson and political protegee Congressman James Madison founded the National Gazette in 1791, along with poet and writer Phillip Freneau, in an effort to counter Hamilton's Federalist policies, which Hamilton was promoting through the influential Federalist newspaper the Gazette of the United States. The National Gazette made particular criticism of the policies promoted by Hamilton, often through anonymous essays signed by the pen name Brutus at Jefferson's urging, which were actually written by Madison.Bernstein, 2003, p. 96. In the Spring of 1791, Jefferson and Madison took a vacation to Vermont. Jefferson had been suffering from migraines and he was tired of Hamilton in- fighting.Randall (1996), p. 1. In May 1792, Jefferson was alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, urging him to run for re-election that year as a unifying influence.Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 429. He urged the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of Democratic-Republican Party principles.Greider, 2010, p. 246. Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored states' rights and local control and opposed federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more power for the federal government.Wood, 2010, pp. 145‚Äì49. Jefferson supported France against Britain when the two nations fought in 1793, though his arguments in the Cabinet were undercut by French Revolutionary envoy Edmond-Charles Gen√™t's open scorn for President Washington.Wood, 2010, pp. 186‚Äì88. In his discussions with British Minister George Hammond, Jefferson tried unsuccessfully to persuade the British to acknowledge their violation of the Treaty of Paris, to vacate their posts in the Northwest, and to compensate the U.S. for slaves whom the British had freed at the end of the war. Seeking a return to private life, Jefferson resigned the cabinet position in December 1793, perhaps to bolster his political influence from outside the administration.Ellis, 1996, p. 119; Meacham, 2012, pp. 283‚Äì84; Tucker, 1837, v. 1, p. 523. After the Washington administration negotiated the Jay Treaty with Great Britain (1794), Jefferson saw a cause around which to rally his party and organized a national opposition from Monticello.Meacham, 2012, pp. 293‚Äì94. The treaty, designed by Hamilton, aimed to reduce tensions and increase trade. Jefferson warned that it would increase British influence and subvert republicanism, calling it \\"the boldest act [Hamilton and Jay] ever ventured on to undermine the government\\".Peterson, 1970, ch.8 [e-book]. The Treaty passed, but it expired in 1805 during Jefferson's administration and was not renewed. Jefferson continued his pro-French stance; during the violence of the Reign of Terror, he declined to disavow the revolution: \\"To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America.\\"Yarbrough, 2006, p. xx. =Election of 1796 and vice presidency= 1796 election results In the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams by 71‚Äì68 and was elected vice president because of a mistake in voting for Adams's running mate. As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams. He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an \\"honorable and easy\\" role.Meacham, 2012, p. 305. Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years, making him unusually well qualified to serve as presiding officer. In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as A Manual of Parliamentary Practice.Bernstein, 2003, pp. 117‚Äì18. Jefferson would cast only three tie-breaking votes in the Senate. Jefferson held four confidential talks with French consul Joseph L√©tombe in the spring of 1797 where he attacked Adams, predicting that his rival would serve only one term. He also encouraged France to invade England, and advised L√©tombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing him to \\"listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings.\\"Elkins, 1994, p. 566. This toughened the tone that the French government adopted toward the Adams administration. After Adams's initial peace envoys were rebuffed, Jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related to the incident, called the XYZ Affair after the letters used to disguise the identities of the French officials involved.Chernow, 2004, p. 550. However, the tactic backfired when it was revealed that French officials had demanded bribes, rallying public support against France. The U.S. began an undeclared naval war with France known as the Quasi-War.Meacham, 2012, p. 312. During the Adams presidency, the Federalists rebuilt the military, levied new taxes, and enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson believed that these laws were intended to suppress Democratic-Republicans, rather than prosecute enemy aliens, and considered them unconstitutional.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, p. 54. To rally opposition, he and James Madison anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states.Wood, 2010, pp. 269‚Äì71. The resolutions followed the \\"interposition\\" approach of Madison, in which states may shield their citizens from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional. Jefferson advocated nullification, allowing states to invalidate federal laws altogether.Meacham, 2012, p. 318. Jefferson warned that, \\"unless arrested at the threshold\\", the Alien and Sedition Acts would \\"necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood\\".Onuf, 2000, p. 73. Historian Ron Chernow claims that \\"the theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions was deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion\\", contributing to the American Civil War as well as later events.Chernow, 2004, p. 574. Washington was so appalled by the resolutions that he told Patrick Henry that, if \\"systematically and pertinaciously pursued\\", the resolutions would \\"dissolve the union or produce coercion.\\"Chernow, 2004, p. 587. Jefferson had always admired Washington's leadership skills but felt that his Federalist party was leading the country in the wrong direction. Jefferson thought it wise not to attend his funeral in 1799 because of acute differences with Washington while serving as Secretary of State, and remained at Monticello.Meacham, 2012, p. 323. =Election of 1800= 1800 election results In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson contended once more against Federalist John Adams. Adams's campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War.Bernstein, 2003, pp. 126‚Äì28; McCullough, 2001, p. 556. Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French.McCullough, 2001, pp. 543‚Äì44. Historian Joyce Appleby said the election was \\"one of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history\\".Appleby, 2003, pp. 27‚Äì28. Republicans ultimately won more electoral college votes, but Jefferson and his vice-presidential candidate Aaron Burr unexpectedly received an equal total. Due to the tie, the election was decided by the Federalist-dominated House of Representatives.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, p. 75; Wood, 2010, p. 278. Hamilton lobbied Federalist representatives on Jefferson's behalf, believing him a lesser political evil than Burr. On February 17, 1801, after thirty-six ballots, the House elected Jefferson president and Burr vice president. The win was marked by Republican celebrations throughout the country.Meacham, 2012, pp. 340‚Äì41. Some of Jefferson's opponents argued that he owed his victory over Adams to the South's inflated number of electors, due to counting slaves as partial population under the Three-Fifths Compromise.Ferling, 2004, p. 208. Others alleged that Jefferson secured James Asheton Bayard's tie- breaking electoral vote by guaranteeing the retention of various Federalist posts in the government.Wood, 2010, pp. 284‚Äì85. Jefferson disputed the allegation, and the historical record is inconclusive.Meacham, 2012, pp. 337‚Äì38. The transition proceeded smoothly, marking a watershed in American history. As historian Gordon S. Wood writes, \\"it was one of the first popular elections in modern history that resulted in the peaceful transfer of power from one 'party' to another.\\" Presidency (1801‚Äì1809) Jefferson was sworn in by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington, D.C. on March 4, 1801. In contrast to his predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette; he arrived alone on horseback without escort, dressed plainlyWood, 2010, pp. 287‚Äì88. and, after dismounting, retired his own horse to the nearby stable.Hale, 1896, Illustrious Americans, p. 124. His inaugural address struck a note of reconciliation, declaring, \\"We have been called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.\\"Meacham, 2012, pp. 348‚Äì50. Ideologically, Jefferson stressed \\"equal and exact justice to all men\\", minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and press.Peterson (2002), p. 40. He said that a free and democratic government was \\"the strongest government on earth.\\" He nominated moderate Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as Secretary of State, Henry Dearborn as Secretary of War, Levi Lincoln as Attorney General, and Robert Smith as Secretary of the Navy. Upon assuming office, he first confronted an $83 million national debt. He began dismantling Hamilton's Federalist fiscal system with help from Secretary of Treasury Albert Gallatin.Peterson, 2002, p. 41. Jefferson's administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing \\"unnecessary offices\\" and cutting \\"useless establishments and expenses\\".Wood, 2010, p. 293.Bailey, 2007, p. 216. They attempted to disassemble the national bank and its effect of increasing national debt, but were dissuaded by Gallatin.Wills, 2002, pp. 50‚Äì51. Jefferson shrank the Navy, deeming it unnecessary in peacetime.Chernow, 2004, p. 671. Instead, he incorporated a fleet of inexpensive gunboats used only for defense with the idea that they would not provoke foreign hostilities. After two terms, he had lowered the national debt from $83 million to $57 million.Meacham, 2012, p. 387. Jefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts.Meacham, 2012, p. 357. Congressional Republicans repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which removed nearly all of Adams's \\"midnight judges\\" from office. A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Marbury v. Madison, asserting judicial review over executive branch actions.Meacham, 2012, p. 375. Jefferson appointed three Supreme Court justices: William Johnson (1804), Henry Brockholst Livingston (1807), and Thomas Todd (1807).Urofsky, 2006, p. viii. Jefferson strongly felt the need for a national military university, producing an officer engineering corps for a national defense based on the advancement of the sciences, rather than having to rely on foreign sources for top grade engineers with questionable loyalty.Scythes, 2014, pp. 693‚Äì94. He signed the Military Peace Establishment Act on March 16, 1802, thus founding the United States Military Academy at West Point. The Act documented in 29 sections a new set of laws and limits for the military. Jefferson was also hoping to bring reform to the Executive branch, replacing Federalists and active opponents throughout the officer corps to promote Republican values.Scythes, 2014, pp. 422‚Äì23. Jefferson took great interest in the Library of Congress, which had been established in 1800. He often recommended books to acquire. In 1802, an act of Congress authorized President Jefferson to name the first Librarian of Congress and gave itself the power to establish library rules and regulations. This act also granted the president and vice president the right to use the library. =White House hostess= Jefferson needed a hostess when ladies were present at the White House. His wife, Martha, had died in 1782. Jefferson's two daughters, Martha Jefferson Randolph and Maria Jefferson Eppes, occasionally served in that role. On May 27, 1801, Jefferson asked Dolly Madison, wife of his long time friend James Madison, to be the permanent White House hostess. She accepted, realizing the diplomatic importance of the position. She was also in charge of the completion of the White House mansion. Dolly served as White House hostess for the rest of Jefferson's two terms and then eight more years as First Lady to President James Madison, Jefferson's successor. Historians have speculated that Martha Jefferson would have been an elegant First Lady on par with Martha Washington. Although she died before her husband took office, Martha Jefferson is sometimes considered the First Lady. =First Barbary War= Barbary Coast of North Africa 1806. Left is Morocco at Gibraltar, center is Tunis, and right is Tripoli. American merchant ships had been protected from Barbary Coast pirates by the Royal Navy when the states were British colonies.Fremont-Barnes, 2006, p. 32. After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S. merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom. Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the Barbary States since 1785.Fremont-Barnes, 2006, p. 36. In March 1786, he and John Adams went to London to negotiate with Tripoli's envoy, ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja).First Barbary War In 1801, he authorized a U.S. Navy fleet under Commodore Richard Dale to make a show of force in the Mediterranean, the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic.Meacham, 2012, pp. 364‚Äì65. Following the fleet's first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war. The subsequent \\"First Barbary War\\" was the first foreign war fought by the U.S.Herring, 2008, p. 97. Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and Subjects of Ottoman Tripolitania, known popularly as the Treaty of Tripoli, handwritten in Arabic with Maghrebi script, signed November 4, 1796. Pasha of Tripoli Yusuf Karamanli captured the , so Jefferson authorized William Eaton, the U.S. Consul to Tunis, to lead a force to restore the pasha's older brother to the throne.Wood, 2010, p. 638. The American navy forced Tunis and Algiers into breaking their alliance with Tripoli. Jefferson ordered five separate naval bombardments of Tripoli, leading the pasha to sign a treaty that restored peace in the Mediterranean.Bernstein. 2003, p. 146. This victory proved only temporary, but according to Wood, \\"many Americans celebrated it as a vindication of their policy of spreading free trade around the world and as a great victory for liberty over tyranny.\\"Wood, 2010, p. 639. =Louisiana Purchase= The 1803 Louisiana Purchase totaled , doubling the size of the United States. Spain ceded ownership of the Louisiana territory in 1800 to the more predominant France. Jefferson was greatly concerned that Napoleon's broad interests in the vast territory would threaten the security of the continent and Mississippi River shipping. He wrote that the cession \\"works most sorely on the U.S. It completely reverses all the political relations of the U.S.\\"Meacham, 2012, pp. 383‚Äì84. In 1802, he instructed James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston to negotiate with Napoleon to purchase New Orleans and adjacent coastal areas from France.Wood, 2010, p. 368. In early 1803, Jefferson offered Napoleon nearly $10 million for of tropical territory.Freehling, 2005, p. 69. Napoleon realized that French military control was impractical over such a vast remote territory, and he was in dire need of funds for his wars on the home front. In early April 1803, he unexpectedly made negotiators a counter-offer to sell of French territory for $15 million, doubling the size of the United States. U.S. negotiators seized this unique opportunity and accepted the offer and signed the treaty on April 30, 1803. Word of the unexpected purchase didn't reach Jefferson until July 3, 1803. He unknowingly acquired the most fertile tract of land of its size on Earth, making the new country self-sufficient in food and other resources. The sale also significantly curtailed British and French imperial ambitions in North America, removing obstacles to U.S. westward expansion.Ellis, 2008, pp. 207‚Äì08. Most thought that this was an exceptional opportunity, despite Republican reservations about the Constitutional authority of the federal government to acquire land.Wilentz, 2005, p. 108. Jefferson initially thought that a Constitutional amendment was necessary to purchase and govern the new territory; but he later changed his mind, fearing that this would give cause to oppose the purchase, and he, therefore, urged a speedy debate and ratification.Meecham, 2012, pp. 389‚Äì90. On October 20, 1803, the Senate ratified the purchase treaty by a vote of 24‚Äì7.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, pp. 152‚Äì54. After the purchase, Jefferson preserved the region's Spanish legal code and instituted a gradual approach for integrating settlers into American democracy. He believed that a period of federal rule would be necessary while Louisianians adjusted to their new nation.Peterson, 1970, p. 777; Wood, 2010, p. 372; Ellis, 2008, p. 230. Historians have differed in their assessments regarding the constitutional implications of the sale,Ellis, 2008, pp. 231‚Äì32. but they typically hail the Louisiana acquisition as a major accomplishment. Frederick Jackson Turner called the purchase the most formative event in American history. Attempted annexation of Florida In the aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex West Florida from Spain, a nation under the control of Emperor Napoleon and the French Empire after 1804. In his annual message to Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations. A few days later Jefferson secretly requested a two million dollar expenditure to purchase Florida. Representative and floor leader John Randolph, however, opposed annexation and was upset over Jefferson's secrecy on the matter. The Two Million Dollar bill passed only after Jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace Randolph with Barnabas Bidwell as floor leader. This aroused suspicion of Jefferson and charges of undue executive influence over Congress. Jefferson signed the bill into law in February 1806. Six weeks later the law was made public. The two million dollars was to be given to France as payment, in turn, to put pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States. France, however, was in no mood to allow Spain give up Florida, and refused the offer. Florida remained under the control of Spain. The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters. =Lewis and Clark expedition= Corps of Discovery, October 1805 Jefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the Louisiana Purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping of the uncharted territory. He sought to establish a U.S. claim ahead of competing European interests and to find the rumored Northwest Passage.Ambrose, 1996, pp. 76, 418. Jefferson and others were influenced by exploration accounts of Le Page du Pratz in Louisiana (1763) and Captain James Cook in the Pacific (1784),Ambrose, 1996, p. 154. and they persuaded Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean.Rodriguez, 2002, pp. xxiv, 162, 185. Jefferson appointed Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to be leaders of the Corps of Discovery (1803‚Äì1806).Rodriguez, 2002, pp. 112, 186. In the months leading up to the expedition, Jefferson tutored Lewis in the sciences of mapping, botany, natural history, mineralogy, and astronomy and navigation, giving him unlimited access to his library at Monticello, which included the largest collection of books in the world on the subject of the geography and natural history of the North American continent, along with an impressive collection of maps.Ambrose, 1996, pp. 54, 80. The expedition lasted from May 1804 to September 1806 (see Timeline) and obtained a wealth of scientific and geographic knowledge, including knowledge of many Indian tribes.Ambrose, 1996, pp. 154, 409, 512. ;Other expeditions In addition to the Corps of Discovery, Jefferson organized three other western expeditions: the William Dunbar and George Hunter expedition on the Ouachita River (1804‚Äì1805), the Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition (1806) on the Red River, and the Zebulon Pike Expedition (1806‚Äì1807) into the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest. All three produced valuable information about the American frontier.Berry, 2006, p. xi. =American Indian policies= Black Hoof, leader of the Shawnee, accepted Jefferson's Indian assimilation policies. Jefferson's experiences with the American Indians began during his boyhood in Virginia and extended through his political career and into his retirement. He refuted the contemporary notion that Indians were inferior people and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of European descent.TJF: American Indians As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson recommended moving the Cherokee and Shawnee tribes, who had allied with the British, to west of the Mississippi River. But when he took office as president, he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict, as American and Indian societies were in collision and the British were inciting Indian tribes from Canada.Miller, 2008, p. 90.Sheehan, 1974, pp. 120‚Äì21. In Georgia, he stipulated that the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for military support in expelling the Cherokee from Georgia. This facilitated his policy of western expansion, to \\"advance compactly as we multiply\\".Peterson, 1970, ch. 9. In keeping with his Enlightenment thinking, President Jefferson adopted an assimilation policy toward American Indians known as his \\"civilization program\\" which included securing peaceful U.S. ‚Äì Indian treaty alliances and encouraging agriculture. Jefferson advocated that Indian tribes should make federal purchases by credit holding their lands as collateral for repayment. Various tribes accepted Jefferson's policies, including the Shawnees led by Black Hoof, the Creek, and the Cherokees. However, some Shawnees broke off from Black Hoof, led by Tecumseh, and opposed Jefferson's assimilation policies.TJF: President Jefferson and the Indian Nations Historian Bernard Sheehan argues that Jefferson believed that assimilation was best for American Indians; second best was removal to the west. He felt that the worst outcome of the cultural and resources conflict between American citizens and American Indians would be their attacking the whites. Jefferson told Secretary of War General Henry Dearborn (Indian affairs were then under the War Department), \\"If we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated or driven beyond the Mississippi.\\"The Life and Writings of Thomas Jefferson, pp. 265‚Äì66. Miller agrees that Jefferson believed that Indians should assimilate to American customs and agriculture. Historians such as Peter S. Onuf and Merrill D. Peterson argue that Jefferson's actual Indian policies did little to promote assimilation and were a pretext to seize lands.Miller, 2008, p. 94. =Re-election in 1804 and second term= 1804 Electoral College vote Jefferson's successful first term occasioned his re- nomination for president by the Republican party, with George Clinton replacing Burr as his running mate.Meacham, 2012, pp. 405‚Äì06. The Federalist party ran Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, John Adams's vice- presidential candidate in the 1800 election. The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes, and the Louisiana Purchase. In March 1806, a split developed in the Republican party, led by fellow Virginian and former Republican ally John Randolph who viciously accused President Jefferson on the floor of the House of moving too far in the Federalist direction. In so doing, Randolph permanently set himself apart politically from Jefferson. Jefferson and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports in retaliation for British actions against American shipping. Also, in 1808, Jefferson was the first president to propose a broad Federal plan to build roads and canals across several states, asking for $20 million, further alarming Randolph and believers of limited government.Meacham, 2012, pp. 415‚Äì17. Jefferson's popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in Europe. Positive relations with Great Britain had diminished, due partly to the antipathy between Jefferson and British diplomat Anthony Merry. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, Napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights, which American efforts failed to counter. Jefferson then led the enactment of the Embargo Act of 1807, directed at both France and Great Britain. This triggered economic chaos in the U.S. and was strongly criticized at the time, resulting in Jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, pp. 291‚Äì94. During the revolutionary era, the states abolished the international slave trade, but South Carolina reopened it. In his annual message of December 1806, Jefferson denounced the \\"violations of human rights\\" attending the international slave trade, calling on the newly elected Congress to criminalize it immediately. In 1807, Congress passed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, which Jefferson signed.Miller, 1980, pp. 145‚Äì46.Randall, 1994, p. 583. The act established severe punishment against the international slave trade, although it did not address the issue domestically.Kaplan, 1999, p. 407. In the wake of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson sought to annex Florida from Spain, as brokered by Napoleon.Peterson, 2002, p. 49. Congress agreed to the president's request to secretly appropriate purchase money in the \\"$2,000,000 Bill\\". The Congressional funding drew criticism from Randolph, who believed that the money would wind up in the coffers of Napoleon. The bill was signed into law; however, negotiations for the project failed. Jefferson lost clout among fellow Republicans, and his use of unofficial Congressional channels was sharply criticized. In Haiti, Jefferson's neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its Revolution, and blocked attempts to assist Napoleon, who was defeated there in 1803.Jefferson, Haiti The Journal of Southern History 61, no. 2 (May 1995), p. 221. But he refused official recognition of the country during his second term, in deference to southern complaints about the racial violence against slave-holders; it was eventually extended to Haiti in 1862.Bernstein, 2003, pp. 146‚Äì47. Domestically, Jefferson's grandson James Madison Randolph became the first child born in the White House in 1806.Malone, 1981, p. 11. =Burr conspiracy and trial= Aaron Burr Vanderlyn, 1802 Following the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship with his vice president, former New York Senator Aaron Burr, rapidly eroded. Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office. Burr was dropped from the Republican ticket in 1804. The same year, Burr was soundly defeated in his bid to be elected New York governor. During the campaign, Alexander Hamilton publicly made callous remarks regarding Burr's moral character.Chernow, 2004, p. 714. Subsequently, Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel, mortally wounding him on July 11, 1804. Burr was indicted for Hamilton's murder in New York and New Jersey, causing him to flee to Georgia, although he remained President of the Senate during Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase's impeachment trial.Wood, 2010, pp. 385‚Äì86. Both indictments quietly died and Burr was not prosecuted.Banner (1974), p. 34. Also during the election, certain New England separatists approached Burr, desiring a New England federation and intimating that he would be their leader.Banner (1974), pp. 34‚Äì35. However, nothing came of the plot, since Burr had lost the election and his reputation was ruined after killing Hamilton. In August 1804, Burr contacted British Minister Anthony Merry offering to capture U.S. western territory in return for money and British ships.The Burr Conspiracy (2000) After leaving office in April 1805, Burr traveled west and conspired with Louisiana Territory governor James Wilkinson, beginning a large-scale recruitment for a military expedition.Peterson (2002), p. 50. Other plotters included Ohio Senator John Smith and an Irishman named Harmon Blennerhassett. Burr discussed a number of plots‚Äîseizing control of Mexico or Spanish Florida, or forming a secessionist state in New Orleans or the Western U.S. Historians remain unclear as to his true goal.Wood, 2010, pp. 385‚Äì86; Meacham, 2012, pp. 420, 422. In the fall of 1806, Burr launched a military flotilla carrying about 60 men down the Ohio River. Wilkinson renounced the plot, apparently from self-interested motives; he reported Burr's expedition to Jefferson, who immediately ordered Burr's arrest.Meacham, 2012, p. 420.Banner (1974), p. 37. On February 13, 1807, Burr was captured in Louisiana's Bayou Pierre wilderness and sent to Virginia to be tried for treason. Burr's 1807 conspiracy trial became a national issue.Appleby, 2003, p. 100; Bernstein, 2003, p. 162. Jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the verdict by telling Congress that Burr's guilt was \\"beyond question\\", but the case came before his longtime political foe John Marshall, who dismissed the treason charge. Burr's legal team at one stage subpoenaed Jefferson, but Jefferson refused to testify, making the first argument for executive privilege. Instead, Jefferson provided relevant legal documents.Bernstein, 2003, pp. 163‚Äì64; Meacham, 2012, pp. 422‚Äì23. After a three-month trial, the jury found Burr not guilty, while Jefferson denounced his acquittal.Banner, 1974, p. 37.Bernstein, 2003, p. 165.Appleby, 2003, p. 101. Jefferson subsequently removed Wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the U.S. military. Historian James N. Banner criticized Jefferson for continuing to trust Wilkinson, a \\"faithless plotter\\". =General Wilkinson misconduct= Commanding General James Wilkinson was a hold over of the Washington and Adams administrations. Wilkinson was rumored to be a \\"skillful and unscrupolous plotter\\". In 1804, Wilkinson received 12,000 pesos from the Spanish for information on American boundary plans. Wilkinson also received advances on his salary and payments on claims submitted to Secretary of War Henry Dearborn. This damaging information apparently was unknown to Jefferson. In 1805, Jefferson trusted Wilkinson, and appointed him Louisiana Territory governor, admiring Wilkinson's work ethic. In January 1806 Jefferson received information from Kentucky U.S. Attorney Joseph Davies that Wilkinson was on the Spanish payroll. Jefferson took no action against Wilkinson, there being, at the time, lack of evidence against Wilkinson. An investigation by the House in December 1807 exonerated Wilkinson. In 1808, a military court looked into Wilkinson, but lacked evidence to charge Wilkinson. Jefferson retained Wilkinson in the Army and he was passed on by Jefferson to Jefferson's successor James Madison. Twentieth Century evidence, revealed in Spanish archives, proved Wilkinson was on the Spanish payroll. =Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard affair and Embargo Act= HMS Leopard (right) firing upon USS Chesapeake The British conducted raids on American shipping and kidnapped seamen in 1806‚Äì07; thousands of Americans were thus impressed into the British naval service. In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced. Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and William Pinkney to negotiate with Great Britain to end the harassment of American shipping, though Britain showed no signs of improving relations. The Monroe‚ÄìPinkney Treaty was finalized but lacked any provisions to end impressment, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification.Hayes, 2008, pp. 504‚Äì05. The British ship fired upon the off the Virginia coast in June 1807, and Jefferson prepared for war.TJF: Embargo of 1807 He issued a proclamation banning armed British ships from U.S. waters. He presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100,000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms, ammunition, and supplies, writing, \\"The laws of necessity, of self- preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation [than strict observance of written laws]\\". The was dispatched to demand an explanation from the British government; it also was fired upon. Jefferson called for a special session of Congress in October to enact an embargo or alternatively to consider war.Meacham, 2012, pp. 425‚Äì29. In December, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the Berlin Decree, globally banning British imports. In Britain, King George III ordered redoubling efforts at impressment, including American sailors. But the war fever of the summer faded; Congress had no appetite to prepare the U.S. for war. Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S. more time to build up defensive works, militias, and naval forces. Later historians have seen irony in Jefferson's assertion of such federal power. Meacham claims that the Embargo Act was a projection of power which surpassed the Alien and Sedition Acts, and R. B. Bernstein writes that Jefferson \\"was pursuing policies resembling those he had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution\\".Meacham, 2012, p. 430; Bernstein, 2003, p. 168. A political cartoon showing merchants dodging the \\"Ograbme\\", which is \\"Embargo\\" spelled backwards (1807) Secretary of State James Madison supported the embargo with equal vigor to Jefferson,Burstein, 2010, pp. 497‚Äì98. while Treasury Secretary Gallatin opposed it, due to its indefinite time frame and the risk that it posed to the policy of American neutrality.Meacham, 2012, p. 430. The U.S. economy suffered, criticism grew, and opponents began evading the embargo. Instead of retreating, Jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators.Tucker, 1990, v. 1, pp. 204‚Äì09, 232. Three acts were passed in Congress during 1807 and 1808, called the Supplementary, the Additional, and the Enforcement acts. The government could not prevent American vessels from trading with the European belligerents once they had left American ports, although the embargo triggered a devastating decline in exports. Most historians consider Jefferson's embargo to have been ineffective and harmful to American interests.Cogliano, 2008, p. 250; Meacham, 2012, p. 475. Appleby describes the strategy as Jefferson's \\"least effective policy\\", and Joseph Ellis calls it \\"an unadulterated calamity\\".Appleby, 2003, p. 145; Ellis, 1996, p. 237. Others, however, portray it as an innovative, nonviolent measure which aided France in its war with Britain while preserving American neutrality.Hayes, 2008, pp. 504‚Äì05; Kaplan, 1999, pp. 166‚Äì68. Jefferson believed that the failure of the embargo was due to selfish traders and merchants showing a lack of \\"republican virtue.\\" He maintained that, had the embargo been widely observed, it would have avoided war in 1812.Hayes, 2008, pp. 504‚Äì05; Peterson, 1960, pp. 289‚Äì90. In December 1807, Jefferson announced his intention not to seek a third term. He turned his attention increasingly to Monticello during the last year of his presidency, giving Madison and Gallatin almost total control of affairs.Ellis, 1996, p. 238; Appleby, 2003, pp. 128‚Äì29. Shortly before leaving office in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the Embargo. In its place, the Non-Intercourse Act was passed, but it proved no more effective. The day before Madison was inaugurated as his successor, Jefferson said that he felt like \\"a prisoner, released from his chains\\".Ellis, 1996, p. 238. Post-presidency (1809‚Äì1826) Portrait of Jefferson by Gilbert Stuart, 1821. Following his retirement from the presidency, Jefferson continued his pursuit of educational interests; he sold his vast collection of books to the Library of Congress, and founded and built the University of Virginia.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, p. 479. Jefferson continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders, and the Monroe Doctrine bears a strong resemblance to solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823.Meacham, 2012, pp. 481‚Äì82. As he settled into private life at Monticello, Jefferson developed a daily routine of rising early. He would spend several hours writing letters, with which he was often deluged. In the midday, he would often inspect the plantation on horseback. In the evenings, his family enjoyed leisure time in the gardens; late at night, Jefferson would retire to bed with a book.TJF: I Rise with the Sun However, his routine was often interrupted by uninvited visitors and tourists eager to see the icon in his final days, turning Monticello into \\"a virtual hotel\\".Ellis, 1996, p. 232; Meacham, 2012, pp. 463‚Äì65. =University of Virginia= The University of Virginia, Jefferson's \\"Academical Village\\" Jefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other colleges. He believed that education engendered a stable society, which should provide publicly funded schools accessible to students from all social strata, based solely on ability.U Va. Library He initially proposed his University in a letter to Joseph Priestley in 1800Adams, 1888, p. 48. and, in 1819, the 76-year-old Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. He organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and, with the assistance of Edmund Bacon, purchased the location. He was the principal designer of the buildings, planned the university's curriculum, and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825.Peterson, 1970, ch. 11 [e-book]. Jefferson was a strong disciple of Greek and Roman architectural styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy. Each academic unit, called a pavilion, was designed with a two-story temple front, while the library \\"Rotunda\\" was modeled on the Roman Pantheon. Jefferson referred to the university's grounds as the \\"Academical Village,\\" and he reflected his educational ideas in its layout. The ten pavilions included classrooms and faculty residences; they formed a quadrangle and were connected by colonnades, behind which stood the students' rows of rooms. Gardens and vegetable plots were placed behind the pavilions and were surrounded by serpentine walls, affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle.Hogan, 1987, pp. 28‚Äì29. The university had a library rather than a church at its center, emphasizing its secular nature‚Äîa controversial aspect at the time.Gordon-Reed, 2008, p. 649. When Jefferson died in 1826, James Madison replaced him as rector.TJF: James Madison Jefferson bequeathed most of his library to the university.Crawford, 2008, p. 235. =Reconciliation with Adams= In 1804, Abigail Adams attempted to reconcile Jefferson and Adams. Jefferson and John Adams had been good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s. The Federalist/Republican split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson's sponsorship of partisan attacks, such as those of James Callender. Jefferson, on the other hand, was angered at Adams for his appointment of \\"midnight judges\\".Freeman, 2008, p. 12. The two men did not communicate directly for more than a decade after Jefferson succeeded Adams as president.Ellis, 2003, pp. 207, 209. A brief correspondence took place between Abigail Adams and Jefferson after Jefferson's daughter \\"Polly\\" died in 1804, in an attempt at reconciliation unknown to Adams. However, an exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and Jefferson. As early as 1809, Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of Independence, desired that Jefferson and Adams reconcile and began to prod the two through correspondence to re-establish contact. In 1812, Adams wrote a short New Year's greeting to Jefferson, prompted earlier by Rush, to which Jefferson warmly responded. Thus began what historian David McCullough calls \\"one of the most extraordinary correspondences in American history\\".McCullough, 2001, pp. 603‚Äì05. Over the next fourteen years, the former presidents exchanged 158 letters discussing their political differences, justifying their respective roles in events, and debating the revolution's import to the world.Ellis, 2003, pp. 213, 230. When Adams died, his last words included an acknowledgment of his longtime friend and rival: \\"Thomas Jefferson survives\\", unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.McCullough, 2001, p. 646.Ellis, 2003, p. 248. =Autobiography= In 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson began writing his autobiography, in order to \\"state some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself\\".Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson, 1743‚Äì1790 He focused on the struggles and achievements he experienced until July 29, 1790, where the narrative stopped short.Berstein, 2003, p. 179. He excluded his youth, emphasizing the revolutionary era. He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights. Jefferson described his father as uneducated, but with a \\"strong mind and sound judgement\\". His enrollment in the College of William and Mary and election to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1775 were included. He also expressed opposition to the idea of a privileged aristocracy made up of large landowning families partial to the King, and instead promoted \\"the aristocracy of virtue and talent, which nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society, & scattered with equal hand through all its conditions, was deemed essential to a well-ordered republic\\". Jefferson gave his insight about people, politics, and events. The work is primarily concerned with the Declaration and reforming the government of Virginia. He used notes, letters, and documents to tell many of the stories within the autobiography. He suggested that this history was so rich that his personal affairs were better overlooked, but he incorporated a self-analysis using the Declaration and other patriotism.Hamelman, 2002, Journal =Lafayette's visit= Lafayette in 1824, portrait by Scheffer, hanging in U.S. House of Representatives In the summer of 1824, the Marquis de Lafayette accepted an invitation from President James Monroe to visit the country. Jefferson and Lafayette had not seen each other since 1789. After visits to New York, New England, and Washington, Lafayette arrived at Monticello on November 4. Jefferson's grandson Randolph was present and recorded the reunion: \\"As they approached each other, their uncertain gait quickened itself into a shuffling run, and exclaiming, 'Ah Jefferson!' 'Ah Lafayette!', they burst into tears as they fell into each other's arms.\\" Jefferson and Lafayette then retired to the house to reminisce.Mapp, 1991, p. 328. The next morning Jefferson, Lafayette, and James Madison attended a tour and banquet at the University of Virginia. Jefferson had someone else read a speech he had prepared for Lafayette, as his voice was weak and could not carry. This was his last public presentation. After an 11-day visit, Lafayette bid Jefferson goodbye and departed Monticello.Malone, 1981, pp. 403‚Äì04; Brodie, 1998, p. 460; Crawford, 2008, pp. 202‚Äì03. =Final days, death, and burial= alt=Obelisk at Thomas Jefferson's gravesite Jefferson's approximately $100,000 of debt weighed heavily on his mind in his final months, as it became increasingly clear that he would have little to leave to his heirs. In February 1826, he successfully applied to the General Assembly to hold a public lottery as a fundraiser.Ellis, 1996, pp. 287‚Äì88. His health began to deteriorate in July 1825, due to a combination of rheumatism from arm and wrist injuries, as well as intestinal and urinary disorders and, by June 1826, he was confined to bed. On July 3, Jefferson was overcome by fever and declined an invitation to Washington to attend an anniversary celebration of the Declaration.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, p. 551. During the last hours of his life, he was accompanied by family members and friends. Jefferson died on July 4 at 12:50 p.m. at age 83, the same day as the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. His last recorded words were \\"No, doctor, nothing more,\\" refusing laudanum from his physician, but his final significant words are often cited as \\"Is it the Fourth?\\" or \\"This is the Fourth.\\" When John Adams died, his last words included an acknowledgment of his longtime friend and rival: \\"Thomas Jefferson survives,\\" though Adams was unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.McCullough, 2001, p. 646Ellis, 2003, p. 248Rayner, 1834, pp. 428‚Äì29.Bernstein, 2003, p. 189. The sitting president was Adams's son, John Quincy Adams, and he called the coincidence of their deaths on the nation's anniversary \\"visible and palpable remarks of Divine Favor.\\"Meacham, 2012, p. 496. Shortly after Jefferson had died, attendants found a gold locket on a chain around his neck, where it had rested for more than 40 years, containing a small faded blue ribbon which tied a lock of his wife Martha's brown hair.Donaldson, 1898, p. 49. Jefferson's remains were buried at Monticello, under an epitaph that he wrote: > HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON, AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN > INDEPENDENCE, OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND FATHER > OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.Thomas Jefferson Foundation: \\"Thomas > Jefferson, A Brief Biography\\" In his advanced years, Jefferson became increasingly concerned that people understand the principles in and the people responsible for writing the Declaration of Independence, and he continually defended himself as its author. He considered the document one of his greatest life achievements, in addition to authoring the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and his founding of the University of Virginia. Plainly absent from his epitaph were his political roles, including President of the United States. Jefferson died deeply in debt, unable to pass on his estate freely to his heirs.Bernstein, 2003, p. xii. He gave instructions in his will for disposal of his assets,Tucker, 1837, v. 2, p. 556. including the freeing of Sally Hemings's children;Meacham, 2012, p. 495. but his estate, possessions, and slaves were sold at public auctions starting in 1827.Ellis, 1996, p. 289. In 1831, Monticello was sold by Martha Jefferson Randolph and the other heirs.Thomas Jefferson Foundation: \\"Sale of Monticello\\" Political, social, and religious views Jefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived.Hayes, 2008, p. 10.Cogliano, 2008, p. 14. He was also influenced by the writings of Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire.Cogliano, 2008, p. 26. Jefferson thought that the independent yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of republican virtues. He distrusted cities and financiers, favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies. He supported efforts to disestablish the Church of EnglandFerling, 2000, p. 158. wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and he pressed for a wall of separation between church and state.Mayer, 1994, p. 76. The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th-century British Whig Party, which believed in limited government.Wood, 2010, p. 287. His Democratic-Republican Party became dominant in early American politics, and his views became known as Jeffersonian democracy.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, pp. 559‚Äì67.Smith, 2003, p. 314. =Society and government= According to Jefferson's philosophy, citizens have \\"certain inalienable rights\\" and \\"rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will, within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others.\\"Bassani, 2010, p. 113. A staunch advocate of the jury system to protect people's liberties, he proclaimed in 1801, \\"I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.\\"Wilson, 2012, p. 584. Jeffersonian government not only prohibited individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of others, but also restrained itself from diminishing individual liberty as a protection against tyranny from the majority.Mayer, 1994, p. 328. Initially, Jefferson favored restricted voting to those who could actually have the free exercise of their reason by escaping any corrupting dependence on others. He advocated enfranchising a majority of Virginians, seeking to expand suffrage to include \\"yeoman farmers\\" who owned their own land while excluding tenant farmers, city day laborers, vagrants, most Amerindians, and women. He was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of political equality, which were threatened by arbitrary government.Peterson, 1960, p. 340. Excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruption rather than human nature. He was less suspicious of a working democracy than many contemporaries.Wood, 2011, pp. 220‚Äì27. As president, Jefferson feared that the Federalist system enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence. He tried to restore a balance between the state and federal governments more nearly reflecting the Articles of Confederation, seeking to reinforce state prerogatives where his party was in a majority. Jefferson was steeped in the British Whig tradition of the oppressed majority set against a repeatedly unresponsive court party in the Parliament. He justified small outbreaks of rebellion as necessary to get monarchial regimes to amend oppressive measures compromising popular liberties. In a republican regime ruled by the majority, he acknowledged \\"it will often be exercised when wrong.\\"Golden & Golden, 2002, p. 60. But \\"the remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them.\\"Meacham, 2012, p. 213. The full letter to William S. Smith can be seen at the Library of Congress As Jefferson saw his party triumph in two terms of his presidency and launch into a third term under James Madison, his view of the U.S. as a continental republic and an \\"empire of liberty\\" grew more upbeat. On departing the presidency in 1809, he described America as \\"trusted with the destines of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government.\\"Bober, 2008, p. 264. =Democracy= Thomas Jefferson at age 78. Portrait by Thomas Sully hanging at West Point, commissioned by Faculty and Cadets, 1821. Jefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society and promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and education of all males of the commonwealth.Wood, 2010, p. 277. He supported public education and a free press as essential components of a democratic nation.Appleby, 2003, pp. 57‚Äì58, 84. After resigning as Secretary of State in 1795, Jefferson focused on the electoral bases of the Republicans and Federalists. The \\"Republican\\" classification for which he advocated included \\"the entire body of landholders\\" everywhere and \\"the body of laborers\\" without land.Meacham, 2012, p. 298. Republicans united behind Jefferson as vice president, with the election of 1796 expanding democracy nationwide at grassroots levels.Wilentz, 2005, p. 85. Jefferson promoted Republican candidates for local offices.Meacham, 2012, p. 308. Beginning with Jefferson's electioneering for the \\"revolution of 1800,\\" his political efforts were based on egalitarian appeals.Wilentz, 2005, pp. 97‚Äì98. In his later years, he referred to the 1800 election \\"as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form,\\" one \\"not effected indeed by the sword ... but by the ... suffrage of the people.\\"Wilentz, 2005, p. 97. Voter participation grew during Jefferson's presidency, increasing to \\"unimaginable levels\\" compared to the Federalist Era, with turnout of about 67,000 in 1800 rising to about 143,000 in 1804.Wilentz, 2005, p. 138. At the onset of the Revolution, Jefferson accepted William Blackstone's argument that property ownership would sufficiently empower voters' independent judgement, but he sought to further expand suffrage by land distribution to the poor.Keyssar, 2009, p. 10. In the heat of the Revolutionary Era and afterward, several states expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to all propertied male, tax-paying citizens with Jefferson's support.Ferling, 2004, p. 286. In retirement, he gradually became critical of his home state for violating \\"the principle of equal political rights\\"‚Äîthe social right of universal male suffrage.Keyssar, 2009, p. 37. He sought a \\"general suffrage\\" of all taxpayers and militia-men, and equal representation by population in the General Assembly to correct preferential treatment of the slave-holding regions.Wilentz, 2005, p. 200. =Religion= The alt=A leather-bound Bible Baptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, which he later attended with his daughters.Randall, 1994, p. 203. Influenced by Deist authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned \\"orthodox\\" Christianity after his review of New Testament teachings.TJF: \\"Jefferson's Religious Beliefs\\"Onuf, 2007, pp. 139‚Äì68. In 1803 he asserted, \\"I am Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be.\\" Jefferson later defined being a Christian as one who followed the simple teachings of Jesus. Jefferson compiled Jesus' biblical teachings, omitting miraculous or supernatural references. He titled the work The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, known today as the Jefferson Bible.Jefferson Bible, 1820 Peterson states Jefferson was a theist \\"whose God was the Creator of the universe ... all the evidences of nature testified to His perfection; and man could rely on the harmony and beneficence of His work.\\"Peterson, 1970, ch. 2 [e-book]. Jefferson was firmly anticlerical, writing in \\"every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty ... they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon.\\"Wood, 2010, p. 577. The full letter to Horatio Spatford can be read at the National Archives.U.S. Gov: National Archives Jefferson once supported banning clergy from public office but later relented.Finkelman, 2006, p. 921. In 1777, he drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Ratified in 1786, it made compelling attendance or contributions to any state-sanctioned religious establishment illegal and declared that men \\"shall be free to profess ... their opinions in matters of religion.\\"Yarbrough, 2006, p. 28. The Statute is one of only three accomplishments he chose to have inscribed in the epitaph on his gravestone.Peterson, 2003, p. 315.W. W. Hening, ed., Statutes at Large of Virginia, vol. 12 (1823): 84‚Äì86. Early in 1802, Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Connecticut Baptist Association, \\"that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man and his God.\\" He interpreted the First Amendment as having built \\"a wall of separation between Church and State.\\"Meacham, 2012, pp. 369‚Äì70. The phrase 'Separation of Church and State' has been cited several times by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the Establishment Clause. Jefferson donated to the American Bible Society, saying the Four Evangelists delivered a \\"pure and sublime system of morality\\" to humanity. He thought Americans would rationally create \\"Apiarian\\" religion, extracting the best traditions of every denomination.Meacham, 2012, pp. 472‚Äì73. And he contributed generously to several local denominations near Monticello.Randall, 1994, p. 555. Acknowledging organized religion would always be factored into political life for good or ill, he encouraged reason over supernatural revelation to make inquiries into religion. He believed in a creator god, an afterlife, and the sum of religion as loving God and neighbors. But he also controversially renounced the conventional Christian Trinity, denying Jesus' divinity as the Son of God.Meacham, 2012, pp. 471‚Äì73.Sanford, 1984, pp. 85‚Äì86. Jefferson's unorthodox religious beliefs became an important issue in the 1800 presidential election.Wood, 2010, p. 586. Federalists attacked him as an atheist. As president, Jefferson countered the accusations by praising religion in his inaugural address and attending services at the Capitol. =Banks= Alexander Hamilton, national bank proponent and Jefferson's adversary Jefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing, which he thought created long-term debt, bred monopolies, and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor.Malone, 1981, pp. 140‚Äì43. In one letter to Madison, he argued each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years, and not impose a long-term debt on subsequent generations.Meacham, 2012, pp. 224‚Äì25. In 1791, President Washington asked Jefferson, then Secretary of State, and Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, if the Congress had the authority to create a national bank. While Hamilton believed Congress had the authority, Jefferson and Madison thought a national bank would ignore the needs of individuals and farmers, and would violate the Tenth Amendment by assuming powers not granted to the federal government by the states.Wood, 2010, p. 144; Bailey, 2007, p. 82; Meacham, 2012, p. 249. Jefferson used agrarian resistance to banks and speculators as the first defining principle of an opposition party, recruiting candidates for Congress on the issue as early as 1792.Ferling, 2013, pp. 221‚Äì22. As president, Jefferson was persuaded by Secretary of Treasury Albert Gallatin to leave the bank intact, but sought to restrain its influence.Wood, 2010, pp. 293‚Äì95. =Slavery= Jefferson's 1795 Farm Book, page 30, lists 163 slaves at Monticello. Jefferson lived in a planter economy largely dependent upon slavery, and as a wealthy landholder, used slave labor for his household, plantation, and workshops. He first recorded his slaveholding in 1774, when he counted 41 enslaved people.Cogliano, 2006, p. 219; Onuf, 2007, p. 258. Over his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves; he inherited about 175 people while most of the remainder were people born on his plantations.TJF: Slavery at Monticello ‚Äì Property Jefferson purchased some slaves in order to reunite their families. He sold approximately 110 people for economic reasons, primarily slaves from his outlying farms.Gordon-Reed, 2008, p. 292. In 1784 when the number of slaves he owned likely was approximately 200, he began to divest himself of many slaves and by 1794 he had divested himself of 161 individuals. Jefferson once said, \\"My first wish is that the labourers may be well treated\\". Jefferson did not work his slaves on Sundays and Christmas and he allowed them more personal time during the winter months.TJF: Slavery at Monticello ‚Äì Work Some scholars doubt Jefferson's benevolence,Wiencek, 2012, pp. 114, 122. however, noting cases of excessive slave whippings in his absence. His nail factory was staffed only by enslaved children. Many of the enslaved boys became tradesmen. Burwell Colbert, who started his working life as a child in Monticello's Nailery, was later promoted to the supervisory position of butler.TJF: Thomas Jefferson's Monticello ‚Äì Nailery, Wiencek, 2012, p. 93. Jefferson felt slavery was harmful to both slave and master, but had reservations about releasing slaves from captivity, and advocated for gradual emancipation.TJF: Thomas Jefferson and SlaveryFerling, 2000, p. 161.Howe, 2009, p. 74. In 1779, he proposed gradual voluntary training and resettlement to the Virginia legislature, and three years later drafted legislation allowing slaveholders to free their own slaves.Meacham, p. 105. In his draft of the Declaration of Independence, he included a section, stricken by other Southern delegates, criticizing King George III's role in promoting slavery in the colonies.Meacham, p. 475. In 1784, Jefferson proposed the abolition of slavery in all western U.S. territories, limiting slave importation to 15 years.Ferling 2000, p. 287. Congress, however, failed to pass his proposal by one vote. In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, a partial victory for Jefferson that terminated slavery in the Northwest Territory. Jefferson freed his slave Robert Hemings in 1794 and he freed his cook slave James Hemings in 1796.Finkelman (1994), p. 215. Jefferson freed his runaway slave Harriet Hemings in 1822. Upon his death in 1826, Jefferson freed five male Hemings slaves in his will.Finkelman (1994), pp. 220‚Äì21. During his presidency Jefferson allowed the diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory hoping to prevent slave uprisings in Virginia and to prevent South Carolina secession.Freehling, 2005, p. 70. In 1804, in a compromise on the slavery issue, Jefferson and Congress banned domestic slave trafficking for one year into the Louisiana Territory.Wiencek, 2012, pp. 257‚Äì58. In 1806 he officially called for anti-slavery legislation terminating the import or export of slaves. Congress passed the law in 1807.Du Bois, 1904, pp. 95‚Äì96.Ferling 2000, p. 288. In 1819, Jefferson strongly opposed a Missouri statehood application amendment that banned domestic slave importation and freed slaves at the age of 25 on grounds it would destroy the union.Ferling 2000, pp. 286, 294. Jefferson shared the 'common belief' of his day that Black people were mentally and physically inferior, but argued that they nonetheless had innate human rights.Appleby, 2003, pp. 139‚Äì40. In Notes on the State of Virginia, he created controversy by calling slavery a moral evil for which the nation would ultimately have to account to God.Ellis, 1997, p. 87. He therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country, such as Liberia or Sierra Leone, though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals.Helo, 2013, p. 105; Peterson, 1970, pp. 998‚Äì99; Meacham, 2012, p. 478. During his presidency, Jefferson was for the most part publicly silent on the issue of slavery and emancipation,TJF:Jefferson's Antislavery Actions as the Congressional debate over slavery and its extension caused a dangerous north‚Äìsouth rift among the states, with talk of a northern confederacy in New England.DiLorenzo, 1998, Yankee Confederates The violent attacks on white slave owners during the Haitian Revolution due to injustices under slavery supported Jefferson's fears of a race war, increasing his reservations about promoting emancipation at that time.Meacham, 2012, pp. 255, 275‚Äì78. After numerous attempts and failures to bring about emancipation,Ferling 2000, p. 287. Jefferson wrote privately in an 1805 letter to William A. Burwell, \\"I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for the extinguishment of slavery among us.\\" That same year he also related this idea to George Logan, writing, \\"I have most carefully avoided every public act or manifestation on that subject.\\"TJF: Quotations on slavery (May 11, 1805) Historical assessment Scholars remain divided on whether Jefferson truly condemned slavery and how he changed.Finkelman (1994), p. 215; Finkelman (2012)Alexander, 2010; Davis, 1999, p. 179. Francis D. Cogliano traces the development of competing emancipationist then revisionist and finally contextualist interpretations from the 1960s to the present. The emancipationist view, held by the various scholars at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, Douglas L. Wilson, and others, maintains Jefferson was an opponent of slavery all his life, noting that he did what he could within the limited range of options available to him to undermine it, his many attempts at abolition legislation, the manner in which he provided for slaves, and his advocacy of their more humane treatment.TJF ‚Äì Thomas Jefferson's Monticello \\"Slave Dwellings\\"Landscape of Slavery ‚Äì Mulberry Row at Monticello: TreatmentCogliano, 2008, p. 209. The revisionist view, advanced by Paul Finkelman and others, criticizes Jefferson for racism, for holding slaves, and for acting contrary to his words. Jefferson never freed most of his slaves, and he remained silent on the issue while he was president.Finkelman (2012) Contextualists such as Joseph J. Ellis emphasize a change in Jefferson's thinking from his emancipationist views before 1783, noting Jefferson's shift toward public passivity and procrastination on policy issues related to slavery. Jefferson seemed to yield to public opinion by 1794 as he laid the groundwork for his first presidential campaign against Adams in 1796.Cogliano, 2008, pp. 218‚Äì20. Jefferson‚ÄìHemings controversy Claims that Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings's children have been debated since 1802. That year James T. Callender, after being denied a position as postmaster, alleged Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with her.In 1853, William Wells Brown published a novel called Clotel; or, The President's Daughter alluding to Jefferson. This is the first novel in America published by anyone of African descent.Hyland, 2009, pp. ix, 2‚Äì3. In 1998, a panel of researchers conducted a Y-DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field, and of a descendant of Hemings's son, Eston Hemings. The results, released November 1998, published in the journal Nature, showed a match with the male Jefferson line.Foster et al., 1998 After the results of the DNA test were published, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) formed a nine member research team of historians to assess the matter. In January 2000, (revised 2011), the TJF report concluded that \\"the DNA study ... indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings.\\"TJF: Report of the Research Committee on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings ‚Äì Conclusions The TJF report said Jefferson likely fathered all of Heming's children listed at Monticello. In July 2017, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) announced that archeological excavations at Monticello had revealed what they believe to have been Sally Hemings's quarters, adjacent to Jefferson's bedroom. In 2018, the TJF said that it considered the issue \\"a settled historical matter.\\" Since the results of the DNA tests were made public, the consensus among academic historians has been that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with Sally Hemings and that he was the father of her son Eston Hemings,  * though some experts dispute this conclusion. Some scholars maintain the evidence is insufficient to prove Jefferson's paternity conclusively. Based on DNA and other evidence, they note the possibility that additional Jefferson males, including his brother Randolph Jefferson and any one of Randolph's four sons, or his cousin, could have fathered Eston Hemings or Sally Hemings's other children.Hyland, 2009, pp. 30‚Äì31, 79; Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society After Thomas Jefferson's death, although not formally manumitted, Sally Hemings was allowed by Jefferson's daughter Martha to live in Charlottesville as a free woman with her two sons until her death in 1835.Gordon-Reed, 1997, pp. 657‚Äì60. The Monticello Association refused to allow Sally Hemings' descendents the right of burial at Monticello. Interests and activities Virginia State Capitol, designed by Jefferson (wings added later) Jefferson was a farmer, obsessed with new crops, soil conditions, garden designs, and scientific agricultural techniques. His main cash crop was tobacco, but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable. He tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat, vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and cattle to supply his family, slaves, and employees, but he lived perpetually beyond his means and was always in debt.Hayes, 2008, p. 100; McEwan, 1991, pp. 20‚Äì39. In the field of architecture, Jefferson helped popularize the Neo-Palladian style in the United States utilizing designs for the Virginia State Capitol, the University of Virginia, Monticello, and others.Berstein, 2003, p. 193; Tucker, 1837, v. 2, p. 202. Jefferson mastered architecture through self-study, using various books and classical architectural designs of the day. His primary authority was Andrea Palladio's The Four Books of Architecture, which outlines the principles of classical design.Brodie, 1974, pp. 87‚Äì88; Bernstein, 2003, p. 9. He was interested in birds and wine, and was a noted gourmet; he was also a prolific writer and linguist, and spoke several languages.Hayes, 2008, pp. 135‚Äì36. As a naturalist, he was fascinated by the Natural Bridge geological formation, and in 1774 successfully acquired the Bridge by grant from George III.Kastning, 2014, p. 8. =American Philosophical Society= Jefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society for 35 years, beginning in 1780. Through the society he advanced the sciences and Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom.Hayes, 2008, p. 432. His Notes on the State of Virginia was written in part as a contribution to the society.TJF: \\"American Philosophical Society\\" He became the society's third president on March 3, 1797, a few months after he was elected Vice President of the United States.Bernstein, 2003, pp. 118‚Äì19. In accepting, Jefferson stated: \\"I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society, beggars and kings.\\" Jefferson served as APS president for the next eighteen years, including through both terms of his presidency. He introduced Meriwether Lewis to the society, where various scientists tutored him in preparation for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.Ambrose, 1996, p. 126. He resigned on January 20, 1815, but remained active through correspondence.Tucker, 1837, v. 2, p. 399. =Linguistics= Jefferson had a lifelong interest in linguistics, and could speak, read, and write in a number of languages, including French, Greek, Italian, and German. In his early years, he excelled in classical language while at boarding schoolUniv. Virginia archives: Miller Center where he received a classical education in Greek and Latin.Andresen, 2006, Chap. 1. Jefferson later came to regard the Greek language as the \\"perfect language\\" as expressed in its laws and philosophy.Bober, 2008, p. 16. While attending the College of William & Mary, he taught himself Italian.TJF: Italy ‚Äì Language Here Jefferson first became familiar with the Anglo-Saxon language, especially as it was associated with English Common law and system of government and studied the language in a linguistic and philosophical capacity. He owned 17 volumes of Anglo-Saxon texts and grammar and later wrote an essay on the Anglo-Saxon language. Jefferson claimed to have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a grammar guide and a copy of Don Quixote.TJF: Spanish Language Linguistics played a significant role in how Jefferson modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas. He believed that the study of ancient languages was essential in understanding the roots of modern language.Hellenbrand, 1990, pp. 155‚Äì56. He collected and understood a number of American Indian vocabularies and instructed Lewis and Clark to record and collect various Indian languages during their Expedition.Frawley, 2003, p. 96. When Jefferson removed from Washington after his presidency, he packed 50 Native American vocabulary lists in a chest and transported them on a river boat back to Monticello along with the rest of his possessions. Somewhere along the journey, a thief stole the heavy chest, thinking it was full of valuables, but its contents were dumped into the James River when the thief discovered it was only filled with papers. Subsequently, 30 years of collecting were lost, with only a few fragments rescued from the muddy banks of the river.American Philosophical Society, 2016: Gathering voices Jefferson was not an outstanding orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering his State of the Union addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition which continued until 1913 when President Woodrow Wilson (1913‚Äì1921) chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.TJF: \\"Public speaking\\" =Inventions= Jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a \\"Great Clock\\" powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs. He improved the pedometer, the polygraph (a device for duplicating writing),Univ. Virginia archives and the moldboard plow, an idea he never patented and gave to posterity.Malone, 1962, pp. 213‚Äì15. Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the swivel chair, the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence.Kaplan, 1993, p. 315. As Minister to France, Jefferson was impressed by the military standardization program known as the Syst√®me Gribeauval, and initiated a program as president to develop interchangeable parts for firearms. For his inventiveness and ingenuity, he received several honorary Doctor of Law degrees.Peterson, 1970, pp. 335‚Äì36. Legacy =Historical reputation= Jefferson Memorial, Washington, D.C. Jefferson is an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship.Peterson, 1960, pp. 5, 67‚Äì69, 189‚Äì208, 340. The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations.Appleby, 2006, p. 149. Meacham opined, that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half-century, succeeded by presidential adherents James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren.Meacham, 2012, p. xix. Jefferson is recognized for having written more than 18,000 letters of political and philosophical substance during his life, which Francis D. Cogliano describes as \\"a documentary legacy ... unprecedented in American history in its size and breadth.\\"Cogliano, 2008, p. 75. Jefferson's reputation declined during the American Civil War, due to his support of states' rights. In the late 19th century, his legacy was widely criticized; conservatives felt that his democratic philosophy had led to that era's populist movement, while Progressives sought a more activist federal government than Jefferson's philosophy allowed. Both groups saw Alexander Hamilton as vindicated by history, rather than Jefferson, and President Woodrow Wilson even described Jefferson as \\"though a great man, not a great American\\".Bernstein, 2003, pp. 191‚Äì92; Appleby, 2003, pp. 132‚Äì33. Thomas Jefferson Memorial Statue, by Rudulph Evans (1947) In the 1930s, Jefferson was held in higher esteem; President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933‚Äì1945) and New Deal Democrats celebrated his struggles for \\"the common man\\" and reclaimed him as their party's founder. Jefferson became a symbol of American democracy in the incipient Cold War, and the 1940s and 1950s saw the zenith of his popular reputation.Bernstein, 2003, pp. 192‚Äì94; Appleby, 2003, pp. 135‚Äì36. Following the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Jefferson's slaveholding came under new scrutiny, particularly after DNA testing in the late 1990s supported allegations that he raped Sally Hemings.Cogliano, 2008, p. 12; Appleby, 2003, p. 136, 140; Bernstein, 2003, pp. 194‚Äì97. Noting the huge output of scholarly books on Jefferson in recent years, historian Gordon Wood summarizes the raging debates about Jefferson's stature: \\"Although many historians and others are embarrassed about his contradictions and have sought to knock him off the democratic pedestal ... his position, though shaky, still seems secure.\\"Gordon S. Wood. \\"Revealing the Total Jefferson,\\" The New York Review of Books. June 23, 2016. The Siena Research Institute poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S. presidents,SRI, 2010. and a 2015 Brookings Institution poll of American Political Science Association members ranked him as the fifth greatest president.Brookings, 2015 =Memorials and honors= (left to right) George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln sculpted into Mount Rushmore Jefferson has been memorialized with buildings, sculptures, postage, and currency.

The term was first coined in 1882 by the classical scholar Frederic W. H. Myers, a founder of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), and has remained more popular than the earlier expression thought-transference.Glossary of Parapsychological terms - Telepathy ‚Äî Parapsychological Association. Retrieved December 19, 2006. Telepathy experiments have historically been criticized for lack of proper controls and repeatability. There is no convincing evidence that telepathy exists, and the topic is generally considered by the scientific community to be pseudoscience.Felix Planer. (1980). Superstition. Cassell. p. 218. \\"Many experiments have attempted to bring scientific methods to bear on the investigation of the subject. Their results based on literally millions of tests, have made it abundantly clear that there exists no such phenomenon as telepathy, and that the seemingly successful scores have relied either on illusion, or on deception.\\"Spencer Rathus. (2011). Psychology: Concepts and Connections. Cengage Learning. p. 143. \\"There is no adequate scientific evidence that people can read other people's minds. Research has not identified one single indisputable telepath or clairvoyant.\\" Origins of the concept According to historians such as Roger Luckhurst and Janet Oppenheim the origin of the concept of telepathy in Western civilization can be tracked to the late 19th century and the formation of the Society for Psychical Research.Oppenheim, Janet. (1985). The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914. Cambridge University Press. pp. 135-249. Luckhurst, Roger. (2002). The Invention of Telepathy, 1870-1901. Oxford University Press. pp. 9-51. As the physical sciences made significant advances, scientific concepts were applied to mental phenomena (e.g., animal magnetism), with the hope that this would help to understand paranormal phenomena. The modern concept of telepathy emerged in this context. Psychical researcher Eric Dingwall criticized SPR founding members Frederic W. H. Myers and William F. Barrett for trying to \\"prove\\" telepathy rather than objectively analyze whether or not it existed.Dingwall, Eric. (1985). The Need for Responsibility in Parapsychology: My Sixty Years in Psychical Research. In A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 161-174. \\"Let me give an example, such as thought-transference, which is as good as any. When the British SPR was founded, the public was led to believe that at least a scientific survey was to be made, and I have no doubt that even some of those closely associated with the early days thought so too. But Myers, among others, had no such intention and cherished no such illusion. He knew that the primary aim of the Society was not objective experimentation but the establishment of telepathy. (...) What was wanted was proof that mind could communicate with mind apart from the normal avenues, for if mental sharing was a fact when the persons concerned were incarnate it could plausibly be suggested that the same mechanism might operate when death had occurred. Thus the supernatural might be proved by science, and psychical research might become, in the words of Sir William Barrett, a handmaid to religion.\\" Thought reading In the late 19th century, the magician and mentalist, Washington Irving Bishop would perform \\"thought reading\\" demonstrations. Bishop claimed no supernatural powers and ascribed his powers to muscular sensitivity (reading thoughts from unconscious bodily cues).Roger Luckhurst. (2002). The Invention of Telepathy: 1870-1901. Oxford University Press. p. 63. Bishop was investigated by a group of scientists including the editor of the British Medical Journal and the psychologist Francis Galton. Bishop performed several feats successfully such as correctly identifying a selected spot on a table and locating a hidden object. During the experiment Bishop required physical contact with a subject who knew the correct answer. He would hold the hand or wrist of the helper. The scientists concluded that Bishop was not a genuine telepath but using a highly trained skill to detect ideomotor movements.Richard Wiseman. (2011). Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There. Macmillan. p. 140-142. Another famous thought reader was the magician Stuart Cumberland. He was famous for performing blindfolded feats such as identifying a hidden object in a room that a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the Society for Psychical Research who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by muscle reading. Case studies Gilbert Murray conducted early telepathy experiments. In the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by the Society for Psychical Research and believed to have genuine psychic ability. However, during a later experiment they were caught utilizing signal codes and they confessed to fraud.Ray Hyman. (1989). The Elusive Quarry: A Scientific Appraisal of Psychical Research. Prometheus Books. pp. 99-106Gordon Stein. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 688 George Albert Smith and Douglas Blackburn were claimed to be genuine psychics by the Society for Psychical Research but Blackburn confessed to fraud: > For nearly thirty years the telepathic experiments conducted by Mr. G. A. > Smith and myself have been accepted and cited as the basic evidence of the > truth of thought transference... ...the whole of those alleged experiments > were bogus, and originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how > easily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when seeking > for evidence in support of a theory they were wishful to establish.Neher, > Andrew. (2011). Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological > Examination. Dover Publications. p. 220. Between 1916 and 1924, Gilbert Murray conducted 236 experiments into telepathy and reported 36% as successful, however, it was suggested that the results could be explained by hyperaesthesia as he could hear what was being said by the sender.Payne, Kenneth Wilcox. (1928). Is Telepathy all Bunk? Popular Science Monthly. p. 119Couttie, Bob. (1988). Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox. Lutterworth Press. p. 129. \\"In the early 1900s Gilbert Murray, who died in 1957, carried out some experiments in ESP in which he was in one room and the sender in a hallway, often with an open door between them. These experiments were successful. Most of the time the target was spoken aloud. When it was not, there were negative results. This is suggestive of a hyperacuity of hearing, especially since on at least one occasion Murray complained about noise coming from a milk-cart in the street next to the one in which the experiments were being carried out.\\"Mauskopf, Seymour H; McVaugh, Michael Rogers.

(1986). Psychic Paradoxes. Prometheus Books. p. 8 In 1924, Robert H. Gault of Northwestern University with Gardner Murphy conducted the first American radio test for telepathy. The results were entirely negative. One of their experiments involved the attempted thought transmission of a chosen number between one and one-thousand. Out of 2,010 replies, none was correct. This is below the theoretical chance figure of two correct replies in such a situation.Gault, Robert H. (August, 1924). Telepathy Put to the Test. Popular Science. pp. 114-115 In February 1927, with the co- operation of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), V. J. Woolley who was at the time the Research Officer for the SPR, arranged a telepathy experiment in which radio listeners were asked to take part. The experiment involved 'agents' thinking about five selected objects in an office at Tavistock Square, whilst listeners on the radio were asked to identify the objects from the BBC studio at Savoy Hill. 24, 659 answers were received. The results revealed no evidence for telepathy.Mauskopf, Seymour H; McVaugh, Michael Rogers. (1980). The Elusive Science: Origins of Experimental Psychical Research. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 36-38. Edmunds, Simeon. (1965). Miracles of the Mind: An Introduction to Parapsychology. C. C. Thomas. pp. 26-28 A famous experiment in telepathy was recorded by the American author Upton Sinclair in his book Mental Radio which documents Sinclair's test of psychic abilities of Mary Craig Sinclair, his second wife. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her husband. Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 \\"partial successes\\" and 70 failures. However, these experiments were not conducted in a controlled scientific laboratory environment.Martin Gardner, Fads & Fallacies in the Name of Science (Courier Dover Publications, 1957) Chapter 25: ESP and PK, available online; accessed July 25, 2010. Science writer Martin Gardner suggested that the possibility of sensory leakage during the experiment had not been ruled out: Frederick Marion who was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research in the late 1930-1940s. The Turner-Ownbey long distance telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned herself in the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses.John Sladek. (1974). The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs. Panther. pp. 172-174 The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to J. B. Rhine; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.Bergen Evans. (1954). The Spoor of Spooks: And Other Nonsense. Knopf. p. 24C. E. M. Hansel. (1989). The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited. Prometheus Books. pp. 56-58. Another example is the experiment carried out by the author Harold Sherman with the explorer Hubert Wilkins who carried out their own experiment in telepathy for five and a half months starting in October 1937. This took place when Sherman was in New York and Wilkins was in the Arctic. The experiment consisted of Sherman and Wilkins at the end of each day to relax and visualise a mental image or \\"thought impression\\" of the events or thoughts they had experienced in the day and then to record those images and thoughts on paper in a diary. The results at the end when comparing Sherman's and Wilkins' diaries were claimed to be more than 60 percent.Simon Nasht. (2006). The Last Explorer: Hubert Wilkins, Hero of the Great Age of Polar Exploration. Arcade Publishing. pp. 267-268 The full results of the experiments were published in 1942 in a book by Sherman and Wilkins titled Thoughts Through Space. In the book both Sherman and Wilkins had written they believed they had demonstrated that it was possible to send and receive thought impressions from the mind of one person to another.Hubert Wilkins, Harold Sherman. (2004). Thoughts through Space: A Remarkable Adventure in the Realm of Mind. Hampton Roads Publishing. The magician John Booth wrote the experiment was not an example of telepathy as a high percentage of misses had occurred. Booth wrote it was more likely that the \\"hits\\" were the result of \\"coincidence, law of averages, subconscious expectancy, logical inference or a plain lucky guess\\".John Booth. (1986). Psychic Paradoxes. Prometheus Books. p. 69 A review of their book in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry cast doubt on their experiment noting \\"the study was published five years after it was conducted, arouses suspicion on the validity of the conclusions.Steiner, Lee R. (1942). Review of Thoughts Through Space. American Journal of Orthopsychiatry 12 (4): 745. In 1948, on the BBC radio Maurice Fogel made the claim that he could demonstrate telepathy. This intrigued the journalist Arthur Helliwell who wanted to discover his methods. He found that Fogel's mind reading acts were all based on trickery as he relied on information about members of his audience before the show started. Helliwell exposed Fogel's methods in a newspaper article. Although Fogel managed to fool some people into believing he could perform genuine telepathy, the majority of his audience knew he was a showman.Lamont, Peter. (2013). Extraordinary Beliefs: A Historical Approach to a Psychological Problem. Cambridge University Press. p. 220. In a series of experiments Samuel Soal and his assistant K. M. Goldney examined 160 subjects over 128,000 trials and obtained no evidence for the existence of telepathy.Lawrie Reznek. (2010). Delusions and the Madness of the Masses. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers . pp. 54-55 Soal tested Basil Shackleton and Gloria Stewart between 1941 and 1943 in over five hundred sittings and over twenty thousand guesses. Shackleton scored 2890 compared with a chance expectation of 2308 and Gloria scored 9410 compared with a chance level of 7420. It was later discovered the results had been tampered with. Gretl Albert who was present during many of the experiments said she had witnessed Soal altering the records during the sessions. Betty Marwick discovered Soal had not used the method of random selection of numbers as he had claimed. Marwick showed that there had been manipulation of the score sheets and all experiments reported by Soal had thereby become discredited.C. E. M. Hansel. (1980). ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Reevaluation. Prometheus Books. p. 165Betty Markwick. (1985). The establishment of data manipulation in the Soal-Shackleton experiments. In Paul Kurtz. A Skeptic‚Äôs Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 287-312 In 1979 the physicists John G. Taylor and Eduardo Balanovski wrote the only scientifically feasible explanation for telepathy could be electromagnetism (EM) involving EM fields. In a series of experiments the EM levels were many orders of magnitude lower than calculated and no paranormal effects were observed. Both Taylor and Balanovski wrote their results were a strong argument against the validity of telepathy. Research in anomalistic psychology has discovered that in some cases telepathy can be explained by a covariation bias. In an experiment (Schienle et al. 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments. The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by hindsight and confirmation biases. In parapsychology Within parapsychology, telepathy, often along with precognition and clairvoyance, is described as an aspect of extrasensory perception (ESP) or \\"anomalous cognition\\" that parapsychologists believe is transferred through a hypothetical psychic mechanism they call \\"psi\\".Glossary of Parapsychological terms - ESP , Parapsychological Association. Retrieved December 19, 2006. Parapsychologists have reported experiments they use to test for telepathic abilities. Among the most well known are the use of Zener cards and the Ganzfeld experiment. =Types= Several forms of telepathy have been suggested: * Latent telepathy, formerly known as \\"deferred telepathy\\",Rennie, John (1845), \\"Test for Telepathy\\", Scientific American, V3#1 (1847-09-25) describes a transfer of information with an observable time-lag between transmission and reception. * Retrocognitive, precognitive, and intuitive telepathy describes the transfer of information about the past, future or present state of an individual's mind to another individual. * Emotive telepathy, also known as remote influencePlazo, Joseph R., (2002) \\"Psychic Seduction.\\" pp.112-114 or emotional transfer, describes the transfer of kinesthetic sensations through altered states. * Superconscious telepathy describes use of the supposed superconsciousSt. Claire, David., (1989) \\"Instant ESP.\\" pp.40-50 to access the collective wisdom of the human species for knowledge. =Zener Cards= Zener cards Zener cards are marked with five distinctive symbols. When using them, one individual is designated the \\"sender\\" and another the \\"receiver\\". The sender selects a random card and visualizes the symbol on it, while the receiver attempts to determine that symbol telepathically. Statistically, the receiver has a 20% chance of randomly guessing the correct symbol, so to demonstrate telepathy, they must repeatedly score a success rate that is significantly higher than 20%. If not conducted properly, this method is vulnerable to sensory leakage and card counting. J. B. Rhine's experiments with Zener cards were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.Jonathan C. Smith. (2009). Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit. Wiley-Blackwell. . \\"Today, researchers discount the first decade of Rhine's work with Zener cards. Stimulus leakage or cheating could account for all his findings. Slight indentations on the backs of cards revealed the symbols embossed on card faces. Subjects could see and hear the experimenter, and note subtle but revealing facial expressions or changes in breathing.\\" Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects.Milbourne Christopher. (1970). ESP, Seers & Psychics. Thomas Y. Crowell Company. p. 28 Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.James Alcock. (2011). Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair. Skeptical Inquirer. \\"Despite Rhine‚Äôs confidence that he had established the reality of extrasensory perception, he had not done so. Methodological problems with his experiments eventually came to light, and as a result parapsychologists no longer run card-guessing studies and rarely even refer to Rhine‚Äôs work.\\" =Dream telepathy= Parapsychological studies into dream telepathy were carried out at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy. However, the results have not been independently replicated.Parker, Adrian. (1975). States of Mind: ESP and Altered States of Consciousness. Taplinger. p. 90. Hyman, Ray. (1986). Maimonides dream-telepathy experiments. Skeptical Inquirer 11: 91-92.Neher, Andrew. (2011). Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination. Dover Publications. p. 145. The psychologist James Alcock has written the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and \\"lack of replication is rampant.\\" The picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.Hansel, C. E. M. The Search for a Demonstration of ESP. In Kurtz, Paul. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.Hansel, C. E. M. (1989). The Search for Psychic Power: ESP and Parapsychology Revisited. Prometheus Books. pp. 141-152. =Ganzfeld experiment= When using the Ganzfeld experiment to test for telepathy, one individual is designated as the receiver and is placed inside a controlled environment where they are deprived of sensory input, and another person is designated as the sender and is placed in a separate location. The receiver is then required to receive information from the sender. The nature of the information may vary between experiments.The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena by Dean I. Radin Harper Edge, The Ganzfeld experiment studies that were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues.Julie Milton, Richard Wiseman. (2002). A Response to Storm and Ertel (2002). The Journal of Parapsychology. Volume 66: 183-186. Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 Ganzfeld experiments and to access each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate documentation, randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage.Ray Hyman. Evaluating Parapsychological Claims in Robert J. Sternberg, Henry L. Roediger, Diane F. Halpern. (2007). Critical Thinking in Psychology. Cambridge University Press. pp. 216-231. Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 Ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi. Possibilities of sensory leakage in the Ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender's room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender's fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, Diana Kornbrot.

(2014). \\"Ganzfeld\\" in The Skeptic's Dictionary. Hyman also reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place: Hyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage. In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is statistically significant with p < .001. Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the ganzfeld condition. Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm et al. According to Hyman \\"reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence.\\" Hyman wrote the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for telepathy.Hyman, R. (2010). Meta-analysis that conceals more than it reveals: Comment on Storm et al . (2010). Psychological Bulletin, 136. pp. 486-490. Storm et al. published a response to Hyman claiming the ganzfeld experimental design has proved to be consistent and reliable but parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention so further research on the subject is necessary. Rouder et al. 2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm et al.'s meta- analysis reveals no evidence for telepathy, no plausible mechanism and omitted replication failures. A 2016 paper examined questionable research practices in the ganzfeld experiments. =Twin telepathy= Twin telepathy is a belief that has been described as a myth in psychological literature. Psychologists Stephen Hupp and Jeremy Jewell have noted that all experiments on the subject have failed to provide any scientific evidence for telepathy between twins.Hupp, Stephen; Jewell, Jeremy. (2015). Great Myths of Child Development. Wiley. pp. 10-16. According to Hupp and Jewell there are various behavioral and genetic factors that contribute to the twin telepathy myth \\"identical twins typically spend a lot of time together and are usually exposed to very similar environments. Thus, it's not at all surprising that they act in similar ways and are adept at anticipating and forecasting each other's reactions to events.\\" A 1993 study by Susan Blackmore investigated the claims of twin telepathy. In an experiment with six sets of twins one subject would act as the sender and the other the receiver. The sender was given selected objects, photographs or numbers and would attempt to psychically send the information to the receiver. The results from the experiment were negative, no evidence of telepathy was observed.Wiseman, Richard. (2011). Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There. Macmillan. p. 54. The skeptical investigator Benjamin Radford has noted that \\"Despite decades of research trying to prove telepathy, there is no credible scientific evidence that psychic powers exist, either in the general population or among twins specifically. The idea that two people who shared their mother's womb ‚Äî or even who share the same DNA ‚Äî have a mysterious mental connection is an intriguing one not borne out in science.\\"\\"The Riddle of Twin Telepathy\\".

Taylor also wrote the arguments used by parapsychologists for the feasibility of such phenomena are based on distortions of theoretical physics as well as \\"complete ignorance\\" of relevant areas of physics.John Taylor.

According to Sutherland, \\"most stories about this phenomenon concern people who are close to one another - husband and wife or brother and sister.

Graham Reed, a specialist in anomalistic psychology, noted that experiments into telepathy often involve the subject relaxing and reporting the 'messages' to consist of colored geometric shapes. Reed wrote that these are a common type of hypnagogic image and not evidence for telepathic communication.Graham Reed. (1988). The Psychology of Anomalous Experience. Prometheus Books. pp. 38-42. Outside of parapsychology, telepathy is generally explained as the result of fraud, self-delusion and/or self-deception and not as a paranormal power.Skepdic.com on ESP. Retrieved February 22, 2007. Psychological research has also revealed other explanations such as confirmation bias, expectancy bias, sensory leakage, subjective validation and wishful thinking.Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones.

Virtually all of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena, such as mediumship, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading.Ian Rowland. (1998). The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading. Ian Rowland Limited: 4th Revised edition. Derren Brown. (2007). Tricks of the Mind. Channel 4: New edition. Magicians such as Ian Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, without paranormal means. They have identified, described, and developed psychological techniques of cold reading and hot reading. Psychiatry The notion of telepathy is not dissimilar to three clinical concepts: delusions of thought insertion/removal and thought broadcasting. This similarity might explain how an individual might come to the conclusion that he or she were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or substance-induced psychosis.Richard Noll. (2007). The Encyclopedia of Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders. Facts on File. p. 359. Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies, or artificial intelligences) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with schizotypy and schizotypal personality disorder are particularly likely to believe in telepathy.Graham Pickup.

B. \\"The works of Charles Darwin: an annotated bibliographical handlist.\\" In Van Wyhe, John, ed. Darwin Online: On the Origin of Species, 2002. published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. The book presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had collected on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream. The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T. H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences. Summary of Darwin's theory Darwin pictured shortly before publication Darwin's theory of evolution is based on key facts and the inferences drawn from them, which biologist Ernst Mayr summarised as follows: :* Every species is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact). :* Despite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size (fact). :* Resources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time (fact). :* A struggle for survival ensues (inference). :* Individuals in a population vary significantly from one another (fact). :* Much of this variation is heritable (fact). :* Individuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of natural selection (fact). :* This slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species (inference). Background =Developments before Darwin's theory= In later editions of the book, Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life. Cuvier's 1799 paper on living and fossil elephants helped establish the reality of extinction. The Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible, with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of Ren√© Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism. Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His pal√¶ontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species. In Britain, William Paley's Natural Theology saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial \\"design\\" by the Creator acting through natural laws. All naturalists in the two English universities (Oxford and Cambridge) were Church of England clergymen, and science became a search for these laws. Geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood. Some anatomists such as Robert Grant were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order. =Inception of Darwin's theory= Darwin went to Edinburgh University in 1825 to study medicine. In his second year he neglected his medical studies for natural history and spent four months assisting Robert Grant's research into marine invertebrates. Grant revealed his enthusiasm for the transmutation of species, but Darwin rejected it. Starting in 1827, at Cambridge University, Darwin learnt science as natural theology from botanist John Stevens Henslow, and read Paley, John Herschel and Alexander von Humboldt. Filled with zeal for science, he studied catastrophist geology with Adam Sedgwick. evolutionary tree. In December 1831, he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist. He read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore, at St. Jago, found Lyell's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their \\"centre of creation\\". The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed \\"miserable, degraded savages\\", and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. As the Beagle neared England in 1836, he noted that species might not be fixed. Richard Owen showed that fossils of extinct species Darwin found in South America were allied to living species on the same continent. In March 1837, ornithologist John Gould announced that Darwin's rhea was a separate species from the previously described rhea (though their territories overlapped), that mockingbirds collected on the Gal√°pagos Islands represented three separate species each unique to a particular island, and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as finches. Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that \\"one species does change into another\\" to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms. Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists. At the zoo he had his first sight of an ape, and was profoundly impressed by how human the orangutan seemed. In late September 1838, he started reading Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population with its statistical argument that human populations, if unrestrained, breed beyond their means and struggle to survive. Darwin related this to the struggle for existence among wildlife and botanist de Candolle's \\"warring of the species\\" in plants; he immediately envisioned \\"a force like a hundred thousand wedges\\" pushing well-adapted variations into \\"gaps in the economy of nature\\", so that the survivors would pass on their form and abilities, and unfavourable variations would be destroyed. By December 1838, he had noted a similarity between the act of breeders selecting traits and a Malthusian Nature selecting among variants thrown up by \\"chance\\" so that \\"every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected\\". Darwin now had the basic framework of his theory of natural selection, but he was fully occupied with his career as a geologist and held back from compiling it until his book on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was completed. As he recalled in his autobiography, he had \\"at last got a theory by which to work\\", but it was only in June 1842 that he allowed himself \\"the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil\\". =Further development= Darwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the Beagle voyage. He tentatively wrote of his ideas to Lyell in January 1842; then in June he roughed out a 35-page \\"Pencil Sketch\\" of his theory. Darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in January 1844, and by July had rounded out his \\"sketch\\" into a 230-page \\"Essay\\", to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely. Darwin researched how the skulls of different pigeon breeds varied, as shown in his Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication of 1868. In November 1844, the anonymously published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, written by Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened public interest in the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s. Hooker was persuaded to take away a copy of the \\"Essay\\" in January 1847, and eventually sent a page of notes giving Darwin much-needed feedback. Reminded of his lack of expertise in taxonomy, Darwin began an eight-year study of barnacles, becoming the leading expert on their classification. Using his theory, he discovered homologies showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and he found an intermediate stage in the evolution of distinct sexes. Darwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence. Publication =Time taken to publish= In his autobiography, Darwin said he had \\"gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it\\". On the first page of his 1859 book he noted that, having begun work on the topic in 1837, he had drawn up \\"some short notes\\" after five years, had enlarged these into a sketch in 1844, and \\"from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.\\" Various biographers have proposed that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to be sure he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time. A more recent study by science historian John van Wyhe has determined that the idea that Darwin delayed publication only dates back to the 1940s, and Darwin's contemporaries thought the time he took was reasonable. Darwin always finished one book before starting another. While he was researching, he told many people about his interest in transmutation without causing outrage. He firmly intended to publish, but it was not until September 1854 that he could work on it full-time. His 1846 estimate that writing his \\"big book\\" would take five years proved optimistic. =Events leading to publication: \\"big book\\" manuscript= A photograph of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823‚Äì1913) taken in Singapore in 1862 An 1855 paper on the \\"introduction\\" of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1‚Äì2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \\"sketch\\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species as his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas. =Joint publication of papers by Wallace and Darwin= Darwin was hard at work on the manuscript for his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation. =Abstract of Species book= Soon after the meeting, Darwin decided to write \\"an abstract of my whole work\\" in the form of one or more papers to be published by the Linnean Society, but was concerned about \\"how it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which would be impossible.\\" He asked Hooker how many pages would be available, but \\"If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific I would, perhaps publish it as pamphlet.\\" He began his \\"abstract of Species book\\" on 20 July 1858, while on holiday at Sandown, and wrote parts of it from memory, while sending the manuscripts to his friends for checking. By early October, he began to \\"expect my abstract will run into a small volume, which will have to be published separately.\\" Over the same period, he continued to collect information and write large fully detailed sections of the manuscript for his \\"big book\\" on Species, Natural Selection. =Murray as publisher; choice of title= By mid-March 1859 Darwin's abstract had reached the stage where he was thinking of early publication; Lyell suggested the publisher John Murray, and met with him to find if he would be willing to publish. On 28 March Darwin wrote to Lyell asking about progress, and offering to give Murray assurances \\"that my Book is not more un-orthodox, than the subject makes inevitable.\\" He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection, with the year shown as \\" _1859_ \\". Darwin, C. R. proposed title page for Origin of species draft. (1859) APS- B-D25.L[.38] Transcribed by Kees Rookmaaker, edited by John van Wyhe Murray's response was favourable, and a very pleased Darwin told Lyell on 30 March that he would \\"send shortly a large bundle of M.S. but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as the three first chapters are in three copyists' hands\\". He bowed to Murray's objection to \\"abstract\\" in the title, though he felt it excused the lack of references, but wanted to keep \\"natural selection\\" which was \\"constantly used in all works on Breeding\\", and hoped \\"to retain it with Explanation, somewhat as thus\\",‚Äî Through Natural Selection or the preservation of favoured races. On 31 March Darwin wrote to Murray in confirmation, and listed headings of the 12 chapters in progress: he had drafted all except \\"XII. Recapitulation & Conclusion\\". Murray responded immediately with an agreement to publish the book on the same terms as he published Lyell, without even seeing the manuscript: he offered Darwin ‚Öî of the profits. Darwin promptly accepted with pleasure, insisting that Murray would be free to withdraw the offer if, having read the chapter manuscripts, he felt the book would not sell well (eventually Murray paid ¬£180 to Darwin for the first edition and by Darwin's death in 1882 the book was in its sixth edition, earning Darwin nearly ¬£3000). On 5 April, Darwin sent Murray the first three chapters, and a proposal for the book's title. An early draft title page suggests On the Mutability of Species.Darwin, C. R. [early draft title of Origin] On the mutability of species [& other notes] CUL-DAR205.1.70 Transcribed by Kees Rookmaaker, edited by John van Wyhe Murray cautiously asked Whitwell Elwin to review the chapters. At Lyell's suggestion, Elwin recommended that, rather than \\"put forth the theory without the evidence\\", the book should focus on observations upon pigeons, briefly stating how these illustrated Darwin's general principles and preparing the way for the larger work expected shortly: \\"Every body is interested in pigeons.\\" Darwin responded that this was impractical: he had only the last chapter still to write. In September the main title still included \\"An essay on the origin of species and varieties\\", but Darwin now proposed dropping \\"varieties\\". With Murray's persuasion, the title was eventually agreed as On the Origin of Species, with the title page adding by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. In this extended title (and elsewhere in the book) Darwin used the biological term \\"races\\" interchangeably with \\"varieties\\", meaning varieties within a species. He used the term broadly,, Quote: \\"There nonetheless are a few cases in which Darwin does discuss selection processes in which groups are the units, and these will be the focus of the present chapter. But even here it does not matter whether the groups are from different 'races' or from the same race. It is nests of honeybees that compete with each other, and human tribes that compete with other human tribes. For Darwin, the question of group selection had nothing special to do with 'race.' Still, writing in the heyday of empire, Darwin saw European nations outcompeting the nations, kingdoms, and tribes that occupy the rest of the globe. In this one very salient example, Darwin did see races struggling with each other. In any event, the word race in Darwin‚Äôs subtitle needs to be understood very broadly; it encompasses competition among individuals, competition among groups in the same 'race,' and competition from groups from different 'races.' This is a much broader meaning than the word 'race' tends to have today.\\" and as well as discussions of \\"the several races, for instance, of the cabbage\\" and \\"the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants\\", there are three instances in the book where the phrase \\"races of man\\" is used, referring to races of humans.the three instances of the phrase \\"races of man\\" are found on . =Publication and subsequent editions= On the Origin of Species was first published on Thursday 24 November 1859, priced at fifteen shillings with a first printing of 1250 copies. The book had been offered to booksellers at Murray's autumn sale on Tuesday 22 November, and all available copies had been taken up immediately. In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers' Hall copyright, around 1,170 copies were available for sale. Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie's Library, ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library. The second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 January 1860, and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii, a quotation from Charles Kingsley, and the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" added to the closing sentence. During Darwin's lifetime the book went through six editions, with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter- arguments raised. The third edition came out in 1861, with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species, while the fourth in 1866 had further revisions. The fifth edition, published on 10 February 1869, incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\", which had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Biology (1864).\\"This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.\\" In January 1871, George Jackson Mivart's On the Genesis of Species listed detailed arguments against natural selection, and claimed it included false metaphysics. Darwin made extensive revisions to the sixth edition of the Origin (this was the first edition in which he used the word \\"evolution\\" which had commonly been associated with embryological development, though all editions concluded with the word \\"evolved\\". \\"Evolution\\" in the transformist sense had been used by Charles Lyell in 1832, Principles of Geology vol 2, p. 11; and was used by Darwin in The Descent of Man in 1871, p. 2 onwards.), and added a new chapter VII, Miscellaneous objections, to address Mivart's arguments. The sixth edition was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 as The Origin of Species, with \\"On\\" dropped from the title. Darwin had told Murray of working men in Lancashire clubbing together to buy the fifth edition at 15 shillings and wanted it made more widely available; the price was halved to 7s 6d by printing in a smaller font. It includes a glossary compiled by W.S. Dallas. Book sales increased from 60 to 250 per month. =Publication outside Great Britain= American botanist Asa Gray (1810‚Äì1888) In the United States, botanist Asa Gray, an American colleague of Darwin, negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin was delighted by the popularity of the book, and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid-January 1860, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this referred to the first printing only as there were four that year. The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Cl√©mence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860.Ch. Darwin, Het ontstaan der soorten van dieren en planten door middel van de natuurkeus of het bewaard blijven van bevoorregte rassen in de strijd des levens, transl. by T.C. Winkler (Haarlem 1860) Source: Teyler, Winkler, Darwin Lecture by Marijn van Hoorn MA at the Congress of the European Botanical and Horticultural Libraries Group, Prague, 23 April 2009 By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873‚Äì1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, Origin had appeared in an additional 18 languages, including Chinese by Ma Ch√ºn-wu who added non-Darwinian ideas; he published the preliminaries and chapters 1‚Äì5 in 1902‚Äì1904, and his complete translation in 1920. Content =Title pages and introduction= John Gould's illustration of Darwin's rhea was published in 1841. The existence of two rhea species with overlapping ranges influenced Darwin. Page ii contains quotations by William Whewell and Francis Bacon on the theology of natural laws, harmonising science and religion in accordance with Isaac Newton's belief in a rational God who established a law-abiding cosmos. In the second edition, Darwin added an epigraph from Joseph Butler affirming that God could work through scientific laws as much as through miracles, in a nod to the religious concerns of his oldest friends. The Introduction establishes Darwin's credentials as a naturalist and author, then refers to John Herschel's letter suggesting that the origin of species \\"would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\\": > WHEN on board HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain > facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the > geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that > continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of > species‚Äîthat mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our > greatest philosophers. Darwin refers specifically to the distribution of the species rheas, and to that of the Gal√°pagos tortoises and mockingbirds. He mentions his years of work on his theory, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion, which led him to \\"publish this Abstract\\" of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his theory: > As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; > and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for > existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any > manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying > conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be > naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected > variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form. Starting with the third edition, Darwin prefaced the introduction with a sketch of the historical development of evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813. =Variation under domestication and under nature= Chapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding, going back to ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that \\"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\\", yet all were descended from one species of rock pigeon. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \\"sports\\" or \\"monstrosities\\" (example: Ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons).David Reznick (2009) The Origin Then and Now, Princeton University Press, p.49. Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution. In this chapter Darwin expresses his erroneous belief that environmental change is necessary to generate variation.Winther, Rasmus G. (2000), \\"Darwin on Variation and heredity\\", Journal of the History of Biology\\" 33, pp. 425-455 In Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between species and varieties is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found. He concludes that \\"a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species\\" and that \\"species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties\\". He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature. Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the archetype of each species, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God. Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world. =Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence= In Chapter III, Darwin asks how varieties \\"which I have called incipient species\\" become distinct species, and in answer introduces the key concept he calls \\"natural selection\\"; in the fifth edition he adds, \\"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\\" > Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from > whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an > individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other > organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that > individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring ... I have > called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is > preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation > to man's power of selection. He notes that both A. P. de Candolle and Charles Lyell had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition. Darwin emphasizes that he used the phrase \\"struggle for existence\\" in \\"a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another\\"; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and disseminate their seeds. He describes the struggle resulting from population growth: \\"It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.\\" He discusses checks to such increase including complex ecological interdependencies, and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms \\"which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature\\". Chapter IV details natural selection under the \\"infinitely complex and close-fitting ... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life\\". Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that natural selection might do the same, saying: > But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I > believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance > that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in > structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled > to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and > so be enabled to increase in numbers. Historians have remarked that here Darwin anticipated the modern concept of an ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings. This tree diagram, used to show the divergence of species, is the only illustration in the Origin of Species. Darwin proposes sexual selection, driven by competition between males for mates, to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds. He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could \\"see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection\\". Using a tree diagram and calculations, he indicates the \\"divergence of character\\" from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in \\"the great Tree of life ... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications\\". =Variation and heredity= In Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, \\"The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.\\" He accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought \\"there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited\\", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island-dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism. Breeding of animals and plants showed related varieties varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection. More detail was given in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.McBride, P. D., Gillman, L. N., & Wright, S. D. (2009). Current debates on the origin of species. Journal of Biological Education, 43(3), 104‚Äì107. =Difficulties for the theory= Chapter VI begins by saying the next three chapters will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, \\"Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?\\" Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms. This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space. Another difficulty, related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in time. Darwin commented that by the theory of natural selection \\"innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\\" and wondered \\"why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\\" (For further discussion of these difficulties, see Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist? and Bernstein et al. and Michod.) The chapter then deals with whether natural selection could produce complex specialised structures, and the behaviours to use them, when it would be difficult to imagine how intermediate forms could be functional. Darwin said: > Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure > and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some > animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection > could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the > tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, > organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet > fully understand the inimitable perfection? His answer was that in many cases animals exist with intermediate structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: \\"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\\" In a section on \\"organs of little apparent importance\\", Darwin discusses the difficulty of explaining various seemingly trivial traits with no evident adaptive function, and outlines some possibilities such as correlation with useful features. He accepts that we \\"are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\\" which distinguish domesticated breeds of animals, , Quote: \\"We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations; and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries\\" and human races. He suggests that sexual selection might explain these variations: , Quote: \\"‚Ä¶ I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man.\\" > I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races > of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can > apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through > sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious > details my reasoning would appear frivolous. Chapter VII (of the first edition) addresses the evolution of instincts. His examples included two he had investigated experimentally: slave-making ants and the construction of hexagonal cells by honey bees. Darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food. He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps. He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax. Darwin concluded: > Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far > more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its > foster-brothers, ‚Äîants making slaves, ‚Äîthe larv√¶ of ichneumonid√¶ feeding > within the live bodies of caterpillars, ‚Äînot as specially endowed or created > instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the > advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest > live and the weakest die. Chapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: \\"Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.\\" In the sixth edition Darwin inserted a new chapter VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature. =Geological record= Chapter IX deals with the fact that the geological record appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable transitional fossils expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well- founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he cited the example of The Weald as discussed in Principles of Geology together with other observations from Hugh Miller, James Smith of Jordanhill and Andrew Ramsay. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well-developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years. Chapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at the same rate ‚Äì some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area. =Geographic distribution= Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: \\"On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\\" Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally. Chapter XII continues the discussion of biogeography. After a brief discussion of freshwater species, it returns to oceanic islands and their peculiarities; for example on some islands roles played by mammals on continents were played by other animals such as flightless birds or reptiles. The summary of both chapters says: > ... I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are > explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms > of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of > new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether > of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical > provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, > and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in > South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, > marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by > affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly > inhabited the same continent ... On these same principles, we can > understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have > few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar; > ... =Classification, morphology, embryology, rudimentary organs= Chapter XIII starts by observing that classification depends on species being grouped together in a Taxonomy, a multilevel system of groups and sub-groups based on varying degrees of resemblance. After discussing classification issues, Darwin concludes: > All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are > explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural > system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which > naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more > species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in > so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent > is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, ... Darwin discusses morphology, including the importance of homologous structures. He says, \\"What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?\\" This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even Richard Owen had admitted, but the \\"explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications\\" showing common descent. He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in baleen whales, are found only in embryonic stages. These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification. =Concluding remarks= The final chapter, \\"Recapitulation and Conclusion\\", reviews points from earlier chapters, and Darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history. Quote: \\"When the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history. ...\\" He suggests that psychology will be put on a new foundation and implies the relevance of his theory to the first appearance of humanity with the sentence that \\"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\\" , Quote: \\"‚Ä¶ this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.\\" Darwin ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted: > It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants > of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects > flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to > reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each > other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been > produced by laws acting around us ... Thus, from the war of nature, from > famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of > conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. > There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been > originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this > planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so > simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have > been, and are being, evolved. Darwin added the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" from the 1860 second edition onwards, so that the ultimate sentence begins \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\\". Structure, style, and themes =Nature and structure of Darwin's argument= Darwin's aims were twofold: to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation. Later chapters provide evidence that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternative concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, and its ability to explain a wide range of observations. =Literary style= The Examiner review of 3 December 1859 commented, \\"Much of Mr. Darwin's volume is what ordinary readers would call 'tough reading;' that is, writing which to comprehend requires concentrated attention and some preparation for the task. All, however, is by no means of this description, and many parts of the book abound in information, easy to comprehend and both instructive and entertaining.\\" While the book was readable enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience. = Human evolution = From his early transmutation notebooks in the late 1830s onwards, Darwin considered human evolution as part of the natural processes he was investigating, and rejected divine intervention., quoting Darwin, C. R. Notebook C (February to July 1838) pp. 196‚Äì197 \\"Man in his arrogance thinks himself a great work worthy the interposition of a deity, more humble & I believe truer to consider him created from animals.\\" In 1856, his \\"big book on species\\" titled Natural Selection was to include a \\"note on Man\\", but when Wallace enquired in December 1857, Darwin replied; \\"You ask whether I shall discuss 'man';‚ÄîI think I shall avoid whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest & most interesting problem for the naturalist.\\" On 28 March 1859, with his manuscript for the book well under way, Darwin wrote to Lyell offering the suggested publisher John Murray assurances \\"That I do not discuss origin of man\\". In the final chapter of On the Origin of Species, \\"Recapitulation and Conclusion\\", Darwin briefly highlights the human implications of his theory: > \\"In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. > Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary > acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be > thrown on the origin of man and his history.\\" Discussing this in January 1860, Darwin assured Lyell that \\"by the sentence [Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history] I show that I believe man is in same predicament with other animals. Many modern writers have seen this sentence as Darwin‚Äôs only reference to humans in the book; Janet Browne describes it as his only discussion there of human origins, while noting that the book makes other references to humanity.For example, , \\"In this book, he was completely silent on the subject of human origins, although he did refer in several places to mankind as an example of biological details. The only words he allowed himself‚Äîand these out of a sense of duty that he must somewhere refer to human beings‚Äìwere gnomic in their brevity. 'Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history'.\\" Some other statements in the book are quietly effective at pointing out the implication that humans are simply another species, evolving through the same processes and principles affecting other organisms. For example, in Chapter III: \\"Struggle for Existence\\" Darwin includes \\"slow-breeding man\\" among other examples of Malthusian population growth., Quote: \\"There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny.\\" In his discussions on morphology, Darwin compares and comments on bone structures that are homologous between humans and other mammals. , Quote: \\"What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?\\" , Quote: \\"The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse ‚Ä¶ at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications.\\" Darwin's early notebooks discussed how non-adaptive characteristics could be selected when animals or humans chose mates,Darwin, C.

He had not completely avoided the topic:, Quote: \\"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views.\\" > It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin > of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man > and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other > organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance > on this earth.See also , Quote: \\"My Descent of Man was published in Feb. > 1871.

It would have > been useless and injurious to the success of the book to have paraded > without giving any evidence my conviction with respect to his origin.\\" He also said that he had \\"merely alluded\\" in that book to sexual selection differentiating human races., Quote: \\"During many years it has seemed to me highly probable that sexual selection has played an important part in differentiating the races of man; but in my 'Origin of Species' (first edition, p. 199) I contented myself by merely alluding to this belief.\\" Reception In the 1870s, British caricatures of Darwin with a non-human ape body contributed to the identification of evolutionism with Darwinism. The book aroused international interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much of the initial reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory,Darwin in letters, 1860: Answering critics but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. Samuel Wilberforce wrote a review in Quarterly Review in 1860 where he disagreed with Darwin's 'argument'. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant. While Darwin had been somewhat coy about human origins, not identifying any explicit conclusion on the matter in his book, he had dropped enough hints about human's animal ancestry for the inference to be made, and the first review claimed it made a creed of the \\"men from monkeys\\" idea from Vestiges. Human evolution became central to the debate and was strongly argued by Huxley who featured it in his popular \\"working- men's lectures\\". Darwin did not publish his own views on this until 1871. The naturalism of natural selection conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking. =Impact on the scientific community= Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \\"law of development\\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive idea that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line. Huxley used illustrations to show that humans and apes had the same basic skeletal structure. Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late-Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies. The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871). Impact outside Great Britain Haeckel showed a main trunk leading to mankind with minor branches to various animals, unlike Darwin's branching evolutionary tree. Evolutionary ideas, although not natural selection, were accepted by German biologists accustomed to ideas of homology in morphology from Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants and from their long tradition of comparative anatomy. Bronn's alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives, but enthused political radicals. Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie. Their ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in palaeontology. Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that von Baer's laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching. Asa Gray promoted and defended Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz who viewed every species as a distinct fixed unit in the mind of the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties.Dupree, pp. 216‚Äì232 Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory. French-speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much-modified French translation by Cl√©mence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views. Challenges to natural selection There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von N√§geli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the fifth edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century. By the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" included forms of \\"saltationism\\" in which new species were thought to arise through \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views. =Impact on economic and political debates= While some, like Spencer, used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non-white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry. =Religious attitudes= The book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world. Baden Powell defended evolutionary ideas by arguing that the introduction of new species should be considered a natural rather than a miraculous process. Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \\"just as noble a conception of Deity\\". In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as \\"a celebrated cleric\\", and added the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" to the closing sentence, which from then on read \\"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\\". While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to \\"creation\\". Baden Powell praised \\"Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self- evolving powers of nature\\". In America, Asa Gray argued that evolution is the secondary effect, or modus operandi, of the first cause, design, and published a pamphlet defending the book in terms of theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with Natural Theology. Theistic evolution became a popular compromise, and St. George Jackson Mivart was among those accepting evolution but attacking Darwin's naturalistic mechanism. Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as neo-Lamarckism were favoured over natural selection as being more compatible with purpose. Even though the book did not explicitly spell out Darwin's beliefs about human origins, it had dropped a number of hints about human's animal ancestry and quickly became central to the debate, as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial soul, and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities. This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind's position at the head of nature. While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, Charles Hodge argued in his 1874 critique \\"What is Darwinism?\\" that \\"Darwinism\\", defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design. Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin's text. By the early 20th century, four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution, but fundamentalism inspired the American creation‚Äìevolution controversy that began in the 1920s. Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century, but other Catholic writers, starting with Mivart, pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area. The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching. Modern influence A modern phylogenetic tree based on genome analysis shows the three-domain system. Various alternative evolutionary mechanisms favoured during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" became untenable as more was learned about inheritance and mutation. The full significance of natural selection was at last accepted in the 1930s and 1940s as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis. During that synthesis biologists and statisticians, including R. A. Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane, merged Darwinian selection with a statistical understanding of Mendelian genetics. Modern evolutionary theory continues to develop. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geological record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States. Interest in Darwin's writings continues, and scholars have generated an extensive literature, the Darwin Industry, about his life and work. The text of Origin itself has been subject to much analysis including a variorum, detailing the changes made in every edition, first published in 1959,, recently reprinted. and a concordance, an exhaustive external index published in 1981. Worldwide commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species and the bicentenary of Darwin's birth were scheduled for 2009.The ISTC of On the Origin of Species is A02-2009-00000001-4. As a tribute to its influence, this work has been the first one to be registered by The International ISTC Agency. They celebrated the ideas which \\"over the last 150 years have revolutionised our understanding of nature and our place within it\\". In a survey conducted by a group of academic booksellers, publishers and librarians in advance of Academic Book Week in the United Kingdom, On the Origin of Species was voted the most influential academic book ever written. It was hailed as \\"the supreme demonstration of why academic books matter\\" and \\"a book which has changed the way we think about everything\\".

It was adopted at the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2, 1836, and was formally signed the next day after mistakes were noted in the text. Background In October 1835, settlers in Mexican Texas launched the Texas Revolution. However, within Austin, many struggled with understanding what the ultimate goal of the Revolution was. Some believed that the goal should be total independence from Mexico, while others sought the reimplementation of the Mexican Constitution of 1824 (which offered greater freedoms than the centralist government declared in Mexico the prior year).Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 98. To settle the issue, a convention was called for March 1836. This convention differed from the previous Texas councils of 1832, 1833, and the 1835 Consultation. Many of the delegates to the 1836 convention were young men who had only recently arrived in Texas from the United States, in violation of Mexico's immigration ban of April, 1830, although many of them had participated in one of the battles in 1835. The only two known native Texans to sign are Jose Francisco Ruiz and Jose Antonio Navarro. Most of the delegates were members of the War Party and were adamant that Texas must declare its independence from Mexico.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 142. Forty-one delegates arrived in Washington-on-the-Brazos on February 28. Development The convention was convened on March 1 with Richard Ellis as president.Davis (1982), p. 38. The delegates selected a committee of five to draft a declaration of independence; the committee was led by George Childress and also included Edward Conrad, James Gaines, Bailey Hardeman, and Collin McKinney. The committee submitted its draft within a mere 24 hours, leading historians to speculate that Childress had written much of it before his arrival at the Convention.Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 144. The declaration was approved on March 2 with no debate. Based primarily on the writings of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson, the declaration proclaimed that the Mexican government \\"ceased to protect the lives, liberty, and property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers are derived\\"Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 145. and complained about \\"arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny\\".Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 146. Throughout the declaration are numerous references to the United States laws, rights, and customs. Omitted from the declaration was the fact that the author and many of the signatories were citizens of the United States, occupying Texas illegally, and therefore had no legal rights in the government of Mexico. The declaration makes clear that the men were accustomed to the laws and privileges of the United States, and were unfamiliar with the language, religion, and traditions of the nation that they were rebelling against. The declaration officially established the Republic of Texas, although it was not officially recognized at that time by any government other than itself. The Mexican Republic still claimed the land and considered the delegates to be invaders. Among others, the declaration mentions the following reasons for the separation: * The 1824 Constitution of Mexico establishing a federal republic had been overturned and changed into a centralist military dictatorship by Gen. Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. (From Mexico's viewpoint, lawful elections of 1835 seated many conservative politicians who intended to strengthen the government of Mexico and defend their nation from an invasion of illegal American immigrants. They amended the 1824 constitution by passing the Seven Laws.) * The Mexican government had invited settlers to Texas and promised them constitutional liberty and republican government, but then reneged on these guarantees. (It did not mention that many settlers, including the author and majority of signatories, were factually uninvited, illegal trespassers.Scott (2000), p. 122.) * Texas was in union with the Mexican state of Coahuila as Coahuila y Tejas, with the capital in distant Saltillo, and thus the affairs of Texas were decided at a great distance from the province and in the Spanish language, which the immigrants called \\"an unknown tongue\\". * Political rights to which the settlers had previously been accustomed in the United States, such as the right to keep and bear arms and the right to trial by jury, were denied. The right to keep slaves was endangered by the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. * No system of public education had been established. * Attempts by the Mexican government to enforce import tariffs were called \\"piratical attacks\\" by \\"foreign desperadoes\\". * The settlers were not allowed freedom of religion. All legal settlers were required to convert to Catholicism. Based upon the United States Declaration of Independence, the Texas Declaration also contains many memorable expressions of American political principles: *\\"the right of trial by jury, that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.\\" *\\"our arms ... are essential to our defence, the rightful property of freemen, and formidable only to tyrannical governments.\\" Signatories Replica of the building at Washington-on-the-Brazos where the Texas Declaration was signed.

Other names are considered mere epithets or titles reflecting different aspects of God, but Khumra sometimes dictates special care such as the writing of \\"G-d\\" instead of \\"God\\" in English or saying ·π¨ƒìt-Vav (, \\"9-6\\") instead of Y≈çd-Hƒì (, \\"10-5\\" but also \\"Jah\\") for the number fifteen in Hebrew. The documentary hypothesis proposes that the Torah was compiled from various original sources, two of which (the Jahwist and the Elohist) are named for their usual names for God (Yahweh and Elohim respectively).

All other names, such as \\"Merciful\\", \\"Gracious\\" and \\"Faithful\\", merely represent attributes that are also common to human beings.Sheb. 35a. =YHWH= Aramaic ( ‚Äì 200 ) or modern Hebrew scripts. The Tetragrammaton in the Ketef Hinnom silver scrolls with the Priestly Blessing from the Book of Numbers. ( ). The name of God used most often in the Hebrew Bible is (), (generally transcribed as YHWH) and is called the Tetragrammaton (Greek for \\"something written with four letters\\"). Hebrew script is an abjad, so that the letters Y≈çd, Hƒì, Vav, Hƒì in this name are normally consonants, usually expanded in English as \\"Yahweh\\". Modern Jewish culture judges it forbidden to pronounce this name. In prayers it is replaced by the word Adonai (\\"The Lord\\"), and in discussion by HaShem (\\"The Name\\"). Nothing in the Torah explicitly prohibits speaking the name and the Book of Ruth shows it was being pronounced as late as the 5th century .. It had ceased to be spoken aloud by at least the 3rd century , during Second Temple Judaism and vowel points began to be added to the Hebrew text only in the early medieval period. The Masoretic Text adds to the Tetragrammaton the vowel points of Adonai or Elohim (depending on the context), indicating that these are the words to be pronounced in place of the Tetragrammaton (see Qere and Ketiv),Otto Eissfeldt \\"◊ê◊ì◊ï◊ü ƒÅdh≈çn\\" en G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren, 'Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament (Eerdmans1974), vol. I, p. 71Fran√ßois Bovon, New Testament and Christian Apocrypha: Collected Studies II (Mohr Siebeck 2009), p. 20 as shown also by the subtle pronunciation changes when combined with a preposition or a conjunction. The Tetragrammaton appears in Genesis. and occurs 6,828 times in total in the Stuttgart edition of the Masoretic Text. It is thought to be an archaic third-person singular of the imperfective aspect of the verb \\"to be\\" (i.e., \\"[He] is/was/will be\\"). This agrees with the passage in Exodus where God names himself as \\"I Will Be What I Will Be\\". using the first-person singular imperfective aspect, open to interpretation as present tense (\\"I am what I am\\"), future (\\"I shall be what I shall be\\"), imperfect (\\"I used to be what I used to be\\").University of Texas at Austin, \\"Biblical Hebrew Grammar for Beginners\\" Rabbinical Judaism teaches that the name is forbidden to all except the High Priest, who should only speak it in the Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem on Yom Kippur. He then pronounces the name \\"just as it is written\\". As each blessing was made, the people in the courtyard were to prostrate themselves completely as they heard it spoken aloud. As the Temple has not been rebuilt since its destruction in 70 , most modern Jews never pronounce YHWH but instead read Adonai (\\"My Lord\\") during prayer and while reading the Torah and as HaShem (\\"The Name\\") at other times. Similarly, the Vulgate used ' (\\"The Lord\\") and most English translations of the Bible write \\"the \\" for YHWH and \\"the God\\", \\"the Lord \\" or \\"the Sovereign \\" for Adonai YHWH instead of transcribing the name. The Septuagint may have originally used the Hebrew letters themselves amid its Greek textOrigen, Commentary on Psalms 2:2.Jerome, Prologus Galeatus. but there is no scholarly consensus on this point. All surviving Christian-era manuscripts use Kyrios [, \\"Lord\\") or very occasionally Theos [, \\"God\\"] to translate the many thousand occurrences of the Name. (However, given the great preponderance of the anarthrous Kyrios solution for translating YHWH in the Septuagint and some disambiguation efforts by Christian-era copyists involving Kyrios (see especially scribal activity in Actssee Larry W. Hurtado, \\"God or Jesus? Textual Ambiguity and Textual Variants in Acts of the Apostles,\\" in Texts and Traditions: Essays in Honour of J. Keith Elliott, eds. Peter Doble and Jeffrey Kloha. Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2014. Pp. 239-54.), Theos should probably not be considered historically as a serious early contender substitute for the divine Name.) =El= El appears in Ugaritic, Phoenician and other 2nd and 1st millennium texts both as generic \\"god\\" and as the head of the divine pantheon. In the Hebrew Bible El (Hebrew: ) appears very occasionally alone (e.g. Genesis 33:20, el elohe yisrael, \\"El the God of Israel\\",KJV margin at Gen. 33:20 and Genesis 46:3, ha'el elohe abika, \\"El the God of thy father\\"), but usually with some epithet or attribute attached (e.g. El Elyon, \\"Most High El\\", El Shaddai, \\"El of Shaddai\\", El \`Olam \\"Everlasting El\\", El Hai, \\"Living El\\", El Ro'i \\"El my Shepherd\\", and El Gibbor \\"El of Strength\\"), in which cases it can be understood as the generic \\"god\\". In theophoric names such as Gabriel (\\"Strength of God\\"), Michael (\\"Who is like God?\\"), Raphael (\\"God's medicine\\"), Ariel (\\"God's lion\\"), Daniel (\\"God's Judgment\\"), Israel (\\"one who has struggled with God\\"), Immanuel (\\"God is with us\\"), and Ishmael (\\"God Hears\\"/\\"God Listens\\") it is usually interpreted and translated as \\"God\\", but it is not clear whether these \\"el\\"s refer to the deity in general or to the god El in particular. =Eloah= =Elohim= A common name of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (). Despite the -im ending common to many plural nouns in Hebrew, the word Elohim when referring to God is grammatically singular, and takes a singular verb in the Hebrew Bible. The word is identical to the usual plural of el meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the lhm found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El and conventionally vocalized as \\"Elohim\\" although the original Ugaritic vowels are unknown. When the Hebrew Bible uses elohim not in reference to God, it is plural (for example, Exodus 20:2). There are a few other such uses in Hebrew, for example Behemoth. In Modern Hebrew, the singular word ba'alim (\\"owner\\") looks plural, but likewise takes a singular verb. A number of scholars have traced the etymology to the Semitic root *yl, \\"to be first, powerful\\", despite some difficulties with this view. Elohim is thus the plural construct \\"powers\\". Hebrew grammar allows for this form to mean \\"He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)\\", just as the word Ba'alim means \\"owner\\" (see above). \\"He is lord (singular) even over any of those things that he owns that are lordly (plural).\\" Theologians who dispute this claim cite the hypothesis that plurals of majesty came about in more modern times. Richard Toporoski, a classics scholar, asserts that plurals of majesty first appeared in the reign of Diocletian ( 284‚Äì305).R. Toporoski, \\"What was the origin of the royal 'we' and why is it no longer used?\\", The Times, May 29, 2002. Ed. F1, p. 32 Indeed, Gesenius states in his book Hebrew Grammar the following:Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (A. E. Cowley, ed., Oxford, 1976, p.398) > The Jewish grammarians call such plurals ... plur. virium or virtutum; later > grammarians call them plur. excellentiae, magnitudinis, or plur. > maiestaticus. This last name may have been suggested by the we used by kings > when speaking of themselves (compare 1 Maccabees 10:19 and 11:31); and the > plural used by God in Genesis 1:26 and 11:7; Isaiah 6:8 has been incorrectly > explained in this way). It is, however, either communicative (including the > attendant angels: so at all events in Isaiah 6:8 and Genesis 3:22), or > according to others, an indication of the fullness of power and might > implied. It is best explained as a plural of self-deliberation. The use of > the plural as a form of respectful address is quite foreign to Hebrew. Mark S. Smith has cited the use of plural as possible evidence to suggest an evolution in the formation of early Jewish conceptions of monotheism, wherein references to \\"the gods\\" (plural) in earlier accounts of verbal tradition became either interpreted as multiple aspects of a single monotheistic God at the time of writing, or subsumed under a form of monolatry, wherein the god(s) of a certain city would be accepted after the fact as a reference to the God of Israel and the plural deliberately dropped.Mark S. Smith, God in Translation: Deities in Cross-Cultural Discourse in the Biblical World, vol. 57 of Forschungen zum Alten Testament, Mohr Siebeck, 2008, , p. 19.; Smith, Mark S. (2002), \\"The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel\\" (Biblical Resource Series) The plural form ending in -im can also be understood as denoting abstraction, as in the Hebrew words chayyim (\\"life\\") or betulim (\\"virginity\\"). If understood this way, Elohim means \\"divinity\\" or \\"deity\\". The word chayyim is similarly syntactically singular when used as a name but syntactically plural otherwise. In many of the passages in which elohim occurs in the Bible it refers to non-Israelite deities, or in some instances to powerful men or judges, and even angels (Exodus 21:6, Psalms 8:5) as a simple plural in those instances. =Elohai= Elohai or Elohei (\\"My God\\") is a form of Elohim along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic. It appears in the names \\"God of Abraham\\" (Elohai Avraham); \\"God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\\" (Elohai Avraham, Elohai Yitzchak ve Elohai Ya øaqov); and \\"God of Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Rachel\\" (Elohai Sara, Elohai Rivka, Elohai Leah ve Elohai Rakhel). =El Shaddai= El Shaddai (, ) is one of the names of God in Judaism, with its etymology coming from the influence of the Ugaritic religion on modern Judaism. El Shaddai is conventionally translated as \\"God Almighty\\". While the translation of El as \\"god\\" in Ugarit/Canaanite language is straightforward, the literal meaning of Shaddai is the subject of debate. =Tzevaot= Tzevaot, Tsebaoth or Sabaoth (, , \\"Armies\\") appears in reference to armies or armed hosts of men in Exodus, , . and Isaiah but is not used as a divine epithet in the Torah, Joshua, or Judges. In the First Book of Samuel, David uses the name YHWH Tzavaot and immediately glosses it as \\"the God of the armies of Israel\\".. The same name appears in the prophets along with YHWH Elohe Tzevaot, Elohey Tzevaot, and Adonai YHWH Tzevaot. These are usually translated in the King James Version as the \\"Lord of Hosts\\" or \\"Lord God of Hosts\\". In its later uses, however, it often denotes God in his role as leader of the heavenly hosts. The Hebrew word Sabaoth was also absorbed in Ancient Greek (œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ±œâŒ∏, saba≈çth) and Latin (Sabaoth, with no declension). Tertullian and other patristics used it with the meaning of Army of angels of God.Georges, O. Badellini, F. Calonghi, Dizionario latino-italiano [Latin-to-Italian Dictionary], Rosenberg & Sellier, Turin, 17th edition, 1989, page 2431 of 2959 =Jah= The abbreviated form Jah ()Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed. \\"Jah, n.\\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1900. or Yah (; , Yah) appears in the Psalms. and Isaiah., , & . It is a common element in Hebrew theophoric names such as Elijah and also appears in the forms yahu (\\"Jeremiah\\"), yeho (\\"Joshua\\"), and yo (\\"John\\", ultimately from the biblical \\"Yohanan\\" and Jonathan, \\"God gives\\". It also appears 24 times in the Psalms as a part of Hallelujah (\\"Praise Jah\\").E.g., . Other names and titles =Adonai= Shefa Tal ‚Äì A Kabbalistic explanation of the Priestly Blessing with Adonai inscribed. Adonai (, \\"My Lords\\") is the plural form of adon (\\"Lord\\") along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic. As with Elohim, Adonai's grammatical form is usually explained as a plural of majesty. In the Hebrew Bible, it is nearly always used to refer to God (approximately 450 occurrences). As pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton came to be avoided in the Hellenistic period, Jews may have begun to drop the Tetragrammaton when presented alongside Adonai and subsequently expand it to cover for the Tetragrammaton in the forms of spoken prayer and written scripture. Owing to the expansion of chumra (the idea of \\"building a fence around the Torah\\"), the word 'Adonai' itself has come to be too holy to say for Orthodox Jews, leading to its replacement by HaShem (\\"The Name\\"). The singular forms adon and adoni (\\"my lord\\") are used in the Hebrew Bible as royal titles, as in the First Book of Samuel,. and for distinguished persons. The Phoenicians used it as a title of Tammuz, the origin of the Greek Adonis. It is also used very occasionally in Hebrew texts to refer to God (e.g. Ps 136:3.) Deuteronomy 10:17 has the proper name Yahweh alongside the superlative constructions \\"God of gods\\" el≈çh√™ ha-el≈çh√Æm and \\"Lord of lords\\" ad≈çn√™ ha-ad≈çn√Æm (; KJV: \\"For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords\\"). The final syllable of Adonai uses the vowel kamatz, rather than patach which would be expected from the Hebrew for \\"my lord(s)\\". Prof. Yoel Elitzur explains this as a normal transformation when a Hebrew word becomes a name, giving as other examples Nathan, Yitzchak, and Yigal.Yoel Elitzur, Shemot HaEl VeTaarichei Ketivat Sifrei HaMiqra, published in Be'einei Elohim VaAdam, Beit Morasha Jerusalem: 2017, p. 407 footnote 24; see also link. As Adonai became the most common reverent substitute for the Tetragrammaton, it too became considered unerasable due to its holiness. As such, most prayer books avoid spelling the word Adonai out, and instead write two yodhs () in its place. =Adoshem= Up until the mid-twentieth century, the use of the word Adoshem combining the first two syllables of \\"Adonai\\" with the last syllable of \\"Hashem\\" was quite common. It took a few centuries for the word to fall into almost complete disuse. Despite being obsolete in most circles, it is used occasionally in conversation in place of Adonai by Jews who do not wish to say Adonai, but need to specify the substitution of that particular word. It is also used when quoting from the liturgy in a non- liturgical context, especially as a substitute in musical pieces where a replacement for \\"Adonai\\" must have the same number of syllables. For example, Shlomo Carlebach performed his prayer \\"Shema Yisrael\\" with the words Shema Yisrael Adoshem Elokeinu Adoshem E·∏•ad instead of Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai E·∏•ad. =Baal= Baal (),Oxford English Dictionary (1885), \\"Baal, n.\\" properly Ba øal, meant \\"owner\\" and, by extension, \\"lord\\", \\"master\\", and \\"husband\\" in Hebrew and the other Northwest Semitic languages. In some early contexts and theophoric names, it and Baali (; \\"My Lord\\") were treated as synonyms of Adon and Adonai. After the time of Solomon and particularly after Jezebel's attempt to promote the worship of the Lord of Tyre Melqart, however, the name became particularly associated with the Canaanite storm god Ba øal Haddu and was gradually avoided as a title for Yahweh. Several names that included it were rewritten as bosheth (\\"shame\\"). The prophet Hosea in particular reproached the Israelites for continuing to use the term:. =Ehyeh asher ehyeh= Ehyeh asher ehyeh (Hebrew: ◊ê÷∂◊î÷∞◊ô÷∂◊î ◊ê÷≤◊©÷∂◊Å◊® ◊ê÷∂◊î÷∞◊ô÷∂◊î) is the first of three responses given to Moses when he asks for God's name in the Book of Exodus. The King James Version of the Bible translates the Hebrew as \\"I Am that I Am\\" and uses it as a proper name for God. The Aramaic Targum Onkelos leaves the phrase untranslated and is so quoted in the Talmud (B. B. 73a.) The word ehyeh is the first-person singular imperfect form of hayah, \\"to be\\", usually translated into English as \\"I will be\\". Because Classical Hebrew had an aspectual system rather than grammatical tense, in which the imperfect denotes any actions that are not yet completed, the verb form ehyeh can be translated as \\"I am/I am being/I will be\\" (e.g. Exodus 3:12, \\"Certainly I will be [ehyeh] with thee.\\").Seidner, 4. Although Ehyeh asher ehyeh is generally rendered in English \\"I am that I am\\", better renderings might be \\"I will be what I will be\\" or \\"I will be who I will be\\", or \\"I shall prove to be whatsoever I shall prove to be\\" or even \\"I will be because I will be\\".Seidner, 5. Other renderings include: Leeser, \\"I Will Be that I Will Be\\"; Rotherham, \\"I Will Become whatsoever I please\\", New World Translation (2013 Edition): \\"I Will Become What I Choose to Become.\\"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.

The origin of the word is uncertain and it may be related to a root word, meaning \\"reverence\\". Elah is found in the Tanakh in the books of Ezra, Jeremiah (Jer 10:11, the only verse in the entire book written in Aramaic),Torrey 1945, 64; Metzger 1957, 96; Moore 1992, 704, and Daniel. Elah is used to describe both pagan gods and the Jews' God. The word 'Elah - ' is also an Arabic word which means god. The name is etymologically related to Allah used by Muslims. * Elah Yisrael, God of Israel (Ezra 5:1) * Elah Yerushelem, God of Jerusalem (Ezra 7:19) * Elah Shemaya, God of Heaven (Ezra 7:23) * Elah-avahati, God of my fathers, (Daniel 2:23) * Elah Elahin, God of gods (Daniel 2:47) =El Roi= In the Book of Genesis, Hagar uses this name for the God who spoke to her through his angel. In Hebrew, her phrase \\"El Roi\\", literally, \\"God of Seeing Me\\", is translated in the King James Version as \\"Thou God seest me.\\" KJV. =Elyon= The name Elyon (Hebrew: ◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ï◊ü) occurs in combination with El, YHWH, Elohim and alone. It appears chiefly in poetic and later Biblical passages. The modern Hebrew adjective \\"\`Elyon\\" means \\"supreme\\" (as in \\"Supreme Court\\") or \\"Most High\\". El Elyon has been traditionally translated into English as 'God Most High'. The Phoenicians used what appears to be a similar name for God, one that the Greeks wrote as ŒàŒªŒπŒøŒΩ. It is cognate to the Arabic \`Aliyy. =Eternal One= \\"The Eternal One\\" is increasingly used, particularly in Reform and Reconstructionist communities seeking to use gender-neutral language.Matthew Berke, GOD AND GENDER IN JUDAISM, First Things, June 1995; Mel Scult, The Radical American Judaism of Mordecai M. Kaplan, Indiana University Press, 2013. p. 195. In the Torah, Hashem El Olam (\\"the Everlasting God\\") is used at Genesis 21:33 to refer to God.. =Hashem= It is common Jewish practice to restrict the use of the names of God to a liturgical context. In casual conversation some Jews, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God Hashem (), which is Hebrew for \\"the Name\\" (cf. Leviticus 24:11 and Deuteronomy 28:58). Likewise, when quoting from the Tanakh or prayers, some pious Jews will replace Adonai with HaShem. For example, when making audio recordings of prayer services, HaShem will generally be substituted for Adonai. A popular expression containing this phrase is Baruch HaShem, meaning \\"Thank God\\" (literally, \\"Blessed be the Name\\"). =Shalom= Talmudic authors,Rabbi Adah ben Ahabah and Rabbi Haninuna (possibly citing \\"'Ulla\\") ruling on the basis of Gideon's name for an altar (\\"YHVH-Shalom\\", according to Judges 6:24), write that \\"the name of God is 'Peace'\\" (Pereq ha-Shalom, Shab. 10b); consequently, a Talmudic opinion (Shabbat, 10b) asserts that one would greet another with the word ' in order for the word not to be forgotten in the exile. But one is not permitted to greet another with the word ' in unholy places such as a bathroom, because of the holiness of the name. =Shekhinah= Shekhinah () is the presence or manifestation of God which has descended to \\"dwell\\" among humanity. The term never appears in the Hebrew Bible; later rabbis used the word when speaking of God dwelling either in the Tabernacle or amongst the people of Israel. The root of the word means \\"dwelling\\". Of the principal names of God, it is the only one that is of the feminine gender in Hebrew grammar. Some believe that this was the name of a female counterpart of God, but this is unlikely as the name is always mentioned in conjunction with an article (e.g.: \\"the Shekhina descended and dwelt among them\\" or \\"He removed Himself and His Shekhina from their midst\\"). This kind of usage does not occur in Semitic languages in conjunction with proper names. The Arabic form of the word \\"' \\" is also mentioned in the Quran.

Manuscript on parchment, 12th century. In Jewish tradition the sacredness of the divine name or titles must be recognized by the professional sofer (scribe) who writes Torah scrolls, or tefillin and mezuzah. Before transcribing any of the divine titles or name he prepares mentally to sanctify them. Once he begins a name he does not stop until it is finished, and he must not be interrupted while writing it, even to greet a king. If an error is made in writing it may not be erased, but a line must be drawn round it to show that it is canceled, and the whole page must be put in a genizah (burial place for scripture) and a new page begun. Kabbalistic use One of the most important names is that of the Ein Sof ( \\"Endless\\"), which first came into use after 1300. Another name is derived from the names . By spelling these four names out with the names of the Hebrew letters ( and ) this new forty-five letter long name is produced. Spelling the letters in (YHWH) by itself gives . Each letter in Hebrew is given a value, according to gematria, and the value of is also 45. The seventy-two-fold name is derived from three verses in Exodus 14:19‚Äì21. Each of the verses contains 72 letters. When the verses are read boustrophedonically 72 names, three letter each, are produced (the niqqud of the source verses is disregarded in respect to pronunciation). Some regard this name as the Shemhamphorasch. The Proto-Kabbalistic book Sefer Yetzirah describe how the creation of the world was achieved by manipulation of these 216 sacred letters that form the names of God. Erasing the name of God From this it is understood that one should not erase or blot out the name of God. The general halachic opinion is that this only applies to the sacred Hebrew names of God, not to other euphemistic references; there is a dispute as to whether the word \\"God\\" in English or other languages may be erased or whether Jewish law and/or Jewish custom forbids doing so, directly or as a precautionary \\"fence\\" about the law. The words \\"God\\" and \\"Lord\\" are written by some Jews as \\"G-d\\" and \\"L-rd\\" as a way of avoiding writing any name of God in full out. The hyphenated version of the English name (\\"G-d\\") can be destroyed, so by writing that form, religious Jews prevent documents in their possession with the unhyphenated form from being destroyed later. Alternatively, a euphemistic English reference such as Hashem (literally, \\"the Name\\") may be substituted, or an abbreviation thereof, such as BH (B'ezrat Hashem \\"by the blessing of the Name\\"). This issue is most controversial in the context of the motto of the United States, \\"In God We Trust\\", which has been minted or printed without hyphenation since its first appearance in 1864. While many Jews write the name \\"God\\" in English, others will not or will only under special circumstances. By comparison, the nation of Israel struck down efforts to enshrine an allusive reference to God (◊ë◊î BH) on its currency in 2002, 2003, and 2009 because the frequency of currency destruction was considered too high. According to Talmudic Tractate Rosh Hashana (18B4), Jews in the times of the Hasmonean Kingdom were \\"weaned off\\" the practice of writing the name of Heaven by the Sages, an event that was commemorated as a holiday on the third of Tishrei, a date now dedicated to the Fast of Gedaliah.

However, if diamonds or hearts are trumps, South or West respectively win. A trick-taking game is a card or tile-based game in which play of a hand centers on a series of finite rounds or units of play, called tricks, which are each evaluated to determine a winner or taker of that trick. The object of such games then may be closely tied to the number of tricks taken, as in plain- trick games such as Whist, Contract bridge, Spades, Napoleon, Euchre, Rowboat, Clubs and Spoil Five, or to the value of the cards contained in taken tricks, as in point-trick games such as Pinochle, the Tarot family, Mariage, Rook, All Fours, Manille, Briscola, and most evasion games like Hearts.. The domino game Texas 42 is an example of a trick-taking game that is not a card game. Trick- and-draw games are trick-taking games in which the players can fill up their hands after each trick. In most variants, players are free to play any card into a trick in the first phase of the game, but must follow suit as soon as the stock is depleted. Trick-avoidance games like Reversis or Polignac are those in which the aim is to avoid taking some or all tricks. History The earliest card games were trick-taking games (as evidenced by the rank-and-suit structure) originating from China and spreading westwards during the early part of the second millennium. Michael Dummett noted that these games share various features. They were played without trumps, following suit was not required but only the highest card of the suit led wins, rotation was counter- clockwise, they were plain-trick games, and that the pip cards of one or more suit are in reverse order so that the lower cards beat the higher ones. Two revolutions occurred in European trick-taking games that would lead to the development of ever more sophisticated card games. The first is the invention of trumps (and following suit to contain their power) in the 15th century. The second was bidding in the 17th century. According to card game researcher David Parlett, the oldest known European trick-taking game, Karn√∂ffel, was mentioned in 1426 in the Bavarian town N√∂rdlingen ‚Äì roughly half a century after the introduction of playing cards to Europe, which were first mentioned in Spain in 1371.. The oldest known \\"trumps\\" appear in Karn√∂ffel, where specific ranks of one suit were named Karn√∂ffel, Devil, Pope etc. and subject to an elaborate system of trumping powers. Around 1440 in Italy, special cards called trionfi were introduced with a similar function. These special cards are now known as tarots, and a deck augmented by tarots as a tarot deck. The trionfi/tarots formed essentially a fifth suit without the ordinary ranks but consisting of trumps in a fixed hierarchy. But one can get a similar effect by declaring all cards of a fixed or randomly determined suit to be trumps. This method, originating with Triomphe, is still followed by a number of modern trick-taking games that do not involve an auction.. Trumps were retroactively added to some games, such as Trappola. It is much rarer for trumps to be removed.McLeod, John. K√∂nigrufen (Graden) at pagat.com. Retrieved 25 January 2016. The invention of trumps became so popular that very few European trick- taking games exist without them. This did not stop the two-handed Piquet from becoming the most popular card game in Europe during the 16th century. Parlett suggests the invention of trumps let players in games involving more than two a greater chance of heading a trick. The invention of bidding for a trump suit is credited to Ombre, the most popular card game of the 17th century. Rather than having a randomly selected trump suit, players can now hold an auction for it. The most popular games of the 18th-century was tarot which experienced a great revival.. During this time, many tarot games borrowed bidding over the stock (Taroc l'Hombre). In the 20th century, Whist (now with bidding and the dummy hand) developed into Contract bridge, the last global trick-taking game. It is possible that the origin of the practice of counting tricks (in plain- trick games) was the counting of cards won in tricks. It was therefore a logical development to accord some cards a higher counting-value, and some cards no value at all, leading to point-trick games. Point-trick games are at least as old as tarot decks and may even predate the invention of trumps. Elfern and F√ºnfzehnern are possible candidates although the earliest references date to the 19th century. Nearly all point-trick games are played with tarot decks or stripped decks, which in many countries became standard before 1600, and neither point-trick games nor stripped decks have a tradition in England. While there are a number of games with unusual card-point values, such as Trappola and All Fours, most point-trick games are in the huge family of Ace‚ÄìTen card games beginning with Brusquembille. Pinochle is a representative of this family that is popular in the United States. Other examples include Belote and Skat. In contrast to Europe, Chinese trick-taking games did not develop trumps or bidding. They diverged into multi-trick games where melds can only be beaten by other melds provided they have the same number of cards. During the Qing dynasty, these multi-trick games evolved into the earliest draw-and-discard games where the players' objective is to form melds and \\"go out\\" rather than capturing the opponents' cards. Khanhoo is an example of a multi-trick game that became a draw-and-discard game. Multi-trick games are also probably the source for climbing games like Winner and dou dizhu which first appeared during the Cultural Revolution. Basic structure Certain actions in trick-taking games with three or more players always proceed in the same direction. In games originating in North and West Europe, including England, Russia, and the United States and Canada, the rotation is typically clockwise (i.e., play proceeds to the left); in South and East Europe, Latin America, and Asia it is typically counterclockwise, so that play proceeds to the right. When games move from one region to another, they tend to initially preserve their original sense of rotation, but a region with a dominant sense of rotation may adapt a migrated game to its own sensibilities. For two-player games the order of play is moot as either direction would result in exactly the same turn order. In each hand or deal, one player is the dealer. This function moves from deal to deal in the normal direction of play. The dealer usually shuffles the deck (some games use \\"soft shuffling\\", where the dealer does not explicitly shuffle the deck), and after giving the player one seat from the dealer opposite the normal direction of play an opportunity to cut, hands out the same (prescribed) number of cards to each player, usually in an order following the normal direction of play. Most games deal cards one at a time in rotation; a few games require dealing multiple cards at one time in a packet. The cards apportioned to each player are collectively known as that player's hand and are only known to the player. Some games involve a set of cards that are not dealt to a player's hand; these cards form the stock (see below). It is generally good manners to leave one's cards on the table until the deal is complete. The player sitting one seat after the declarer (one with the highest bid and not the dealer) in normal rotation is known as the eldest hand, also called the forehand in Skat and other games of German origin. The eldest hand leads to the first trick, i.e. places the first card of the trick face up in the middle of all players. The other players each follow with a single card, in the direction of play. When every player has played a card to the trick, the trick is evaluated to determine the winner, who takes the cards, places them face down on a pile, and leads to the next trick. The winner or taker of a trick is usually the player who played the highest-value card of the suit that was led, unless the game uses one or more trump cards (see below). The player who leads to a trick is usually allowed to play an arbitrary card from their hand. Some games have restrictions on the first card played in the hand, or may disallow leading a card of a particular suit until that suit has been played \\"off-suit\\" in a prior trick (called \\"breaking\\" the suit, usually seen in cases of a trump or penalty suit). Other games have special restrictions on the card that must be led to the first trick; usually this is a specific card (e.g., 2) and the holder of that card is the eldest hand instead of the person one seat after the dealer. In many games, the following players must follow suit if they can, i.e., they must play a card of the same suit if possible. A player who cannot follow suit may sluff a card, i.e., play a card of a different suit. A trick is won by the player who has played the highest-ranked card of the suit led, i.e., of the suit of the first card in the trick (unless the game uses a trump suit). It can be an advantage to lead to a trick, because the player who leads controls the suit that is led and which others must follow; the leading player playing a suit of which he has many, decreases the chance that anyone else would be able to follow suit; while conversely playing a suit of which he has few, allows him to rid his hand of that suit (known as voiding the suit), freeing him from the restriction to follow suit when that suit is led by another player. On the other hand, it can also be advantageous to be the final player who plays to the trick, because at that point one has full information about the other cards played to the trick; the last player to a trick can play a card just slightly higher or lower than the current winning card, guaranteeing they will win or lose it by the minimum amount necessary, saving more valuable high or low value cards for situations where they must guarantee that a card played early to a trick will win or lose. When all cards have been played, the number or contents of the tricks won by each player is tallied and used to update the score. Scoring based on the play of tricks varies widely between games, but in most games either the number of tricks a player or partnership has won (plain-trick games), or the value of certain cards that the player has won by taking tricks (point-trick games) is important.  Partnerships  * In many games such as Hearts and Oh Hell, all players play individually against each other. * In many four-player games such as Bridge, Euchre and Spades, the players sitting opposite to each other form a fixed partnership. * Some games such as Pinochle are commonly played with or without partnerships, depending on the number of players. * In some contract/auction games for three or more players, e.g. most Tarot variants, the contractor (declarer or taker) plays alone against all opponents, who form an ad hoc partnership (the defenders). * In some games the partnerships are decided by chance ‚Äì the contractor forms a partnership with the winner of the first trick, or with the player who holds a certain card. This practice originated from Cinquillo and Quadrille. ** In K√∂nigrufen and five-player French tarot the taker can call out a suit of which he does not possess the King, and is partnered with whomever does have it against the other three. ** Standard Schafkopf is similar: A \\"player\\" can \\"call\\" a suit, and the person holding the ace of that suit becomes his partner for the hand. As this is not openly declared, it can be a challenge for the remaining players, to find out who is partnered with whom through cunning playing for several tricks. Aside from that, standard Schafkopf also has several solo options, where the \\"player\\" plays alone against the rest. ** In Doppelkopf the two players holding the black Queens are partners for that hand. Special rules are provided for the case where a single player holds both black Queens. Stock In some games not all cards are distributed to the players, and a stock remains. This stock can be referred to by different names, depending on the game; supply, talon, nest, skat, kitty, and dog are common game-specific and/or regional names. In some games the stock remains untouched throughout play of the hand; it is simply a pile of \\"extra\\" cards that will never be played and whose values are unknown, which will reduce the effectiveness of \\"counting cards\\" (a common strategy of keeping track of the cards that have been played or are yet to be played). In games without bidding, trumps may be decided by exposing a card in the stock as in Triomphe. In other games, the winner of an auction-bidding process (the taker or declarer) may get to exchange cards from his hand with the stock, either by integrating the stock into his hand and then discarding equal cards as in Skat, Rook and French tarot, or in a \\"blind\\" fashion by discarding and drawing as in Ombre. The stock, either in its original or discarded form, may additionally form part of one or more players' \\"scoring piles\\" of tricks taken; it may be kept by the declarer, may be won by the player of the first trick, or may go to an opposing player or partnership. In some games, especially two-player games, after each trick every player draws a new card. This continues while the stock lasts. Since this drawing mechanism would normally make it difficult or impossible to detect a revoke (for instance, the player may not be able to follow suit, so they play off-suit and then immediately draw a card of the suit led), in the first phase of trick-play (before the stock is empty) players generally need not follow suit. A widespread game of this type is the Marriage group.  Bidding  In a contract game the winning and scoring conditions are not fixed but are chosen by one of the players after seeing their hand. In such games, players make bids depending on the number of tricks or card points they believe they can win during play of the hand. One or more of these bids stands as the contract, and the player who made that bid is rewarded for meeting it or penalized for not meeting it. In auction games, bidding players are competing against each other for the right to attempt to make the contract. In a few games, the contract is fixed (normally a simple majority, less often based on certain cards captured during play) and players' bids are a wager of game points to be won or lost. In others, the bid is a number of tricks or card points the bidder is confident that they or their partnership will take. Either of these can also include the suit to be used as trumps during the hand. Common bids include slam (winning all the tricks), mis√®re (losing all the tricks), ouvert (the contractor's hand is exposed), playing without using the stock or only part of it, and winning the last trick or other specific tricks. The highest bid becomes the contract and the highest bidder is the contractor, known in some games as the declarer or taker, who then plays either with or without a partner. The other players become opponents or defenders, whose main goal is to prevent the contract being met. They may announce a contra against the contractor which doubles the points for the hand. The contractor can declare a recontra which will double the points again. Popular examples of games with auctions include Contract bridge, Pinochle, tarot games, Skat, Belote and Twenty-Eight. In many auction games the eldest hand leads to the first trick, regardless of who won the auction, but in some, such as Contract Bridge, the first lead is made by the player next in rotation after the contractor, so that the contractor plays last to that trick. In precision or exact-prediction games, all players choose their winning condition independently: to win precisely a predicted number of tricks (Oh Hell) or card points (Differenzler). Each player's bid stands (in partnership games the partners' bids are often combined), and each player or partnership then tries to take exactly the number of tricks or points they bid, and are rewarded or penalized for doing so independently of anyone else's success or failure in meeting their bid. This type of game began to mature in the 20th century.. Other games generally falling into the exact-prediction category are Spades and Ninety- Nine. Trumps Trump cards are a set of one or more cards in the deck that, when played, are of higher value than the suit led. If a trick contains any trump cards, it is won by the highest-value trump card played, not the highest-value card of the suit led. In most games with trumps, one of the four suits is identified as the trump suit. In the simplest case, there is a static trump suit such as the Spade suit in the game Spades, or a dedicated trump suit in the Tarot family (in addition to the other four) is featured. More often, a dynamic trump suit is determined by some means, either randomly by selection of a card as in Oh Hell and the original form of Whist, or decided by the winner or winning bid of an auction as in contract bridge and some forms of Pinochle. In certain games, such as Rowboat and Rage, the trump suit may change during the course of the hand, even from trick to trick. Some psychological variety is added to the game and makes it more difficult to cheat if the trump suit is only chosen after dealing. In some games, in addition to or separately from a trump suit, certain fixed cards are always the highest trumps, e.g. the Jacks in Skat, the Jacks or Jokers in Euchre, and the Rook Bird card in Rook. They are called matadors after the high trumps in Ombre. Matadors either have high point values or special abilities as in Spoil Five where they can revoke legally. Some games have more than one trump suit, such as the quasi-trick game Stortok, in which there are two trumps, with one superseding the other. Other games have no trumps; Hearts for instance has no provision for a trump suit of any kind (the Hearts suit for which the game is named has a different significance). Though trump is part of contract bridge, teams can make bids that do not specify a trump suit, and if that is the winning bid then there is no trump suit for that hand (making such a contract is regarded as harder to accomplish). Declarations In some games such as Piquet, Tarocchini, and Belote, before the taking of tricks commences, players can expose certain cards or melds (combinations) that they possess for bonus points. While this phase may seem to award players for pure chance, those who do declare risk letting their opponents develop strategies to counter the cards that they have revealed. Follow suit In many games, following suit is the obligatory action of playing a card of the same suit as that of the leading suit. A player must follow suit if that player has cards of the leading suit in his hands. There is a large variation of strictness in following suit among games.McLeod, John. Mechanics of Card Games at pagat.com. Retrieved 18 February 2017. In most modern games with trump suits, the rules for following suit do not distinguish between the trump suit and the plain suits. If a trick begins with a plain suit card and a later player cannot follow suit, the player may choose freely to either slough (discard a card of another plain suit), or ruff (trump the trick by playing a trump card). Subsequent players to the trick must still follow the original suit, and may only discard or trump if they do not hold a card of the suit led. Certain games are \\"play to beat\\" or \\"must-trump\\"; if a player cannot follow suit but can play trump, they must play trump, and additionally if they are able they must beat any trump card already played to the trick. Pinochle and several of the Tarot card games have this rule. Some games, notably French tarot and a variation of Rook, use a special card (in French Tarot's case, the Excuse) that can be played at any time. If not, he has the choice of playing a trump to possibly win the trick, or rough (waste) a different suit. If unable to follow suit or trump, any card can be played. Each trick must contain one card per player, and hence a player unable to satisfy any other instruction is at liberty to play any card. Usually a low-ranking card or one from a short suit is sacrificed. The former is used to protect a higher ranking card while the latter is to help void a suit so as to allow trumping a future trick. It is also possible that the specific deal has \\"no trump\\". In that case, any card other than the leading suit played has no value, in most trick-taking games. In some games such as Oh, hell, where the player may need to not get more tricks to win, playing cards other than the leading suit can be useful.McLeod, John. Oh Hell! at pagat.com. Retrieved 18 February 2017. For example, consider the following Whist hand: :: Trump diamonds * North: * East: * South: * West: North leads the deal with . Now, all the other players must follow suit, i.e. play a spade card. East has a spade card, and thus must follow suit by playing . South, however, does not have any spade card, and thus is allowed to play any card he wants. If he desires to win the trick, he can override North's by playing a diamond card (diamond being the trump), for example . If he does not want to win the trick, he can slough any other suit, such as . Let us assume that he plays , overriding North's card. Now, West still has to follow suit, since he has a spade card, and plays . South's trump card, gives him an opportunity to escape following suit, and he wins the trick. If a player who can follow suit does not do so, or in games with additional restrictions on card play, not following these restrictions is known as a revoke, or 'renege'. A revoke typically cannot be discovered at the time when it is committed, but when a player plays off-suit to a trick, competent opponents will make a mental note that the player does not hold the suit led, and will notice later if the player later plays a card of the suit they were thought to be void in. The situation is similar for other types of revoke. Most game rules prescribe a severe penalty for a revoke and may also result in the hand being voided (a \\"misdeal\\"). Decks of cards have been marketed for trick-taking games with the traditional French suit symbols, but in four colors; these are often called \\"no-revoke\\" decks, as the color contrast between each suit makes a potential revoking play easier to spot and harder to do accidentally. In some trick games‚Äîtypically ones in which players are not penalized for winning tricks, and there is no requirement for trumping or following suit when possible‚Äîplayers may slough, or play a card face down. A card so played is incapable of winning the trick; but sloughing has the advantage that the other players cannot see what card is played. As this form of sloughing has the potential to be used to cheat in most games (i.e. playing a winning card face- down to avoid taking an \\"overtrick\\" or a trick containing penalty points) and is thus not allowed, sloughing in the vernacular more often refers to simply discarding an off-suit card on a trick, particularly one that could be dangerous to that player if kept. This form of sloughing is important in evasion games and in some contract games where \\"overtricks\\" are penalized; in Oh Hell, for instance, a player who cannot follow suit may elect to discard a card that would win if played to follow suit later, thus reducing the chance that the player will \\"bag\\", or take more tricks than needed. This is common in Hearts, where high-value cards (especially Spades and Hearts) are dangerous as they increase the chance of winning a trick with penalty points. Some games such as Pinochle use several decks shuffled together. In these games, there may be several equal winning cards in a trick; such games then use other rules to break ties. Common rules include: * the first-played of the tying cards wins * the last-played of the tying cards wins * The tying cards cancel each other out, and the trick is taken by the next-highest card that was played. * The tying cards cancel each other out, but the trick is spoiled (ignored). A common additional rule to reduce these occurrences is that a player cannot play a card tying the current high card unless they would renege or fail to overtrump by making any other play. Scoring When all tricks have been played, the winner of the hand and the players' scores can be determined. The determining factor in plain-trick games (the most popular form of trick-taking games in English-speaking countries) is simply how many tricks each player or partnership has taken. In point-trick games, certain card values are worth varying points, and the players sum the points from cards in their \\"scoring piles\\" that were accumulated by taking tricks. Points for cards, and the method of counting points, vary by game; in Rook, for example, the 5-card of each color is worth 5 points, the 10 and 14 (or Ace) is worth 10, and the Rook Bird (or Joker) is worth 20, while all other cards are worth nothing. Many Chinese card games like Finding Friends use a very similar system, in which each 5-card is worth 5 points, and the 10 and King are each worth 10 points.Rules for Chinese trick-taking card game \\"Finding Friends (Zhao Pengyou)\\". Retrieved on 7 September 2018. Pinochle has many popular scoring variants usually based on point values for face cards and Aces, while pip cards score no points. In French tarot, all cards have a value including a half-point, and are traditionally scored in pairs of a high-value and a low- value card which results in a whole-point value for the pair. In the most common positive or race games, players seek to win as many tricks or card points as possible. To win a hand, a player typically needs to win a minimal number of tricks or card points; this minimal threshold is usually called the \\"contract\\", and may be defined by the game's rules (a simple majority of total available points or tricks, or tiered thresholds depending on which player or side has captured certain cards), or the result of an \\"auction\\" or \\"bidding\\" process. A player who wins more than the number of tricks or card points necessary for winning the hand may be rewarded with a higher score, or conversely (in exact-prediction games) they may be penalized. There are also negative or evasion games, in which the object is to avoid tricks or card points. E.g. in Hearts each card point won in a trick contributes negatively to the score. A special type is mis√®re games, which are usually variants of positive games which can only be won by not winning a single trick. Other criteria also occur. Sometimes the last trick has special significance. In marriage games such as Pinochle the winner of the last trick receives 10 points in addition to the card points, while in final-trick games such as c·∫Øt t√™ only the winner of the last trick can win a hand. There are also blends between positive and negative games, e.g. the aim may be to win a certain prescribed number of tricks. Many card games, regardless of their normal scoring mechanism, give bonuses to players or partnerships who win all tricks or possible points in a hand, or conversely lose all tricks or points. Games usually end after every player has had an equal chance to be the dealer. The number of rotations varies widely among games. Some games have a cumulative score where all points from each hand add up. Others assign only a set number of game points for winning a hand. For example, a player or side that wins one hand may be awarded one game point, two if they achieve a slam. The player or side with the most game points or the first to reach a certain number of card or game points, is considered the winner. Special variations = Variations to basic rules = Numerous further variations to the basic rules may occur, and only a few examples can be mentioned here: * Certain games require the holder of a certain card value to play it as the lead to the first trick of a hand; Hearts, as commonly played in North America, requires the player holding the 2 to play it as the lead-off card. Variants of Pinochle sometimes require the first player to the left of the dealer that holds a dix (9) to lead off. * There may be restrictions on leading certain suits; a common Hearts rule is that a player may not lead a Heart until at least one trick has had a Heart played off-suit to another trick. Spades has a similar but less-common variation regarding its trump suit. * There are trick-taking games played with Domino tiles instead of playing cards. These include the Chinese Tien Gow and Texas 42. Giog is played with Chinese chess tiles. * Many games are played with one or more stripped decks (a deck from which certain card values are removed). The most common stripped deck is a piquet deck, used for piquet, Belote, Skat, Euchre, Bezique and (with two piquet decks) Pinochle, among others. Rook's main variant, Kentucky Discard, uses the equivalent of a 52-card deck with all card values 2‚Äì4 removed. Most regional Tarot variants, especially Central European and Italian variants like Tarock and Tarocco, use some subset of the \\"full\\" 78-card Tarot deck. * In Bridge the partner of the contractor or declarer is called dummy and does not actively participate in the play; dummy's hand is instead laid on the table face-up after the opening lead, and declarer chooses the cards from dummy's hand to play during dummy's turns. * In Hachinin-meri and Truf, trumps are played face down. When the trick is finished, the trumps are revealed to see who won the trick.McLeod, John. Truf at pagat.com. Retrieved 25 January 2016. * In many trumpless games that do not require following suit, sluffing is done face down. This is done in Madiao, Tien Gow, Tam c√∫c, Six Tigers, Ganjifa, Kaiserspiel, and Brazilian Truco. * Some cards lose their trick-taking power if they are not led or played in a specific trick as in Karn√∂ffel, Tien Gow, and Ganjifa. * In tarot games played outside of Central Europe, the Fool is a special card that excuses the player from following suit. Except in rare circumstances in some games, it can neither capture nor be captured. Usually a non-counting card is given as compensation to the trick's winner by the Fool's owner. = Rules in Austrian and German games = In games derived from Austria and Germany, trick-taking is governed by the rules called Zw√§nge. The three main ones are Farbzwang, Stichzwang and Trumpfzwang. Although they broadly equate to rules in English-speaking countries, there are no single- word equivalents. For many games of this type, applying these rules correctly is crucial to the type of contract being played.  Farbzwang  Farbzwang (or Bedienzwang) literally means \\"suit compulsion\\" and is the rule that players must follow the suit of the first card to be led to the trick, provided that they have a card of that suit. If a player does not have a card of the led suit, they may play ('discard') a card of their choice. If a player has several cards of the led suit, they may choose which to play. In most cases it makes sense to play a higher ranking card.  Stichzwang  Stichzwang means \\"trick compulsion\\" and is the rule that players must attempt to win the trick if they are able, either by playing a higher card of the led suit or by playing a trump card.  Farbzwang with Stichzwang  Some games apply Farbzwang and Stichzwang together, which means that a player, when it is his turn, must: * take the trick with a higher card of the led suit. If unable to do so, he must * discard a lower card of the led suit. If that is not possible, he must * take the trick with a trump card, but if that is also not feasible, he may * discard a card of his choice. Farbzwang, the requirement to follow suit, always takes precedence over Stichzwang. A player is not allowed to take the trick with a trump if he can follow suit.  Trumpfzwang  Trumpfzwang means \\"trump compulsion\\" and requires that a player must play a trump if he cannot follow suit. In other words, he may not simply discard, if he cannot follow suit. Example: Acorns are trumps. Forehand plays the 8 of Bells, middlehand trumps with a 10 of Acorns; rearhand has no Bells, but does have a trump card, the 8 of Acorns. He must play this and cannot discard another non-trump card in order to keep the trump for a subsequent trick.  Tarockzwang  Tarockzwang is used in tarock games such as K√∂nigrufen and Tapp-Tarock and means \\"Tarock compulsion\\" or the requirement to play a Tarock card if one is led to the trick or if a player is unable to follow suit. It is a form of Trumpfzwang.  Examples  Trick- taking games may be divided into point-trick games and plain-trick games. Examples of each are as follows: = Point-trick games = Point-trick game are those in which win or loss is determined by the total value of the \\"counters\\" in the tricks.. The counters are cards with a point value, sometimes referred to as \\"card points\\" to avoid confusion with \\"game points\\" awarded for winning the game and/or bonuses. Examples include: * Bavarian Tarock * Belote * B√©zique * Binokel * Doppelkopf * Jass * Finding Friends (Zhao Pengyou) * Schafkopf * Schnapsen or Sixty-six * Skat * Tarock games (French tarot, K√∂nigrufen, Zwanzigerrufen, etc.) * Trappola (Bulka) = Plain- trick games = Plain-trick games are those in which the outcome is determined by the number of tricks taken, regardless of their content. Examples of plain- trick games include: * Boston * Bridge * √âcart√© * Jabberwocky * Ombre and Quadrille * Piquet * Pr√©f√©rence * Solo Whist * Tippen * Watten * Whist In games that consist of several successive, different, trick-taking contracts, such as Herzeln or Quodlibet, it is not possible to categorise them as either point- or plain-trick games. = Last trick games = In a very few games the aim is to win the last trick. These include: * Agram * Femkort * Letzter Stich * Toepen = Trick-avoidance games = Trick-avoidance games are those in which the aim is to avoid taking certain tricks or to avoid taking all tricks. Misere or bettel are contracts in which the declarer undertakes to win no tricks. There are also contracts like Piccolo in which the aim is to take only one trick. Examples include: * Bassadewitz * Grasobern * Hearts * Polignac * Slobberhannes See also * List of trick-taking games Notes References  . * . * .

Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and physical properties of matter. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering, but also in other complex fields such as meteorology. Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines, particularly through the work of French physicist Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic Wars. Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 which stated, \\"Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency.\\" The initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was quickly extended to the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field.Duhem, P.M.M. (1886). Le Potential Thermodynamique et ses Applications, Hermann, Paris.Guggenheim, E.A. (1933). Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of J.W. Gibbs, Methuen, London.Guggenheim, E.A. (1949/1967). Thermodynamics. An Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists, 1st edition 1949, 5th edition 1967, North-Holland, Amsterdam. Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged. Statistical thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, concerns itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carath√©odory presented a purely mathematical approach in an axiomatic formulation, a description often referred to as geometrical thermodynamics. Introduction A description of any thermodynamic system employs the four laws of thermodynamics that form an axiomatic basis. The first law specifies that energy can be exchanged between physical systems as heat and work. The second law defines the existence of a quantity called entropy, that describes the direction, thermodynamically, that a system can evolve and quantifies the state of order of a system and that can be used to quantify the useful work that can be extracted from the system. In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of the thermodynamic system and its surroundings. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, and those properties are in turn related to one another through equations of state. Properties can be combined to express internal energy and thermodynamic potentials, which are useful for determining conditions for equilibrium and spontaneous processes. With these tools, thermodynamics can be used to describe how systems respond to changes in their environment. This can be applied to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, such as engines, phase transitions, chemical reactions, transport phenomena, and even black holes. The results of thermodynamics are essential for other fields of physics and for chemistry, chemical engineering, corrosion engineering, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, cell biology, biomedical engineering, materials science, and economics, to name a few. This article is focused mainly on classical thermodynamics which primarily studies systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is often treated as an extension of the classical treatment, but statistical mechanics has brought many advances to that field. The thermodynamicists representative of the original eight founding schools of thermodynamics. The schools with the most-lasting effect in founding the modern versions of thermodynamics are the Berlin school, particularly as established in Rudolf Clausius‚Äôs 1865 textbook The Mechanical Theory of Heat, the Vienna school, with the statistical mechanics of Ludwig Boltzmann, and the Gibbsian school at Yale University, American engineer Willard Gibbs' 1876 On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances launching chemical thermodynamics.Schools of thermodynamics ‚Äì EoHT.info. History The history of thermodynamics as a scientific discipline generally begins with Otto von Guericke who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first vacuum pump and demonstrated a vacuum using his Magdeburg hemispheres. Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove Aristotle's long-held supposition that 'nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly after Guericke, the Anglo-Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle had learned of Guericke's designs and, in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke, built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between pressure, temperature, and volume. In time, Boyle's Law was formulated, which states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional. Then, in 1679, based on these concepts, an associate of Boyle's named Denis Papin built a steam digester, which was a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confined steam until a high pressure was generated. Later designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and a cylinder engine. He did not, however, follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer Thomas Savery built the first engine, followed by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. The fundamental concepts of heat capacity and latent heat, which were necessary for the development of thermodynamics, were developed by Professor Joseph Black at the University of Glasgow, where James Watt was employed as an instrument maker. Black and Watt performed experiments together, but it was Watt who conceived the idea of the external condenser which resulted in a large increase in steam engine efficiency.The Newcomen engine was improved from 1711 until Watt's work, making the efficiency comparison subject to qualification, but the increase from the 1865 version was on the order of 100%. Drawing on all the previous work led Sadi Carnot, the \\"father of thermodynamics\\", to publish Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire (1824), a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency. The book outlined the basic energetic relations between the Carnot engine, the Carnot cycle, and motive power. It marked the start of thermodynamics as a modern science. The first thermodynamic textbook was written in 1859 by William Rankine, originally trained as a physicist and a civil and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Glasgow. The first and second laws of thermodynamics emerged simultaneously in the 1850s, primarily out of the works of William Rankine, Rudolf Clausius, and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin).A New Kind of Science Note (b) for Irreversibility and the Second Law of Thermodynamics The foundations of statistical thermodynamics were set out by physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, Max Planck, Rudolf Clausius and J. Willard Gibbs. During the years 1873‚Äì76 the American mathematical physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs published a series of three papers, the most famous being On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, in which he showed how thermodynamic processes, including chemical reactions, could be graphically analyzed, by studying the energy, entropy, volume, temperature and pressure of the thermodynamic system in such a manner, one can determine if a process would occur spontaneously. Also Pierre Duhem in the 19th century wrote about chemical thermodynamics. During the early 20th century, chemists such as Gilbert N. Lewis, Merle Randall, and E. A. Guggenheim applied the mathematical methods of Gibbs to the analysis of chemical processes. Etymology The etymology of thermodynamics has an intricate history. It was first spelled in a hyphenated form as an adjective (thermo-dynamic) and from 1854 to 1868 as the noun thermo-dynamics to represent the science of generalized heat engines. American biophysicist Donald Haynie claims that thermodynamics was coined in 1840 from the Greek root Œ∏Œ≠œÅŒºŒ∑ therme, meaning ‚Äúheat‚Äù, and Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±ŒºŒπœÇ dynamis, meaning ‚Äúpower‚Äù. Pierre Perrot claims that the term thermodynamics was coined by James Joule in 1858 to designate the science of relations between heat and power, however, Joule never used that term, but used instead the term perfect thermo-dynamic engine in reference to Thomson's 1849 phraseology. By 1858, thermo-dynamics, as a functional term, was used in William Thomson's paper \\"An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat.\\"Kelvin, William T. (1849) \\"An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat ‚Äì with Numerical Results Deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam.\\" Transactions of the Edinburg Royal Society, XVI. January 2.Scanned Copy Branches of thermodynamics The study of thermodynamical systems has developed into several related branches, each using a different fundamental model as a theoretical or experimental basis, or applying the principles to varying types of systems. =Classical thermodynamics= Classical thermodynamics is the description of the states of thermodynamic systems at near-equilibrium, that uses macroscopic, measurable properties. It is used to model exchanges of energy, work and heat based on the laws of thermodynamics. The qualifier classical reflects the fact that it represents the first level of understanding of the subject as it developed in the 19th century and describes the changes of a system in terms of macroscopic empirical (large scale, and measurable) parameters. A microscopic interpretation of these concepts was later provided by the development of statistical mechanics. =Statistical mechanics= Statistical mechanics, also called statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and supplemented classical thermodynamics with an interpretation of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-mechanical states. This field relates the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining classical thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum theory at the microscopic level. =Chemical thermodynamics= Chemical thermodynamics is the study of the interrelation of energy with chemical reactions or with a physical change of state within the confines of the laws of thermodynamics. =Equilibrium thermodynamics= Equilibrium thermodynamics is the study of transfers of matter and energy in systems or bodies that, by agencies in their surroundings, can be driven from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another. The term 'thermodynamic equilibrium' indicates a state of balance, in which all macroscopic flows are zero; in the case of the simplest systems or bodies, their intensive properties are homogeneous, and their pressures are perpendicular to their boundaries. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces, between macroscopically distinct parts of the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial equilibrium state, and given its surroundings, and given its constitutive walls, to calculate what will be the final equilibrium state of the system after a specified thermodynamic operation has changed its walls or surroundings. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods. Laws of thermodynamics Thermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally valid when applied to systems that fall within the constraints implied by each. In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are the following. =Zeroth Law= The zeroth law of thermodynamics states: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This statement implies that thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation on the set of thermodynamic systems under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian motion) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide whether two bodies are at the same temperature, it is not necessary to bring them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time.Moran, Michael J. and Howard N. Shapiro, 2008. Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics. 6th ed. Wiley and Sons: 16. The law provides an empirical definition of temperature, and justification for the construction of practical thermometers. The zeroth law was not initially recognized as a separate law of thermodynamics, as its basis in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws. The first, second, and third laws had been explicitly stated already, and found common acceptance in the physics community before the importance of the zeroth law for the definition of temperature was realized. As it was impractical to renumber the other laws, it was named the zeroth law. =First Law= The first law of thermodynamics states: In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy, , of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat, , less the thermodynamic work, , done by the system on its surroundings.Bailyn, M. (1994). A Survey of Thermodynamics, American Institute of Physics, AIP Press, Woodbury NY, , p. 79.The sign convention (Q is heat supplied to the system as, W is work done by the system) is that of Rudolf Clausius. The opposite sign convention is customary in chemical thermodynamics. :\\\\Delta U = Q - W. For processes that include transfer of matter, a further statement is needed: With due account of the respective fiducial reference states of the systems, when two systems, which may be of different chemical compositions, initially separated only by an impermeable wall, and otherwise isolated, are combined into a new system by the thermodynamic operation of removal of the wall, then :U_0 = U_1 + U_2, where denotes the internal energy of the combined system, and and denote the internal energies of the respective separated systems. Adapted for thermodynamics, this law is an expression of the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.Callen, H.B. (1960/1985).Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics, second edition, John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken NY, , pp. 11‚Äì13. Internal energy is a principal property of the thermodynamic state, while heat and work are modes of energy transfer by which a process may change this state. A change of internal energy of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat added or removed and work performed on or by the system. As a function of state, the internal energy does not depend on the manner, or on the path through intermediate steps, by which the system arrived at its state. =Second Law= The second law of thermodynamics states: Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter location. This law is an expression of the universal principle of decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. Entropy is a measure of how much this process has progressed. The entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium. However, principles guiding systems that are far from equilibrium are still debatable. One of such principles is the maximum entropy production principle. It states that non-equilibrium systems behave such a way as to maximize its entropy production. In classical thermodynamics, the second law is a basic postulate applicable to any system involving heat energy transfer; in statistical thermodynamics, the second law is a consequence of the assumed randomness of molecular chaos. There are many versions of the second law, but they all have the same effect, which is to express the phenomenon of irreversibility in nature. =Third Law= The third law of thermodynamics states: As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. This law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding entropy and the impossibility of reaching absolute zero of temperature. This law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy. The entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy. Alternate definitions include \\"the entropy of all systems and of all states of a system is smallest at absolute zero,\\" or equivalently \\"it is impossible to reach the absolute zero of temperature by any finite number of processes\\". Absolute zero, at which all activity would stop if it were possible to achieve, is ‚àí273.15 ¬∞C (degrees Celsius), or ‚àí459.67 ¬∞F (degrees Fahrenheit), or 0 K (kelvin), or 0¬∞ R (degrees Rankine). System models A diagram of a generic thermodynamic system An important concept in thermodynamics is the thermodynamic system, which is a precisely defined region of the universe under study. Everything in the universe except the system is called the surroundings. A system is separated from the remainder of the universe by a boundary which may be a physical or notional, but serve to confine the system to a finite volume. Segments of the boundary are often described as walls; they have respective defined 'permeabilities'. Transfers of energy as work, or as heat, or of matter, between the system and the surroundings, take place through the walls, according to their respective permeabilities. Matter or energy that pass across the boundary so as to effect a change in the internal energy of the system need to be accounted for in the energy balance equation. The volume contained by the walls can be the region surrounding a single atom resonating energy, such as Max Planck defined in 1900; it can be a body of steam or air in a steam engine, such as Sadi Carnot defined in 1824. The system could also be just one nuclide (i.e. a system of quarks) as hypothesized in quantum thermodynamics. When a looser viewpoint is adopted, and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium is dropped, the system can be the body of a tropical cyclone, such as Kerry Emanuel theorized in 1986 in the field of atmospheric thermodynamics, or the event horizon of a black hole. Boundaries are of four types: fixed, movable, real, and imaginary. For example, in an engine, a fixed boundary means the piston is locked at its position, within which a constant volume process might occur. If the piston is allowed to move that boundary is movable while the cylinder and cylinder head boundaries are fixed. For closed systems, boundaries are real while for open systems boundaries are often imaginary. In the case of a jet engine, a fixed imaginary boundary might be assumed at the intake of the engine, fixed boundaries along the surface of the case and a second fixed imaginary boundary across the exhaust nozzle. Generally, thermodynamics distinguishes three classes of systems, defined in terms of what is allowed to cross their boundaries: As time passes in an isolated system, internal differences of pressures, densities, and temperatures tend to even out. A system in which all equalizing processes have gone to completion is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Once in thermodynamic equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium are much simpler and easier to understand than are systems which are not in equilibrium. Often, when analysing a dynamic thermodynamic process, the simplifying assumption is made that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium, producing thermodynamic processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an equilibrium state and are said to be reversible processes. States and processes When a system is at equilibrium under a given set of conditions, it is said to be in a definite thermodynamic state. The state of the system can be described by a number of state quantities that do not depend on the process by which the system arrived at its state. They are called intensive variables or extensive variables according to how they change when the size of the system changes. The properties of the system can be described by an equation of state which specifies the relationship between these variables. State may be thought of as the instantaneous quantitative description of a system with a set number of variables held constant. A thermodynamic process may be defined as the energetic evolution of a thermodynamic system proceeding from an initial state to a final state. It can be described by process quantities. Typically, each thermodynamic process is distinguished from other processes in energetic character according to what parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or volume, etc., are held fixed; Furthermore, it is useful to group these processes into pairs, in which each variable held constant is one member of a conjugate pair. Several commonly studied thermodynamic processes are: * Adiabatic process: occurs without loss or gain of energy by heat * Isenthalpic process: occurs at a constant enthalpy * Isentropic process: a reversible adiabatic process, occurs at a constant entropy * Isobaric process: occurs at constant pressure * Isochoric process: occurs at constant volume (also called isometric/isovolumetric) * Isothermal process: occurs at a constant temperature * Steady state process: occurs without a change in the internal energy  Instrumentation  There are two types of thermodynamic instruments, the meter and the reservoir. A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a thermodynamic system. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument. For example, the zeroth law states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted by James Maxwell in 1872, asserts that it is possible to measure temperature. An idealized thermometer is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From the ideal gas law pV=nRT, the volume of such a sample can be used as an indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a barometer may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a constant temperature. A calorimeter is a device which is used to measure and define the internal energy of a system. A thermodynamic reservoir is a system which is so large that its state parameters are not appreciably altered when it is brought into contact with the system of interest. When the reservoir is brought into contact with the system, the system is brought into equilibrium with the reservoir. For example, a pressure reservoir is a system at a particular pressure, which imposes that pressure upon the system to which it is mechanically connected. The Earth's atmosphere is often used as a pressure reservoir. The ocean can act as temperature reservoir when used to cool power plants.  Conjugate variables  The central concept of thermodynamics is that of energy, the ability to do work. By the First Law, the total energy of a system and its surroundings is conserved. Energy may be transferred into a system by heating, compression, or addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or extraction of matter. In mechanics, for example, energy transfer equals the product of the force applied to a body and the resulting displacement. Conjugate variables are pairs of thermodynamic concepts, with the first being akin to a \\"force\\" applied to some thermodynamic system, the second being akin to the resulting \\"displacement,\\" and the product of the two equaling the amount of energy transferred. The common conjugate variables are: * Pressure-volume (the mechanical parameters); * Temperature-entropy (thermal parameters); * Chemical potential-particle number (material parameters).  Potentials  Thermodynamic potentials are different quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials are used to measure the energy changes in systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state. The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure. For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively. The five most well known potentials are: where T is the temperature, S the entropy, p the pressure, V the volume, \\\\mu the chemical potential, N the number of particles in the system, and i is the count of particles types in the system. Thermodynamic potentials can be derived from the energy balance equation applied to a thermodynamic system. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be obtained through Legendre transformation.

In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings. In later Scandinavian folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them. Trolls are sometimes associated with particular landmarks in Scandinavian folklore, which at times may be explained as formed from a troll exposed to sunlight. Trolls are depicted in a variety of media in modern popular culture. Etymology The Old Norse nouns troll and tr√∂ll (variously meaning \\"fiend, demon, werewolf, j√∂tunn\\") and Middle High German troll, trolle \\"fiend\\" (according to philologist Vladimir Orel likely borrowed from Old Norse) developed from Proto-Germanic neuter noun *trullan. The origin of the Proto-Germanic word is unknown.Orel (2003:410-411). Additionally, the Old Norse verb trylla 'to enchant, to turn into a troll' and the Middle High German verb tr√ºllen \\"to flutter\\" both developed from the Proto-Germanic verb *trulljanan, a derivative of *trullan. Norse mythology In Norse mythology, troll, like thurs, is a term applied to j√∂tnar and is mentioned throughout the Old Norse corpus. In Old Norse sources, trolls are said to dwell in isolated mountains, rocks, and caves, sometimes live together (usually as father-and- daughter or mother-and-son), and are rarely described as helpful or friendly.Orchard (1997:167). The Prose Edda book Sk√°ldskaparm√°l describes an encounter between an unnamed troll woman and the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason. According to the section, Bragi was driving through \\"a certain forest\\" late one evening when a troll woman aggressively asked him who he was, in the process describing herself: > {  Old Norse: :Troll kalla mik :trungl sj«´trungnis, :au√∞sug j«´tuns, > :√©ls√≥lar b«´l, :vilsinn v«´lu, :v«´r√∞ nafjar√∞ar, :hv√©lsveg himins ‚Äì :hvat's > troll nema √æat?Lindow (2007:22).  Anthony Faulkes translation: :'Trolls > call me :moon of dwelling-Rungnir, :giant's wealth-sucker, :storm-sun's > bale, :seeress's friendly companion, :guardian of corpse-fiord, :swallower > of heaven-wheel; :what is a troll other than that?'Faulkes (1995:132).  > John Lindow translation: :They call me a troll, :moon of the earth-Hrungnir > [?] :wealth sucker [?] of the giant, :destroyer of the storm-sun [?] > :beloved follower of the seeress, :guardian of the \\"nafjord\\" [?] :swallower > of the wheel of heaven [the sun]. :What's a troll if not that?  } Bragi responds in turn, describing himself and his abilities as a skillful skald, before the scenario ends. There is much confusion and overlap in the use of Old Norse terms j√∂tunn, troll, √æurs, and risi, which describe various beings. Lotte Motz theorized that these were originally four distinct classes of beings: lords of nature (j√∂tunn), mythical magicians (troll), hostile monsters (√æurs), and heroic and courtly beings (risi), the last class being the youngest addition. On the other hand, √Årmann Jakobson is critical of Motz's interpretation and calls this theory \\"unsupported by any convincing evidence\\".√Årmann Jakobsson (2006). √Årmann highlights that the term is used to denote various beings, such as a j√∂tunn or mountain-dweller, a witch, an abnormally strong or large or ugly person, an evil spirit, a ghost, a bl√°ma√∞r, a magical boar, a heathen demi-god, a demon, a brunnmigi, or a berserker.√Årmann Jakobsson (2008). Scandinavian folklore Skogtroll (Forest Troll), by Theodor Kittelsen, 1906 Later in Scandinavian folklore, trolls become defined as a particular type of being.Simek (2007:335). Numerous tales are recorded about trolls in which they are frequently described as being extremely old, very strong, but slow and dim-witted, and are at times described as man-eaters and as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight.Kvedelund, Sehsmdorf (2010:301‚Äî313). However, trolls are also attested as looking much the same as human beings, without any particularly hideous appearance about them, but living far away from human habitation and generally having \\"some form of social organization\\"‚Äîunlike the r√• and n√§ck, who are attested as \\"solitary beings\\". According to John Lindow, what sets them apart is that they are not Christian, and those who encounter them do not know them. Therefore, trolls were in the end dangerous, regardless of how well they might get along with Christian society, and trolls display a habit of bergtagning ('kidnapping'; literally \\"mountain-taking\\") and overrunning a farm or estate.Lindow (1978:33‚Äî35). Lindow states that the etymology of the word \\"troll\\" remains uncertain, though he defines trolls in later Swedish folklore as \\"nature beings\\" and as \\"all-purpose otherworldly being[s], equivalent, for example, to fairies in Anglo-Celtic traditions\\". They \\"therefore appear in various migratory legends where collective nature-beings are called for\\". Lindow notes that trolls are sometimes swapped out for cats and \\"little people\\" in the folklore record.Lindow (1978:33‚Äî35). A Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and j√∂tnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of the god Thor's role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and j√∂tnar in modern Scandinavia is sometimes explained as a result of the \\"accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes\\".See Lindow (1978:89), but noted as early as Thorpe (1851:154) who states \\"The dread entertained by Trolls for thunder dates from the time of paganism, Thor ... being the deadly foe of their race\\". Additionally, the absence of trolls in regions of Scandinavia is described in folklore as being a \\"consequence of the constant din of the church-bells\\". This ring caused the trolls to leave for other lands, although not without some resistance; numerous traditions relate how trolls destroyed a church under construction or hurled boulders and stones at completed churches. Large local stones are sometimes described as the product of a troll's toss.Thorpe (1851:158, 154‚Äî156). Additionally, into the 20th century, the origins of particular Scandinavian landmarks, such as particular stones, are ascribed to trolls who may, for example, have turned to stone upon exposure to sunlight. The Changeling, by John Bauer, 1913 Lindow compares the trolls of the Swedish folk tradition to Grendel, the supernatural mead hall invader in the Old English poem Beowulf, and notes that \\"just as the poem Beowulf emphasizes not the harrying of Grendel but the cleansing of the hall of Beowulf, so the modern tales stress the moment when the trolls are driven off.\\" Smaller trolls are attested as living in burial mounds and in mountains in Scandinavian folk tradition.MacCulloch (1930:223‚Äî224). In Denmark, these creatures are recorded as troldfolk (\\"troll-folk\\"), bjergtrolde (\\"mountain-trolls\\"), or bjergfolk (\\"mountain-folk\\") and in Norway also as troldfolk (\\"troll-folk\\") and tusser. Trolls may be described as small, human-like beings or as tall as men depending on the region of origin of the story.MacCulloch (1930:219‚Äî223, 224). In Norwegian tradition, similar tales may be told about the larger trolls and the Huldrefolk (\\"hidden-folk\\"), yet a distinction is made between the two. The use of the word trow in Orkney and Shetland, to mean beings which are very like the Huldrefolk in Norway, may suggest a common origin for the terms. The word troll may have been used by pagan Norse settlers in Orkney and Shetland as a collective term for supernatural beings who should be respected and avoided rather than worshipped. Troll could later have become specialized as a description of the larger, more menacing J√∂tunn-kind whereas Huldrefolk may have developed as the term for smaller trolls.Narv√°ez (1997:118). John Arnott MacCulloch posited a connection between the Old Norse v√¶ttir and trolls, suggesting that both concepts may derive from spirits of the dead.MacCulloch (1930:228 & 231). Troll, a Norwegian research station in Antarctica, is so named because of the rugged mountains which stand around that place like trolls. It includes a ground station which tracks satellites in polar orbit.

In some jurisdictions, such secrets are referred to as confidential information. Definition The precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction, as do the particular types of information that are subject to trade secret protection. Three factors are common to all such definitions: A trade secret is information that * is not generally known to the public; * confers economic benefit on its holder because the information is not publicly known; and * where the holder makes reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. In international law, these three factors define a trade secret under article 39 of the Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, commonly referred to as the TRIPS Agreement. Similarly, in the United States Economic Espionage Act of 1996, \\"A trade secret, as defined under (3)(A),(B) (1996), has three parts: (1) information; (2) reasonable measures taken to protect the information; and (3) which derives independent economic value from not being publicly known.\\" Value Trade secrets are an important, but invisible component of a company's intellectual property (IP). Their contribution to a company's value, measured as its market capitalization, can be major.Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, Mark A. Lemley (@006) Intellectual Property in the Technological Age, 3rd ed.; Aspen Being invisible, that contribution is hard to measure.Baruch Lev (2001): Intangibles, Management, Measurement and Reporting, with comments by conference participants; Brookings Institution Press, 2001. Patents are a visible contribution, but delayed, and unsuitable for internal innovations. Having an internal scoreboard provides insight into the cost of risks of employees leaving to serve or start competing ventures. Protection In contrast to registered intellectual property, trade secrets are, by definition, not disclosed to the world at large. Instead, owners of trade secrets seek to protect trade secret information from competitors by instituting special procedures for handling it, as well as technological and legal security measures. Legal protections include non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and work-for-hire and non-compete clauses. In other words, in exchange for an opportunity to be employed by the holder of secrets, an employee may sign agreements to not reveal their prospective employer's proprietary information, to surrender or assign to their employer ownership rights to intellectual work and work-products produced during the course (or as a condition) of employment, and to not work for a competitor for a given period of time (sometimes within a given geographic region). Violation of the agreement generally carries the possibility of heavy financial penalties which operate as a disincentive to reveal trade secrets. However, proving a breach of an NDA by a former stakeholder who is legally working for a competitor or prevailing in a lawsuit for breaching a non-compete clause can be very difficult. A holder of a trade secret may also require similar agreements from other parties he or she deals with, such as vendors, licensees, and board members. As a company can protect its confidential information through NDA, work-for-hire, and non-compete contracts with its stakeholders (within the constraints of employment law, including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic- and time-scope), these protective contractual measures effectively create a perpetual monopoly on secret information that does not expire as would a patent or copyright. The lack of formal protection associated with registered intellectual property rights, however, means that a third party not bound by a signed agreement is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered, such as through reverse engineering. Green Chartreuse liqueur protected by confidential information of the ingredients Therefore, trade secrets such as secret formulae are often protected by restricting the key information to a few trusted individuals. Famous examples of products protected by trade secrets are Chartreuse liqueur and Coca-Cola.Leon Stafford for The Atlanta Journal- Constitution December 8, 2011 Coke hides its secret formula in plain sight in World of Coca-Cola move Because protection of trade secrets can, in principle, extend indefinitely, it therefore may provide an advantage over patent protection and other registered intellectual property rights, which last only for a specific duration. The Coca-Cola company, for example, has no patent for the formula of Coca-Cola and has been effective in protecting it for many more years than the 20 years of protection that a patent would have provided. In fact, Coca-Cola refused to reveal its trade secret under at least two judges' orders.For God, Country & Coca-Cola, by Mark Pendergrast, 2nd Ed., Basic Books 2000, p. 456  Misappropriation Companies often try to discover one another's trade secrets through lawful methods of reverse engineering or employee poaching on one hand, and potentially unlawful methods including industrial espionage on the other. Acts of industrial espionage are generally illegal in their own right under the relevant governing laws, and penalties can be harsh.Ben Fox Rubin (2012): Former Dow Chemical Scientist Gets Five Year in Prison; Wall Street Journal, 13 January 2012 The importance of that illegality to trade secret law is: if a trade secret is acquired by improper means (a somewhat wider concept than \\"illegal means\\" but inclusive of such means), then the secret is generally deemed to have been misappropriated. Thus, if a trade secret has been acquired via industrial espionage, its acquirer will probably be subject to legal liability for having acquired it improperly‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî this notwithstanding, the holder of the trade secret is nevertheless obliged to protect against such espionage to some degree in order to safeguard the secret, as under most trade secret regimes, a trade secret is not deemed to exist unless its purported holder takes reasonable steps to maintain its secrecy. History =Roman law= Commentators starting with A. Arthur Schiller assert that trade secrets were protected under Roman law by a claim known as , interpreted as an \\"action for making a slave worse\\" (or an action for corrupting a servant). The Roman law is described as follows: > [T]he Roman owner of a mark or firm name was legally protected against > unfair usage by a competitor through the actio servi corrupti ... which the > Roman jurists used to grant commercial relief under the guise of private law > actions. \\"If, as the writer believes [writes Schiller], various private > cases of action were available in satisfying commercial needs, the state was > acting in exactly the same fashion as it does at the present day.\\"Alan > Watson, Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded, 11 Tul. Eur. & Civ. > L.F. 19, 19 (1996). The suggestion that trade secret law has its roots in Roman law was introduced in 1929 in a Columbia Law Review article called \\"Trade Secrets and the Roman Law: The Actio Servi Corrupti\\", which has been reproduced in Schiller's, An American Experience in Roman Law 1 (1971). See Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded, at 19. However, the University of Georgia Law School professor Alan Watson argued in Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded that the actio servi corrupti was not used to protect trade secrets p. 19\\\\. Rather, he explained: > Schiller is sadly mistaken as to what was going on. ... The actio servi > corrupti presumably or possibly could be used to protect trade secrets and > other similar commercial interests. That was not its purpose and was, at > most, an incidental spin-off. But there is not the slightest evidence that > the action was ever so used. In this regard the actio servi corrupti is not > unique. Exactly the same can be said of many private law actions including > those for theft, damage to property, deposit, and production of property. > All of these could, I suppose, be used to protect trade secrets, etc., but > there is no evidence they were. It is bizarre to see any degree the Roman > actio servi corrupti as the counterpart of modern law for the protection of > trade secrets and other such commercial interests. =19th century= Trade secret law as known today made its first appearance in England in 1817 in Newbery v. James,Newbery v. James, (1817) 2 Mer. 446, 35 Eng. Rep. 1011, 1013 (Ct. Ch. 1817) and in the United States in 1837 in Vickery v. Welch.Vickery v. Welch, 36 Mass. (19 Pick.) 523, 527 (1837)See The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights, 61 Stan. L. Rev. at 315 & n.6. While those cases involved the first known common law causes of action based on a modern concept of trade secret laws, neither involved injunctive relief; rather, they involved damages only. In England, the first case involving injunctive relief came in 1820 in Yovatt v Winyard,Yovatt v. Winyard, (1820) 37 Eng. Rep. 425, 426 (Ch.) while in the United States, it took until the 1866 case Taylor v. Blanchard.Taylor v. Blanchard, 95 Mass. (13 Allen) 370 (1866)See The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights, 61 Stan. L. Rev. at 315 & n.7; but see Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 493 n.23, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 1892 n.23, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974) (trade secret law imported into the United States from England in 1868 in Peabody v. Norfolk, 98 Mass. 452 (1868)) Trade secrets law continued to evolve throughout the United States as a hodgepodge of state laws. In 1939, the American Law Institute issued the Restatement of Torts, containing a summary of trade secret laws across states, which served as the primary resource until the latter part of the century. As of 2013, however, only four states‚ÄîMassachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Texas‚Äîstill rely on the Restatement as their primary source of guidance (other than their body of state case law). It has also been recently theorized that the doctrine of trade secrets should protect competitively valuable, personal information of company executives, in a concept known as \\"executive trade secrets\\". =Worldwide= Commonwealth nations In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right. =England and Wales= The Court of Appeal of England and Wales in the case of Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering LtdSaltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd, (1948) 65 P.R.C. 203 held that the action for breach of confidence is based on a principle of preserving \\"good faith\\". The test for a cause of action for breach of confidence in the common law world is set out in the case of Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd:Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd, (1969) R.P.C. 41 at 47 * The information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it; * That information must have been imparted in circumstances imparting an obligation of confidence; * There must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it. The \\"quality of confidence\\" highlights that trade secrets are a legal concept. With sufficient effort or through illegal acts (such as breaking and entering), competitors can usually obtain trade secrets. However, so long as the owner of the trade secret can prove that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the information confidential, the information remains a trade secret and generally remains legally protected. Conversely, trade secret owners who cannot evidence reasonable efforts at protecting confidential information risk losing the trade secret, even if the information is obtained by competitors illegally. It is for this reason that trade secret owners shred documents and do not simply recycle them. A successful plaintiff is entitled to various forms of judicial relief, including: * An injunction * An account of profits or an award of damages * A declaration =Hong Kong= Hong Kong does not follow the traditional commonwealth approach, instead recognizing trade secrets where a judgment of the High Court indicates that confidential information may be a property right. European Union The EU adopted a Directive on the Protection of Trade Secrets on 27 May 2016. The goal of the directive is to harmonize the definition of trade secrets in accordance with existing international standards, and the means of obtaining protection of trade secrets within the EU. United States Within the U.S., trade secrets generally encompass a company's proprietary information that is not generally known to its competitors, and which provides the company with a competitive advantage. Although trade secrets law evolved under state common law, prior to 1974, the question of whether patent law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered. In 1974, the United States Supreme Court issued the landmark decision, Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., which resolved the question in favor of allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws.Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974) =State law= In 1979 several U.S. states adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which was further amended in 1985, with approximately 47 states having adopted some variation of it as the basis for trade secret law. Another significant development is the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996 (), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. # , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. # , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses. The EEA was extended in 2016 to allow companies to file civil suits in federal court. =Federal law= On May 11, 2016, President Obama signed the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), 18 U.S.C.¬ß¬ß1839 et seq., which for the first time created a federal cause of action for misappropriating trade secrets. The DTSA provides for both a private right of action for damages and injunction and a civil action for injunction brought by the Attorney General. The statute followed state laws on liability in significant part, defining trade secrets in the same way as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as, However, the law contains several important differences from prior law. # Because it is a federal law, trade secret cases can be prosecuted in federal courts with concomitant procedural advantages. # It provides for the unusual remedy of preliminary seizure of \\"property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret,\\" 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1836 # It provides for remedies to include royalties in appropriate cases and exemplary damages up to two times the actual damages in cases of \\"willful and malicious\\" appropriation, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1836(b)(3). The DTSA also clarifies that a United States resident (including a company) can be liable for misappropriation that takes place outside the United States, and any person can be liable as long as an act in furtherance of the misappropriation takes place in the United States, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1837. The DTSA provides the courts with broad injunctive powers. 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1836(b)(3). The DTSA does not preempt or supplant state laws, but provides an additional cause of action. Because states vary significantly in their approach to the \\"inevitable disclosure\\" doctrine,The \\"inevitable disclosure\\" doctrine allows an employee's new employment to be enjoined if the court determines that the nature of his new duties will inevitably lead to a disclosure or improper use of trade secrets of the prior employer. It has been accepted in a number of states (see, e.g., PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond, 54 F.3d 1262 (7th Cir. 1995)(applying Illinois law), and flatly rejected in others (see, e.g., Schlage Lock Co. v. Whyte, 101 Cal. App. 4th 1443 (2002) (applying California law). its use has limited, if any, application under the DTSA, 18 U.S.C.¬ß1836(b)(3)(A).A Court may grant an injunction, provided the order does not \\"prevent a person from entering into an employment relationship, and that conditions placed on such employment shall be based on evidence of threatened misappropriation and not merely on the information that the person knows....\\" 18 U.S.C. ¬ß1836(b)(3)(A)(i)(I). Comparison to other types of intellectual property law In the United States, trade secrets are not protected by law in the same manner as patents or trademarks. Historically, trademarks and patents are protected under federal statutes, the Lanham Act and Patent Act, respectively, while trade secrets are usually protected under state laws, and most states have enacted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), except for Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina. However, since 2016 this situation changed with the enactment of the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), making trade secrets also protectable under a federal law. One of the differences between patents and trademarks, on the one hand, and trade secrets, on the other, is that a trade secret is protected only when the owner has taken reasonable measures to protect the information as a secret (see (3)(A)). =Comparison with trademarks= Nations have different trademark policies. Assuming the mark in question meets certain other standards of protectibility, trademarks are generally protected from infringement on the grounds that other uses might confuse consumers as to the origin or nature of the goods once the mark has been associated with a particular supplier. Similar considerations apply to service marks and trade dress. By definition, a trademark enjoys no protection (qua trademark) until and unless it is \\"disclosed\\" to consumers, for only then are consumers able to associate it with a supplier or source in the requisite manner. (That a company plans to use a certain trademark might itself be protectable as a trade secret, however, until the mark is actually made public.) To acquire a trademark rights under U.S. law, one must simply use the mark \\"in commerce\\".United States Patent and Trademark Office, General Questions It is possible to register a trademark in the United States, both at the federal and state levels. Registration of trademarks confers some advantages, including stronger protection in certain respects, but registration is not required in order to get protection. Registration may be required in order to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement. =Comparison with patents= To acquire a patent, full information about the method or product has to be supplied to the patent office and upon publication or issuance, will then be available to all. After expiration of the patent, competitors can copy the method or product legally. The temporary monopoly on the subject matter of the patent is regarded as a tradeoff for thus disclosing the information to the public. It may be possible to obtain patent protection for a trade secret. In order to obtain a patent, the inventor must disclose the invention, so that others will be able to both make and use the invention. To obtain a patent in the United States, any preference for the mode of practicing the invention must be disclosed. Often, an invention will be improved after filing of the patent application, and additional information will be learned. None of that additional information must be disclosed through the patent application process, and it may thus be kept as a trade secret.Considerations Relevant to Best Mode MPEP 2165.01 That nondisclosed information will often increase the commercial viability of the patent. Most patent licenses include clauses that require the inventor to disclose any trade secrets they have, and patent licensors must be careful to maintain their trade secrets while licensing a patent through such means as the use of a non-disclosure agreement. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time (it \\"continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public\\", whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs, has an immediate effect, does not require compliance with any formalities, and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public. The disadvantages of trade secrets include that \\"others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it\\", \\"others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets\\", and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent. Criticism Trade secret regulations that mask the composition of chemical agents in consumer products have been criticized for allowing the trade secret holders to hide the presence of potentially harmful and toxic substances.

It is widespread in the wild across much of Eurasia and North America, and is cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes. One subspecies, Artemisia dracunculus var. sativa, is cultivated for use of the leaves as an aromatic culinary herb. In some other subspecies, the characteristic aroma is largely absent. The species is polymorphic. Informal names for distinguishing the variations include \\"French tarragon\\" (best for culinary use), \\"Russian tarragon\\", and \\"wild tarragon\\" (covers various states). Tarragon grows to tall, with slender branches. The leaves are lanceolate, long and broad, glossy green, with an entire margin. The flowers are produced in small capitula diameter, each capitulum containing up to 40 yellow or greenish-yellow florets. French tarragon, however, seldom produces any flowers (or seeds). Some tarragon plants produce seeds that are generally sterile. Others produce viable seeds. Tarragon has rhizomatous roots that it uses to spread and readily reproduce.  Cultivation  Dried tarragon leaves French tarragon is the variety used for cooking in the kitchen and is not grown from seed, as the flowers are sterile; instead it is propagated by root division. Russian tarragon (A. dracunculoides L.) can be grown from seed but is much weaker in flavor when compared to the French variety. However, Russian tarragon is a far more hardy and vigorous plant, spreading at the roots and growing over a meter tall. This tarragon actually prefers poor soils and happily tolerates drought and neglect. It is not as strongly aromatic and flavorsome as its French cousin, but it produces many more leaves from early spring onwards that are mild and good in salads and cooked food. Russian tarragon loses what flavor it has as it ages and is widely considered useless as a culinary herb, though it is sometimes used in crafts. The young stems in early spring can be cooked as an asparagus substitute. Horticulturists recommend that Russian tarragon be grown indoors from seed and planted out in the summer. The spreading plants can be divided easily. A better substitute for French tarragon is Spanish tarragon (Tagetes lucida), also known as Mexican mint marigold, Mexican tarragon, Texas tarragon, or winter tarragon. It is much more reminiscent of French tarragon, with a hint of anise. Although not in the same genus as the other tarragons, Spanish tarragon has a stronger flavor than Russian tarragon that does not diminish significantly with age.  Health  Tarragon has an aromatic property reminiscent of anise, due to the presence of estragole, a known carcinogen and teratogen in mice. The European Union investigation revealed that the danger of estragole is minimal even at 100‚Äì1,000 times the typical consumption seen in humans. Estragole concentration in fresh tarragon leaves is about 2900 mg/kg.  Uses  = Culinary use = Tarragon is one of the four fines herbes of French cooking, and is particularly suitable for chicken, fish, and egg dishes. Tarragon is the main flavoring component of B√©arnaise sauce. Fresh, lightly bruised sprigs of tarragon are steeped in vinegar to produce tarragon vinegar. Tarragon is used to flavor a popular carbonated soft drink in the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia (where it originally comes from) and, by extension, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The drink, named Tarkhuna, is made out of sugary tarragon concentrate and colored bright green. Tarragon is one of the main ingredients in Chakapuli, Georgian national dish. In Iran, tarragon is used as a side dish in sabzi khordan (fresh herbs), or in stews and in Persian style pickles, particularly khiar shoor (pickled cucumbers). In Slovenia, tarragon is used in a variation of the traditional nut roll sweet cake, called potica. In Hungary a popular kind of chicken soup is flavored with tarragon. cis-Pellitorin, an isobutyramide eliciting a pungent taste, has been isolated from the tarragon plant.Gatfield, I. L.; Ley, J. P.; Foerstner, J.; Krammer, G.; Machinek, A. Production of cis-pellitorin and use as a flavouring.

The organic compound capillin was initially isolated from Artemisia capillaris in 1956. Quotes James Andrew Beard, American cookbook author, teacher, syndicated columnist and television personality, was quoted as saying, \\"I believe that if ever I had to practice cannibalism, I might manage if there were enough tarragon around.\\" Fernand Point, French chef and restaurateur, was quoted as saying \\"A Bearnaise sauce is simply an egg yolk, a shallot, a little tarragon vinegar, and butter, but it takes years of practice for the result to be perfect.\\" Name In Swedish and German the plant is commonly known as dragon. The species name, dracunculus, means \\"little dragon,\\" and the plant seems to be so named due to its coiled roots. See Artemisia for the genus name derivative.

Thymes are relatives of the oregano genus Origanum. They have culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses, and the species most commonly cultivated and used for culinary purposes is Thymus vulgaris.  History  Flowering thyme Ancient Egyptians used thyme for embalming. The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples, believing it was a source of courage. The spread of thyme throughout Europe was thought to be due to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms and to \\"give an aromatic flavour to cheese and liqueurs\\". In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed beneath pillows to aid sleep and ward off nightmares.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan. In this period, women also often gave knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves, as it was believed to bring courage to the bearer. Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals, as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life. The name of the genus of fish Thymallus, first given to the grayling (T. thymallus, described in the 1758 edition of Systema Naturae by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus), originates from the faint smell of thyme that emanates from the flesh.  Cultivation  Thyme is best cultivated in a hot, sunny location with well-drained soil. It is generally planted in the spring, and thereafter grows as a perennial. It can be propagated by seed, cuttings, or dividing rooted sections of the plant. It tolerates drought well. The plant can take deep freezes and is found growing wild on mountain highlands.  Culinary use  Ulleungdo thyme tea) In some Levantine countries, and Assyria, the condiment za'atar (Arabic for both thyme and marjoram) contains many of the essential oils found in thyme. It is a common component of the bouquet garni, and of herbes de Provence. Thyme is sold both fresh and dried. While summer-seasonal, fresh greenhouse thyme is often available year-round. The fresh form is more flavourful, but also less convenient; storage life is rarely more than a week. However, the fresh form can last many months if carefully frozen. Fresh thyme is commonly sold in bunches of sprigs. A sprig is a single stem snipped from the plant. It is composed of a woody stem with paired leaf or flower clusters (\\"leaves\\") spaced apart. A recipe may measure thyme by the bunch (or fraction thereof), or by the sprig, or by the tablespoon or teaspoon. Dried thyme is widely used in Armenia in tisanes (called urc). Depending on how it is used in a dish, the whole sprig may be used (e.g., in a bouquet garni), or the leaves removed and the stems discarded. Usually, when a recipe specifies \\"bunch\\" or \\"sprig\\", it means the whole form; when it specifies spoons, it means the leaves. It is perfectly acceptable to substitute dried for whole thyme. Leaves may be removed from stems either by scraping with the back of a knife, or by pulling through the fingers or tines of a fork. Thyme retains its flavour on drying better than many other herbs.  Antimicrobial properties  Thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil Oil of thyme, the essential oil of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris), contains 20‚Äì54% thymol.Thymus Vulgaris. PDR for Herbal Medicine. Montvale, NJ: Medical Economics Company. p. 1184. Thyme essential oil also contains a range of additional compounds, such as p-cymene, myrcene, borneol, and linalool. Thymol, an antiseptic, is an active ingredient in various commercially produced mouthwashes such as Listerine.Pierce, Andrea. 1999.

The term \\"herbal tea\\" is often used in contrast to true teas (e.g., black, green, white, yellow, oolong), which are prepared from the cured leaves of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis. Unlike coffee and true teas (which are also available decaffeinated), most tisanes do not contain caffeine naturally.  History  Camellia sinesis, the tea plant, has been grown for around 5000 years. The plant is a member of the family Theaceae, its origins dating back to China and Southeast Asia. According to ancient Chinese legend, the drink was made accidentally by King Shen Nong (around 2700 b.c.e). Despite the legend, it is documented that the Chinese have been using herbal tea as a medicine dating back to around 2000 years ago. The habitual consumption of tea grew in Asia and eventually European explorers brought it home to Europe in the 17th century. Herbal tea then became a staple in British and Irish culture during that time. Tea is widely consumed all over the world today.\\"Tea.\\" Plant Sciences, edited by Richard Robinson, Macmillan Reference USA, 2001.

Etymology  Herbal tea in a glass teapot and cup Some feel that the term tisane is more correct than herbal tea or that the latter is even misleading, but most dictionaries record that the word tea is also used to refer to other plants beside the tea plant and to beverages made from these other plants. In any case, the term herbal tea is very well established and much more common than tisane. The word tisane was rare in its modern sense before the 20th century, when it was borrowed in the modern sense from French. (This is why some people feel it should be pronounced as in French, but the original English pronunciation continues to be more common in US English and especially in UK English). The word had already existed in late Middle English in the sense of \\"medicinal drink\\" and had already been borrowed from French (Old French). The Old French word came from the Latin word ptisana, which came from the Ancient Greek word œÄœÑŒπœÉŒ¨ŒΩŒ∑ (ptis√°nƒì), which meant \\"peeled\\" barley, in other words pearl barley, and a drink made from this that is similar to modern barley water.Oxford Living Dictionaries  Health risks  While most herbal teas are safe for regular consumption, some herbs have toxic or allergenic effects. Among the greatest causes of concern are: * Comfrey, which contains alkaloids which may be harmful to the liver from chronic use, and particularly is not recommended during pregnancy or when prescription drugs are used; comfrey is not recommended for oral use. * Lobelia, which contains alkaloids and has traditional medicine uses for smoking cessation, may cause nausea, vomiting, or dizziness at high doses. Herbal teas can also have different effects from person to person, and this is further compounded by the problem of potential misidentification. The deadly foxglove, for example, can be mistaken for the much more benign (but still relatively toxic to the liver) comfrey. The US does not require herbal teas to have any evidence concerning their efficacy, but does treat them technically as food products and require that they be safe for consumption. Fruit or fruit-flavored tea is usually acidic and thus may contribute to erosion of tooth enamel. = Contamination = Depending on the source of the herbal ingredients, herbal teas, like any crop, may be contaminated with pesticides or heavy metals. According to Naithani & Kakkar (2004), \\"all herbal preparations should be checked for toxic chemical residues to allay consumer fears of exposure to known neuro-toxicant pesticides and to aid in promoting global acceptance of these products\\". = During pregnancy = In addition to the issues mentioned above which are toxic to all people, several medicinal herbs are considered abortifacients, and if consumed by a pregnant woman could cause miscarriage. These include common ingredients like nutmeg, mace, papaya, bitter melon, verbena, saffron, slippery elm, and possibly pomegranate. It also includes more obscure herbs, like mugwort, rue, pennyroyal, wild carrot, blue cohosh, tansy, and savin.  Composition  Herbal teas can be made with fresh or dried flowers, fruit, leaves, seeds or roots. They are made by pouring boiling water over the plant parts and letting them steep for a few minutes. The herbal tea is then strained, sweetened if desired, and served. Many companies produce herbal tea bags for such infusions.

The plant is a perennial, rhizomatous, herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, that requires temperatures between and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered each year for their rhizomes, some for propagation in the following season and some for consumption. The rhizomes are used fresh or boiled in water and dried, after which they are ground into a deep orange-yellow powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines, especially for curries, as well as for dyeing. Turmeric powder has a warm, bitter, black pepper‚Äìlike flavor and earthy, mustard-like aroma. Although long used in Ayurvedic medicine, where it is also known as haridra, there is no high-quality clinical evidence for using turmeric or its constituent, curcumin, to treat any disease, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. Botanical view of Curcuma longa  Origin and distribution  The greatest diversity of Curcuma species by number alone is in India, at around 40 to 45 species. Thailand has a comparable 30 to 40 species. Other countries in tropical Asia also have numerous wild species of Curcuma. Recent studies have also shown that the taxonomy of Curcuma longa is problematic, with only the specimens from South India being identifiable as C. longa. The phylogeny, relationships, intraspecific and interspecific variation, and even identity of other species and cultivars in other parts of the world still need to be established and validated. Various species currently utilized and sold as \\"turmeric\\" in other parts of Asia have been shown to belong to several physically similar taxa, with overlapping local names.  History  Turmeric has been used in Asia for thousands of years and is a major part of Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Unani, and the animistic rituals of Austronesian peoples. It was first used as a dye, and then later for its supposed properties in folk medicine. From India, it spread to Southeast Asia along with Hinduism and Buddhism, as the yellow dye is used to color the robes of monks and priests. Turmeric has also been found in Tahiti, Hawaii and Easter Island before European contact. There is linguistic and circumstantial evidence of the spread and use of turmeric by the Austronesian peoples into Oceania and Madagascar. The populations in Polynesia and Micronesia, in particular, never came into contact with India, but use turmeric widely for both food and dye. Thus independent domestication events are also likely. Turmeric also spread westwards, where it was noted as a dye plant by the Assyrians in the 6th century BC. In Medieval Europe, turmeric was called \\"Indian saffron. Etymology The name possibly derives from Middle English or Early Modern English as ' or '. It may be of Latin origin, ' (\\"meritorious earth\\"). The name of the genus, curcuma, is derived from the Sanskrit ', referring to turmeric, used in India since ancient times. Botanical description =Appearance= Turmeric farm on Deccan Plateau Turmeric is a perennial herbaceous plant that reaches up to tall. Highly branched, yellow to orange, cylindrical, aromatic rhizomes are found. The leaves are alternate and arranged in two rows. They are divided into leaf sheath, petiole, and leaf blade. From the leaf sheaths, a false stem is formed. The petiole is long. The simple leaf blades are usually long and rarely up to . They have a width of and are oblong to elliptical, narrowing at the tip. =Inflorescence, flower, and fruit= Turmeric flower Wild turmeric, Australia At the top of the inflorescence, stem bracts are present on which no flowers occur; these are white to green and sometimes tinged reddish-purple, and the upper ends are tapered. The hermaphrodite flowers are zygomorphic and threefold. The three sepals are long, fused, and white, and have fluffy hairs; the three calyx teeth are unequal. The three bright-yellow petals are fused into a corolla tube up to long. The three corolla lobes have a length of and are triangular with soft-spiny upper ends. While the average corolla lobe is larger than the two lateral, only the median stamen of the inner circle is fertile. The dust bag is spurred at its base. All other stamens are converted to staminodes. The outer staminodes are shorter than the labellum. The labellum is yellowish, with a yellow ribbon in its center and it is obovate, with a length from . Three carpels are under a constant, trilobed ovary adherent, which is sparsely hairy. The fruit capsule opens with three compartments. In East Asia, the flowering time is usually in August. Terminally on the false stem is an inflorescence stem, long, containing many flowers. The bracts are light green and ovate to oblong with a blunt upper end with a length of . Phytochemistry keto form Curcumin enol form Turmeric powder is about 60-70% carbohydrates, 6-13% water, 6-8% protein, 5-10% fat, 3-7% dietary minerals, 3-7% essential oils, 2-7% dietary fiber, and 1-6% curcuminoids. Phytochemical components of turmeric include diarylheptanoids, a class including numerous curcuminoids, such as curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Curcumin constitutes up to 3.14% of assayed commercial samples of turmeric powder (the average was 1.51%); curry powder contains much less (an average of 0.29%). Some 34 essential oils are present in turmeric, among which turmerone, germacrone, atlantone, and zingiberene are major constituents.

Turmeric powder Curry using turmeric, referred to as haldi ki Sabzi, a dish from India bap (turmeric rice) Patoleo ‚Äì sweet rice cakes steamed in turmeric leaves consisting of a filling of coconut and coconut palm sugar prepared in Goan Catholic style Turmeric is one of the key ingredients in many Asian dishes, imparting a mustard-like, earthy aroma and pungent, slightly bitter flavor to foods. It is used mostly in savory dishes, but also is used in some sweet dishes, such as the cake sfouf. In India, turmeric leaf is used to prepare special sweet dishes, patoleo, by layering rice flour and coconut-jaggery mixture on the leaf, then closing and steaming it in a special utensil (chondr√µ). Most turmeric is used in the form of rhizome powder to impart a golden yellow color. It is used in many products such as canned beverages, baked products, dairy products, ice cream, yogurt, yellow cakes, orange juice, biscuits, popcorn color, cereals, sauces, and gelatin. It is a principal ingredient in curry powders. Although typically used in its dried, powdered form, turmeric also is used fresh, like ginger. It has numerous uses in East Asian recipes, such as a pickle that contains large chunks of fresh soft turmeric. Turmeric is used widely as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking. Various Iranian khoresh recipes begin with onions caramelized in oil and turmeric. The Moroccan spice mix ras el hanout typically includes turmeric. In South Africa, turmeric is used to give boiled white rice a golden color, known as geelrys (yellow rice) traditionally served with bobotie. In Vietnamese cuisine, turmeric powder is used to color and enhance the flavors of certain dishes, such as b√°nh x√®o, b√°nh kh·ªçt, and mi quang. The staple Cambodian curry paste, kroeung, used in many dishes including amok, typically contains fresh turmeric. In Indonesia, turmeric leaves are used for Minang or Padang curry base of Sumatra, such as rendang, sate padang, and many other varieties. In the Philippines, turmeric is used in the preparation and cooking of Kuning and Satay. In Thailand, fresh turmeric rhizomes are used widely in many dishes, in particular in the southern Thai cuisine, such as yellow curry and turmeric soup. Turmeric is used in a hot drink called \\"turmeric latte\\" or \\"golden milk\\" that is made with milk, frequently coconut milk. The turmeric milk drink known as haldi doodh (haldi means turmeric in Hindi) is a South Asian recipe. Sold in the US and UK, the drink known as \\"golden mylk\\" uses nondairy milk and sweetener, and sometimes black pepper after the traditional recipe (which may also use ghee). =Dye= The golden yellow color of turmeric is due to curcumin. It also contains an orange-colored volatile oil. Turmeric makes a poor fabric dye, as it is not very light fast, but is commonly used in Indian clothing, such as saris and Buddhist monks's robes. It is used to protect food products from sunlight, coded as E100 when used as a food additive. The oleoresin is used for oil-containing products. A curcumin and polysorbate solution or curcumin powder dissolved in alcohol is used for water-containing products. Overcoloring, such as in pickles, relishes, and mustard, is sometimes used to compensate for fading. In combination with annatto (E160b), turmeric has been used to color cheeses, yogurt, dry mixes, salad dressings, winter butter, and margarine. Turmeric is used to give a yellow color to some prepared mustards, canned chicken broths, and other foodsoften as a much cheaper replacement for saffron. =Indicator= Turmeric dispersed in water is yellow under acid and brown under alkaline conditions Turmeric paper, also called curcuma paper or in German literature, Curcumapapier, is paper steeped in a tincture of turmeric and allowed to dry. It is used in chemical analysis as an indicator for acidity and alkalinity. The paper is yellow in acidic and neutral solutions and turns brown to reddish-brown in alkaline solutions, with transition between pH of 7.4 and 9.2. =Traditional uses= Curcuma domestica Valeton, a drawing by A. Bernecker around 1860 Khandoba's newer temple in Jejuri, where devotees shower turmeric powder (bhandara) on each other Turmeric grows wild in the forests of South and Southeast Asia, where it is collected for use in classical Indian medicine (Siddha or Ayurveda). In Eastern India, the plant is used as one of the nine components of navapatrika along with young plantain or banana plant, taro leaves, barley (jayanti), wood apple (bilva), pomegranate (darimba), Saraca indica, manaka (Arum), or manakochu, and rice paddy. The Haldi ceremony called gaye holud in Bengal (literally \\"yellow on the body\\") is a ceremony observed during wedding celebrations of people of Indian culture all throughout the Indian subcontinent. In Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, as a part of the Tamil‚ÄìTelugu marriage ritual, dried turmeric tuber tied with string is used to create a Thali necklace. In western and coastal India, during weddings of the Marathi and Konkani people, Kannada Brahmins, turmeric tubers are tied with strings by the couple to their wrists during a ceremony, Kankanabandhana. Friedrich Ratzel reported in The History of Mankind during 1896, that in Micronesia, turmeric powder was applied for embellishment of body, clothing, utensils, and ceremonial uses. Adulteration As turmeric and other spices are commonly sold by weight, the potential exists for powders of toxic, cheaper agents with a similar color to be added, such as lead(II,IV) oxide (\\"red lead\\"). These additives give turmeric an orange-red color instead of its native gold-yellow, and such conditions led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue import alerts from 2013 to 2019 on turmeric originating in India and Bangladesh. Imported into the United States in 2014 were approximately of turmeric, some of which was used for food coloring, traditional medicine, or dietary supplement. Lead detection in turmeric products led to recalls across the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom through 2016. Lead chromate, a bright yellow chemical compound, was found as an adulterant of turmeric in Bangladesh, where turmeric is used commonly in foods and the contamination levels were up to 500 times higher than the national limit. Researchers identified a chain of sources adulterating the turmeric with lead chromate: from farmers to merchants selling low-grade turmeric roots to \\"polishers\\" who added lead chromate for yellow color enhancement, to wholesalers for market distribution, all unaware of the potential consequences of lead toxicity. Another common adulterant in turmeric, metanil yellow (also known as acid yellow 36), is considered by the British Food Standards Agency as an illegal dye for use in foods. Medical research Turmeric and curcumin (one of its constituents) have been studied in numerous clinical trials for various human diseases and conditions; profoundly lacking in scale or flawed, none have produced any high-quality evidence. There is no high-quality evidence from clinical trials on humans that curcumin reduces inflammation .

The term can be defined as \\"A war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803105038425 \\"Total war\\" In the mid-19th century, scholars identified total war as a separate class of warfare. In a total war, the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants diminishes due to the capacity of opposing sides to consider nearly every human, including non-combatants, as resources that are used in the war effort.Edward Gunn. \\"The Moral Dilemma of Atomic Warfare\\", Aegis: The Otterbein College Humanities Journal, Spring 2006, p. 67. NB Gunn cites this Wikipedia article as it was on , but on only for the text of the song \\"The Thing-Ummy Bob\\". Background The phrase \\"total war\\" can be traced back to the 1935 publication of German general Erich Ludendorff's World War I memoir, Der totale Krieg (\\"The total war\\"). Some authors extend the concept back as far as classic work of Carl von Clausewitz, On War, as \\"absoluter Krieg\\" (absolute war), even-though he did not use the term; others interpret Clausewitz differently. Total war also describes the French \\"guerre √† outrance\\" during the Franco-Prussian War. In his December 24, 1864 letter to his Chief of Staff during the American Civil War, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman wrote the Union was \\"not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies,\\" defending Sherman's March to the Sea, the operation that inflicted widespread destruction of infrastructure in Georgia. United States Air Force General Curtis LeMay updated the concept for the nuclear age. In 1949, he first proposed that a total war in the nuclear age would consist of delivering the entire nuclear arsenal in a single overwhelming blow, going as far as \\"killing a nation\\". Examples =Middle Ages= Written by academics at Eastern Michigan University, the Cengage Advantage Books: World History textbook claims that while total war \\"is traditionally associated with the two global wars of the twentieth century... it would seem that instances of total war predate the twentieth century.\\" They write: =18th and 19th centuries= North America The Sullivan Expedition of 1779 is considered one of the first modern examples of total warfare. As Indians and Tory forces killed livestock and burned buildings in remote areas (where the devastation was keenly felt) George Washington advised Sullivan to seek \\"the total destruction and devastation of their settlements and the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible\\". The expedition devastated \\"14 towns and most flourishing crops of corn\\" in New York but, despite the large scale destruction, failed to drive the Indians off the land.Fischer, Joseph R. (1997) A Well-Executed Failure: The Sullivan Campaign against the Iroquois, July‚ÄìSeptember 1779 Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press Europe In his book, The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know it, David A Bell, a French History professor at Princeton University argues that the French Revolutionary Wars introduced to mainland Europe some of the first concepts of total war, such as mass conscription. He claims that the new republic found itself threatened by a powerful coalition of European nations and used the entire nation's resources in an unprecedented war effort that included lev√©e en masse (mass conscription). By August 23, 1793, the French front line forces grew to some 800,000 with a total of 1.5 million in all services‚Äîthe first time an army in excess of a million had been mobilized in Western history: Savenay during the War in the Vend√©e, 1793 Napoleon's retreat from Russia in 1812. Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e had lost about half a million men. During the Russian campaign of 1812 the Russians retreated while destroying infrastructure and agriculture in order to effectively hamper the French and strip them of adequate supplies. In the campaign of 1813, Allied forces in the German theater alone amounted to nearly one million whilst two years later in the Hundred Days a French decree called for the total mobilization of some 2.5 million men (though at most a fifth of this was managed by the time of the French defeat at Waterloo). During the prolonged Peninsular War from 1808‚Äì1814 some 300,000 French troops were kept permanently occupied by, in addition to several hundred thousand Spanish, Portuguese and British regulars, an enormous and sustained guerrilla insurgency‚Äîultimately French deaths would amount to 300,000 in the Peninsular War alone.Broers, Michael (2008) \\"The Concept of 'Total War' in the Revolutionary‚ÄîNapoleonic Period\\" War in History v.15 n.3 pp. 247‚Äì268 =20th century= World War I Damage and destruction of civilian buildings in Belgium, 1914 =Propaganda= One of the features of total war in Britain was the use of government propaganda posters to divert all attention to the war on the home front. Posters were used to influence public opinion about what to eat and what occupations to take, and to change the attitude of support towards the war effort. Even the Music Hall was used as propaganda, with propaganda songs aimed at recruitment. After the failure of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the large British offensive in March 1915, the British Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal John French blamed the lack of progress on insufficient and poor-quality artillery shells. This led to the Shell Crisis of 1915 which brought down both the Liberal government and Premiership of H. H. Asquith. He formed a new coalition government dominated by Liberals and appointed David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions. It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front. Carl Schmitt, a supporter of Nazi Germany, wrote that total war meant \\"total politics\\"‚Äîauthoritarian domestic policies that imposed direct control of the press and economy. In Schmitt's view the total state, which directs fully the mobilization of all social and economic resources to war, is antecedent to total war. Scholars consider that the seeds of this total state concept already existed in the German state of World War I, which exercised full control of the press and other aspects economic and social life as espoused in the statement of state ideology known as the \\"Ideas of 1914\\". =Rationing= As young men left the farms for the front, domestic food production in Britain and Germany fell. In Britain, the response was to import more food, which was done despite the German introduction of unrestricted submarine warfare, and to introduce rationing. The Royal Navy's blockade of German ports prevented Germany from importing food and hastened German capitulation by creating a food crisis in Germany. Almost the whole of Europe and the European colonial empires mobilized to wage World War I. Rationing occurred on the home fronts. Bulgaria went so far as to mobilize a quarter of its population, or 800,000 people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war. Founding ceremony of the Hakk≈ç ichiu Monument, promoting the unification of \\"the 8 corners of the world under one roof\\" World War II The Second World War was the quintessential total war of modernity. The level of national mobilization of resources on all sides of the conflict, the battlespace being contested, the scale of the armies, navies, and air forces raised through conscription, the active targeting of non- combatants (and non-combatant property), the general disregard for collateral damage, and the unrestricted aims of the belligerents marked total war on an unprecedented and unsurpassed, multicontinental scale. =Sh≈çwa Japan= During the first part of the Sh≈çwa era, the government of Imperial Japan launched a string of policies to promote a total war effort against China and occidental powers and increase industrial production. Among these were the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. The National Mobilization Law had fifty clauses, which provided for government controls over civilian organizations (including labor unions), nationalization of strategic industries, price controls and rationing, and nationalized the news media.Pauer, Japan's War Economy, 1999 pp. 13 The laws gave the government the authority to use unlimited budgets to subsidize war production and to compensate manufacturers for losses caused by war-time mobilization. Eighteen of the fifty articles outlined penalties for violators. To improve its production, Sh≈çwa Japan used millions of slave laborersUnidas, Naciones. World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration, p. 23 and pressed more than 18 million people in East Asia into forced labor.Zhifen Ju, \\"Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war\\", 2002, Library of Congress, 1992, \\"Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942‚Äì50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942‚Äì45\\" Access date: February 9, 2007. =United Kingdom= Before the onset of the Second World War, the United Kingdom drew on its First World War experience to prepare legislation that would allow immediate mobilization of the economy for war, should future hostilities break out. Rationing of most goods and services was introduced, not only for consumers but also for manufacturers. This meant that factories manufacturing products that were irrelevant to the war effort had more appropriate tasks imposed. All artificial light was subject to legal blackouts. Not only were men conscripted into the armed forces from the beginning of the war (something which had not happened until the middle of World War I), but women were also conscripted as Land Girls to aid farmers and the Bevin Boys were conscripted to work down the coal mines. Enormous casualties were expected in bombing raids, so children were evacuated from London and other cities en masse to the countryside for compulsory billeting in households. In the long term this was one of the most profound and longer-lasting social consequences of the whole war for Britain. This is because it mixed up children with adults of other classes. Not only did the middle and upper classes become familiar with the urban squalor suffered by working class children from the slums, but the children got a chance to see animals and the countryside, often for the first time, and experience rural life. The use of statistical analysis, by a branch of science which has become known as Operational Research to influence military tactics, was a departure from anything previously attempted. It was a very powerful tool but it further dehumanised war particularly when it suggested strategies that were counter-intuitive. Examples, where statistical analysis directly influenced tactics include the work done by Patrick Blackett's team on the optimum size and speed of convoys and the introduction of bomber streams, by the Royal Air Force to counter the night fighter defences of the Kammhuber Line. =Germany= In contrast, Germany started the war under the concept of Blitzkrieg. Officially, it did not accept that it was in a total war until Joseph Goebbels' Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943 - in which the crowd was told \\"Totaler Krieg ‚Äì K√ºrzester Krieg\\" (\\"Total War ‚Äì Shortest War\\".) Nazi rally on 18 February 1943 at the Berlin Sportpalast; the sign says \\"\\" (\\"Total War ‚Äì Shortest War\\"). Goebbels and Hitler had spoken in March 1942 about Goebbels' idea to put the entire home front on a war footing. Hitler appeared to accept the concept, but took no action. Goebbels had the support of minister of armaments Albert Speer, economics minister Walther Funk and Robert Ley, head of the German Labour Front, and they pressed Hitler in October 1942 to take action, but Hitler, while outwardly agreeing, continued to dither. Finally, after the holidays in 1942, Hitler sent his powerful personal secretary, Martin Bormann, to discuss the question with Goebbels and Hans Lammers, the head of the Reich Chancellery. As a result, Bormann told Goebbels to go ahead and draw up a draft of the necessary decree, to be signed in January 1943. Hitler signed the decree on 13 January, almost a year after Goebbels first discussed the concept with him. The decree set up a steering committee consisting of Bormann, Lammers, and General Wilheml Keitel to oversee the effort, with Goebbels and Speer as advisors; Goebbels had expected to be one of the triumvirate. Hitler remained aloof from the project, and it was Goebbels and Hermann G√∂ring who gave the \\"total war\\" radio address from the Sportspalast the next month, on the 10th anniversary of the Nazi's \\"seizure of power\\".Reuth, Ralph Georg (1993) Goebbels Translated by Krishna Winston. New York: Harcourt Brace. pp/304, 309-313. The commitment to the doctrine of the short war was a continuing handicap for the Germans; neither plans nor state of mind were adjusted to the idea of a long war until the failure of the Operation Barbarossa. A major strategic defeat in the Battle of Moscow forced Speer as armaments minister to nationalize German war production and eliminate the worst inefficiencies.A. S. Milward (1964)The End of the Blitzkrieg. The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 499‚Äì518. Under Speer's direction a threefold increase in armament production occurred and did not reach its peak until late 1944. To do this during the damage caused by the growing strategic Allied bomber offensive, is an indication of the degree of industrial under-mobilization in the earlier years. It was because the German economy through most of the war was substantially under-mobilized that it was resilient under air attack. Civilian consumption was high during the early years of the war and inventories both in industry and in consumers' possession were high. These helped cushion the economy from the effects of bombing. Plant and machinery were plentiful and incompletely used, thus it was comparatively easy to substitute unused or partly used machinery for that which was destroyed. Foreign labour, both slave labour and labour from neighbouring countries who joined the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, was used to augment German industrial labour which was under pressure by conscription into the Wehrmacht (Armed Forces). =Soviet Union= Leningrad's siege, in which about 1 million civilians died The Soviet Union (USSR) was a command economy which already had an economic and legal system allowing the economy and society to be redirected into fighting a total war. The transportation of factories and whole labour forces east of the Urals as the Germans advanced across the USSR in 1941 was an impressive feat of planning. Only those factories which were useful for war production were moved because of the total war commitment of the Soviet government. The Eastern Front of the European Theatre of World War II encompassed the conflict in central and eastern Europe from June 22, 1941 to May 9, 1945. It was the largest theatre of war in history in terms of numbers of soldiers, equipment and casualties and was notorious for its unprecedented ferocity, destruction, and immense loss of life (see World War II casualties). The fighting involved millions of German, Hungarian, Romanian and Soviet troops along a broad front hundreds of kilometres long. It was by far the deadliest single theatre of World War II. Scholars now believe that at most 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, including at least 8.7 million soldiers who fell in battle against Hitler's armies or died in POW camps. Millions of civilians died from starvation, exposure, atrocities, and massacres. The Axis lost over 5 million soldiers in the east as well as many thousands of civilians.German losses according to: R√ºdiger Overmans, Deutsche milit√§rische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Oldenbourg 2000. , p. 265, 272 During the Battle of Stalingrad, newly built T-34 tanks were driven‚Äîunpainted because of a paint shortage‚Äîfrom the factory floor straight to the front. This came to symbolise the USSR's commitment to the World War II and demonstrated the government's total war policy. =United States= The United States underwent an unprecedented mobilization of national resources for the Second World War. Conditions in the United States were not as strained as they were in the United Kingdom or as desperate as they were in the Soviet Union, but the United States greatly curtailed nearly all non-essential activities in its prosecution of the Second World War and redirected nearly all available national resources to the conflict, including reaching the point of diminishing returns by late 1944, where the U.S. military was unable to find any more males of the correct military age to draft into service. The strategists of the U.S. military looked abroad at the storms brewing on the horizon in Europe and Asia, and began quietly making contingency plans as early as the mid-1930s; new weapons and weapons platforms were designed, and made ready. Following the outbreak of war in Europe and the ongoing aggression in Asia, efforts were stepped up significantly. The collapse of France and the airborne aggression directed at Great Britain unsettled the Americans, who had close relations with both nations, and a peacetime draft was instituted, along with Lend-Lease programs to aid the British, and covert aid was passed to the Chinese as well. American public opinion was still opposed to involvement in the problems of Europe and Asia, however. In 1941, the Soviet Union became the latest nation to be invaded, and the U.S. gave her aid as well. American ships began defending aid convoys to the Allied nations against submarine attacks, and a total trade embargo against the Empire of Japan was instituted to deny its military the raw materials its factories and military forces required to continue its offensive actions in China. In late 1941, Japan's Army-dominated government decided to seize by military force the strategic resources of South-East Asia and Indonesia since the Western powers would not give Japan these goods by trade. Planning for this action included surprise attacks on American and British forces in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, and the U.S. naval base and warships at Pearl Harbor. In response to these attacks, the U.K. and U.S. declared war on the Empire of Japan the next day. Nazi Germany declared war on the U.S. a few days later, along with Fascist Italy; the U.S. found itself fully involved in a second world war. As the United States began to gear up for a major war, information and propaganda efforts were set in motion. Civilians (including children) were encouraged to take part in fat, grease, and scrap metal collection drives. Many factories making non-essential goods retooled for war production. Levels of industrial productivity previously unheard of were attained during the war; multi-thousand-ton convoy ships were routinely built in a month-and-a-half, and tanks poured out of the former automobile factories. Within a few years of the U.S. entry into the Second World War, nearly every man fit for service, between 18 and 30, had been conscripted into the military \\"for the duration\\" of the conflict, and unprecedented numbers of women took up jobs previously held by them. Strict systems of rationing of consumer staples were introduced to redirect productive capacity to war needs. Previously untouched sections of the nation mobilized for the war effort. Academics became technocrats; home-makers became bomb-makers (massive numbers of women worked in heavy industry during the war); union leaders and businessmen became commanders in the massive armies of production. The great scientific communities of the United States were mobilized as never before, and mathematicians, doctors, engineers, and chemists turned their minds to the problems ahead of them. By the war's end a multitude of advances had been made in medicine, physics, engineering, and the other sciences. Even the theoretical physicists, whose theories were not believed to have military applications (at the time), were sent far into the Western deserts to work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory on the Manhattan Project that culminated in the Trinity nuclear test and changed the course of history. In the war, the United States lost 407,316 military personnel, but had managed to avoid the extensive level of damage to civilian and industrial infrastructure that other participants suffered. The U.S. emerged as one of the two superpowers after the war. =Unconditional surrender= After the United States entered World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared at Casablanca conference to the other Allies and the press that unconditional surrender was the objective of the war against the Axis Powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Prior to this declaration, the individual regimes of the Axis Powers could have negotiated an armistice similar to that at the end of World War I and then a conditional surrender when they perceived that the war was lost. The unconditional surrender of the major Axis powers caused a legal problem at the post-war Nuremberg Trials, because the trials appeared to be in conflict with Articles 63 and 64 of the Geneva Convention of 1929. Usually if such trials are held, they would be held under the auspices of the defeated power's own legal system as happened with some of the minor Axis powers, for example in the post World War II Romanian People's Tribunals. To circumvent this, the Allies argued that the major war criminals were captured after the end of the war, so they were not prisoners of war and the Geneva Conventions did not cover them. Further, the collapse of the Axis regimes created a legal condition of total defeat (debellatio) so the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention over military occupation were not applicable.Ruth Wedgwood Wall Street Journal November 16, 2004 Present day Since the end of World War II, no industrial nation has fought such a large, decisive war. This is likely due to the availability of nuclear weapons, whose destructive power and quick deployment render a full mobilization of a country's resources such as in World War II logistically impractical and strategically irrelevant. Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peacetime defense budgets. By the end of the 1950s, the ideological stand-off of the Cold War between the Western World and the Soviet Union had resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed by each side at the other. Strategically, the equal balance of destructive power possessed by each side situation came to be known as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), considering that a nuclear attack by one superpower would result in nuclear counter-strike by the other. This would result in hundreds of millions of deaths in a world where, in words widely attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, \\"The living will envy the dead\\". During the Cold War, the two superpowers sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons. Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in proxy wars, military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs. In the case of proxy wars, each superpower supported its respective allies in conflicts with forces aligned with the other superpower, such as in the Vietnam War and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. During the Yugoslav Wars, NATO conducted strikes against the electrical grid in enemy territory using graphite bombs. Some observers considered this to be an act of total war, owing to the fact that powerplants supported by the electrical grid were essential to water purification and thus the strike represented a direct attack on civilian resources. NATO claimed that the objective of their strikes was to disrupt military infrastructure and communications. Characteristics Actions that may characterize the post-19th century concept of total war include: * Strategic bombing, as during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War (Operations Rolling Thunder and Linebacker II) * Blockade and sieging of population centers, as with the Allied blockade of Germany and the Siege of Leningrad during the First and Second World Wars * Scorched earth policy, as with the March to the Sea during the American Civil War and the Japanese \\"Three Alls Policy\\" during the Second Sino-Japanese War * Commerce raiding, tonnage war, and unrestricted submarine warfare, as with privateering, the German U-Boat campaigns of the First and Second World Wars, and the United States submarine campaign against Japan during World War II * Collective punishment, pacification operations, and reprisals against populations deemed hostile, as with the execution and deportation of suspected Communards following the fall of the 1871 Paris Commune or the German reprisal policy targeting resistance movements, insurgents, and Untermenschen such as in France (e.g. Maill√© massacre) and Poland during World War II * The use of civilians and prisoners of war as forced labor for military operations, as with Japan and Germany's massive use of forced laborers of other nations during World War II (see Slavery in Japan and Forced labor under German rule during World War II) * Giving no quarter (i.e. take no prisoners), as with Hitler's Commando Order during World War II.

The penalty for violating a legislative or court-imposed time constraint may be anything from a small fine to judicial determination of an entire case against one's interests. For example, if a complaining party files an action and then fails to cause the papers pertaining thereto to be served on the opposing party within the time established by local rules, and is unable to convince the court that there was good and sufficient reason for the delay, he risks having his action dismissed with prejudice. If the opposing party is served with the papers and Anil fails to respond within the time limit provided for his answer, he risks having the case decided against him by default. If one is aggrieved by the judicial outcome of an action and wishes to appeal, he may be forever barred from doing so if he fails to meet the deadline by which his appeal may be filed. By court order, or by local rule, there may be other time constraints. One may be required to answer interrogatories or a request to produce or other discovery pleadings within a given time. He may be required to give a certain number of days' advance notice before he intends to depose a party or witness.

The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese, allowing great versatility and variety. They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles. Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have spread around the world. Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as burritos, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded, taquitos which are rolled and fried, or chalupas/tostadas, in which the tortilla is fried before filling. Etymology Various taco ingredients The origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical. According to the Real Academia Espa√±ola, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua Espa√±ola, the word taco describes a typical Mexican dish of a maize tortilla folded around food. This meaning of the Spanish word \\"taco\\" is a Mexican innovation, but in other dialects \\"taco\\" is used to mean \\"wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick piece of wood.\\" In this non-culinary usage, the word \\"taco\\" has cognates in other European languages, including the French word \\"tache\\" and the English word \\"tack (nail).\\" According to one etymological theory, the culinary meaning of \\"taco\\" derives from its \\"plug\\" meaning as employed among Mexican silver miners, who used explosive charges in plug form consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling. Indigenous origins for the culinary word \\"taco\\" are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word \\"tlahco\\", meaning \\"half\\" or \\"in the middle,\\" in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.Florilegio Verbal N√°huatl, Nexos, Mar. 12, 2016 Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society‚Äîfor example, the Nahuatl word \\"tlaxcalli\\" (a type of corn tortilla). History The taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. There is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal D√≠az del Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which Hern√°n Cort√©s arranged for his captains in Coyoac√°n. Traditional variations There are many traditional varieties of tacos: Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat. * Tacos al pastor (\\"shepherd style\\") or tacos de adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins. * Tacos de asador (\\"spit\\" or \\"grill\\" tacos) may be composed of any of the following: carne asada tacos; tacos de tripita (\\"tripe tacos\\"), grilled until crisp; and, chorizo asado (traditional Spanish-style sausage). Each type is served on two overlapped small tortillas and sometimes garnished with guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro (coriander leaf). Also, prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called mulita (\\"little mule\\") made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with Oaxaca style cheese. \\"Mulita\\" is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas. Tacos may also be served with salsa. * Tacos de cabeza (\\"head tacos\\"), in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow. These include: Cabeza, a serving of the muscles of the head; Sesos (\\"brains\\"); Lengua (\\"tongue\\"); Cachete (\\"cheeks\\"); Trompa (\\"lips\\"); and, Ojo (\\"eye\\"). Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency. These tacos are typically served in pairs, and also include salsa, onion, and cilantro (coriander leaf) with occasional use of guacamole. * Tacos de camarones (\\"shrimp tacos\\") also originated in Baja California in Mexico. Grilled or fried shrimp are used, usually with the same accompaniments as fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. * Tacos de cazo (literally \\"bucket tacos\\") for which a metal bowl filled with lard is typically used as a deep-fryer. Meats for these types of tacos typically include Tripa (\\"tripe\\", usually from a pig instead of a cow, and can also refer to the intestines); Suadero (tender beef cuts), Carnitas and Buche (Literally, \\"crop\\", as in bird's crop; or the esophagus of any animal.) * Tacos de lengua (beef tongue tacos), which are cooked in water with onions, garlic, and bay leaves for several hours until tender and soft, then sliced and saut√©ed in a small amount of oil. \\"It is said that unless a taqueria offers tacos de lengua, it is not a real taqueria.\\" Two fish tacos in Bonita, California * Tacos de pescado (\\"fish tacos\\") originated in Baja California in Mexico, where they consist of grilled or fried fish, lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. In the United States, they were first popularized by the Rubio's fast-food chain, and remain most popular in California, Colorado, and Washington. In California, they are often found at street vendors, and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top. * Tacos dorados (fried tacos; literally, \\"golden tacos\\") called flautas (\\"flute\\", because of the shape), or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. They are sometimes cooked in a microwave oven or broiled. * Tacos sudados (\\"sweaty tacos\\") are made by filling soft tortillas with a spicy meat mixture, then placing them in a basket covered with cloth. The covering keeps the tacos warm and traps steam (\\"sweat\\") which softens them. As an accompaniment to tacos, many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes, lime slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally cucumber slices, or grilled cambray onions.

The most common type of taco in the US is the hard-shell, U-shaped version, first described in a cookbook in 1949. This type of taco is typically served as a crisp-fried corn tortilla filled with seasoned ground beef, cheese, lettuce, and sometimes tomato, onion, salsa, sour cream, and avocado or guacamole. Such tacos are sold by restaurants and by fast food chains, while kits are readily available in most supermarkets. Hard shell tacos are sometimes known as tacos dorados (\\"golden tacos\\") in Spanish, a name that they share with taquitos. Various sources credit different individuals with the invention of the hard- shell taco, but some form of the dish likely predates all of them. Beginning from the early part of the twentieth century, various types of tacos became popular in the country, especially in Texas and California but also elsewhere. By the late 1930s, companies like Ashley Mexican Food and Absolute Mexican Foods were selling appliances and ingredients for cooking hard shell tacos, and the first patents for hard-shell taco cooking appliances were filed in the 1940s. In the mid-1950s, Glen Bell opened Taco Tia, and began selling a simplified version of the tacos being sold by Mexican restaurants in San Bernardino, particularly the tacos dorados being sold at the Mitla Cafe, owned by Lucia and Salvador Rodriguez across the street from another of Bell's restaurants. Over the next few years, Bell owned and operated a number of restaurants in southern California including four called El Taco. At this time, Los Angeles was racially-segregated, and the tacos sold at Bell's restaurants were many white Americans' first introduction to Mexican food. Bell sold the El Tacos to his partner and built the first Taco Bell in Downey in 1962. Kermit Becky, a former Los Angeles police officer, bought the first Taco Bell franchise from Glen Bell in 1964, and located it in Torrance. The company grew rapidly, and by 1967, the 100th restaurant opened at 400 South Brookhurst in Anaheim. In 1968, its first franchise location east of the Mississippi River opened in Springfield, Ohio. File:NCI Visuals Food Taco.jpgA hard-shell taco, made with a prefabricated shell File:Picture of crispy taco from taqueria in sacramento, ca.jpgA crispy taco from a Sacramento, California taqueria =Soft-shell tacos= Traditionally, soft- shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco - usually by grilling or steaming. More recently, the term has come to include flour tortilla based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains. In this context, soft tacos are tacos made with wheat flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco. =Breakfast taco= Breakfast tacos The breakfast taco, found in Tex-Mex cuisine, is a soft corn or flour tortilla filled with meat, eggs, or cheese, and can also contain other ingredients. Some have claimed that Austin, Texas is the home of the breakfast taco.How Austin Became the Home of the Crucial Breakfast Taco, Eater Austin, Feb. 19, 2016, However, food writer and OC Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano responded that such a statement reflects a common trend of \\"whitewashed\\" foodways reporting, noting that predominantly Hispanic San Antonio, Texas \\"never had to brag about its breakfast taco love‚Äîfolks there just call it 'breakfast'. =Indian taco= Indian tacos, or Navajo tacos, are made using frybread instead of tortillas. They are commonly eaten at pow-wows, festivals, and other gatherings by and for indigenous people in the United States and Canada. This kind of taco is not known to have been present before the arrival of Europeans in what is now the Southwestern United States. Navajo tradition indicates that frybread came into use in the 1860s when the government forced the tribe to relocate from their homeland in Arizona in a journey known as the Long Walk of the Navajo. It was made from ingredients given to them by the government to supplement their diet since the region couldn‚Äôt support growing the agricultural commodities that had been previously used. File:Puffy taco.jpgA puffy taco File:Frybread taco.jpgA frybread taco File:Huna Fish Taco.jpgA fish taco on frybread =Puffy tacos, taco kits, and tacodillas= Since at least 1978, a variation called the \\"puffy taco\\" has been popular. Henry's Puffy Tacos, opened by Henry Lopez in San Antonio, Texas, claims to have invented the variation, in which uncooked corn tortillas (flattened balls of masa dough) are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become \\"puffy\\". Fillings are similar to hard-shell versions. Restaurants offering this style of taco have since appeared in other Texas cities, as well as in California, where Henry's brother, Arturo Lopez, opened Arturo's Puffy Taco in Whittier, not long after Henry's opened. Henry's continues to thrive, managed by the family's second generation. Kits are available at grocery and convenience stores and usually consist of taco shells (corn tortillas already fried in a U-shape), seasoning mix and taco sauce. Commercial vendors for the home market also market soft taco kits with tortillas instead of taco shells. The tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas, thus resembling a quesadilla. In popular culture In the United States, National Taco Day is celebrated annually on October 4.

The song peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, but had a three-week run at #1 on the R&B; chart, later used in the Back to the Future movies. The group's tenor was Cleveland Duncan. Early career The original members of The Penguins were Cleveland Duncan (July 23, 1935 ‚Äì November 7, 2012), Curtis Williams (December 11, 1934 ‚Äì August 10, 1979), Dexter Tisby (March 10, 1935 \\\\- May 2019) and Bruce Tate (January 27, 1937 ‚Äì June 20, 1973). Duncan and Williams were former classmates at Fremont High School in Los Angeles, California, and Williams had become a member of The Hollywood Flames. In late 1953, they decided to form a new vocal group, and added Tisby and Tate. Their midtempo performance style was a cross between rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Williams brought with him a song, \\"Earth Angel\\", on which he had worked with Gaynel Hodge, another member of the Hollywood Flames. The Penguins were one of a number of doo-wop groups of the period named after birds (such as The Orioles, The Flamingos, and The Crows). One of the members smoked Kool cigarettes, which, at the time, had \\"Willie the Penguin\\" as its cartoon advertising character. They considered themselves \\"cool\\", and accordingly decided to call themselves \\"The Penguins\\". Dootone Records released The Penguins' single \\"Hey Senorita\\" in late 1954 as the intended A-side, but a radio DJ flipped the record over to the B-side: \\"Earth Angel\\" worked its way up to #1 on the Billboard R&B; chart (the only Penguins song to chart that high), and held that place for three weeks early in 1955. By 1966 the disc had sold four million copies. The Penguins followed up this hit with a Christmas release \\"A Christmas prayer\\" with \\"Jingle jangle.\\"The Mercury Labels: The 1945-1956 era Michel Ruppli, Ed Novitsky - 1993 - Page 538 \\"THE PENGUINS: Cleveland Duncan , Dexter Tisby(tenor vo)Bruce Tate (baritone vo)Curtis Wil 1 iams (bass vo) with ts,p & rhythm.

Also featured Big Jay McNeely, Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra, The Medallions and James Moody and his Orchestra.‚Äú11th Cavalcade of Jazz ‚Äì Wrigley Field July 24‚Äù Article Los Angeles Sentinel June 30, 1955. Duncan sang lead on \\"Earth Angel\\". He reprised his performance a decade later on Frank Zappa's \\"Memories of El Monte\\", an elegiac 1963 song in which he suddenly breaks into \\"Earth Angel\\" as one of the various songs remembered. El Monte, a city near Los Angeles, had spawned such popular performers as Tony Allan, Marvin & Johnny, The Shields, as well as the Penguins. Those groups were also emulated as part of Zappa's tribute to early days of rock and roll. In a common practice of the time, radio stations frequently featured segregated playlists. Thus, \\"Earth Angel\\" was simultaneously recorded by the white group, The Crew-Cuts in 1955. The Crew- Cuts cover peaked at #3 on the Hot 100 chart, five spots higher than the Penguins version. The single's success contributed to the Crew-Cuts' own successful career of recording crossover-friendly covers of R&B; hits. The songwriting genesis for \\"Earth Angel\\" was a matter of some dispute, eventually ending up in a split credit between Penguins baritone Curtis Williams, Gaynel Hodge, and Jesse Belvin. The song had evolved through several Los Angeles area groups, and was based on the \\"Blue Moon\\" chord changes that were so popular with many doo-wop groups. The song was influenced by Jesse and Marvin's #2 R&B; hit \\"Dream Girl\\", which contained many of the same vocal inflections used to great effect in \\"Earth Angel\\". The \\"Will you be mine?\\" hook in \\"Earth Angel\\", which was also the song's subtitle, was borrowed from the #9 R&B; hit of the same name by The Swallows. The Hollywood Flames had also recorded \\"I Know\\" in 1953, a song which has been called a chord-for-chord blueprint for \\"Earth Angel\\", and which featured the same Curtis Williams piano intro that Williams himself reused on the Penguins hit. The coda of \\"Earth Angel\\", with the repeatedly harmonized word \\"You-oo... you-oo... you-oo... you-oo\\", had previously been heard in the Dominoes' #5 R&B; cover of \\"These Foolish Things Remind Me Of You\\". After \\"Earth Angel\\" Coming off the success of \\"Earth Angel\\", the Penguins approached Buck Ram to manage them. Ram's primary interest was in managing The Platters, who at that point had no hit singles, but were a profitable touring group. With the Penguins in hand, Ram was able to swing a 2-for-1 deal with Mercury Records, in which the company agreed to take on the Platters as a condition for getting the Penguins (the group that Mercury really wanted). The Platters became the label's more successful act, the Penguins never scoring another hit single. In 1955, Bruce Tate left the group. He was replaced by Randy Jones (who would later sing with the Cadets). During the summer of 1956, Jones and Tisby were briefly out of the group, and were replaced by Ray Brewster and Teddy Harper, respectively. Jones and Tisby returned shortly afterwards. Curtis Williams left in December 1957, with Harper rejoining as his permanent replacement. The Penguins never had another national hit, but their 1957 cover of \\"Pledge of Love\\" reached #15 on the R&B; chart. Later years The group broke up in 1962. Cleveland Duncan continued recording as \\"The Penguins\\", with new member Walter Saulsberry and a backing group, the Viceroys. Later, the group was Duncan, Saulsberry, Vesta and Evelyn King, and Vera Walker. (Duncan and the King sisters had recorded a record as \\"Cleve Duncan and the Radiants\\" in 1959.) By the late 1960s, the group was being billed as the \\"Fabulous Penguins\\", and featured Duncan, Walker, and new member Rudy Wilson. By the 1970s, the members were Duncan, the returning Walter Saulsberry, and new member Glenn Madison, formerly of the Delcos (Indiana). This was the current line up of the group until 2012. The group performed on the PBS television special, Doo Wop 50. Duncan, Madison, and Saulsberry also performed with Randy Jones as guest, in 2001. It was planned for Jones to appear with the Penguins the following year but he suffered a stroke while rehearsing with the group and died shortly thereafter. Jones also performed with the reunited Jacks/Cadets in the 1990s. Duncan died on November 7, 2012, in Los Angeles at the age of 77. The group is mentioned in the Paul Simon song \\"Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War\\". Award The Penguins were inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.

The exact date of the founding of the city is unclear. The date 13 March 1325 was chosen in 1925 to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the city.Castillo Ledon, Luis (1925). La Fundacion de la Ciudad de M√©xico 1325-1925 Editorial CVLTURA p 5, 55, 56 The city was built on an island in what was then Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico. The city was the capital of the expanding Aztec Empire in the 15th century until it was captured by the Spanish in 1521. At its peak, it was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas. It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Today, the ruins of Tenochtitlan are in the historic center of the Mexican capital. The World Heritage Site of Xochimilco contains what remains of the geography (water, boats, floating gardens) of the Mexica capital. Tenochtitlan was one of two Mexica ƒÅltƒìpetl (city-states or polities) on the island, the other being Tlatelolco.  Etymology  Traditionally, the name Tenochtitlan was thought to come from Nahuatl (\\"rock\\") and (\\"prickly pear\\") and is often thought to mean, \\"Among the prickly pears [growing among] rocks\\". However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as \\"the Bancroft dialogues\\" suggest the second vowel was short, so that the true etymology remains uncertain.Frances Karttunen (1983) An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl p.225, Texas linguistic series, University of Texas, Austin ; Geography The western side of the shallow Lake Texcoco. is the southern part of the main island (under the red line). The northern part is . covered an estimated , situated on the western side of the shallow Lake Texcoco. At the time of Spanish conquests, Mexico City comprised both and . The city extended from north to south, from the north border of to the swamps, which by that time were gradually disappearing to the west; the city ended more or less at the present location of . The city was connected to the mainland by bridges and causeways leading to the north, south, and west. The causeways were interrupted by bridges that allowed canoes and other water traffic to pass freely. The bridges could be pulled away, if necessary, to defend the city. The city was interlaced with a series of canals, so that all sections of the city could be visited either on foot or via canoe. Lake Texcoco was the largest of five interconnected lakes. Since it formed in an endorheic basin, Lake was brackish. During the reign of Moctezuma I, the \\"levee of \\" was constructed, reputedly designed by . Estimated to be in length, the levee was completed circa 1453. The levee kept fresh spring-fed water in the waters around Tenochtitlan and kept the brackish waters beyond the dike, to the east. Two double aqueducts, each more than long and made of terracotta,Cort√©s, H. provided the city with fresh water from the springs at . This was intended mainly for cleaning and washing. For drinking, water from mountain springs was preferred. Most of the population liked to bathe twice a day; was said to take four baths a day. According to the context of Aztec culture in literature, the soap that they most likely used was the root of a plant called (Saponaria americana), and to clean their clothes they used the root of (Agave americana). Also, the upper classes and pregnant women washed themselves in a , similar to a sauna bath, which is still used in the south of Mexico. This was also popular in other Mesoamerican cultures. City plans The city was divided into four zones, or camps; each camp was divided into 20 districts (calpullis, Nahuatl calp≈çlli); and each calpulli, or 'big house', was crossed by streets or tlaxilcalli. There were three main streets that crossed the city, each leading to one of the three causeways to the mainland of Tepeyac, Iztapalapa, and Tlacopan.Coe, M. 2008, p. 193. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo reported that they were wide enough for ten horses. Surrounding the raised causeways were artificial floating gardens with canal waterways and gardens of plants, shrubs, and trees.Walker, C. 1980, p. 162. The calpullis were divided by channels used for transportation, with wood bridges that were removed at night. The earliest European images of the city were woodcuts published in Augsburg around 1522. =Marketplaces= The Tlatelolco Marketplace as depicted at The Field Museum, Chicago Each calpulli (from Classical Nahuatl calp≈çlli, Nahuatl pronunciation: [ka…¨ÀàpoÀêlÀêi], meaning \\"large house\\") had its own tiyanquiztli (marketplace), but there was also a main marketplace in Tlatelolco ‚Äì Tenochtitlan's sister city. Cort√©s estimated it was twice the size of the city of Salamanca with about 60,000 people trading daily. Bernardino de Sahag√∫n provides a more conservative population estimate of 20,000 on ordinary days and 40,000 on feast days. There were also specialized markets in the other central Mexican cities. =Public buildings= A picture of Tenochtitlan and a model of the Templo Mayor at the National Museum of Anthropology of Mexico City In the center of the city were the public buildings, temples, and palaces. Inside a walled square, 500 meters to a side, was the ceremonial center. There were about 45 public buildings, including: the Templo Mayor, which was dedicated to the Aztec patron deity Huitzilopochtli and the Rain God Tlaloc; the temple of Quetzalcoatl; the tlachtli (ball game court) with the tzompantli or rack of skulls; the Sun Temple, which was dedicated to Tonatiuh; the Eagle's House, which was associated with warriors and the ancient power of rulers; the platforms for the gladiatorial sacrifice; and some minor temples.Coe, M. 2008, p. 193 Outside was the palace of Moctezuma with 100 rooms, each with its own bath, for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people. Also located nearby was the cuicalli, or house of the songs, and the calmecac.Cort√©s, H. 1520, p. 87. The city had great symmetry. All constructions had to be approved by the calmimilocatl, a functionary in charge of the city planning. =Palaces of Moctezuma II= The palace of Moctezuma II also had two houses or zoos, one for birds of prey and another for other birds, reptiles, and mammals. About 300 people were dedicated to the care of the animals. There was also a botanical garden and an aquarium. The aquarium had ten ponds of salt water and ten ponds of fresh water, containing various fish and aquatic birds. Places like this also existed in Texcoco, Chapultepec, Huaxtepec (now called Oaxtepec), and Texcotzingo.Cort√©s, H. 1520, p. 89. Social classes National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. Reconstruction of an Aztec market in Tenochtitlan. Tenochtitlan can be considered the most complex society in Mesoamerica in regard to social stratification. The complex system involved many social classes. The macehualtin were commoners who lived outside the island city of Tenochtitlan. The pipiltin were noblemen who were relatives of leaders and former leaders, and lived in the confines of the island. Cuauhipiltin, or eagle nobles, were commoners who impressed the nobles with their martial prowess, and were treated as nobles. Teteuctin were the highest class, rulers of various parts of the empire, including the king. Tlacohtin were individuals who chose indentured servitude to pay back a debt. Finally, the pochteca were merchants who traveled all of Mesoamerica trading. The membership of this class was based on heredity. Pochteca could become very rich because they did not pay taxes, but they had to sponsor the ritual feast of Xocotl Huetzi from the wealth that they obtained from their trade expeditions. Status was displayed by location and type of house where a person lived. Ordinary people lived in houses made of reeds plastered with mud and roofed with thatch. People who were better off had houses of adobe brick with flat roofs. The wealthy had houses of stone masonry with flat roofs. They most likely made up the house complexes that were arranged around the inner court. The higher officials in Tenochtitlan lived in the great palace complexes that made up the city. Adding even more complexity to Aztec social stratification was the calpolli. Calpolli, meaning ‚Äòbig house‚Äô is a group of families related by either kinship or proximity. These groups consist of both elite members of Aztec society and commoners. Elites provided commoners with arable land and nonagricultural occupations, and commoners performed services for chiefs and gave tribute.Coe, M. 2008, pp. 194‚Äì196. History A Mexico City statue commemorating the foundation of Tenochtitlan Tenochtitlan was the capital of the Mexican civilization of the Mexica people, founded in 1325. The state religion of the Mexica civilization awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy: the wandering tribes would find the destined site for a great city whose location would be signaled by an eagle with a snake in its beak perched atop a cactus (Opuntia). The Mexica saw this vision on what was then a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco, a vision that is now immortalized in Mexico's coat of arms and on the Mexican flag. Not deterred by the unfavourable terrain, they set about building their city, using the chinampa system (misnamed as \\"floating gardens\\") for agriculture and to dry and expand the island. A thriving culture developed, and the Mexica civilization came to dominate other tribes around Mexico. The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica. Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and perhaps even the Inca Empire.Blainey, G. A Very Short History of the World, 2007 After a flood of Lake Texcoco, the city was rebuilt under the rule of Ahuitzotl in a style that made it one of the grandest ever in Mesoamerica. Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s arrived in Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519. Although there are not precise numbers, the city's population has been estimated at between 200,000‚Äì400,000 inhabitants, placing Tenochtitlan among the largest cities in the world at that time. Compared to the cities of Europe, only Paris, Venice and Constantinople might have rivaled it. It was five times the size of the London of Henry VIII. In a letter to the Spanish king, Cort√©s wrote that Tenochtitlan was as large as Seville or C√≥rdoba. Cortes' men were in awe at the sight of the splendid city and many wondered if they were dreaming. Although some popular sources put the number as high as 350,000,Stannard, D. (1992) the most common estimates of the population are of over 200,000 people. One of the few comprehensive academic surveys of Mesoamerican city and town sizes arrived at a population of 212,500 living on ,Smith (2005), p. 411 It is also said that at one time, Moctezuma had rule over an empire of almost five million people in central and southern Mexico because he had extended his rule to surrounding territories to gain tribute and prisoners to sacrifice to the gods. =Invasion era= The Conquest of Tenochtitlan When Cort√©s and his men invaded Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma II chose to welcome Cort√©s as an ambassador rather than risk a war which might quickly be joined by aggrieved indigenous people. As Cort√©s approached Tenochtitlan, the Tenochcah celebrated Toxcatl. At this event the most prominent warriors of altepetl would dance in front of a huge statue of Huitzilopochtli. The Spanish leader, Pedro de Alvarado, who was left in charge, worried that the natives planned a surprise attack. He captured three natives and tortured them until they said that this was indeed true. During the festival, the Spaniards came heavily armed and closed off every exit from the courtyard so that no one would escape. This happened during their last days in Tenochtitlan.Townsend, Camilla. 2006. 102‚Äì103. Nobles lined each side of the city's main causeway, which extended about a league. Walking down the center came Moctezuma II, with two lords at his side, one his brother, the ruler of Iztapalapa. Cort√©s dismounted and was greeted by the ruler and his lords, but forbidden to touch him. Cort√©s gave him a necklace of crystals, placing it over his neck.Cort√©s, H. 1520, p. 69. Mexica pyramid of Ehecatl in the Metro Pino Su√°rez station, Mexico City Subway. They were then brought to a large house that would serve as their home for their stay in the city. Once they were settled, Moctezuma himself sat down and spoke with Cort√©s. The great ruler declared that anything that they needed would be theirs to have.Cort√©s, H. 1520, p. 71. He was thrilled to have visitors of such stature. Although the Spaniards were seeking gold, Moctezuma expressed that he had very little of the sort, but all of it was to be given to Cort√©s if he desired it.Cort√©s, H. 1520, p. 70. Since arriving in Tenochtitlan, Cort√©s faced early trouble. Leaving a post in Vera Cruz, the officer left in charge received a letter from Qualpopoca, the leader of Nueva Almer√≠a, asking to become a vassal of the Spaniards. He requested that officials be sent to him so that he could confirm his submission. To reach the province, the officers would have to travel through hostile land. The officer in charge of Vera Cruz decided to send four officers to meet with Qualpopoca.Cort√©s, H. 1520, p. 72. When they arrived, they were captured and two were killed, the other two escaping through the woods. Upon their return to Vera Cruz, the officer in charge was infuriated, and led troops to storm Almer√≠a. Here they learned that Moctezuma was supposedly the one who ordered the officers executed.Cort√©s, Hernan. 1520, p. 73. Back in Tenochtitlan, Cort√©s detained Moctezuma and questioned him.Cort√©s, H. 1520, p. 77. Though no serious conclusions were reached, this started the relationship between Moctezuma and the Spaniards on a bad note.Stannard, D. 1992, 214. Cort√©s subsequently besieged Tenochtitlan for over 90 days, causing a famine; directed the systematic destruction and leveling of the city;\\"The Colonial Spanish-American City: Urban Life in the Age of Atlantic Capitalism\\", Jay Kinsbruner, University of Texas Press, 2005, p. 20, and began its rebuilding, despite opposition, with a central area designated for Spanish use (the traza). The outer Indian section, now dubbed San Juan Tenochtitlan, continued to be governed by the previous indigenous elite and was divided into the same subdivisions as before.Stannard, D. 1992, 109. While the people of Tenochtitlan were celebrating the over 60 Spaniards who were captured, sacrificed while living, and then eaten by the locals. The skins, feet, and hands of captured Spaniards were sent around the country as a warning to other tribes. The people of Tenochtitlan were exposed to diseases. Symptoms were often delayed for up to ten days, when the infection would spread throughout the body, causing sores, pain, and high fever. People were weak to the point that they could not move, nor obtain food and water. Burial of the dead become difficult to impossible, due to the pervasiveness of the people's illness. The people of Tenochtitlan began to starve and weaken. The death toll rose steadily over the course of the next 60 days.Townsend, Camilla. 2006, 109‚Äì110. =Colonial era= Districts of Tenochtitlan overlaid on a map of modern streets of Mexico City, with the shown in gray Cort√©s founded the Spanish capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. Despite the extensive damage to the built environment, the site retained symbolic power and legitimacy as the capital of the Aztec empire, which Cort√©s sought to appropriate. For a time this , the highest rank in the Spanish hierarchy of settlement designation, was called Mexico‚ÄìTenochtitlan. Charles Gibson devotes the final chapter of his classic work, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule, to what he called \\"The City,\\"Charles Gibson, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule.

The Spaniards established a or town council, which had jurisdiction over the Spanish residents. The Spanish established a Europeans-only zone in the center of the city, an area of 13 blocks in each direction of the central plaza, which was the . Although many native residents died during the siege of Tenochtitlan, the indigenous still had a strong presence in the city, and were settled in two main areas of the island, designated San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco, each with a municipal council that functioned the entire colonial period. San Juan Tenochtitlan was a Spanish administrative creation, which amalgamated four indigenous sections, with each losing territory to the Spanish . The Spanish laid out the streets of the in a checker board pattern, with straight streets and plazas at intervals, whereas the indigenous portions of the city were irregular in layout and built of modest materials. In the colonial period both San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco retained jurisdiction over settlements on the mainland that they could draw on for labor and tribute demanded by the Spanish, but increasingly those subordinate settlements () were able to gain their autonomy with their own rulers and separate relationship with the Spanish rulers.Gibson, Aztecs Under Spanish Rule, pp. 368‚Äì377. Concern about the health of the indigenous population in early post- conquest Mexico‚ÄìTenochtitlan led to the founding of a royal hospital for indigenous residents. There are a number of colonial-era pictorial manuscripts dealing with Tenochtitlan‚ÄìTlatelolco, which shed light on litigation between Spaniards and indigenous over property.Glass, John B. in collaboration with Donald Robertson. \\"A Census of Native Middle American Pictorial Manuscripts\\". article 23, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources Part 3; Handbook of Middle American Indians.

Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1995. =Ruins= The city was the place of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. Templo Mayor of Mexico-Tenochtitlan ruins. The ruins of the Templo Mayor Fundaci√≥n de M√©xico (The foundation of Mexico) ‚Äì Tenochtitl√°n by Roberto Cueva del R√≠o Tenochtitlan's main temple complex, the Templo Mayor, was dismantled and the central district of the Spanish colonial city was constructed on top of it. The great temple was destroyed by the Spanish during the construction of a cathedral. The location of the Templo Mayor was rediscovered in the early 20th century, but major excavations did not take place until 1978‚Äì1982, after utility workers came across a massive stone disc depicting the nude dismembered body of the moon goddess Coyolxauhqui. The disc is in diameter, and is held at the Templo Mayor Museum. The ruins, constructed over seven periods, were built on top of each other. The resulting weight of the structures caused them to sink into the sediment of Lake Texcoco; the ruins now rest at an angle instead of horizontally. Mexico City's Z√≥calo, the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, is located at the site of Tenochtitlan's original central plaza and market, and many of the original calzadas still correspond to modern city streets. The Aztec calendar stone was located in the ruins. This stone is in diameter and weighs over . It was once located half-way up the great pyramid. This sculpture was carved around 1470 under the rule of King Axayacatl, the predecessor of Tizoc, and is said to tell the history of the Mexicas and to prophesy the future.Walker, p. 162‚Äì167 In August 1987, archaeologists discovered a mix of 1,789 human bones below street level in Mexico City. The burial dates back to the 1480s, ie before Cortez, and lies at the foot of the main temple in the sacred ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital. The bones are from children, teenagers and adults. A complete skeleton of a young woman was also found at the site.

Thompson traveled the country wagering at cards, dice games, golf, shooting, billiards, horseshoes and proposition bets of his own devising. As an ambidextrous golfer, card player, marksman and pool shark, his skills and reputation were compared to \\"Merlin himself\\". Writer Damon Runyon allegedly based the character Sky Masterson, the gambler-hero of \\"The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown\\" (on which the musical Guys and Dolls is based), on Thompson. In 1928, Thompson was involved in a high-stakes poker game that led to the shooting death of New York City crime boss Arnold Rothstein, then called the \\"crime of the century\\".Golf Digest, May 1996 The following year he testified in the trial of George McManus, who was charged with Rothstein's murder, but later acquitted. Early life Thomas was born in Monett, Missouri, but was, in fact, raised mainly on a farm in the Ozark Mountains, a few miles from Rogers, Arkansas, 50 miles south even further than that. His mother remarried following desertion by Thomas' father, who was himself a gambler. Thomas began conducting his nomadic, lucrative career of hustling in the rural south-central United States about 1908, leaving home at age 16 with less than a dollar in his pocket. Unable to read or write effectively, he had attended school only sporadically, and felt unwelcome in the home of his stepfather. Thomas spent most of his youth developing skills he would use later, such as shooting and understanding odds at card games through marathon dealing of hands. Military service Thomas was drafted in early 1918, several months after the United States entered World War I. Following basic training, where he excelled, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant. Thomas remained stateside, trained younger draftees, and did not see overseas service or combat before the war ended in November 1918, when he was discharged. Thomas also taught gambling skills to many of his trainees, and then proceeded to win substantial money from them. He ended the war with more than $50,000 in cash, and used much of this money to buy his mother a house in Monett, Missouri, his birthplace. Gambling style and favorite bets Later, when Thompson had honed his skills, he became a \\"road gambler\\", a traveling hustler who became an underground legend by winning at all manner of propositions, many of them tricky if not outright fraudulent. Among his favorites were: betting he could throw a walnut over a building (he had weighted the hollowed shell with lead beforehand), throwing a large room key into its lock, and moving a road mileage sign before betting that the listed distance to the town was in error. Thompson once bet that he could drive a golf ball 500 yards, using a hickory-shafted club, at a time when an expert player's drive was just over 200 yards. He won by waiting until winter and driving the ball onto a frozen lake, where it bounced past the required distance on the ice. Thompson's partners in \\"the hustling game\\" included pool player Minnesota Fats, who considered Titanic a genius, \\"the greatest action man of all time\\". Thompson's one weakness, as he admitted, was betting on horse racing, where he lost millions of dollars during his life in failed bets. Expert golfer Blessed with extraordinary eyesight and hand- eye coordination, he was a skilled athlete, crack shot and self-taught golfer good enough to turn professional. Raised in a poor environment far from exclusive golf courses, Thomas did not take up golf seriously until he was in his early thirties, but improved very quickly during an extended stint in San Francisco, where he took lessons from club professionals and honed his skills. From then on he played several times per week for the next 20 years. In an era when the top pro golfers would be fortunate to make $30,000 a year, Thomas (who, after a misprint in a New York newspaper, let people think his name was Thompson) could make that much in a week hustling rich country club players. Asked whether he would ever turn professional, he replied, \\"I could not afford the cut in pay\\". Hall of Fame golfer Ben Hogan, who traveled with him in the early 1930s for money games, later called Titanic the best shotmaker he ever saw. \\"He can play right- or left-handed, you can't beat him\\", said Hogan. One hustle of his was to beat a golfer playing right-handed, and then offer double or nothing to play the course again left-handed as an apparent concession. One thing his opponent usually did not know was that Thomas was naturally left- handed. Thomas' genius was in figuring out the odds on almost any proposition and heavily betting that way. He also had to perform under pressure, and most often did. As he aged, Thompson liked to pick promising young players as his golf partners. Several of these who went on to later PGA Tour stardom included young and unknown Ben Hogan, Ky Laffoon, Herman Keiser and Lee Elder. Other well-known golfers who left behind first-hand documented accounts of their dealings and matches with Thompson included Harvey Penick, Paul Runyan, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead, all of whom were inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. Marriages and family Married five times, Thompson fathered three children, all boys, with three different wives. He was also romantically linked with many women. Among his alleged trysts were actresses Myrna Loy and Jean Harlow. He typically married a young woman, lived with her for a few months, then returned to his road hustling, while leaving comfortable housing and financial support for his newly divorced wife. Killings Thompson killed five men. The first was in 1910, in rural Arkansas, when a man named Jim Johnson accused him of cheating at dice and threw him off the boat on which they were traveling (and which Thompson had recently won when gambling with its previous owner ‚Äì a friend of Johnson's). When Thompson climbed back on board, Johnson drew a knife and threatened Thompson's girlfriend, who was also on board. Thompson seized a hammer and struck Johnson several times on the head before throwing him overboard. The unconscious Johnson drowned. Thompson showed no remorse, stating it was Johnson's fault for not being able to swim. The sheriff gave Thompson a choice: standing trial, or handing over the deed to the boat and leaving town, which he chose. The other four men Thompson killed were shot in self-defense when they tried to rob him of gambling winnings. Two were killed in one incident in St. Louis in 1919 (the local police chief thanked him for killing two wanted bank robbers). The third came in St. Joseph, where Thompson and his hired bodyguard between them shot two men attempting to rob a poker game (again, the victims were known criminals and no charges were pressed). Thompson's last killing came near a country club in Texas in 1932 when he shot a masked figure who was holding him at gunpoint. This turned out to be sixteen-year-old Jimmy Frederick, who had caddied for Thompson earlier that day in a winning match. The dying Frederick confirmed to witnesses that he had been trying to rob Thompson. Arnold Rothstein case On November 4, 1928, Arnold Rothstein was murdered, allegedly because he refused to pay his debts from a poker game, held several months earlier, that he believed to have been fixed. This game had been organized by George McManus, who stood trial for the murder the next year, in a proceeding heavily covered by the media. McManus was eventually acquitted due to lack of evidence, and no one else was ever tried for Rothstein's death. Thompson had been present at the game, and an active participant in it; and it was he who, in association with one Nate Raymond, allegedly fixed the game, leaving Rothstein with total debts estimated at $500,000. Thompson, who was not present at the shooting, gave evidence at McManus's trial, without revealing his own role in the poker game. Rothstein had stood to recoup his losses by successful heavy bets on the 1928 elections of Herbert Hoover (new president) and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (new governor of New York), which did take place, shortly after Rothstein's death. Thompson later told close friends that he knew the real killer had been Rothstein's bodyguard. Origin of the nickname In his own story, published in Sports Illustrated in 1972, Alvin Thomas, listed as a co-author, said: Trevino vs. Floyd match In the 1960s, Thompson settled in Dallas and, although approaching 70 years of age, kept up a good standard of golf, and frequently hustled games at Tenison Park, a municipal golf course, and at posh Glen Lakes Country Club. Mid-decade, Thompson sponsored a young Raymond Floyd, then early in his PGA Tour career but already a winner, in a big money stakes match against Lee Trevino, then an unknown assistant pro, in El Paso, at Trevino's home course. After three days of play, honors and bets were equal, with both players well under par each round. Trevino gained confidence from the match, and within a few years became a Tour star himself, while Floyd's career also ascended. Later years Thompson was honored at the first World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1970. He lived out his final years in a nursing home near Dallas. Thompson had made gambling trips with eldest son Tommy for many years, but after his father died, Tommy, who also had become a skilled, successful gambler, gave up gambling for a church ministry and later counseled prisoners, preaching to convince others to stay away from gambling.

It is notable for its hero's use of computer hacking skills to escape pursuit in a dystopian future, and for the coining of the word \\"worm\\" to describe a program that propagates itself through a computer network.\\"The Evolution of Cyberpunk\\", Nick Ravo and Eric Nash, The New York Times, 8 August 1993.

Origin of the title The title derives from the futurist work Future Shock by Alvin Toffler.Author's introduction at The hero is a survivor in a hypothetical world of quickly changing identities, fashions, and lifestyles, where individuals are still controlled and oppressed by a powerful and secretive state apparatus. His highly developed computer skills enable him to use any public telephone to punch in a new identity, thus reinventing himself, within hours. As a fugitive, he must do this from time to time to avoid capture. The title is also a metaphor for survival in an uncertain world. Plot introduction The novel shows a dystopian early 21st-century America dominated by computer networks, and is considered by some critics to be an early ancestor of the cyberpunk genre.Dani Cavallaro (2000). Cyberpunk and Cyberculture: Science Fiction and the Work of William Gibson. Athlone Press (London). p. 11. . The hero, Nick Haflinger, is a runaway from Tarnover, a government program intended to find, educate and indoctrinate highly gifted children to further the interests of the state in a future where quantitative analysis backed by the tacit threat of coercion has replaced overt military and economic power as the deciding factor in international competition. In parallel with this, the government has become a oligarchy whose beneficiaries are members of organised crime. Nick's talent extends to programming the network using only a touch- tone telephone. One of his handlers at Tarnover explains that this is like a classical pianist being able to play entire sonatas and concertos from memory. However, Nick also has some personality flaws, amounting almost to a deathwish. These become manifest in exhibitions of his abilities, revealing his identity to his pursuers. The background to the story includes a massive earthquake laying waste to the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Millions die and millions more are left to live on government handouts. The subsequent economic depression, coupled with the rootlessness enabled by access to online data and strong social pressure to be flexible (the results of corporations wanting highly mobile workforces without strong local ties), results in a fragmentation of society along religious, ethnic, and a variety of class markers, what Toffler called \\"subcults\\", including what would in 2010 be described as gangs. The equitable distribution of data access and data privacy is a prominent theme in the book; characters who have access to information which is nominally secret enjoy demonstrable economic advantages over others lacking access to such data. In the novel, data privacy is reserved for corporate entities and individuals, who may then conceal wrongdoing; by contrast, normal citizens do not enjoy significant privacy. The world described in the book is dystopian, with laissez-faire economics portrayed as leading to disaster as greed trumps long-term planning. The educational system is dysfunctional, with teachers unable to perform their jobs due to strictures. The only functional educational system seen in the book is portrayed as an enclave, the tightly-controlled Tarnover school. Communities are either walled enclaves of privilege or largely lawless areas entirely lacking protection from corrupt civil authorities. Infrastructure has been allowed to crumble, and characters who reside within \\"paid avoidance zones\\" receive compensation from the government in lieu of actual services. Plot summary The novel is set in the weeks following Nick's recapture after several years on the run, alternating between moral arguments with his interrogator, who is trying to discover why the program's star pupil had absconded, and flashbacks of his career. The interrogator is Paul Freeman, a graduate of another secret installation known as Electric Skillet, which focuses on weapons and defence strategy. Although he had initially felt at home at Tarnover, Nick eventually becomes aware of experiments in genetic engineering being performed there. These produce monstrous deformed children who are disposed of when they are no longer needed for study. At this point Nick becomes determined to escape. He studies data processing, steals a personal ID code intended for privileged individuals who wish to live their lives without surveillance, and goes on the run. He uses the stolen computer access code to cover his data trails and create new identities for himself, easily adopting entire new personas. One is the pastor of a popular church, another is a successful computer consultant. In this last role, calling himself Sandy Locke, he becomes the lover of Ina Grierson, a top executive at Ground to Space Industries, a powerful \\"hypercorp\\" known to all as G2S. Intending to use the computer facilities at G2S to ensure that his stolen code is still valid, he signs on as a \\"systems rationalizer\\" with the company. This brings him into contact with Ina's daughter, Kate, who attracts him despite her plain appearance and simple lifestyle. At the age of 22, Nick's age when he left Tarnover, Kate is a perpetual student at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City. She is perceptive enough to penetrate Nick's adopted persona, deeply disturbing him even though she fascinates him. He visits her at home, helping her to clean out some of her possessions, and meeting her tame cougar, Bagheera ‚Äì the product of her late father's genetic research into intelligence. He died shortly after abandoning the research because the government was using it to produce animals for military uses. The 21st-century lifestyle produces a symptom called \\"overload\\" in many people, and most, including Nick, take tranquilizers to some degree. However Nick collapses completely when told that a representative from Tarnover is coming to his promotional interview at G2S. He returns to Kate and confesses that he is not what he seems, asking for her help. She conducts him to one of the \\"paid avoidance areas\\" in California, where people are paid to do without the full panoply of modern technology, as an alternative to spending billions to rebuild infrastructure after the earthquake. After Nick risks exposure yet again in one of these places, they move to the least known one, a town called Precipice. Precipice turns out to be a Utopian community of a few thousand people. The nearest comparison would be an agrarian, cottage industry community designed by William Morris. Precipice is also the home of Hearing Aid, an anonymous telephone confession service accessible to anyone in the country. Hearing Aid is also known as the \\"Ten Nines\\", after the phone number used to call it: 999-999-9999. People call the service, a human operator answers, and they simply talk while the operator listens. Some rant, others seek sympathy, still others commit suicide while on the phone. Hearing Aid's promise is that nobody else, not even the government, will hear the call. The only response Hearing Aid gives to a caller is \\"Only I heard that, I hope it helped.\\" Nick and Kate settle into the community. The inhabitants include intelligent dogs that escaped from the projects that Kate's father worked on. These act as companions, guards, nannies, and even lie detectors, using their sense of smell. Nick rewrites the \\"computer tapeworm\\" that prevents the calls to Hearing Aid being monitored. While at G2S he became aware of massive backups of data being performed, clearly in anticipation of a major network outage. The Hearing Aid worm is designed to scramble network traffic if attacked, but Nick realises that it could be destroyed if the authorities were prepared for the effects and ready to recover from them. His new worm, which he calls a \\"phage\\", cannot be removed without dismantling the entire network. Possibly encouraged by the government, local gangs and tribes raid Precipice, burning down Nick and Kate's house before being overwhelmed by the dogs. Nick, suffering another overload, blames Kate for the incident, since she, following Hearing Aid policy, cut off a call from someone attempting to warn Precipice. He hits her, and then, filled with remorse, leaves the town. He finally reveals his location to the authorities when, encountering one of the \\"Roman circus\\" operations which broadcast live fights and other bloody exhibitions to the country, he responds to an \\"all comers\\" challenge by the father of the leader of one of the gangs, and cripples him in front of a nationwide audience. At Tarnover, Paul Freeman takes charge of the interrogation. He was the representative whom Nick, as Sandy Locke, was supposed to meet at G2S. Freeman, a tall gaunt African-American, gradually comes to realise that he has more sympathy with Nick's views than his employer's, and eventually absconds himself, giving Nick computer access so that Nick can make his own escape. The precipitating event in this case is Kate's abduction by government agents, who bring her to Tarnover for further questioning and to threaten Nick. With the code he gets from Freeman, he sets up an identity as an Army major, with Kate as his prisoner. Once clear of Tarnover, they disappear together. This time around, Nick has another plan, and rather than running and hiding, he and Kate spend a number of months travelling the country, aided by an \\"invisible college\\" of academics who are allies or former residents of Precipice. He creates a new \\"worm\\" which is designed to destroy all secrecy. (Brunner invented the term worm for this program, as a self-replicating program that propagates across a computer network ‚Äì the word was later adopted by computer researchers as the name for this type of program.) The worm is eventually activated, and the details of all the government's dark secrets (clandestine genetic experimentation that produces crippled children, bribes and kickbacks from corporations, concealed crimes of high public officials) now become accessible from anywhere on the network ‚Äì in fact, those most affected by a particular crime of a government official are emailed the full details. In place of the old system, Nick has designed the worm to enforce a kind of utilitarian socialism, with people's worth being defined by their roles in society, not their connections in high places. In effect, the network becomes the entire government and financial system, policing income for illegal money, freezing the accounts of criminals, while making sure money (or credit) flows to places where people are in need. This will only happen fully if the results of a plebiscite, again conducted over the network, allow it. In a final atavistic attempt at revenge, the government orders a nuclear strike by a single aircraft from a local Air Force base. Warned by Hearing Aid, Nick is able to penetrate the military computers and manufacture a counter-order to stop the plane just before it reaches the town. The book ends optimistically, with there being no more privileged hiding of information, no more secret conspiracies of the rich and powerful. Characters  *Nick Haflinger is a wanderer, a man without a place to call his own, or a people he can identify with. His parents ceased to care for him at an early age, and he became a \\"rent-a-kid\\", living with a succession of mobile couples who had no time to settle down and start families of their own. Only when he was noticed by a schoolteacher, and subsequently recruited for Tarnover, did he find a group of people with whom he could identify. *Kate Lilleberg is the daughter of a high- powered executive mother and a genius scientist father. She seems content to be a perpetual student, however, until she meets Nick, seeing in him a real person under the false persona. Unlike her friends, she is capable of deep commitment, as exemplified by her fulfilling her promise to her dead father, and caring for the cougar, Bagheera, bred by her father for his researches. Her chosen life has one feature her mother cannot appreciate: it allows her to remain in one place. *Paul T. Freeman has spent his 39 years studying, learning, and believing in the objectives of Tarnover and Electric Skillet. Nick's plan is to lead him to areas where his high intelligence will question his perceptions and beliefs, resulting in the inevitable turning away from the power elite he serves. *Ralph C. Hartz is the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Data Processing, and the man to whom Paul Freeman reports his progress on interrogating Nick. However he himself serves entrenched interests in Washington D.C. When Nick, with Paul's help, escapes with even more powerful codes than before, he is ruthlessly cast aside, not least because his superiors refuse to accept that the new codes must be disabled so soon after replacing the old ones. *Ina Grierson, Kate's mother, lives in world of personal power but is as prone to paranoia as the lowest of her underlings. Good looking at the age of forty-something, she clings to her youthfulness, partly by taking younger lovers. The stress of living in a connected world is partly defused by luxury vacations, on one of which she meets \\"Sandy Locke\\". Later, after Kate is abducted she is jolted out of her complacency, and with the aid of software written by \\"Sandy\\" she is able to penetrate the government smokescreen. Reception Spider Robinson gave the novel a mixed review, saying that while \\"the book reads well ..., [i]ndividual sections are often brilliant, [and] the message is incisive and timely\\", that \\"as a story it limps\\" and that many characters, including the main antagonists, \\"are cut from cardboard\\". The New York Times reviewer Gerald Jonas was even more critical, saying that while Brunner was attempting to write \\"slice-of-life\\" fiction about a future society, the result of his arbitrary choices about social details is that \\"the entire fictional edifice collapses like a house of cards.\\" Themes The novel was written shortly after two pivotal events of the 1970s, the resignation of Richard Nixon and the overthrow of the Chilean President Salvador Allende, which are cited in the novel as examples, in Nixon's case, of a failed attempt by organised crime to suborn the Presidency, and in the second, of the consequences of working against multinational commercial interests. Most of the characters live with the feeling that their lives could be turned upside down in an instant because of someone breaking into the data held on the network. They also believe that the network knows more about them than they do about themselves. This is an extension of the sense of paranoia felt by many people in the 1970s, believing themselves to be powerless in the face of political and economic forces over which they had no control. Perception is a recurrent theme in the novel. In particular, Brunner is concerned with perceptual patterns and how they can both help and mislead. Nick projects patterns of behaviour to assume his personas, but Kate has \\"natural wisdom\\" which means that she ignores surface patterns to perceive the truth beneath. When they arrive in Precipice, the couple have to abandon their normal \\"urban pattern\\" to see the ways in which the town's unique design merges public and private space, along with natural and artificial structures. The theme of patterns in perception runs through the entire novel. Future shock arises when reality and change disrupt patterns. People respond by falling into strong patterns within human nature, particularly tribalism. Others try to convince themselves that all change is good, adopting the \\"plug- in\\" lifestyle where they feel able to relocate to another city and insert themselves into a new social niche with a minimum of inconvenience. Their mobility is, however, a reflection of the failure of the lifestyle to satisfy them, resulting in more moves. In this world of confusion are also companies specialising in psychological intervention. One such is Anti-Trauma Inc. which is hired to \\"normalise\\" children in a process akin to deprogramming, the (often violent) attempt to force people to renounce their association with groups perceived as cults. Anti-Trauma does significant harm to its charges, although as so often happens in Brunner's interconnected society, it also spends much money and time covering up its failures. =The worm= Brunner's concept of the computer worm was inspired by analogy with the tapeworm, a digestive parasite. A biological tapeworm consists of a head attached to a long train of reproductive segments, each of which can produce more worms when detached. Brunner's \\"data-net tapeworm\\" consists of a head followed by other segments, each being some kind of code which has effects on databases and other systems. Several are unleashed in the book. Besides the two Hearing Aid tapeworms, and Nick's ultimate tapeworm, there is a \\"denunciation tapeworm\\" created as revenge by a representative of Anti-Trauma Inc. whom Nick insults and curses. At the time, Nick was playing the role of a priest in a revivalist church. The worm's intent was to destroy the church by cancelling all its utility services. Nick in turn sends another worm into the network to destroy that one.

Published in 1977, it is King's third published novel and first hardback bestseller: the success of the book firmly established King as a preeminent author in the horror genre. The setting and characters are influenced by King's personal experiences, including both his visit to The Stanley Hotel in 1974 and his struggle with alcoholism. The novel was adapted into a 1980 film of the same name and was later followed by a sequel, Doctor Sleep, published in 2013. The Shining centers on the life of Jack Torrance, a struggling writer and recovering alcoholic who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. His family accompanies him on this job, including his young son Danny Torrance, who possesses \\"the shining\\", an array of psychic abilities that allow Danny to see the hotel's horrific past. Soon, after a winter storm leaves them snowbound, the supernatural forces inhabiting the hotel influence Jack's sanity, leaving his wife and son in incredible danger.  Plot  The Shining mainly takes place in the fictional Overlook Hotel, an isolated, haunted resort hotel located in the Colorado Rockies. The history of the hotel, which is described in backstory by several characters, includes the deaths of some of its guests and of former winter caretaker Delbert Grady, who ‚Äúsuccumbed to cabin fever‚Äù and killed his family and himself. Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy, and their five-year-old son Danny move into the hotel after Jack accepts the position as winter caretaker. Jack is an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic with anger issues which, prior to the story, had caused him to accidentally break Danny's arm and lose his position as a teacher after assaulting a student. Jack hopes that the hotel's seclusion will help him reconnect with his family and give him the motivation needed to work on a play. Danny, unknown to his parents, possesses psychic abilities referred to as \\"the shining\\" that enable him to read minds and experience premonitions as well as clairvoyance. The Torrances arrive at the hotel on closing day and are given a tour by the manager. They meet Dick Hallorann, the chef, who also possesses similar abilities to Danny's and helps to explain them to him, giving Hallorann and Danny a special connection. The remaining staff and guests depart the hotel, leaving the Torrances alone in the hotel for the winter. As the Torrances settle in at the Overlook, Danny sees ghosts and frightening visions. Although Danny is close to his parents, he does not tell either of them about his visions because he senses that the care-taking job is important to his father and the family's future. Wendy considers leaving Jack at the Overlook to finish the job by himself; Danny refuses, thinking his father will be happier if they stayed. However, Danny soon realizes that his presence in the hotel makes the supernatural activity more powerful, turning echoes of past tragedies into dangerous threats. Apparitions take solid form and the garden's topiary animals come to life. The winter snowfall leaves the Torrances cut off from the outside world in the isolated hotel. The Overlook has difficulty possessing Danny, so it begins to possess Jack by frustrating his need and desire to work and by enticing him with the storied history of the hotel through a scrapbook and records in the basement. Jack starts to develop cabin fever and becomes increasingly unstable, destroying a CB radio and sabotaging a snowmobile, the only two links with the outside world the Torrances had. One day, after a fight with Wendy, Jack finds the hotel's bar fully stocked with liquor despite being previously empty, and witnesses a party at which he meets the ghost of a bartender named Lloyd. He also dances with a young woman ghost who tries to seduce Jack. As he gets drunk, the hotel uses the ghost of the former caretaker Grady to urge Jack to kill his wife and son. He initially resists, but the increasing influence of the hotel combined with Jack's own alcoholism and anger prove too great. He becomes a monster under the control of the hotel, succumbing to his dark side. Wendy and Danny get the better of Jack after he attacks Wendy, locking him inside the walk-in pantry, but the ghost of Delbert Grady releases him after he makes Jack promise to bring him Danny and to kill Wendy. Jack attacks Wendy with one of the hotel's roque mallets, grievously injuring her, but she escapes to the caretaker's suite and locks herself in the bathroom. Jack attempts to break the door with the mallet, but Wendy slashes his hand with a razor blade to deter him. Meanwhile, Hallorann has received a psychic distress call from Danny while working at a winter resort in Florida. Hallorann rushes back to the Overlook, only to be attacked by the topiary animals and severely injured by Jack. As Jack pursues Danny through the Overlook and corners him on the hotel's top floor, he briefly gains control of himself and implores Danny to run away after Danny stands his ground and denounces Jack as a mask and false face worn by the hotel. The hotel takes control of Jack again, making him violently batter his own face and skull into ruin with the mallet, destroying the last vestiges of Jack and leaving a being controlled by the hotel's own malevolent \\"manager\\" personality. Remembering that Jack has neglected to relieve the pressure on the hotel's unstable boiler, Danny informs the hotel that it is about to explode. As Danny, Wendy, and Hallorann flee, the hotel-creature rushes to the basement in an attempt to vent the pressure, but it is too late and the boiler explodes, killing Jack and destroying the Overlook. Fighting off a last attempt by the hotel to possess him, Hallorann guides Danny and Wendy to safety. The book's epilogue is set during the next summer. Hallorann, who has taken a chef's job at a resort in Maine, comforts Danny over the loss of his father as Wendy recuperates from the injuries Jack inflicted on her. Background The Stanley Hotel, which hosted King in 1974, served as the inspiration for the Overlook Hotel. After writing Carrie and 'Salem's Lot, which are both set in small towns in King's native Maine, King was looking for a change of pace for the next book. \\"I wanted to spend a year away from Maine so that my next novel would have a different sort of background.\\"\\"The Stephen King Companion\\" Beahm, George Andrews McMeel press 1989 King opened an atlas of the US on the kitchen table and randomly pointed to a location, which turned out to be Boulder, Colorado.\\"Stephen King: America's Best-Loved Boogeyman\\" Beahm, George Andrews McMeel Press 1998 On October 30, 1974,\\"Stephen King Country\\" Beahm, George Running Press 1999 King and his wife Tabitha checked into The Stanley Hotel in nearby Estes Park, Colorado. They were the only two guests in the hotel that night. \\"When we arrived, they were just getting ready to close for the season, and we found ourselves the only guests in the place ‚Äî with all those long, empty corridors\\". They checked into room 217, which was said to be haunted. This is where room 217 comes from in the book.This is asserted by the management of the Stanley Hotel on their tours and on their website. Ten years earlier, King had read Ray Bradbury's \\"The Veldt\\" and was inspired to someday write a story about a person whose dreams would become real. In 1972, King started a novel entitled Darkshine, which was to be about a psychic boy in a psychic amusement park, but the idea never came to fruition and he abandoned the book. During the night at the Stanley, this story came back to him.\\"Stephen King: The Art of Darkness\\" Winter, Douglas E. Plume 1984 King and his wife had dinner that evening in the grand dining room, totally alone. They were offered one choice for dinner, the only meal still available. Taped orchestral music played in the room and theirs was the only table set for dining. \\"Except for our table all the chairs were up on the tables. So the music is echoing down the hall, and, I mean, it was like God had put me there to hear that and see those things. And by the time I went to bed that night, I had the whole book in my mind\\".Vvdailypress.com After dinner, his wife decided to turn in, but King took a walk around the empty hotel. He ended up in the bar and was served drinks by a bartender named Grady. \\"That night I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of the book firmly set in my mind.\\" The Shining was also heavily influenced by Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House,\\"The Annotated Guide to Stephen King\\" Collings, Michael R. Starmount House 1986 Edgar Allan Poe's The Masque of the Red Death and The Fall of the House of Usher, and Robert Marasco's Burnt Offerings. The story has been often compared to Guy de Maupassant's story \\"The Inn\\". Before writing The Shining, King had written Roadwork and The Body which were both published later. The first draft of The Shining took less than four months to complete and he was able to publish it before the others. The title was inspired by the John Lennon song \\"Instant Karma!\\", which contained the line \\"We all shine on\\".King discusses this in Bill Thompson, King's editor at Doubleday, tried to talk him out of The Shining because he thought that after writing Carrie and Salem's Lot, he would get \\"typed\\" as a horror writer. King considered that a compliment. Deleted prologue and epilogue Originally, there was a prologue titled \\"Before the Play\\" that chronicled earlier events in the Overlook's history, as well as an epilogue titled \\"After the Play\\", though neither remained part of the published novel. The prologue was later published in Whispers magazine in August 1982, and an abridged version appeared in the April 26‚ÄìMay 2, 1997 issue of TV Guide to promote the then-upcoming miniseries of The Shining. The epilogue was thought to have been lost, but was re- discovered in 2016 as part of an early manuscript version of the novel. Both \\"Before the Play\\" and \\"After the Play\\" were published as part of the Deluxe Special Edition of The Shining by Cemetery Dance Publications in early 2017. Sequel On November 19, 2009, during a reading at the Canon Theatre in Toronto, King described to the audience an idea for a sequel to The Shining. The idea was prompted by the occasional person asking, \\"Whatever happened to Danny?\\" The story would follow Danny Torrance, now in his 40s, living in New Hampshire, where he works as an orderly at a hospice and helps terminally ill patients pass away with the aid of some extraordinary powers. Later, on December 1, 2009, King posted a poll on his official website, asking visitors to vote for which book he should write next, Doctor Sleep or the next Dark Tower novel: Voting ended on December 31, 2009, and it was revealed that Doctor Sleep received 5,861 votes, while The Wind Through the Keyhole received 5,812. In 2011, King posted an update confirming that Doctor Sleep was in the works and that the plot included a traveling group of psychic vampires called The True Knot. Doctor Sleep was published on September 24, 2013.  Adaptations  The novel was adapted into a 1980 feature film of the same name directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with Diane Johnson. Although King himself remains disappointed with the adaptation, having criticized its handling of the book's themes and of Wendy's character, it is regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made. The novel was also adapted to a television miniseries, which premiered in 1997. Stephen King wrote and closely monitored the making of the series to ensure that it followed the novel's narrative. The novel was also adapted into an opera of the same name in 2016. The novel is being adapted into a stage play directed by Ivo van Hove and written by Simon Stephens. A spin-off series titled Overlook is in development by J. J. Abrams and his production company Bad Robot. It will air on HBO Max and explores the tales of the Overlook Hotel.

Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy. The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton. It introduced concepts including spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves. Development and acceptance Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A. Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincar√© and others. Max Planck, Hermann Minkowski and others did subsequent work. Einstein developed general relativity between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. The final form of general relativity was published in 1916. The term \\"theory of relativity\\" was based on the expression \\"relative theory\\" () used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section of the same paper, Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression \\"theory of relativity\\" (). By the 1920s, the physics community understood and accepted special relativity. It rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of atomic physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics. By comparison, general relativity did not appear to be as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory. It seemed to offer little potential for experimental test, as most of its assertions were on an astronomical scale. Its mathematics seemed difficult and fully understandable only by a small number of people. Around 1960, general relativity became central to physics and astronomy. New mathematical techniques to apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized. As astronomical phenomena were discovered, such as quasars (1963), the 3-kelvin microwave background radiation (1965), pulsars (1967), and the first black hole candidates (1981), the theory explained their attributes, and measurement of them further confirmed the theory. Special relativity Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime. It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper \\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\\" (for the contributions of many other physicists see History of special relativity). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in classical mechanics: # The laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference relative to one another (principle of relativity). # The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the light source. The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics. For instance, postulate 2 explains the results of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences. Some of these are: * Relativity of simultaneity: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion. * Time dilation: Moving clocks are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's \\"stationary\\" clock. * Length contraction: Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer. * Maximum speed is finite: No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. ** The effect of Gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously. * Mass‚Äìenergy equivalence: , energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable. * Relativistic mass, idea used by some researchers. The defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the Galilean transformations of classical mechanics by the Lorentz transformations. (See Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism). General relativity General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907‚Äì1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that free fall is inertial motion: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no force being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of gravity as is the case in classical mechanics. This is incompatible with classical mechanics and special relativity because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved. In 1915, he devised the Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it. Some of the consequences of general relativity are: *Gravitational time dilation: Clocks run slower in deeper gravitational wells., Lecture 5 * Precession: Orbits precess in a way unexpected in Newton's theory of gravity. (This has been observed in the orbit of Mercury and in binary pulsars). * Light deflection: Rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field. * Frame-dragging: Rotating masses \\"drag along\\" the spacetime around them. * Metric expansion of space: the universe is expanding, and the far parts of it are moving away from us faster than the speed of light. Technically, general relativity is a theory of gravitation whose defining feature is its use of the Einstein field equations. The solutions of the field equations are metric tensors which define the topology of the spacetime and how objects move inertially. Experimental evidence Einstein stated that the theory of relativity belongs to a class of \\"principle-theories\\". As such, it employs an analytic method, which means that the elements of this theory are not based on hypothesis but on empirical discovery. By observing natural processes, we understand their general characteristics, devise mathematical models to describe what we observed, and by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and match the theory's conclusions. = Tests of special relativity = A diagram of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment Relativity is a falsifiable theory: It makes predictions that can be tested by experiment. In the case of special relativity, these include the principle of relativity, the constancy of the speed of light, and time dilation. The predictions of special relativity have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in 1905, but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to its validation. These are the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment, and the Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment. Einstein derived the Lorentz transformations from first principles in 1905, but these three experiments allow the transformations to be induced from experimental evidence. Maxwell's equations‚Äîthe foundation of classical electromagnetism‚Äîdescribe light as a wave that moves with a characteristic velocity. The modern view is that light needs no medium of transmission, but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light waves were propagated in a medium, analogous to sound propagating in air, and ripples propagating on the surface of a pond. This hypothetical medium was called the luminiferous aether, at rest relative to the \\"fixed stars\\" and through which the Earth moves. Fresnel's partial ether dragging hypothesis ruled out the measurement of first-order (v/c) effects, and although observations of second-order effects (v2/c2) were possible in principle, Maxwell thought they were too small to be detected with then- current technology. The Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment was designed to detect second-order effects of the \\"aether wind\\"‚Äîthe motion of the aether relative to the earth. Michelson designed an instrument called the Michelson interferometer to accomplish this. The apparatus was more than accurate enough to detect the expected effects, but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881, and again in 1887. Although the failure to detect an aether wind was a disappointment, the results were accepted by the scientific community. In an attempt to salvage the aether paradigm, FitzGerald and Lorentz independently created an ad hoc hypothesis in which the length of material bodies changes according to their motion through the aether. This was the origin of FitzGerald‚ÄìLorentz contraction, and their hypothesis had no theoretical basis. The interpretation of the null result of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment is that the round-trip travel time for light is isotropic (independent of direction), but the result alone is not enough to discount the theory of the aether or validate the predictions of special relativity. The Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment shown with interference fringes. While the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment showed that the velocity of light is isotropic, it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed (if at all) in different inertial frames. The Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment was designed to do that, and was first performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike. They obtained a null result, and concluded that \\"there is no effect ... unless the velocity of the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its orbit\\". That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide an acceptable explanation, so from the null result of their experiment it was concluded that the round-trip time for light is the same in all inertial reference frames. The Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment was carried out by Herbert Ives and G.R. Stilwell first in 1938 and with better accuracy in 1941. It was designed to test the transverse Doppler effect the redshift of light from a moving source in a direction perpendicular to its velocity‚Äîwhich had been predicted by Einstein in 1905. The strategy was to compare observed Doppler shifts with what was predicted by classical theory, and look for a Lorentz factor correction. Such a correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity. Those classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased precision. Other experiments include, for instance, relativistic energy and momentum increase at high velocities, experimental testing of time dilation, and modern searches for Lorentz violations. = Tests of general relativity = General relativity has also been confirmed many times, the classic experiments being the perihelion precession of Mercury's orbit, the deflection of light by the Sun, and the gravitational redshift of light. Other tests confirmed the equivalence principle and frame dragging. Modern applications Far from being simply of theoretical interest, relativistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement needs to take into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user and is thus in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo, must account for all of the relativistic effects, such as the consequences of Earth's gravitational field, in order to work with precision. This is also the case in the high- precision measurement of time. Instruments ranging from electron microscopes to particle accelerators would not work if relativistic considerations were omitted. Asymptotic symmetries The spacetime symmetry group for Special Relativity is the Poincar√© group, which is a ten-dimensional group of three Lorentz boosts, three rotations, and four spacetime translations. It is logical to ask what symmetries if any might apply in General Relativity. A tractable case may be to consider the symmetries of spacetime as seen by observers located far away from all sources of the gravitational field. The naive expectation for asymptotically flat spacetime symmetries might be simply to extend and reproduce the symmetries of flat spacetime of special relativity, viz., the Poincar√© group. In 1962 Hermann Bondi, M. G. van der Burg, A. W. Metzner and Rainer K. Sachs addressed this asymptotic symmetry problem in order to investigate the flow of energy at infinity due to propagating gravitational waves. Their first step was to decide on some physically sensible boundary conditions to place on the gravitational field at light-like infinity to characterize what it means to say a metric is asymptotically flat, making no a priori assumptions about the nature of the asymptotic symmetry group ‚Äî not even the assumption that such a group exists. Then after designing what they considered to be the most sensible boundary conditions, they investigated the nature of the resulting asymptotic symmetry transformations that leave invariant the form of the boundary conditions appropriate for asymptotically flat gravitational fields. What they found was that the asymptotic symmetry transformations actually do form a group and the structure of this group does not depend on the particular gravitational field that happens to be present. This means that, as expected, one can separate the kinematics of spacetime from the dynamics of the gravitational field at least at spatial infinity. The puzzling surprise in 1962 was their discovery of a rich infinite-dimensional group (the so-called BMS group) as the asymptotic symmetry group, instead of the finite-dimensional Poincar√© group, which is a subgroup of the BMS group. Not only are the Lorentz transformations asymptotic symmetry transformations, there are also additional transformations that are not Lorentz transformations but are asymptotic symmetry transformations.

A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user. The term is derived from (tƒìle, far) and œÜœâŒΩŒÆ (ph≈çnƒì, voice), together meaning distant voice. A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use almost immediately after the first patent was issued. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device. This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households. The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location. In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone. The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected. The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker. Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously. The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location. Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards. These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network. For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century. Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973. In later decades their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost. Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation. Most are smartphones, integrating all mobile communication and many computing needs.  Basic principles  Schematic of a landline telephone installation A traditional landline telephone system, also known as plain old telephone service (POTS), commonly carries both control and audio signals on the same twisted pair (C in diagram) of insulated wires, the telephone line. The control and signaling equipment consists of three components, the ringer, the hookswitch, and a dial. The ringer, or beeper, light or other device (A7), alerts the user to incoming calls. The hookswitch signals to the central office that the user has picked up the handset to either answer a call or initiate a call. A dial, if present, is used by the subscriber to transmit a telephone number to the central office when initiating a call. Until the 1960s dials used almost exclusively the rotary technology, which was replaced by dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) with pushbutton telephones (A4). A major expense of wire-line telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on a single pair of wires. A twisted pair line rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are negative compared to earth, to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.  Details of operation  The landline telephone contains a switchhook (A4) and an alerting device, usually a ringer (A7), that remains connected to the phone line whenever the phone is \\"on hook\\" (i.e. the switch (A4) is open), and other components which are connected when the phone is \\"off hook\\". The off-hook components include a transmitter (microphone, A2), a receiver (speaker, A1), and other circuits for dialing, filtering (A3), and amplification. The place a telephone call, the calling party picks up the telephone's handset, thereby operating a lever which closes the hook switch (A4). This powers the telephone by connecting the transmission hybrid transformer, as well as the transmitter (microphone) and receiver (speaker) to the line. In this off-hook state, the telephone circuitry has a low resistance of typically than 300 ohms, which causes the flow of direct current (DC) in the line (C) from the telephone exchange. The exchange detects this current, attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line, and sends dial tone to indicate its readiness. On a modern push-button telephone, the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the destination, the called party. The keys control a tone generator circuit (not shown) that sends DTMF tones to the exchange. A rotary-dial telephone uses pulse dialing, sending electrical pulses, that the exchange counts to decode each digit of the telephone number. If the called party's line is available, the terminating exchange applies an intermittent alternating current (AC) ringing signal of 40 to 90 volts to alert the called party of the incoming call. If the called party's line is in use, however, the exchange returns a busy signal to the calling party. If the called party's line is in use but subscribes to call waiting service, the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the called party to indicate another call. The electromechanical ringer of a telephone (A7) is connected to the line through a capacitor (A6), which blocks direct current and passes the alternating current of the ringing power. The telephone draws no current when it is on hook, while a DC voltage is continually applied to the line. Exchange circuitry (D2) can send an alternating current down the line to activate the ringer and announce an incoming call. In manual service exchange areas, before dial service was installed, telephones had hand-cranked magneto generators to generate a ringing voltage back to the exchange or any other telephone on the same line. When a landline telephone is inactive (on hook), the circuitry at the telephone exchange detects the absence of direct current to indicate that the line is not in use. When a party initiates a call to this line, the exchange sends the ringing signal. When the called party picks up the handset, they actuate a double-circuit switchhook (not shown) which may simultaneously disconnects the alerting device and connects the audio circuitry to the line. This, in turn, draws direct current through the line, confirming that the called phone is now active. The exchange circuitry turns off the ring signal, and both telephones are now active and connected through the exchange. The parties may now converse as long as both phones remain off hook. When a party hangs up, placing the handset back on the cradle or hook, direct current ceases in that line, signaling the exchange to disconnect the call. Calls to parties beyond the local exchange are carried over trunk lines which establish connections between exchanges. In modern telephone networks, fiber-optic cable and digital technology are often employed in such connections. Satellite technology may be used for communication over very long distances. In most landline telephones, the transmitter and receiver (microphone and speaker) are located in the handset, although in a speakerphone these components may be located in the base or in a separate enclosure. Powered by the line, the microphone (A2) produces a modulated electric current which varies its frequency and amplitude in response to the sound waves arriving at its diaphragm. The resulting current is transmitted along the telephone line to the local exchange then on to the other phone (via the local exchange or via a larger network), where it passes through the coil of the receiver (A3). The varying current in the coil produces a corresponding movement of the receiver's diaphragm, reproducing the original sound waves present at the transmitter. Along with the microphone and speaker, additional circuitry is incorporated to prevent the incoming speaker signal and the outgoing microphone signal from interfering with each other. This is accomplished through a hybrid coil (A3). The incoming audio signal passes through a resistor (A8) and the primary winding of the coil (A3) which passes it to the speaker (A1). Since the current path A8 ‚Äì A3 has a far lower impedance than the microphone (A2), virtually all of the incoming signal passes through it and bypasses the microphone. At the same time the DC voltage across the line causes a DC current which is split between the resistor-coil (A8-A3) branch and the microphone-coil (A2-A3) branch. The DC current through the resistor- coil branch has no effect on the incoming audio signal. But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC (in response to voice sounds) which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil's (A3) primary winding, which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding. This causes a small portion of the microphone output to be fed back to the speaker, while the rest of the AC goes out through the phone line. A lineman's handset is a telephone designed for testing the telephone network, and may be attached directly to aerial lines and other infrastructure components.  History  Alexander Graham Bell's Telephone Patent Drawing The world's first telephone invented by Antonio Meucci in 1849. Bell placing the first New York to Chicago telephone call in 1892 Before the development of the electric telephone, the term \\"telephone\\" was applied to other inventions, and not all early researchers of the electrical device called it \\"telephone\\". Perhaps the earliest use of the word for a communications system was the telephon created by Gottfried Huth in 1796. Huth proposed an alternative to the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe in which the operators in the signalling towers would shout to each other by means of what he called \\"speaking tubes\\", but would now be called giant megaphones.Holzmann, Gerard J.; Pehrson, Bj√∂rn, The Early History of Data Networks, pp. 90-91, Wiley, 1995 . A communication device for sailing vessels called a \\"telephone\\" was invented by the captain John Taylor in 1844. This instrument used four air horns to communicate with vessels in foggy weather.\\"The Telephone and Telephone Exchanges\\" by J. E. Kingsbury published in 1915. Johann Philipp Reis used the term in reference to his invention, commonly known as the Reis telephone, in c. 1860. His device appears to be the first device based on conversion of sound into electrical impulses. The term telephone was adopted into the vocabulary of many languages. It is derived from the , tƒìle, \\"far\\" and œÜœâŒΩŒÆ, ph≈çnƒì, \\"voice\\", together meaning \\"distant voice\\". Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed. As with other influential inventions such as radio, television, the light bulb, and the computer, several inventors pioneered experimental work on voice transmission over a wire and improved on each other's ideas. New controversies over the issue still arise from time to time. Charles Bourseul, Antonio Meucci, Johann Philipp Reis, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray, amongst others, have all been credited with the invention of the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be awarded a patent for the electric telephone by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in March 1876. Before Bell's patent, the telephone transmitted sound in a way that was similar to the telegraph. This method used vibrations and circuits to send electrical pulses, but was missing key features. Bell found that this method produced a sound through intermittent currents, but in order for the telephone to work a fluctuating current reproduced sounds the best. The fluctuating currents became the basis for the working telephone, creating Bell's patent. That first patent by Bell was the master patent of the telephone, from which other patents for electric telephone devices and features flowed. The Bell patents were forensically victorious and commercially decisive. In 1876, shortly after Bell's patent application, Hungarian engineer Tivadar Pusk√°s proposed the telephone switch, which allowed for the formation of telephone exchanges, and eventually networks. In the United Kingdom the blower is used as a slang term for a telephone. The term came from navy slang for a speaking tube. In the U.S., a somewhat dated slang term refers to the telephone as \\"the horn,\\" as in \\"I couldn't get him on the horn,\\" or \\"I'll be off the horn in a moment.\\" https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/on%20the%20horn =Timeline of early development= Reis' telephone Bell's first telephone transmitter, ca. 1876, reenacted 50 years later Acoustic telephone ad, The Consolidated Telephone Co., Jersey City, New Jersey, 1886 1896 telephone from Sweden magneto generator * 1844: Innocenzo Manzetti first mooted the idea of a \\"speaking telegraph\\" or telephone. Use of the \\"speaking telegraph\\" and \\"sound telegraph\\" monikers would eventually be replaced by the newer, distinct name, \\"telephone\\". * 26 August 1854: Charles Bourseul published an article in the magazine L'Illustration (Paris): \\"Transmission √©lectrique de la parole\\" (electric transmission of speech), describing a \\"make-and-break\\" type telephone transmitter later created by Johann Reis. * 26 October 1861: Johann Philipp Reis (1834‚Äì1874) publicly demonstrated the Reis telephone before the Physical Society of Frankfurt. Reis' telephone was not limited to musical sounds. Reis also used his telephone to transmit the phrase \\"Das Pferd frisst keinen Gurkensalat\\" (\\"The horse does not eat cucumber salad\\"). * 22 August 1865, La Feuille d'Aoste reported \\"It is rumored that English technicians to whom Mr. Manzetti illustrated his method for transmitting spoken words on the telegraph wire intend to apply said invention in England on several private telegraph lines\\". However telephones would not be demonstrated there until 1876, with a set of telephones from Bell. * 28 December 1871: Antonio Meucci files patent caveat No. 3335 in the U.S. Patent Office titled \\"Sound Telegraph\\", describing communication of voice between two people by wire. A 'patent caveat' was not an invention patent award, but only an unverified notice filed by an individual that he or she intends to file a regular patent application in the future. * 1874: Meucci, after having renewed the caveat for two years does not renew it again, and the caveat lapses. * 6 April 1875: Bell's U.S. Patent 161,739 \\"Transmitters and Receivers for Electric Telegraphs\\" is granted. This uses multiple vibrating steel reeds in make-break circuits. * 11 February 1876: Elisha Gray invents a liquid transmitter for use with a telephone but does not build one. * 14 February 1876: Gray files a patent caveat for transmitting the human voice through a telegraphic circuit. * 14 February 1876: Alexander Graham Bell applies for the patent \\"Improvements in Telegraphy\\", for electromagnetic telephones using what is now called amplitude modulation (oscillating current and voltage) but which he referred to as \\"undulating current\\". * 19 February 1876: Gray is notified by the U.S. Patent Office of an interference between his caveat and Bell's patent application. Gray decides to abandon his caveat. * 7 March 1876: Bell's U.S. patent 174,465 \\"Improvement in Telegraphy\\" is granted, covering \\"the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically‚Ä¶by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound.\\" * 10 March 1876: The first successful telephone transmission of clear speech using a liquid transmitter when Bell spoke into his device, \\"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.\\" and Watson heard each word distinctly. * 30 January 1877: Bell's U.S. patent 186,787 is granted for an electromagnetic telephone using permanent magnets, iron diaphragms, and a call bell. * 27 April 1877: Edison files for a patent on a carbon (graphite) transmitter. The patent 474,230 was granted 3 May 1892, after a 15-year delay because of litigation. Edison was granted patent 222,390 for a carbon granules transmitter in 1879. Early commercial instruments Early telephones were technically diverse. Some used a water microphone, some had a metal diaphragm that induced current in an electromagnet wound around a permanent magnet, and some were dynamic ‚Äì their diaphragm vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or the coil vibrated the diaphragm. The sound-powered dynamic variants survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications, where its ability to create its own electrical power was crucial. Most, however, used the Edison/Berliner carbon transmitter, which was much louder than the other kinds, even though it required an induction coil which was an impedance matching transformer to make it compatible with the impedance of the line. The Edison patents kept the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time the network was more important than the instrument. Early telephones were locally powered, using either a dynamic transmitter or by the powering of a transmitter with a local battery. One of the jobs of outside plant personnel was to visit each telephone periodically to inspect the battery. During the 20th century, telephones powered from the telephone exchange over the same wires that carried the voice signals became common. Early telephones used a single wire for the subscriber's line, with ground return used to complete the circuit (as used in telegraphs). The earliest dynamic telephones also had only one port opening for sound, with the user alternately listening and speaking (or rather, shouting) into the same hole. Sometimes the instruments were operated in pairs at each end, making conversation more convenient but also more expensive. At first, the benefits of a telephone exchange were not exploited. Instead telephones were leased in pairs to a subscriber, who had to arrange for a telegraph contractor to construct a line between them, for example between a home and a shop. Users who wanted the ability to speak to several different locations would need to obtain and set up three or four pairs of telephones. Western Union, already using telegraph exchanges, quickly extended the principle to its telephones in New York City and San Francisco, and Bell was not slow in appreciating the potential. Signalling began in an appropriately primitive manner. The user alerted the other end, or the exchange operator, by whistling into the transmitter. Exchange operation soon resulted in telephones being equipped with a bell in a ringer box, first operated over a second wire, and later over the same wire, but with a condenser (capacitor) in series with the bell coil to allow the AC ringer signal through while still blocking DC (keeping the phone \\"on hook\\"). Telephones connected to the earliest Strowger switch automatic exchanges had seven wires, one for the knife switch, one for each telegraph key, one for the bell, one for the push-button and two for speaking. Large wall telephones in the early 20th century usually incorporated the bell, and separate bell boxes for desk phones dwindled away in the middle of the century. Rural and other telephones that were not on a common battery exchange had a magneto hand-cranked generator to produce a high voltage alternating signal to ring the bells of other telephones on the line and to alert the operator. Some local farming communities that were not connected to the main networks set up barbed wire telephone lines that exploited the existing system of field fences to transmit the signal. In the 1890s a new smaller style of telephone was introduced, packaged in three parts. The transmitter stood on a stand, known as a \\"candlestick\\" for its shape. When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a \\"switchhook\\". Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell. With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone \\"off the hook\\". In phones connected to magneto exchanges, the bell, induction coil, battery and magneto were in a separate bell box or \\"ringer box\\". In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other out-of-the-way place, since it did not need a battery or magneto. Cradle designs were also used at this time, having a handle with the receiver and transmitter attached, now called a handset, separate from the cradle base that housed the magneto crank and other parts. They were larger than the \\"candlestick\\" and more popular. Disadvantages of single-wire operation such as crosstalk and hum from nearby AC power wires had already led to the use of twisted pairs and, for long-distance telephones, four-wire circuits. Users at the beginning of the 20th century did not place long-distance calls from their own telephones but made an appointment to use a special soundproofed long-distance telephone booth furnished with the latest technology. What turned out to be the most popular and longest-lasting physical style of telephone was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's 202-type desk set. A carbon granule transmitter and electromagnetic receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use sat in a cradle in the base unit. The circuit diagram of the model 202 shows the direct connection of the transmitter to the line, while the receiver was induction coupled. In local battery configurations, when the local loop was too long to provide sufficient current from the exchange, the transmitter was powered by a local battery and inductively coupled, while the receiver was included in the local loop.Circuit Diagram, Model 102, Porticus Telephone website. The coupling transformer and the ringer were mounted in a separate enclosure, called the subscriber set. The dial switch in the base interrupted the line current by repeatedly but very briefly disconnecting the line 1 to 10 times for each digit, and the hook switch (in the center of the circuit diagram) disconnected the line and the transmitter battery while the handset was on the cradle. In the 1930s, telephone sets were developed that combined the bell and induction coil with the desk set, obviating a separate ringer box. The rotary dial becoming commonplace in the 1930s in many areas enabled customer-dialed service, but some magneto systems remained even into the 1960s. After World War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient telephone sets, such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, were developed that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch- Tone signaling using push-button telephones by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T;) in 1963.

Along with the development of stored program control for electronic switching systems, and new transmission technologies, such as pulse-code modulation (PCM), telephony gradually evolved towards digital telephony, which improved the capacity, quality, and cost of the network. The development of digital data communications methods made it possible to digitize voice and transmit it as real-time data across computer networks and the Internet, giving rise to the field of Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, also known as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), a term that reflects the methodology memorably. VoIP has proven to be a disruptive technology that is rapidly replacing traditional telephone network infrastructure. By January 2005, up to 10% of telephone subscribers in Japan and South Korea had switched to this digital telephone service. A January 2005 Newsweek article suggested that Internet telephony may be \\"the next big thing.\\" The technology has spawned a new industry comprising many VoIP companies that offer services to consumers and businesses. IP telephony uses high-bandwidth Internet connections and specialized customer premises equipment to transmit telephone calls via the Internet, or any modern private data network. The customer equipment may be an analog telephone adapter (ATA) which translates the signals of a conventional analog telephone to packet-switched IP messages. IP Phones have these function combined in standalone device, and computer softphone applications use microphone and headset devices of a personal computer. While traditional analog telephones are typically powered from the central office through the telephone line, digital telephones require a local power supply. Internet-based digital service also requires special provisions to provide the service location to the emergency services when an emergency telephone number is called. Mobile telephony In 2002, only 10% of the world's population used mobile phones and by 2005 that percentage had risen to 46%. By the end of 2009, there were a total of nearly 6 billion mobile and fixed-line telephone subscribers worldwide. This included 1.26 billion fixed-line subscribers and 4.6 billion mobile subscribers.Next-Generation Networks Set to Transform Communications, International Telecommunications Union website, 4 September 2007.

It also runs an international IP backbone network which is ranked number one in the world through Telia Carrier. The company is headquartered in Stockholm and its stock is traded on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. History Telia Company in its current form was first established as TeliaSonera, as the result of a 2002 merger between the Swedish and Finnish telecommunications companies, Telia and Sonera. This merger followed three years after Telia's failed merger attempt with Norwegian telecommunications company Telenor, now its chief competitor in the Nordic countries. Before privatisation, Telia was a state telephone monopoly. Sonera, on the other hand, had a monopoly only on trunk network calls, while most (c. 75%) of local telecommunication was provided by telephone cooperatives. The separate brands Telia and Sonera continued to be used in the Swedish and Finnish markets respectively until March 2017 when Sonera was rebranded to Telia. Of the stock, 39.5% (31 March 2020) is owned by the Swedish government, and the rest by institutions, companies, and private investors worldwide. The Finnish government (through Solidium) divested from Telia Company in February 2018 when it sold its remaining 3.2% stake. =Telia= The Swedish Kungl. Telegrafverket (literally: Royal Telegraph Agency) was founded in 1853, when the first electric telegraph line was established between Stockholm and Uppsala. Allm√§nna Telefon found an equipment supplier in Lars Magnus Ericsson. In this early competition, Telegrafverket with its brand Rikstelefon was a latecomer. However, by securing a national monopoly on long-distance telephone lines, it was able with time to control and take over the local networks of quickly growing private telephone companies. A de facto telephone monopoly position was reached around 1920, and never needed legal sanction. In 1953 the name was modernised to Televerket. On 1 July 1992 this huge government agency's regulating functions was split off into the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (, PTS), with similar functions as the Federal Communications Commission of the United States. The operation of the state radio and TV broadcast network was spun off into a company named Teracom. On 1 July 1993 the remaining telephone and mobile network operator was transformed into a government-owned shareholding company, named Telia AB. At the height of the dot-com bubble, on 13 June 2000, close to one-third of Telia's shares were introduced on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. In the 1980s, Televerket was a pioneering mobile network operator with the NMT system, followed in the 1990s by GSM. Private competition in analogue mobile phone systems had already broken the telephone monopoly, and the growing internet allowed more opportunities for competitors. The most important of Telia's Swedish competitors in these areas has been Tele2. When PTS awarded four licenses for the 3rd generation mobile networks in December 2000, Telia was not among the winners, but later established an agreement to build a 3G network jointly with Tele2 using Tele2's licence. SUNAB was founded as the jointly owned company that would in turn build, own and operate the joint 3G network. In December 2018, Telia in cooperation with Ericsson launched Sweden's first 5G network at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.KP Krishna, Previewtech. \\"Telia and Ericsson launch 5G Network in Sweden KTH Campus.\\" December 05, 2018. Retrieved December 06, 2018. =Sonera= The history of Sonera dates back to 1917, when Suomen Lenn√§tinlaitos (Finnish Telegraph Agency) was founded. In 1927, the telegraph agency was merged with the Finnish Post to form a new agency, Post and Telegraph Agency. This agency governed all long distance and international calls until 1994, when competitors were allowed to enter the Finnish market. In the same year, the Post and Telegraph Agency was divided to form two companies, Suomen Posti Oy (Finnish Post), and Telecom Finland Oy. Telecom Finland then changed its name to Sonera in 1998. =After the merger of Telia and Sonera= During the run up to the 2006 general election the Swedish liberal-conservative Alliance stated as one of its policy aims to reduce government ownership in commercial entities, and specifically to sell its stake in TeliaSonera. The Alliance went on to win the election and formed a coalition government. After the merger with Sonera, the Swedish State held 46% of the shares and with parliamentary approval the government sold down to 37.3%. Further divestment of TeliaSonera was however presented to the parliament only after the next election in 2010, when the Alliance lost its majority but stayed on as a minority administration. On 16 March 2011 the Alliance administration lost a parliamentary vote on sale of publicly owned commercial entities, including TeliaSonera, when a coalition of all opposition parties - the Left Party, Social Democratic Party, Green Party and Sweden Democrats - united against the Alliance.F√∂rs√§ljning av statliga bolag stoppas Sveriges Radio, 16 March 2011 In the beginning of 2008, TeliaSonera announced measures to save nearly 500 million Euros which would include 2900 redundancies: 2000 from Sweden and 900 from Finland. France T√©l√©com (now Orange S.A.) proposed a 33 billion Euro acquisition offer for TeliaSonera on 5 June 2008, which was promptly rejected by the company's board. On 20 July 2018, Telia Company announced the acquisition proposal of Bonnier Broadcasting Group from Bonnier Group for 9.2 billion SEK (roughly $1 billion), thus owning TV4 AB (commercial television broadcaster in Sweden), MTV Oy (commercial television broadcaster in Finland) and C More Entertainment (pan-Nordic operator of premium television channels). The European Commission approved the deal on 12 November 2019 with certain conditions, and the acquisition was completed on 2 December that year. Ahead of the completion of Bonnier Broadcasting deal, the Telia Company nomination committee proposed on 20 October 2019 that Marie Ehrling be succeeded by Lars- Johan Jarnheimer, the former CEO of Tele2 until 2008 and then-chair of Egmont Media, as the company's board chair. The proposal was approved on 26 November that year, following the extraordinary general meeting. Meanwhile, on 24 October, Telia Company appointed Allison Kirkby, the former CEO of Tele2 from 2015 until 2018 and then went on to become the president and CEO of TDC, as the company's new president and CEO. Kirkby assumed office on May 4, 2020. Telia Carrier (AS1299; formerly TeliaSonera International Carrier) is a tier 1 carrier. Operations Telia Company is the largest Nordic and Baltic fixed- voice, broadband, and mobile operator by revenue and customer base. It also owns a TV-media operation which includes TV4 in Sweden and MTV in Finland as well as C More. It operates the world's largest and fastest-growing wholesale IP backbone (AS1299). Telia mobile telephone business in Europe: (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden) Leader company. (Finland, Norway) 2nd company. (Denmark) 3rd company. =Denmark= In Denmark Telia Company operates a mobile operator (Telia), a mobile virtual network operator (Call Me), and a broadband supplier (Telia). The company started in 1995, the result of a merger between Telia Stofa and TeliaSonera. Telia Mobile is the third-largest operator and is in fierce competition with Telenor, which is number two in the market. Telia was the fourth operator to launch 3G services and is the only operator to have a nationwide EDGE network. Telia Broadband was relaunched in 2008 because of the need for TeliaSonera to offer both mobile and broadband in all of their home markets (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland). Telia Broadband was the first operator to launch digital TV with their broadband at no extra cost. Stofa is mainly a cable TV operator, but also supplies broadband via the cable TV network. =Estonia= Telia Company owns 100% of Eesti Telekom. Eesti Telekom is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the Baltic countries and the largest telecommunications company in Estonia. TeliaSonera and the Estonian government reached a deal over the sale of Eesti Telekom in September 2009. On 20 January 2016, Eesti Telekom switched its name to Telia Eesti. =Finland= A Telia Finland store in Tikkurila, Vantaa. Telia Finland is the second largest mobile operator in Finland and also one of the biggest providers of landline telephone and internet services. Before the rebranding on 23 March 2017, Telia was known in Finland under the brands of Sonera and Tele Finland. In September 1999, Sonera became the world's first mobile operator to launch mobile Internet services via Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). Since 2014, Telia Finland and DNA Oyj have jointly deployed a shared 4G LTE network using the 800 MHz (LTE Band 20) \\"digital dividend\\" band in remote Northern and Eastern Finland under the Suomen Yhteisverkko Oy joint venture. Telia Finland owns 51% of Suomen Yhteisverkko Oy. =Latvia= TeliaSonera owns 49% of LMT (24.5% as Telia Company AB and 24.5% as Sonera Holding B.V.). TeliaSonera also owns 49% of Lattelecom, which owns 23% of LMT, which owns Okarte, Amigo. It also owns 100% of Telia Latvija, a business cable operator and data centre operator. =Lithuania= Telia headquarters in Vilnius (skyscraper with the old Teo logo) TeliaSonera owns 88.15% of Telia Lietuva (Teo LT until 2017), the largest landline phone operator in Lithuania, which recently purchased Omnitel, one of largest mobile network operators there. It was previously owned by TeliaSonera group. In October 2015, TeliaSonera announced the merger of Teo and Omnitel, through the acquisition of Omnitel by Teo. On February 1, 2017, Omnitel and Teo merged under the name of \\"Telia Lietuva\\". =Norway= In Norway Telia first entered after the de- regulation in 1998 as a virtual supplier of fixed telephone and Internet services. This was sold to Enitel during the merger attempt with Telenor, but Telia re-entered in 2000 with the purchase of one of the two mobile network operators, NetCom. In 2006 it also bought the virtual mobile provider Chess Communication. 1 March 2016, NetCom was rebranded as Telia Norge. In July 2018, Telia acquired Get AS and TDC Norway for $2.6 billion. =Sweden= In Sweden, Telia Company operates under the consumer brands Telia and its lower- cost flanker brands Halebop and Fello. On the business side, Skanova Access and Cygate are also used. Telia Sverige is currently the largest mobile phone operator in Sweden, both in terms of revenue and customer base. Main competitors include Tele2, Telenor, 3, Com Hem and Boxer. Telia also owns TV4 Group which includes TV4 in Sweden and MTV in Finland and C More Entertainment after acquiring them in 2019. =Turkey= Telia Company is a minority owner (47%) of Turkcell Holding, which holds 51% in the listed leading mobile operator in Turkey. Turkcell owns 80% of BeST in Belarus and 100% of Lifecell in Ukraine. Former operations Telia has been selling off their shares in companies they own that isn't in their main region of business. =Afghanistan= In July 2020, Telia Company announced it has divested its 12.25% share in the Afghan Roshan (telco) cellphone network. =Azerbaijan= On 15 May 2010, after Azercell went through rebranding, it joined the network of TeliaSonera. On 5 March 2018, Telia confirmed they have sold their stake in Azercell. =Cambodia= TeliaSonera purchased a majority stake in Star-Cell in 2008 which was the number four player in the market at that time. By 2010 it exited Cambodia after a $100 million write down and collapse in subscriber numbers. It was subsequently taken over by a more dominant competitor Smart Mobile. =Georgia= From 2007 to 2018, Telia Company has owned 58.55% of the Geocell company, while Turkcell owns the remaining 41.45%. Since 2018 Silknet bought full part of Geocell. = Kazakhstan = Telia Company operated in Kazakhstan under the brand Kcell. From 21 December 2018, Kcell sold to Kazakhtelecom. =Nepal= TeliaSonera owned a majority stake in Ncell, the largest mobile operator in Nepal with US$16.2 billion operating income. On 21 December 2015, TeliaSonera announced its exit from Ncell, selling its 60.4 percent of the shares to Malaysian telecommunications group Axiata. TeliaSonera exited Nepal without settling billions of Capital Gains Tax owed to Nepalese government. = Russia = Telia Company owned 25.2% of MegaFon, the second largest mobile phone operator in Russia. In October 2017 Telia Company agreed to sell their entire MegaFon stake for US$1 billion. = Spain = Telia Company owned a 76.6% holding in the Spanish operator Yoigo until 21 June 2016 when it was sold to Masmovil. =Tajikistan= Telia Company owned 60% of mobile phone operator Tcell. Tcell is a merger of Somoncom and Indigo Tajikistan; the merger was completed in July 2012. On 27 April 2017, it was confirmed that Tcell has been sold. = Moldova = In February 2020 Telia Company has agreed to sell its 100% holding in Moldcell to CG Cell Technologies DAC, for a transaction price of US$31.5 million. = Uzbekistan= In five years, Ucell, the Uzbek subsidiary, increased the number of its subscribers from 400,000 to 9 million (2012). Some former TeliaSonera executives were under preliminary investigation by Swedish prosecutors for allegations of bribery and money laundering associated with the acquisition of their 3G license in Uzbekistan from Takilant Limited, registered in Gibraltar.[30] Under these investigations involving four Uzbek nationals, hundreds of millions of francs have been frozen in Swiss banks.[31] The former executives were acquitted in the first instance in the Swedish legal proceedings in February 2019, the verdict has been appealed. In September 2017 Telia Company announced that a global settlement had been reached with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Dutch Public Prosecution Service (Openbaar Ministerie, OM) relating to previously disclosed investigations regarding historical transactions in Uzbekistan.Telia Company agreed to a total financial sanction of USD 965 million The global resolution ended all known corruption related investigations or inquiries into Telia Company.  Evolution of the Telia brand  When Telia and Sonera merged in 2002, TeliaSonera used a simple wordmark as the logo. In 2011, TeliaSonera released its new purple pebble logo to the corporation and its affiliate brands. The pebble was designed by Landor Associates. In 2016, TeliaSonera changed name to Telia Company and presented an updated pebble brand profile, designed by Wolff Olins, to be used by all Telia brand companies.  Controversies  TeliaSonera has been accused of indirectly supporting dictatorships, allowing them to do man-in-the-middle attacks on their citizens. This was disclosed in the Swedish TV show Uppdrag Granskning in 2012. TeliaSonera responded to these allegations with: \\"This is happening every day in all countries and applies to all operators. We are obliged to comply with the legislation of each country.\\" Further allegations have been presented in Swedish media and elsewhere that TeliaSonera may have illegally, through bribery, acquired licenses in Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan. As a result of internal investigations on these and other potential violations to the company's policies, several senior managers were dismissed from the company. When TeliaSonera exited Nepal there were voices raised in the public debate in Nepal that it had evaded approximately 36 billions of Nepalese Rupees Capital Gains Tax owed to Nepalese government, when it sold its stake to Axiata, a Malaysian Telecom Group, A claim which has been refuted by Telia Company on several occasions.https://www.teliacompany.com/en/news/news- articles/2018/nepalese-note In that context, Telia was criticized by media (TV) even in Sweden where its headquarter is located. Also, a group of Nepalese people started a movement 'No Tax.. No Ncell' to boycott services of Ncell in Nepal.

Thus flag semaphore is a method of telegraphy, whereas pigeon post is not. Ancient signalling systems, although sometimes quite extensive and sophisticated as in China, were generally not capable of transmitting arbitrary text messages. Possible messages were fixed and predetermined and such systems are thus not true telegraphs. The earliest true telegraph put into widespread use was the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe, invented in the late 18th century. The system was extensively used in France, and European countries controlled by France, during the Napoleonic era. The electric telegraph started to replace the optical telegraph in the mid-19th century. It was first taken up in Britain in the form of the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, initially used mostly as an aid to railway signalling. This was quickly followed by a different system developed in the United States by Samuel Morse. The electric telegraph was slower to develop in France due to the established optical telegraph system, but an electrical telegraph was put into use with a code compatible with the Chappe optical telegraph. The Morse system was adopted as the international standard in 1865, using a modified Morse code developed in Germany. The heliograph is a telegraph system using reflected sunlight for signalling. It was mainly used in areas where the electrical telegraph had not been established and generally uses the same code. The most extensive heliograph network established was in Arizona and New Mexico during the Apache Wars. The heliograph was standard military equipment as late as World War II. Wireless telegraphy developed in the early 20th century. Wireless telegraphy became important for maritime use, and was a competitor to electrical telegraphy using submarine telegraph cables in international communications. Telegrams became a popular means of sending messages once telegraph prices had fallen sufficiently. Traffic became high enough to spur the development of automated systems‚Äîteleprinters and punched tape transmission. These systems led to new telegraph codes, starting with the Baudot code. However, telegrams were never able to compete with the letter post on price, and competition from the telephone, which removed their speed advantage, drove the telegraph into decline from 1920 onwards. The few remaining telegraph applications were largely taken over by alternatives on the internet towards the end of the 20th century. Terminology The word \\"telegraph\\" (from Ancient Greek: œÑ·øÜŒªŒµ, t√™le, \\"at a distance\\" and Œ≥œÅŒ¨œÜŒµŒπŒΩ, gr√°phein, \\"to write\\") was first coined by the French inventor of the Semaphore telegraph, Claude Chappe, who also coined the word \\"semaphore\\".Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions & Discoveries of the 18th Century, Jonathan Shectman, p172 A \\"telegraph\\" is a device for transmitting and receiving messages over long distances, i.e., for telegraphy. The word \\"telegraph\\" alone now generally refers to an electrical telegraph. Wireless telegraphy is transmission of messages over radio with telegraphic codes. Contrary to the extensive definition used by Chappe, Morse argued that the term telegraph can strictly be applied only to systems that transmit and record messages at a distance. This is to be distinguished from semaphore, which merely transmits messages. Smoke signals, for instance, are to be considered semaphore, not telegraph. According to Morse, telegraph dates only from 1832 when Pavel Schilling invented one of the earliest electrical telegraphs.Samuel F. B. Morse, Examination of the Telegraphic Apparatus and the Processes in Telegraphy, pages 7‚Äì8, Philp & Solomons 1869 . A telegraph message sent by an electrical telegraph operator or telegrapher using Morse code (or a printing telegraph operator using plain text) was known as a telegram. A cablegram was a message sent by a submarine telegraph cable, often shortened to a cable or a wire. Later, a Telex was a message sent by a Telex network, a switched network of teleprinters similar to a telephone network. A wirephoto or wire picture was a newspaper picture that was sent from a remote location by a facsimile telegraph. A diplomatic telegram, also known as a diplomatic cable, is the term given to a confidential communication between a diplomatic mission and the foreign ministry of its parent country.Definition of \\"cable\\", These continue to be called telegrams or cables regardless of the method used for transmission. Early signalling Great Wall of China Passing messages by signalling over distance is an ancient practice. One of the oldest examples is the signal towers of the Great Wall of China. In , signals could be sent by beacon fires or drum beats. By complex flag signalling had developed, and by the Han dynasty (200 BC‚Äì220 AD) signallers had a choice of lights, flags, or gunshots to send signals. By the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) a message could be sent in 24 hours. The Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) added artillery to the possible signals. While the signalling was complex (for instance, different-coloured flags could be used to indicate enemy strength), only predetermined messages could be sent.Christopher H. Sterling, \\"Great Wall of China\\", pp. 197-198 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century, ABC-CLIO, 2008 . The Chinese signalling system extended well beyond the Great Wall. Signal towers away from the wall were used to give early warning of an attack. Others were built even further out as part of the protection of trade routes, especially the Silk Road.Morris Rossabi, From Yuan to Modern China and Mongolia, p. 203, Brill, 2014 . Signal fires were widely used in Europe and elsewhere for military purposes. The Roman army made frequent use of them, as did their enemies, and the remains of some of the stations still exist. Few details have been recorded of European/Mediterranean signalling systems and the possible messages. One of the few for which details are known is a system invented by Aeneas Tacticus (4th century BC). Tacticus's system had water filled pots at the two signal stations which were drained in synchronisation. Annotation on a floating scale indicated which message was being sent or received. Signals sent by means of torches indicated when to start and stop draining to keep the synchronisation.David L. Woods, \\"Ancient signals\\", pp. 24-25 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century, ABC-CLIO, 2008 . None of the signalling systems discussed above are true telegraphs in the sense of a system that can transmit arbitrary messages over arbitrary distances. Lines of signalling relay stations can send messages to any required distance, but all these systems are limited to one extent or another in the range of messages that they can send. A system like flag semaphore, with an alphabetic code, can certainly send any given message, but the system is designed for short-range communication between two persons. An engine order telegraph, used to send instructions from the bridge of a ship to the engine room, fails to meet both criteria; it has a limited distance and very simple message set. There was only one ancient signalling system described that does meet these criteria. That was a system using the Polybius square to encode an alphabet. Polybius (2nd century BC) suggested using two successive groups of torches to identify the coordinates of the letter of the alphabet being transmitted. The number of said torches held up signalled the grid square that contained the letter. There is no definite record of the system ever being used, but there are several passages in ancient texts that some think are suggestive. Holzmann and Pehrson, for instance, suggest that Livy is describing its use by Philip V of Macedon in 207 BC during the First Macedonian War. Nothing else that could be described as a true telegraph existed until the 17th century. Possibly the first alphabetic telegraph code in the modern era is due to Franz Kessler who published his work in 1616. Kessler used a lamp placed inside a barrel with a moveable shutter operated by the signaller. The signals were observed at a distance with the newly-invented telescope. Drum telegraph In several places around the world, a system of passing messages from village to village using drum beats was developed. This was particularly highly developed in Africa. At the time of its discovery in Africa, the speed of message transmission was faster than any existing European system using optical telegraphs. The African drum system was not alphabetical. Rather, the drum beats followed the tones of the language. This made messages highly ambiguous and context was important for their correct interpretation.James Gleick, \\"Drums that talk\\", ch. 1 in, The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood, Fourth Estate, 2011 Optical telegraph semaphore) tower, c. 1835 Demonstration of the semaphore An optical telegraph is a telegraph consisting of a line of stations in towers or natural high points which signal to each other by means of shutters or paddles. Signalling by means of indicator pointers was called semaphore. Early proposals for an optical telegraph system were made to the Royal Society by Robert Hooke in 1684 and were first implemented on an experimental level by Sir Richard Lovell Edgeworth in 1767. The first successful optical telegraph network was invented by Claude Chappe and operated in France from 1793. The two most extensive systems were Chappe's in France, with branches into neighbouring countries, and the system of Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz in Sweden.Gerard J. Holzmann; Bj√∂rn Pehrson, The Early History of Data Networks, IEEE Computer Society Press, 1995 . During 1790‚Äì1795, at the height of the French Revolution, France needed a swift and reliable communication system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies. In 1790, the Chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time. On 2 March 1791, at 11 am, they sent the message \\"si vous r√©ussissez, vous serez bient√¥t couverts de gloire\\" (If you succeed, you will soon bask in glory) between Brulon and Parce, a distance of . The first means used a combination of black and white panels, clocks, telescopes, and codebooks to send their message. In 1792, Claude was appointed Ing√©nieur-T√©l√©graphiste and charged with establishing a line of stations between Paris and Lille, a distance of . It was used to carry dispatches for the war between France and Austria. In 1794, it brought news of a French capture of Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred.How Napoleon's semaphore telegraph changed the world, BBC News, Hugh Schofield, 16 June 2013 A decision to replace the system with an electric telegraph was made in 1846, but it took a decade before it was fully taken out of service. The fall of Sebastopol was reported by Chappe telegraph in 1855. The Prussian system was put into effect in the 1830s. However, they were highly dependent on good weather and daylight to work and even then could accommodate only about two words per minute. The last commercial semaphore link ceased operation in Sweden in 1880. As of 1895, France still operated coastal commercial semaphore telegraph stations, for ship-to-shore communication.\\"A Semaphore Telegraph Station\\", Scientific American Supplement, 20 April 1895, page 16087. Electrical telegraph Cooke and Wheatstone's five-needle, six-wire telegraph (1837) The early ideas for an electric telegraph included in 1753 using electrostatic deflections of pith balls,E. A. Marland, Early Electrical Communication, Abelard-Schuman Ltd, London 1964, no ISBN, Library of Congress 64-20875, pages 17‚Äì19; proposals for electrochemical bubbles in acid by Campillo in 1804 and von S√∂mmering in 1809.Jones, R.

Attributed to \\"Semaphore to Satellite\\", International Telecommunication Union, Geneva 1965. The first experimental system over a substantial distance was electrostatic by Ronalds in 1816. Ronalds offered his invention to the British Admiralty, but it was rejected as unnecessary, the existing optical telegraph connecting the Admiralty in London to their main fleet base in Portsmouth being deemed adequate for their purposes. As late as 1844, after the electrical telegraph had come into use, the Admiralty's optical telegraph was still used, although it was accepted that poor weather ruled it out on many days of the year. France had an extensive optical telegraph dating from Napoleonic times and was even slower to take up electrical systems.Jay Clayton, \\"The voice in the machine\\", ch. 8 in, Jeffrey Masten, Peter Stallybrass, Nancy J. Vickers (eds), Language Machines: Technologies of Literary and Cultural Production, Routledge, 2016 . Eventually, electrostatic telegraphs were abandoned in favour of electromagnetic systems. An early experimental system (Schilling, 1832) led to a proposal to establish a telegraph between St Petersburg and Kronstadt, but it was never completed. The first operative electric telegraph (Gauss and Weber, 1833) connected G√∂ttingen Observatory to the Institute of Physics about 1 km away during experimental investigations of the geomagnetic field.R. W. Pohl, Einf√ºhrung in die Physik, Vol. 3, G√∂ttingen (Springer) 1924 The first commercial telegraph was by Cooke and Wheatstone following their English patent of 10 June 1837. It was demonstrated on the London and Birmingham Railway in July of the same year. In July 1839, a five-needle, five-wire system was installed to provide signalling over a record distance of 21 km on a section of the Great Western Railway between London Paddington station and West Drayton.Anton A. Huurdeman, The Worldwide History of Telecommunications (2003) p. 67-69 However, in trying to get railway companies to take up his telegraph more widely for railway signalling, Cooke was rejected several times in favour of the more familiar, but shorter range, steam-powered pneumatic signalling. Even when his telegraph was taken up, it was considered experimental and the company backed out of a plan to finance extending the telegraph line out to Slough. However, this led to a breakthrough for the electric telegraph, as up to this point the Great Western had insisted on exclusive use and refused Cooke permission to open public telegraph offices. Cooke extended the line at his own expense and agreed that the railway could have free use of it in exchange for the right to open it up to the public. Morse key (c. 1900) Most of the early electrical systems required multiple wires (Ronalds' system was an exception), but the system developed in the United States by Morse and Vail was a single-wire system. This was the system that first used the soon-to-become-ubiquitous Morse code. By 1844, the Morse system connected Baltimore to Washington, and by 1861 the west coast of the continent was connected to the east coast. The Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph, in a series of improvements, also ended up with a one-wire system, but still using their own code and needle displays. The electric telegraph quickly became a means of more general communication. The Morse system was officially adopted as the standard for continental European telegraphy in 1851 with a revised code, which later became the basis of International Morse Code.Lewis Coe, The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and Its Predecessors in the United States, McFarland, p. 69, 2003 . However, Great Britain and the British Empire continued to use the Cooke and Wheatstone system, in some places as late as the 1930s. Likewise, the United States continued to use American Morse code internally, requiring translation operators skilled in both codes for international messages. Railway telegraphy An early Cooke and Wheatstone double-needle railway telegraph instrument at the National Railway Museum A block signalling instrument as used in Britain in the 20th century Railway signal telegraphy was developed in Britain from the 1840s onward. It was used to manage railway traffic and to prevent accidents as part of the railway signalling system. On 12 June 1837 Cooke and Wheatstone were awarded a patent for an electric telegraph. This was demonstrated between Euston railway station‚Äîwhere Wheatstone was located‚Äîand the engine house at Camden Town‚Äîwhere Cooke was stationed, together with Robert Stephenson, the London and Birmingham Railway line's chief engineer. The messages were for the operation of the rope-haulage system for pulling trains up the 1 in 77 bank. The world's first permanent railway telegraph was completed in July 1839 between London Paddington and West Drayton on the Great Western Railway with an electric telegraph using a four-needle system. The concept of a signalling \\"block\\" system was proposed by Cooke in 1842. Railway signal telegraphy did not change in essence from Cooke's initial concept for more than a century. In this system each line of railway was divided into sections or blocks of several miles length. Entry to and exit from the block was to be authorised by electric telegraph and signalled by the line-side semaphore signals, so that only a single train could occupy the rails. In Cooke's original system, a single-needle telegraph was adapted to indicate just two messages: \\"Line Clear\\" and \\"Line Blocked\\". The signaller would adjust his line-side signals accordingly. As first implemented in 1844 each station had as many needles as there were stations on the line, giving a complete picture of the traffic. As lines expanded, a sequence of pairs of single-needle instruments were adopted, one pair for each block in each direction. Wigwag Wigwag is a form of flag signalling using a single flag. Unlike most forms of flag signalling, which are used over relatively short distances, wigwag is designed to maximise the distance covered‚Äîup to in some cases. Wigwag achieved this by using a large flag‚Äîa single flag can be held with both hands unlike flag semaphore which has a flag in each hand‚Äîand using motions rather than positions as its symbols since motions are more easily seen. It was invented by US Army surgeon Albert J. Myer in the 1850s who later became the first head of the Signal Corps. Wigwag was used extensively during the American Civil War where it filled a gap left by the electrical telegraph. Although the electrical telegraph had been in use for more than a decade, the network did not yet reach everywhere and portable, ruggedized equipment suitable for military use was not immediately available. Permanent or semi-permanent stations were established during the war, some of them towers of enormous height and the system for a while could be described as a communications network.Rebecca Raines, Getting the Message Through, US Government Printing Office, 1996 .Albert J. Myer, A Manual of Signals, D. Van Nostrand, 1866, . Heliograph Western Desert in November 1940 US Forest Service lookout using a Colomb shutter type heliograph in 1912 at the end of a telephone line A heliograph is a telegraph that transmits messages by flashing sunlight with a mirror, usually using Morse code. The idea for a telegraph of this type was first proposed as a modification of surveying equipment (Gauss, 1821). Various uses of mirrors were made for communication in the following years, mostly for military purposes, but the first device to become widely used was a heliograph with a moveable mirror (Mance, 1869). The system was used by the French during the 1870‚Äì71 siege of Paris, with night-time signalling using kerosene lamps as the source of light. An improved version (Begbie, 1870) was used by British military in many colonial wars, including the Anglo-Zulu War (1879). At some point, a morse key was added to the apparatus to give the operator the same degree of control as in the electric telegraph.David L. Woods, \\"Heliograph and mirrors\\", pp. 208-211 in, Christopher H. Sterling (ed), Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century, ABC-CLIO, 2008 . Another type of heliograph was the heliostat fitted with a Colomb shutter. The heliostat was essentially a surveying instrument with a fixed mirror and so could not transmit a code by itself. The term heliostat is sometimes used as a synonym for heliograph because of this origin. The Colomb shutter (Bolton and Colomb, 1862) was originally invented to enable the transmission of morse code by signal lamp between Royal Navy ships at sea. The heliograph was heavily used by Nelson A. Miles in Arizona and New Mexico after he took over command (1886) of the fight against Geronimo and other Apache bands in the Apache Wars. Miles had previously set up the first heliograph line in the US between Fort Keogh and Fort Custer in Montana. He used the heliograph to fill in vast, thinly populated areas that were not covered by the electric telegraph. Twenty-six stations covered an area . In a test of the system, a message was relayed in four hours. Miles' enemies used smoke signals and flashes of sunlight from metal, but lacked a sophisticated telegraph code.Nelson A. Miles, Personal Recollections and Observations of General Nelson A. Miles, vol. 2, pp. 481-484, University of Nebraska Press, 1992 . The heliograph was ideal for use in the American Southwest due to its clear air and mountainous terrain on which stations could be located. It was found necessary to lengthen the morse dash (which is much shorter in American Morse code than in the modern International Morse code) to aid differentiating from the morse dot. Use of the heliograph declined from 1915 onwards, but remained in service in Britain and British Commonwealth countries for some time. Australian forces used the heliograph as late as 1942 in the Western Desert Campaign of World War II. Some form of heliograph was used by the mujahideen in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War (1979-1989). Teleprinter A Baudot keyboard, 1884 A Creed Model 7 teleprinter, 1931 A teleprinter is a telegraph machine that can send messages from a typewriter-like keyboard and print incoming messages in readable text with no need for the operators to be trained in the telegraph code used on the line. It developed from various earlier printing telegraphs and resulted in improved transmission speeds. The Morse telegraph (1837) was originally conceived as a system marking indentations on paper tape. A chemical telegraph making blue marks improved the speed of recording (Bain, 1846), but was retarded by a patent challenge from Morse. The first true printing telegraph (that is printing in plain text) used a spinning wheel of types in the manner of a daisy wheel printer (House, 1846, improved by Hughes, 1855). The system was adopted by Western Union. Early teleprinters used the Baudot code, a five-bit sequential binary code. This was a telegraph code developed for use on the French telegraph using a five-key keyboard (Baudot, 1874). Teleprinters generated the same code from a full alphanumeric keyboard. A feature of the Baudot code, and subsequent telegraph codes, was that, unlike Morse code, every character has a code of the same length making it more machine friendly. The Baudot code was used on the earliest ticker tape machines (Calahan, 1867), a system for mass distributing stock price information.Richard E. Smith, Elementary Information Security, p. 433, Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2015 . Automated punched-tape transmission Creed paper tape reader at The National Museum of Computing In a punched-tape system, the message is first typed onto punched tape using the code of the telegraph system‚ÄîMorse code for instance. It is then, either immediately or at some later time, run through a transmission machine which sends the message to the telegraph network. Multiple messages can be sequentially recorded on the same run of tape. The advantage of doing this is that messages can be sent at a steady, fast rate making maximum use of the available telegraph lines. The economic advantage of doing this is greatest on long, busy routes where the cost of the extra step of preparing the tape is outweighed by the cost of providing more telegraph lines. The first machine to use punched tape was Bain's teleprinter (Bain, 1843), but the system saw only limited use. Later versions of Bain's system achieved speeds up to 1000 words per minute, far faster than a human operator could achieve.Anton A. Huurdeman, The Worldwide History of Telecommunications, p. 72, Wiley, 2003 . The first widely used system (Wheatstone, 1858) was first put into service with the British General Post Office in 1867. A novel feature of the Wheatstone system was the use of bipolar encoding. That is, both positive and negative polarity voltages were used.Ken Beauchamp, History of Technology, p. 87, Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2001 . Bipolar encoding has several advantages, one of which is that it permits duplex communication. Lewis Coe, The Telegraph: A History of Morse's Invention and Its Predecessors in the United States, pp. 16-17, McFarland, 2003 . The Wheatstone tape reader was capable of a speed of 400 words per minute.Tom Standage, The Victorian Internet, Berkley, 1999 . Oceanic telegraph cables The first message is received by the Submarine Telegraph Company in London from Paris on the Foy-Breguet instrument in 1851. The equipment in the background is a Cooke and Wheatstone set for onward transmission. The Eastern Telegraph Company network in 1901 A worldwide communication network meant that telegraph cables would have to be laid across oceans. On land cables could be run uninsulated suspended from poles. Underwater, a good insulator that was both flexible and capable of resisting the ingress of seawater was required, and at first this was not available. A solution presented itself with gutta-percha, a natural rubber from the Palaquium gutta tree, after William Montgomerie sent samples to London from Singapore in 1843. The new material was tested by Michael Faraday and in 1845 Wheatstone suggested that it should be used on the cable planned between Dover and Calais by John Watkins Brett. The idea was proved viable when the South Eastern Railway company successfully tested a gutta-percha insulated cable with telegraph messages to a ship off the coast of Folkstone. The cable to France was laid in 1850 but was almost immediately severed by a French fishing vessel.Solymar, Laszlo. The Effect of the Telegraph on Law and Order, War, Diplomacy, and Power Politics in Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, 2000. Accessed 1 August 2014. It was relaid the next year and connections to Ireland and the Low Countries soon followed. Getting a cable across the Atlantic Ocean proved much more difficult. The Atlantic Telegraph Company, formed in London in 1856, had several failed attempts. A cable laid in 1858 worked poorly for a few days (sometimes taking all day to send a message despite the use of the highly sensitive mirror galvanometer developed by William Thomson (the future Lord Kelvin) before being destroyed by applying too high a voltage. Its failure and slow speed of transmission prompted Thomson and Oliver Heaviside to find better mathematical descriptions of long transmission lines. The company finally succeeded in 1866 with an improved cable laid by SS Great Eastern, the largest ship of its day, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.Wilson, Arthur (1994). The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization. p. 203. Woodhead Publishing. . An overland telegraph from Britain to India was first connected in 1866 but was unreliable so a submarine telegraph cable was connected in 1870. Several telegraph companies were combined to form the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1872. Australia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin.Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter: \\"A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet\\", p110. Polity, Cambridge, 2005. From the 1850s until well into the 20th century, British submarine cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the All Red Line. In 1896, there were thirty cable-laying ships in the world and twenty-four of them were owned by British companies. In 1892, British companies owned and operated two-thirds of the world's cables and by 1923, their share was still 42.7 percent.Headrick, D.R., & Griset, P. (2001). Submarine telegraph cables: business and politics, 1838‚Äì1939. The Business History Review, 75(3), 543‚Äì578. During World War I, Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide. Facsimile Alexander Bain's facsimile machine, 1850 In 1843, Scottish inventor Alexander Bain invented a device that could be considered the first facsimile machine. He called his invention a \\"recording telegraph\\". Bain's telegraph was able to transmit images by electrical wires. Frederick Bakewell made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine. In 1855, an Italian abbot, Giovanni Caselli, also created an electric telegraph that could transmit images. Caselli called his invention \\"Pantelegraph\\". Pantelegraph was successfully tested and approved for a telegraph line between Paris and Lyon. In 1881, English inventor Shelford Bidwell constructed the scanning phototelegraph that was the first telefax machine to scan any two-dimensional original, not requiring manual plotting or drawing. Around 1900, German physicist Arthur Korn invented the Bildtelegraph widespread in continental Europe especially since a widely noticed transmission of a wanted-person photograph from Paris to London in 1908 used until the wider distribution of the radiofax. Its main competitors were the B√©linographe by √âdouard Belin first, then since the 1930s, the Hellschreiber, invented in 1929 by German inventor Rudolf Hell, a pioneer in mechanical image scanning and transmission. Wireless telegraphy St. John's, Newfoundland, December 1901 Marconi's equipment on Flat Holm, May 1897 The late 1880s through to the 1890s saw the discovery and then development of a newly understood phenomenon into a form of wireless telegraphy, called Hertzian wave wireless telegraphy, radiotelegraphy, or (later) simply \\"radio\\". Between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published the results of his experiments where he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 theory of electromagnetic radiation. Many scientists and inventors experimented with this new phenomenon but the general consensus was that these new waves (similar to light) would be just as short range as light, and, therefore, useless for long range communication.view was held by Nikola Tesla, Oliver Lodge, Alexander Stepanovich Popov, amongst others (also Brian Regal, Radio: The Life Story of a Technology, page 22) At the end of 1894, the young Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began working on the idea of building a commercial wireless telegraphy system based on the use of Hertzian waves (radio waves), a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing. Building on the ideas of previous scientists and inventors Marconi re-engineered their apparatus by trial and error attempting to build a radio-based wireless telegraphic system that would function the same as wired telegraphy. He would work on the system through 1895 in his lab and then in field tests making improvements to extend its range. After many breakthroughs, including applying the wired telegraphy concept of grounding the transmitter and receiver, Marconi was able, by early 1896, to transmit radio far beyond the short ranges that had been predicted.Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press - 2001, page 21 Having failed to interest the Italian government, the 22-year-old inventor brought his telegraphy system to Britain in 1896 and met William Preece, a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field and Chief Engineer of the General Post Office. A series of demonstrations for the British government followed‚Äîby March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about across Salisbury Plain. On 13 May 1897, Marconi, assisted by George Kemp, a Cardiff Post Office engineer, transmitted the first wireless signals over water to Lavernock (near Penarth in Wales) from Flat Holm. The message sent was \\"ARE YOU READY\\". From his Fraserburgh base, he transmitted the first long-distance, cross-country wireless signal to Poldhu in Cornwall. His star rising, he was soon sending signals across The English channel (1899), from shore to ship (1899) and finally across the Atlantic (1901). A study of these demonstrations of radio, with scientists trying to work out how a phenomenon predicted to have a short range could transmit \\"over the horizon\\", led to the discovery of a radio reflecting layer in the Earth's atmosphere in 1902, later called the ionosphere. Radiotelegraphy proved effective for rescue work in sea disasters by enabling effective communication between ships and from ship to shore. In 1904, Marconi began the first commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907.Second Test of the Marconi Over-Ocean Wireless System Proved Entirely Successful. Sydney Daily Post. 24 October 1907. Notably, Marconi's apparatus was used to help rescue efforts after the sinking of Titanic. Britain's postmaster-general summed up, referring to the Titanic disaster, \\"Those who have been saved, have been saved through one man, Mr. Marconi...and his marvellous invention.\\"  Telegram services  Western Union telegram (1930) A telegram service is a company or public entity that delivers telegraphed messages directly to the recipient. Telegram services were not inaugurated until electric telegraphy became available. Earlier optical systems were largely limited to official government and military purposes. Historically, telegrams were sent between a network of interconnected telegraph offices. A person visiting a local telegraph office paid by the word to have a message telegraphed to another office and delivered to the addressee on a paper form. Messages sent by telegraph could be delivered faster than mail, and even in the telephone age, the telegram remained popular for social and business correspondence. At their peak in 1929, an estimated 200 million telegrams were sent. Telegram services still operate in much of the world (see worldwide use of telegrams by country), but e-mail and text messaging have rendered telegrams obsolete in many countries, and the number of telegrams sent annually has been declining rapidly since the 1980s.Tom Standage, The Victorian Internet, Afterword, Walker & Company, 2007 . Where telegram services still exist, the transmission method between offices is no longer by telegraph, but by telex or IP link. =Telegram length= As telegrams have been traditionally charged by the word, messages were often abbreviated to pack information into the smallest possible number of words, in what came to be called \\"telegram style\\". The average length of a telegram in the 1900s in the US was 11.93 words; more than half of the messages were 10 words or fewer. According to another study, the mean length of the telegrams sent in the UK before 1950 was 14.6 words or 78.8 characters. For German telegrams, the mean length is 11.5 words or 72.4 characters. At the end of the 19th century, the average length of a German telegram was calculated as 14.2 words. Telex Teletype 32 terminal with telex dial-up facility Telex (TELegraph EXchange) was a public switched network of teleprinters. It used rotary-telephone-style pulse dialling for automatic routing through the network. It initially used the Baudot code for messages. Telex development began in Germany in 1926, becoming an operational service in 1933 run by the Reichspost (Reich postal service). It had a speed of 50 baud‚Äîapproximately 66 words per minute. Up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using voice frequency telegraphy multiplexing, making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication. Telex was introduced into Canada in July 1957, and the United States in 1958.Phillip R. Easterlin, \\"Telex in New York\\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45 A new code, ASCII, was introduced in 1963 by the American Standards Association. ASCII was a 7-bit code and could thus support a larger number of characters than Baudot. In particular, ASCII supported upper and lower case whereas Baudot was upper case only. Decline Telegraph use began to permanently decline around 1920.Jeffrey L. Kieve, The Electric Telegraph: A Social and Economic History, David and Charles, 1973 The decline began with the growth of the use of the telephone. Ironically, the invention of the telephone grew out of the development of the harmonic telegraph, a device which was supposed to increase the efficiency of telegraph transmission and improve the profits of telegraph companies. Western Union gave up their patent battle with Alexander Graham Bell because they believed the telephone was not a threat to their telegraph business. The Bell Telephone Company was formed in 1877 and had 230 subscribers which grew to 30,000 by 1880. By 1886 there were a quarter of a million phones worldwide, and nearly 2 million by 1900. The decline was briefly postponed by the rise of special occasion congratulatory telegrams. Traffic continued to grow between 1867 and 1893 despite the introduction of the telephone in this period, but by 1900 the telegraph was definitely in decline. There was a brief resurgence in telegraphy during World War I but the decline continued as the world entered the Great Depression years of the 1930s. Telegraph lines continued to be an important means of distributing news feeds from news agencies by teleprinter machine until the rise of the internet in the 1990s. For Western Union, one service remained highly profitable‚Äîthe wire transfer of money. This service kept Western Union in business long after the telegraph had ceased to be important. Social implications Optical telegraph lines were installed by governments, often for a military purpose, and reserved for official use only. In many countries, this situation continued after the introduction of the electric telegraph. Starting in Germany and the UK, electric telegraph lines were installed by railway companies. Railway use quickly led to private telegraph companies in the UK and the US offering a telegraph service to the public using telegraph along railway lines. The availability of this new form of communication brought on widespread social and economic changes. The electric telegraph freed communication from the time constraints of postal mail and revolutionized the global economy and society.Downey, Gregory J. (2002) Telegraph Messenger Boys: Labor, Technology, and Geography, 1850‚Äì1950, Routledge, New York and London, p. 7Economic History Encyclopedia (2010) \\"History of the U.S. Telegraph Industry\\", By the end of the 19th century, the telegraph was becoming an increasingly common medium of communication for ordinary people. The telegraph isolated the message (information) from the physical movement of objects or the process.Carey, James (1989). Communication as Culture, Routledge, New York and London, p. 210 There was some fear of the new technology. According to author Allan J. Kimmel, some people \\"feared that the telegraph would erode the quality of public discourse through the transmission of irrelevant, context- free information.\\" Henry David Thoreau thought of the Transatlantic cable \\"...perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\\" Kimmel says these fears anticipate many of the characteristics of the modern internet age.Allan J. Kimmel, People and Products: Consumer Behavior and Product Design, pp. 53-54, Routledge, 2015 . Initially, the telegraph was expensive, but it had an enormous effect on three industries: finance, newspapers, and railways. Telegraphy facilitated the growth of organizations \\"in the railroads, consolidated financial and commodity markets, and reduced information costs within and between firms\\". In the US, there were 200 to 300 stock exchanges before the telegraph, but most of these were unnecessary and unprofitable once the telegraph made financial transactions at a distance easy and drove down transaction costs. This immense growth in the business sectors influenced society to embrace the use of telegrams once the cost had fallen. Worldwide telegraphy changed the gathering of information for news reporting. Journalists were using the telegraph for war reporting as early as 1846 when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out. News agencies were formed, such as the Associated Press, for the purpose of reporting news by telegraph. Messages and information would now travel far and wide, and the telegraph demanded a language \\"stripped of the local, the regional; and colloquial\\", to better facilitate a worldwide media language. Media language had to be standardized, which led to the gradual disappearance of different forms of speech and styles of journalism and storytelling. The spread of the railways created a need for an accurate standard time to replace local arbitrary standards based on local noon. The means of achieving this synchronisation was the telegraph. This emphasis on precise time has led to major societal changes such as the concept of the time value of money. The shortage of men to work as telegraph operators in the American Civil War opened up the opportunity for women of a well-paid skilled job. The economic impact of the telegraph was not much studied by economic historians until parallels started to be drawn with the rise of the internet. In fact, the electric telegraph was as important as the invention of printing in this respect. According to economist Ronnie J. Phillips, the reason for this may be that institutional economists paid more attention to advances that required greater capital investment. The investment required to build railways, for instance, is orders of magnitude greater than that for the telegraph.Ronnie J. Phillips, \\"Digital technology and institutional change from the gilded age to modern times: The impact of the telegraph and the internet\\", Journal of Economic Issues, vol. 34, iss. 2, pp. 267-289, June 2000. Popular culture The optical telegraph was quickly forgotten once it went out of service. While it was in operation, it was very familiar to the public across Europe. Examples appear in many paintings of the period. Poems include Le Tel√©graphe, by Victor Hugo, and the collection Telegrafen: Optisk kalender f√∂r 1858 by Sehlstedt, Elias, Telegrafen: Optisk Kalender f√∂r 1858, Tryckt Hos Joh Beckman, 1857 . is dedicated to the telegraph. In novels, the telegraph is a major component in Lucien Leuwen by Stendhal, and it features in The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas. Joseph Chudy's 1796 opera, Der Telegraph oder die Fernschreibmaschine, was written to publicise Chudy's telegraph (a binary code with five lamps) when it became clear that Chappe's design was being taken up. An illustration declaring that the submarine cable between England and France would bring those countries peace and goodwill Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem in praise of submarine telegraph cables; \\"And a new Word runs between: whispering, 'Let us be one!'\\"Jonathan Reed Winkler, Nexus: Strategic Communications and American Security in World War I, p. 1, Harvard University Press, 2009 . Kipling's poem represented a widespread idea in the late nineteenth century that international telegraphy (and new technology in general)Armand Mattelart, Networking the World, 1794-2000, p. 19. University of Minnesota Press, 2000 . would bring peace and mutual understanding to the world.John A. Britton, Cables, Crises, and the Press: The Geopolitics of the New Information System in the Americas, 1866-1903, p. xi, University of New Mexico Press, 2013 When a submarine telegraph cable first connected America and Britain, the Post declared; =Newspaper names= Numerous newspapers and news outlets in various countries, such as The Daily Telegraph in Britain, The Telegraph in India, De Telegraaf in the Netherlands, and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in the US, were given names which include the word \\"telegraph\\" due to their having received news by means of electric telegraphy. Some of these names are retained even though different means of news acquisition are now used.

It has been described as \\"a fusion of hip hop and electronica until neither genre is recognizable\\", and may incorporate a variety of styles, including funk, dub, soul, psychedelia, R&B;, and house, as well as other forms of electronic music. Trip hop can be highly experimental. Deriving from later idioms of acid house, the term was first used by the British music media to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat emerging from the Bristol Sound scene in the early 1990s, which contained influences of soul, funk, and jazz. It was pioneered by acts like Massive Attack, Tricky, and Portishead.When Bristol music went 'Out of the Comfort Zone', Epigram, 20 April 2019 https://epigram.org.uk/2019/04/20/feature-when-bristol-music-went- out-of-the-comfort-zone/ Trip hop achieved commercial success in the 1990s, and has been described as \\"Europe's alternative choice in the second half of the '90s.\\" Characteristics Common musical aesthetics include a bass-heavy drumbeat, often providing the slowed down breakbeat samples similar to standard 1990s hip hop beats, giving the genre a more psychedelic and mainstream feel. Vocals in trip hop are oftentimes female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&B;, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&B;, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird, and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps. Trip hop is also known for its melancholic sound. This may be partly due to the fact that several acts were inspired by post-punk bands; Tricky and Massive Attack both covered and sampled songs of Siouxsie and the Banshees\\"moon-palace.de\\" Tricky web Site. Tricky covered \\"Tattoo\\" (a pre-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees from 1983) for the opening track of his second album Nearly God in 1996\\"Inflightdata.com\\" Massive Attack sampled and covered \\"Metal Postcard\\" of Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1997 on the movie soundtrack The Jackal and The Cure.Tricky site \\"The Lovecats\\" by Cure, covered by Tricky Tricky opened his second album Nearly God by a version of \\"Tattoo\\", a proto-trip-hop song of Siouxsie and the Banshees initially recorded in 1983. Trip hop tracks often incorporate Rhodes pianos, saxophones, trumpets, and flutes, and may employ unconventional instruments such as the theremin and Mellotron. Trip hop differs from hip hop in theme and overall tone. Instead of gangsta rap with its hard-hitting lyrics, trip hop offers a more aural atmospherics influenced by experimental folk and rock acts of the seventies, such as John Martyn, combined with instrumental hip hop, turntable scratching, and breakbeat rhythms. Regarded in some ways as a 1990s update of fusion, trip hop may be said to \\"transcend\\" the hardcore rap styles and lyrics with atmospheric overtones to create a more mellow tempo. History =1990s= The term \\"trip-hop\\" first appeared in print in June 1994. Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, used it to describe \\"In/Flux\\", a single by American producer DJ Shadow and UK act RPM, with the latter signed to Mo' Wax Records.Pemberton, Andy (June 1994). \\"Trip Hop\\". Mixmag. In Bristol, hip hop began to seep into the consciousness of a subculture already well-schooled in Jamaican forms of music. DJs, MCs, b-boys and graffiti artists grouped together into informal soundsystems. Like the pioneering Bronx crews of DJs Kool Herc, Afrika Bambataa and Grandmaster Flash, the soundsystems provided party music for public spaces, often in the economically deprived council estates from which some of their members originated. Bristol's soundsystem DJs, drawing heavily on Jamaican dub music, typically used a laid-back, slow and heavy drum beat (\\"down tempo\\"). Bristol's Wild Bunch crew became one of the soundsystems to put a local spin on the international phenomenon, helping to birth Bristol's signature sound of trip hop, often termed \\"the Bristol Sound\\". The Wild Bunch and its associates included at various times in its existence the MC Adrian \\"Tricky Kid\\" Thaws, the graffiti artist and lyricist Robert \\"3D\\" Del Naja, producer Jonny Dollar and the DJs Nellee Hooper, Andrew \\"Mushroom\\" Vowles and Grant \\"Daddy G\\" Marshall. As the hip hop scene matured in Bristol and musical trends evolved further toward acid jazz and house in the late 1980s, the golden era of the soundsystem began to end. The Wild Bunch signed a record deal and evolved into Massive Attack, a core collective of 3D, Mushroom and Daddy G, with significant contributions from Tricky Kid (soon shortened to Tricky), Dollar, and Hooper on production duties, along with a rotating cast of other vocalists. Another influence came from Gary Clail's Tackhead soundsystem. Clail often worked with former The Pop Group singer Mark Stewart. The latter experimented with his band Mark Stewart & the Maffia, which consisted of New York session musicians Skip McDonald, Doug Wimbish, and Keith LeBlanc, who had been a part of the house band for the Sugarhill Records record label. Produced by Adrian Sherwood, the music combined hip hop with experimental rock and dub and sounded like a premature version of what later became trip hop. In 1993, Kirsty MacColl released \\"Angel\\", one of the first examples of the genre crossing over to pop, a hybrid that dominated the charts toward the end of the 1990s. =Mainstream breakthrough= Massive Attack, a British trip hop group that helped bring the genre to mainstream success in the 1990s Massive Attack's first album Blue Lines was released in 1991 to huge success in the United Kingdom.Melissa Chemam, 'Massive Attack: Out of the Comfort Zone', 2019, https://www.bl.uk/events/massive-attack-out-of-the- comfort-zone Blue Lines was seen widely as the first major manifestation of a uniquely British hip hop movement, but the album's hit single \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" and several other tracks, while their rhythms were largely sample- based, were not seen as hip hop songs in any conventional sense. Produced by Dollar, Shara Nelson (an R&B; singer) featured on the orchestral \\"Unfinished\\", and Jamaican dance hall star Horace Andy provided vocals on several other tracks, as he would throughout Massive Attack's career.'Massive Attack - Out of the Comfort Zone', Melissa Chemam, An Excerpt, https://humag.co/features/massive-attack Massive Attack released their second album entitled Protection in 1994. Although Tricky stayed on in a lesser role, and Hooper again produced, the fertile dance music scene of the early 1990s had informed the record, and it was seen as an even more significant shift away from the Wild Bunch era. In the June 1994 issue of UK magazine Mixmag, music journalist Andy Pemberton used the term trip hop to describe the hip hop instrumental \\"In/Flux\\", a 1993 single by San Francisco's DJ Shadow, and other similar tracks released on the Mo' Wax label and being played in London clubs at the time. \\"In/Flux\\", with its mixed up bpms, spoken word samples, strings, melodies, bizarre noises, prominent bass, and slow beats, gave the listener the impression they were on a musical trip, according to Pemberton.Pemberton, Andy (June 1994). \\"Trip Hop\\". Mixmag. Soon, however, Massive Attack's dubby, jazzy, psychedelic, electronic textures, rooted in hip hop sampling technique but taking flight into many styles, were described by journalists as the template of the eponymous genre. Tricky, a major trip hop artist In 1993, Icelandic musician Bj√∂rk released Debut, produced by Wild Bunch member Nellee Hooper. The album, although rooted in four-on-the-floor house music, contained elements of trip hop and is credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic dance music into mainstream pop. She had been in contact with London's underground electronic music scene and was romantically involved with trip hop musician Tricky. Bj√∂rk embraced trip hop even more with her 1995 album Post by collaborating with Tricky and Howie B. Homogenic, her 1997 album, has been described as a pinnacle of trip hop music. 1994 and 1995 saw trip hop near the peak of its popularity, with artists such as Howie B and Earthling making significant contributions. Ninja Tune, the independent record label founded by the Coldcut duo, would significantly influence the trip-hop sound in London and beyond with breakthrough artists DJ Food, 9 Lazy 9, Up, Bustle & Out, Funki Porcini and The Herbaliser, among others. The period also marked the debut of two acts who, along with Massive Attack, would define the Bristol scene for years to come. In 1994 Portishead, a trio comprising singer Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, and Adrian Utley, released their debut album Dummy. Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs. Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year, giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music, seen as cutting edge in its film-noir feel and stylish, yet emotional appropriations of past sounds, was also widely imitated, causing the band to recoil from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize. Tricky also released his debut solo album Maxinquaye in 1995, to great critical acclaim. The album was produced largely in collaboration with Mark Saunders. Tricky employed whispered, often abstract stream-of-consciousness murmuring, remote from the gangsta-rap braggadocio of the mid-1990s US hip hop scene. Even more unusually, however, many of the solo songs on Maxinquaye featured little of Tricky's own voice: his then-lover, Martina Topley-Bird, sang them, including her reimagining of Public Enemy's militant 1988 rap \\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\", while other songs were male-female duets dealing with sex and love in oblique ways, over beds of sometimes dissonant samples. Within a year Tricky had released two more full- length albums which were considered even more challenging, without finding the same popularity as his Bristol contemporaries Massive Attack and Portishead. Through his brief collaborations with Bj√∂rk, however, he also exerted influence closer to the pop and alternative rock mainstream, and he developed a large cult fan-base. Musician Poe released her 1995 debut Hello, an album that featured trip-hop elements, to critical praise. Although not as popular in the United States, bands like Portishead and Sneaker Pimps saw moderate airplay on alternative-rock stations across the country. =\\"Post-trip hop\\"= Bj√∂rk, an artist who has often incorporated trip hop in her music After the initial success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, \\"post-trip-hop\\" artists include Baby Fox, Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Anomie Belle, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists incorporated trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed use of the term \\"post-trip hop\\" was in an October 2002 article of The Independent, and was used to describe the band Second Person. Trip hop has also influenced artists in other genres, including Gorillaz, Emancipator, Nine Inch Nails, Travis, Queens of the Stone Age, How to Destroy Angels, Beth Orton, The Flaming Lips, Bitter:Sweet, Beck, and Deftones. Several tracks on Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue's 1997 album Impossible Princess also displayed a trip hop influence. Various prominent artists and groups, such as Janet Jackson,Since acknowledging her capabilities for sensuality on the album \\"Janet,\\" Miss Jackson uses \\"The Velvet Rope\\" to explore her sexuality, including obsession, frustration and even coy allusions to sexual preference, layering her lyrics with fashionable trip-hop beats, overt sampling and trademark grooves. Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Bj√∂rk, and Radiohead, have also been influenced by the genre. Trip hop has spawned several subgenres, including illbient (dub-based trip hop which combines ambient and industrial hip hop). =2000s= Trip hop continued to influence notable artists in the 2000s. Norwegian avant-garde band Ulver incorporated trip hop in their ambient/electronic/jazzy album Perdition City. Atmospheric rock band Antimatter included some trip hop elements in their first two albums. Australian composer Rob Dougan proposed a mix of trip hop beats, orchestral music and electronics. RJD2 began his career as a DJ, but in 2001, began releasing albums under El-P's Def Jux Label. Zero 7's album Simple Things, and in particular, its lead single \\"Destiny\\", was regarded highly by underground listeners and achieved significant popularity. In 2006, Gotye debuted his second studio album, Like Drawing Blood. The songs on the album featured down- tempo hip-hop beats and dub style bass reminiscent of trip hop. Hip hop groups Zion I and the Dub Pistols also displayed heavy trip hop influence. Norwegian singer and songwriter Kate Havnevik is a classically trained musician, but also incorporates trip hop into her work. Many producers who were not explicitly trip-hop artists also displayed its influence during the early 2000s. Daniel Nakamura, aka Dan The Automator, released two albums that were heavily inspired by trip hop. 2000 album Deltron 3030, was a concept album about a rapper, portrayed by Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, from the future. 2001 saw the release of his side project, Lovage. Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By, with special guests Mike Patton, Prince Paul, Maseo, Damon Albarn, and Afrika Bambaataa. British producer Fatboy Slim's breakthrough album, Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars, was his most commercially successful release. =2010s= Major notable releases include Massive Attack's Heligoland, their first studio album in seven years, and Dutch's A Bright Cold Day in 2010, which was met with positive reviews including a 7/10 score from inyourspeakers.com. The latter group consists of members including Jedi Mind Tricks producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind. DJ Shadow's The Less You Know, the Better was released in 2011 after a highly publicised unveiling of songs, including appearances on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show and previews at a performance in Antwerp in August 2010. The album was met with \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on Metacritic, with some criticising Shadow's lack of originality. Sam Richards of NME felt that the album sounded \\"like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place.\\" Geoff Barrow's album titled \\">>\\" was released in 2012 and received high scores from journalists, including an 8/10 from NME and Spin magazine. Lana Del Rey released her second album, Born to Die in 2012, which contained a string of trip hop ballads. The album topped the charts in eleven countries, including Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom; it has sold 3.4 million copies worldwide as of 2013 according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.

He was born in the then Danish peninsula of Scania. Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist. He has been described as \\"the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact empirical facts\\".Edwin Arthur Burtt, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science: A Historical and Critical Essay (1925). Most of his observations were more accurate than the best available observations at the time. An heir to several of Denmark's principal noble families, Tycho received a comprehensive education. He took an interest in astronomy and in the creation of more accurate instruments of measurement. As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system. His system correctly saw the Moon as orbiting Earth, and the planets as orbiting the Sun, but erroneously considered the Sun to be orbiting the Earth. Furthermore, he was the last of the major naked-eye astronomers, working without telescopes for his observations. In his De nova stella (On the New Star) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm. His precise measurements indicated that \\"new stars\\" (stellae novae, now known as supernovae), in particular that of 1572, lacked the parallax expected in sublunar phenomena and were therefore not tailless comets in the atmosphere as previously believed but were above the atmosphere and beyond the Moon. Using similar measurements, he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly immutable celestial spheres. King Frederick II granted Tycho an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build Uraniborg, an early research institute, where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later Stjerneborg, underground, when he discovered that his instruments in Uraniborg were not sufficiently steady. On the island (where he behaved autocratically toward the residents) he founded manufactories, such as a paper mill, to provide material for printing his results. After disagreements with the new Danish king, Christian IV, in 1597, Tycho went into exile. He was invited by the Bohemian king and Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer. He built an observatory at Ben√°tky nad Jizerou. There, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by Johannes Kepler, who later used Tycho's astronomical data to develop his three laws of planetary motion. Tycho's body has been exhumed twice, in 1901 and 2010, to examine the circumstances of his death and to identify the material from which his artificial nose was made. The conclusion was that his death was likely caused by a burst bladder, and not by poisoning, as had been suggested, and that the artificial nose was more likely made of brass than silver or gold, as some had believed in his time. Life Jacques de Gheyn. Tycho Brahe was born as heir to several of Denmark's most influential noble families and in addition to his immediate ancestry with the Brahe and the Bille families, he also counted the Rud, Trolle, Ulfstand, and Rosenkrantz families among his ancestors. Both of his grandfathers and all of his great grandfathers had served as members of the Danish king's Privy Council. His paternal grandfather and namesake Thyge Brahe was the lord of Tosterup Castle in Scania and died in battle during the 1523 Siege of Malm√∂ during the Lutheran Reformation Wars. His maternal grandfather Claus Bille, lord to Bohus Castle and a second cousin of Swedish king Gustav Vasa, participated in the Stockholm Bloodbath on the side of the Danish king against the Swedish nobles. Tycho's father Otte Brahe, a royal Privy Councilor (like his own father), married Beate Bille, who was herself a powerful figure at the Danish court holding several royal land titles. Both parents are buried under the floor of K√•ger√∂d Church, four kilometres east of Knutstorp. =Early years= Tycho was born at his family's ancestral seat of Knutstorp Castle (Danish: Knudstrup borg; Swedish: Knutstorps borg), about eight kilometres north of Sval√∂v in then Danish Scania. He was the oldest of 12 siblings, 8 of whom lived to adulthood, including Steen Brahe. His twin brother died before being baptized. Tycho later wrote an ode in Latin to his dead twin,Reprinted in Danske Magazin, ii, p. 170 (Weistritz, ii. p.23 which was printed in 1572 as his first published work. An epitaph, originally from Knutstorp, but now on a plaque near the church door, shows the whole family, including Tycho as a boy. When he was only two years old Tycho was taken away to be raised by his uncle J√∏rgen Thygesen Brahe and his wife Inger Oxe (sister to Peder Oxe, Steward of the Realm) who were childless. It is unclear why Otte Brahe reached this arrangement with his brother, but Tycho was the only one of his siblings not to be raised by his mother at Knutstorp. Instead, Tycho was raised at J√∏rgen Brahe's estate at Tosterup and at Tranek√¶r on the island of Langeland, and later at N√¶sbyhoved Castle near Odense, and later again at the Castle of Nyk√∏bing on the island of Falster. Tycho later wrote that J√∏rgen Brahe \\"raised me and generously provided for me during his life until my eighteenth year; he always treated me as his own son and made me his heir\\". From ages 6 to 12, Tycho attended Latin school, probably in Nyk√∏bing. At age 12, on 19 April 1559, Tycho began studies at the University of Copenhagen. There, following his uncle's wishes, he studied law, but also studied a variety of other subjects and became interested in astronomy. At the University, Aristotle was a staple of scientific theory, and Tycho likely received a thorough training in Aristotelian physics and cosmology. He experienced the solar eclipse of 21 August 1560, and was greatly impressed by the fact that it had been predicted, although the prediction based on current observational data was a day off. He realized that more accurate observations would be the key to making more exact predictions. He purchased an ephemeris and books on astronomy, including Johannes de Sacrobosco's De sphaera mundi, Petrus Apianus's Cosmographia seu descriptio totius orbis and Regiomontanus's De triangulis omnimodis. J√∏rgen Thygesen Brahe, however, wanted Tycho to educate himself in order to become a civil servant, and sent him on a study tour of Europe in early 1562. 15-year old Tycho was given as mentor the 19-year-old Anders S√∏rensen Vedel, whom he eventually talked into allowing the pursuit of astronomy during the tour. Vedel and his pupil left Copenhagen in February 1562. On 24 March, they arrived in Leipzig, where they matriculated at the Lutheran Leipzig University. In 1563, he observed a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, and noticed that the Copernican and Ptolemaic tables used to predict the conjunction were inaccurate. This led him to realize that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night, using the most accurate instruments obtainable. He began maintaining detailed journals of all his astronomical observations. In this period, he combined the study of astronomy with astrology, laying down horoscopes for different famous personalities. When Tycho and Vedel returned from Leipzig in 1565, Denmark was at war with Sweden, and as vice-admiral of the Danish fleet, J√∏rgen Brahe had become a national hero for having participated in the sinking of the Swedish warship Mars during the First battle of √ñland (1564). Shortly after Tycho's arrival in Denmark, J√∏rgen Brahe was defeated in the Action of 4 June 1565, and shortly afterwards died of a fever. Stories have it that he contracted pneumonia after a night of drinking with the Danish King Frederick II when the king fell into the water in a Copenhagen canal and Brahe jumped in after him. Brahe's possessions passed on to his wife Inger Oxe, who considered Tycho with special fondness. =Tycho's nose= An artificial nose of the kind Tycho wore. This particular example did not belong to Tycho. In 1566, Tycho left to study at the University of Rostock. Here, he studied with professors of medicine at the university's famous medical school and became interested in medical alchemy and botanical medicine.See entry of Tycho Brahe in Rostock Matrikelportal. On 29 December 1566 at the age of 20, Tycho lost part of his nose in a sword duel with a fellow Danish nobleman, his third cousin Manderup Parsberg. The two had drunkenly quarreled over who was the superior mathematician at an engagement party at the home of Professor Lucas Bachmeister on 10 December. Coming nearly to quarrel again with his cousin on 29 December, they ended up resolving their feud with a duel in the dark. Though the two were later reconciled, the duel resulted in Tycho losing the bridge of his nose and gaining a broad scar across his forehead. He received the best possible care at the university and wore a prosthetic nose for the rest of his life. It was kept in place with paste or glue and said to be made of silver and gold. In November 2012, Danish and Czech researchers reported that the prosthetic was actually made of brass after chemically analyzing a small bone sample from the nose from the body exhumed in 2010. The prosthetics made of gold and silver were mostly worn for special occasions, rather than everyday wear. =Science and life on Uraniborg= In April 1567, Tycho returned home from his travels, with a firm intention of becoming an astrologer. Although he had been expected to go into politics and the law, like most of his kinsmen, and although Denmark was still at war with Sweden, his family supported his decision to dedicate himself to the sciences. His father wanted him to take up law, but Tycho was allowed to travel to Rostock and then to Augsburg (where he built a great quadrant), Basel, and Freiburg. In 1568, he was appointed a canon at the Cathedral of Roskilde, a largely honorary position that would allow him to focus on his studies. At the end of 1570, he was informed of his father's ill health, so he returned to Knutstorp Castle, where his father died on 9 May 1571. The war was over, and the Danish lords soon returned to prosperity. Soon, another uncle, Steen Bille, helped him build an observatory and alchemical laboratory at Herrevad Abbey. Tycho was acknowledged by King Frederick II who proposed to him that an observatory be built to better study the night sky. After accepting this proposal, the location for the Uraniborg's construction took place at a remote island called Hven in the Sont near Copenhagen, which made a name for itself as the most promising observatory in Europe at the time. Marriage to Kirsten J√∏rgensdatter Towards the end of 1571, Tycho fell in love with Kirsten, daughter of J√∏rgen Hansen, the Lutheran minister in Knudstrup. As she was a commoner, Tycho never formally married her, since if he did he would lose his noble privileges. However, Danish law permitted morganatic marriage, which meant that a nobleman and a common woman could live together openly as husband and wife for three years, and their alliance then became a legally binding marriage. However, each would maintain their social status, and any children they had together would be considered commoners, with no rights to titles, landholdings, coat of arms, or even their father's noble name. While King Frederick respected Tycho's choice of wife, himself having been unable to marry the woman he loved, many of Tycho's family members disagreed, and many churchmen would continue to hold the lack of a divinely sanctioned marriage against him. Kirsten J√∏rgensdatter gave birth to their first daughter, Kirstine (named after Tycho's late sister) on 12October 1573. Kirstine died from the plague in 1576, and Tycho wrote a heartfelt elegy for her tombstone. In 1574, they moved to Copenhagen where their daughter Magdalene was born, and later the family followed him into exile. Kirsten and Tycho lived together for almost thirty years until Tycho's death. Together, they had eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood. The 1572 supernova Cassiopeia showing the position of the supernova of 1572 (the topmost star, labelled I); from Tycho Brahe's De nova stella. On 11 November 1572, Tycho observed (from Herrevad Abbey) a very bright star, now numbered SN 1572, which had unexpectedly appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. Because it had been maintained since antiquity that the world beyond the Moon's orbit was eternally unchangeable (celestial immutability was a fundamental axiom of the Aristotelian world-view), other observers held that the phenomenon was something in the terrestrial sphere below the Moon. However, Tycho observed that the object showed no daily parallax against the background of the fixed stars. This implied that it was at least farther away than the Moon and those planets that do show such parallax. He also found that the object did not change its position relative to the fixed stars over several months, as all planets did in their periodic orbital motions, even the outer planets, for which no daily parallax was detectable. This suggested that it was not even a planet, but a fixed star in the stellar sphere beyond all the planets. In 1573, he published a small book De nova stella,De nova et nullius √¶vi memoria prius visa stella. ‚Äì Photocopy of the Latin print with a partial translation into Danish: \\"Om den nye og aldrig siden Verdens begyndelse i nogen tidsalders erindring f√∏r observerede stjerne ...\\" thereby coining the term nova for a \\"new\\" star (we now classify this star as a supernova and know that it is 7500 light-years from Earth). This discovery was decisive for his choice of astronomy as a profession. Tycho was strongly critical of those who dismissed the implications of the astronomical appearance, writing in the preface to De nova stella: \\"O crassa ingenia. O caecos coeli spectatores\\" (\\"Oh thick wits. Oh blind watchers of the sky\\"). The publication of his discovery made him a well-known name among scientists across Europe. Lord of Hven A hand- painted copper-plate engraving of Uraniborg from Blaeu's Atlas Maior (1662-5), based on a woodcut from Brahe's Astronomi√¶ instaurat√¶ mechanica (1598). Tycho continued with his detailed observations, often assisted by his first assistant and student, his younger sister Sophie Brahe. In 1574, Tycho published the observations made in 1572 from his first observatory at Herrevad Abbey. He then started lecturing on astronomy, but gave it up and left Denmark in spring 1575 to tour abroad. He first visited William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel's observatory at Kassel, then went on to Frankfurt, Basel and Venice, where he acted as an agent for the Danish king, contacting artisans and craftsmen whom the king wanted to work on his new palace at Elsinore. Upon his return, the King wished to repay Tycho's service by offering him a position worthy of his family; he offered him a choice of lordships of militarily and economically important estates, such as the castles of Hammershus or Helsingborg. But Tycho was reluctant to take up a position as a lord of the realm, preferring to focus on his science. He wrote to his friend Johannes Pratensis, \\"I did not want to take possession of any of the castles our benevolent king so graciously offered me. I am displeased with society here, customary forms and the whole rubbish\\". Tycho secretly began to plan to move to Basel, wishing to participate in the burgeoning academic and scientific life there. But the King heard of Tycho's plans, and desiring to keep the distinguished scientist, he offered Tycho the island of Hven in √òresund and funding to set up an observatory. Tycho Brahe's large mural quadrant at Uraniborg Until then, Hven had been property directly under the Crown, and the 50 families on the island considered themselves to be freeholding farmers, but with Tycho's appointment as Feudal Lord of Hven, this changed. Tycho took control of agricultural planning, requiring the peasants to cultivate twice as much as they had done before, and he also exacted corv√©e labor from the peasants for the construction of his new castle. The peasants complained about Tycho's excessive taxation and took him to court. The court established Tycho's right to levy taxes and labor, and the result was a contract detailing the mutual obligations of lord and peasants on the island. Tycho envisioned his castle Uraniborg as a temple dedicated to the muses of arts and sciences, rather than as a military fortress; indeed, it was named after Urania, the muse of astronomy. Construction began in 1576 (with a laboratory for his alchemical experiments in the cellar). Uraniborg was inspired by the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio, and was one of the first buildings in northern Europe to show influence from Italian renaissance architecture. When he realized that the towers of Uraniborg were not adequate as observatories because of the instruments' exposure to the elements and the movement of the building, he then constructed a second underground observatory at nearby Stjerneborg in 1581. The basement included an alchemical laboratory with 16 furnaces for conducting distillations and other chemical experiments. Unusually for the time, Tycho established Uraniborg as a research centre, where almost 100 students and artisans worked from 1576 to 1597. Uraniborg also contained a printing press and a paper mill, both among the first in Scandinavia, enabling Tycho to publish his own manuscripts, on locally made paper with his own watermark. He created a system of ponds and canals to run the wheels of the paper mill. Over the years he worked on Uraniborg, Tycho was assisted by a number of students and proteg√©s, many of whom went on to their own careers in astronomy: among them were Christian S√∏rensen Longomontanus, later one of the main proponents of the Tychonic model and Tycho's replacement as royal Danish astronomer; Peder Fleml√∏se; Elias Olsen Morsing; and Cort Aslakss√∏n. Tycho's instrument-maker Hans Crol also formed part of the scientific community on the island. Brahe's notebook with his observations of the 1577 comet He observed the great comet that was visible in the Northern sky from November 1577 to January 1578. Within Lutheranism, it was commonly believed that celestial objects like comets were powerful portents, announcing the coming apocalypse, and in addition to Tycho's observations several Danish amateur astronomers observed the object and published prophesies of impending doom. He was able to determine that the comet's distance to Earth was much greater than the distance of the Moon, so that the comet could not have originated in the \\"earthly sphere\\", confirming his prior anti-Aristotelian conclusions about the fixed nature of the sky beyond the Moon. He also realized that the comet's tail was always pointing away from the Sun. He calculated its diameter, mass, and the length of its tail, and speculated about the material it was made of. At this point, he had not yet broken with Copernican theory, and observing the comet inspired him to try to develop an alternative Copernican model in which the Earth was immobile. The second half of his manuscript about the comet dealt with the astrological and apocalyptic aspects of the comet, and he rejected the prophesies of his competitors; instead, making his own predictions of dire political events in the near future. Among his predictions was bloodshed in Moscow and the imminent fall of Ivan the Terrible by 1583. Engraving of the above ground parts of Tycho Brahe's underground observatory \\"Stjerneborg\\". The support that Tycho received from the Crown was substantial, amounting to 1% of the annual total revenue at one point in the 1580s. Tycho often held large social gatherings in his castle. Pierre Gassendi wrote that Tycho also had a tame elk (moose) and that his mentor the Landgrave Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel (Hesse-Cassel) asked whether there was an animal faster than a deer. Tycho replied that there was none, but he could send his tame elk. When Wilhelm replied he would accept one in exchange for a horse, Tycho replied with the sad news that the elk had just died on a visit to entertain a nobleman at Landskrona. Apparently, during dinner, the elk had drunk a lot of beer, fallen down the stairs, and died. Among the many noble visitors to Hven was James VI of Scotland, who married the Danish princess Anne. After his visit to Hven in 1590, he wrote a poem comparing Tycho with Apollon and Phaethon. As part of Tycho's duties to the Crown in exchange for his estate, he fulfilled the functions of a royal astrologer. At the beginning of each year, he had to present an Almanac to the court, predicting the influence of the stars on the political and economic prospects of the year. And at the birth of each prince, he prepared their horoscopes, predicting their fates. He also worked as a cartographer with his former tutor Anders S√∏rensen Vedel on mapping out all of the Danish realm. An ally of the king and friendly with Queen Sophie (both his mother Beate Bille and adoptive mother Inger Oxe had been her court maids), he secured a promise from the King that ownership of Hven and Uraniborg would pass to his heirs. Publications, correspondence and scientific disputes Frontispiece to the 1610 edition of Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata In 1588, Tycho's royal benefactor died, and a volume of Tycho's great two-volume work Astronomiae Instauratae Progymnasmata (Introduction to the New Astronomy) was published. The first volume, devoted to the new star of 1572, was not ready, because the reduction of the observations of 1572‚Äì3 involved much research to correct the stars' positions for refraction, precession, the motion of the Sun etc., and was not completed in Tycho's lifetime (it was published in Prague in 1602/03), but the second volume, titled De Mundi Aetherei Recentioribus Phaenomenis Liber Secundus (Second Book About Recent Phenomena in the Celestial World) and devoted to the comet of 1577, was printed at Uraniborg and some copies were issued in 1588. Besides the comet observations, it included an account of Tycho's system of the world. The third volume was intended to treat the comets of 1580 and following years in a similar manner, but it was never published, nor even written, though a great deal of material about the comet of 1585 was put together and first published in 1845 with the observations of this comet.John Louis Emil Dreyer, Tycho Brahe: a Picture of Scientific Life and Work in the Sixteenth Century, A. & C. Black (1890), pp. 162‚Äì3 While at Uraniborg, Tycho maintained correspondence with scientists and astronomers across Europe. He inquired about other astronomers' observations and shared his own technological advances to help them achieve more accurate observations. Thus, his correspondence was crucial to his research. Often, correspondence was not just private communication between scholars, but also a way to disseminate results and arguments and to build progress and scientific consensus. Through correspondence, Tycho was involved in several personal disputes with critics of his theories. Prominent among them were John Craig, a Scottish physician who was a strong believer in the authority of the Aristotelian worldview, and Nicolaus Reimers Baer, known as Ursus, an astronomer at the Imperial court in Prague, whom Tycho accused of having plagiarized his cosmological model. Craig refused to accept Tycho's conclusion that the comet of 1577 had to be located within the aetherial sphere rather than within the atmosphere of Earth. Craig tried to contradict Tycho by using his own observations of the comet, and by questioning his methodology. Tycho published an apologia (a defense) of his conclusions, in which he provided additional arguments, as well as condemning Craig's ideas in strong language for being incompetent. Another dispute concerned the mathematician Paul Wittich, who, after staying on Hven in 1580, taught Count Wilhelm of Kassel and his astronomer Christoph Rothmann to build copies of Tycho's instruments without permission from Tycho. In turn, Craig, who had studied with Wittich, accused Tycho of minimizing Wittich's role in developing some of the trigonometric methods used by Tycho. In his dealings with these disputes, Tycho made sure to leverage his support in the scientific community, by publishing and disseminating his own answers and arguments. =Exile and later years= When Frederick died in 1588, his son and heir Christian IV was only 11 years old. A regency council was appointed to rule for the young prince- elect until his coronation in 1596. The head of the council (Steward of the Realm) was Christoffer Valkendorff, who disliked Tycho after a conflict between them, and hence Tycho's influence at the Danish court steadily declined. Feeling that his legacy on Hven was in peril, he approached the Dowager Queen Sophie and asked her to affirm in writing her late husband's promise to endow Hven to Tycho's heirs. Nonetheless, he realized that the young king was more interested in war than in science, and was of no mind to keep his father's promise. King Christian IV followed a policy of curbing the power of the nobility by confiscating their estates to minimize their income bases, by accusing nobles of misusing their offices and of heresies against the Lutheran church. Tycho, who was known to sympathize with the Philippists (followers of Philip Melanchthon), was among the nobles who fell out of grace with the new king. The king's unfavorable disposition towards Tycho was likely also a result of efforts by several of his enemies at court to turn the king against him. Tycho's enemies included, in addition to Valkendorff, the king's doctor Peter Severinus, who also had personal gripes with Tycho, and several gnesio-Lutheran Bishops who suspected Tycho of heresy ‚Äî a suspicion motivated by his known Philippist sympathies, his pursuits in medicine and alchemy (both of which he practiced without the church's approval) and his prohibiting the local priest on Hven to include the exorcism in the baptismal ritual. Among the accusations raised against Tycho were his failure to adequately maintain the royal chapel at Roskilde, and his harshness and exploitation of the Hven peasantry. Tycho became even more inclined to leave when a mob of commoners, possibly incited by his enemies at court, rioted in front of his house in Copenhagen. Tycho left Hven in 1597, bringing some of his instruments with him to Copenhagen, and entrusting others to a caretaker on the island. Shortly before leaving, he completed his star catalogue giving the positions of 1,000 stars. After some unsuccessful attempts at influencing the king to let him return; including showcasing his instruments on the wall of the city, he finally acquiesced to exile, but he wrote his most famous poem Elegy to Dania in which he chided Denmark for not appreciating his genius. The instruments he had used in Uraniborg and Stjerneborg were depicted and described in detail in his book Astronomiae instauratae mechanica or Instruments for the restoration of astronomy, first published in 1598. The King sent two envoys to Hven to describe the instruments left behind by Tycho. Unversed in astronomy, the envoys reported to the king that the large mechanical contraptions such as his large quadrant and sextant were \\"useless and even harmful\\". From 1597 to 1598, he spent a year at the castle of his friend Heinrich Rantzau in Wandesburg outside Hamburg, and then they moved for a while to Wittenberg, where they stayed in the former home of Philip Melanchthon. In 1599, he obtained the sponsorship of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor and moved to Prague, as Imperial Court Astronomer. Tycho built a new observatory in a castle in Ben√°tky nad Jizerou, 50 km from Prague, and worked there for one year. The emperor then brought him back to Prague, where he stayed until his death. At the imperial court even Tycho's wife and children were treated like nobility, which they had never been at the Danish court. Tycho received financial support from several nobles in addition to the emperor, including Oldrich Desiderius Pruskowsky von Pruskow, to whom he dedicated his famous Mechanica. In return for their support, Tycho's duties included preparing astrological charts and predictions for his patrons at events such as births, weather forecasting, and astrological interpretations of significant astronomical events, such as the supernova of 1572 (sometimes called Tycho's supernova) and the Great Comet of 1577.Adam Mosley and the Department of History and Philosophy of Science of the University of Cambridge. Tycho Brahe and Astrology. 1999. Retrieved 2 October 2008 Relationship with Kepler In Prague, Tycho worked closely with Johannes Kepler, his assistant. Kepler was a convinced Copernican, and considered Tycho's model to be mistaken, and derived from simple \\"inversion\\" of the Sun's and Earth's positions in the Copernican model. Together, the two worked on a new star catalogue based on his own accurate positions ‚Äî this catalogue became the Rudolphine Tables. Also at the court in Prague was the mathematician Nicolaus Reimers (Ursus), with whom Tycho had previously corresponded, and who, like Tycho, had developed a geo-heliocentric planetary model, which Tycho considered to have been plagiarized from his own. Kepler had previously spoken highly of Ursus, but now found himself in the problematic position of being employed by Tycho and having to defend his employer against Ursus' accusations, even though he disagreed with both of their planetary models. In 1600, he finished the tract Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum (defense of Tycho against Ursus). Kepler had great respect for Tycho's methods and the accuracy of his observations and considered him to be the new Hipparchus, who would provide the foundation for a restoration of the science of astronomy. =Illness, death, and investigations= Tycho Brahe's grave in Prague, new tomb stone from 1901 Tycho suddenly contracted a bladder or kidney ailment after attending a banquet in Prague, and died eleven days later, on 24 October 1601, at the age of 54. It is also said that Tycho had been suffering from an illness which he had attempted to take care of himself with his alchemy skills, but failed and rather contributed to his death. According to Kepler's first-hand account, Tycho had refused to leave the banquet to relieve himself because it would have been a breach of etiquette. After he returned home, he was no longer able to urinate, except eventually in very small quantities and with excruciating pain. The night before he died, he suffered from a delirium during which he was frequently heard to exclaim that he hoped he would not seem to have lived in vain., p. 309: \\"Ne frustra vixisse videar!\\". Before dying, he urged Kepler to finish the Rudolphine Tables and expressed the hope that he would do so by adopting Tycho's own planetary system, rather than that of Copernicus. It was reported that Tycho had written his own epitaph, \\"He lived like a sage and died like a fool.\\" A contemporary physician attributed his death to a kidney stone, but no kidney stones were found during an autopsy performed after his body was exhumed in 1901, and the 20th-century medical assessment is that his death is more likely to have resulted from uremia. The investigations in the 1990s have suggested that Tycho may not have died from urinary problems, but instead from mercury poisoning.Kaempe, Thykier, Pedersen: \\"The cause of death of Tycho Brahe in 1601.\\" Proceedings of the 31st TIAFT Congress, Leipzig 1993, Contributions to Forensic Toxicology. MOLINApress, Leipzig 1994, pp.309‚Äì315 It was speculated that he had been intentionally poisoned. The two main suspects were his assistant, Johannes Kepler, whose motives would be to gain access to Tycho's laboratory and chemicals, and his cousin, Erik Brahe, at the order of friend- turned-enemy Christian IV, because of rumors that Tycho had had an affair with Christian's mother. In February 2010, the Prague city authorities approved a request by Danish scientists to exhume the remains, and in November 2010 a group of Czech and Danish scientists from Aarhus University collected bone, hair and clothing samples for analysis. The scientists, led by Dr Jens Vellev, analyzed Tycho's beard hair once again. The team reported in November 2012 that not only was there not enough mercury present to substantiate murder, but that there were no lethal levels of any poisons present. The team's conclusion was that \\"it is impossible that Tycho Brahe could have been murdered\\". The findings were confirmed by scientists from the University of Rostock, who examined a sample of Tycho's beard hairs that had been taken in 1901. Although traces of mercury were found, these were present only in the outer scales. Therefore, mercury poisoning as the cause of death was ruled out, while the study suggests that the accumulation of mercury may have come from the \\"precipitation of mercury dust from the air during [Tycho's] long-term alchemistic activities\\". The hair samples contain 20‚Äì100 times the natural concentration of gold until 2 months before his death. Tycho is buried in the Church of Our Lady before T√Ωn, in Old Town Square near the Prague Astronomical Clock. Career: observing the heavens =Observational astronomy= Drawing of a large sextant used by Tycho Brahe Tycho's view of science was driven by his passion for accurate observations, and the quest for improved instruments of measurement drove his life's work. Tycho was the last major astronomer to work without the aid of a telescope, soon to be turned skyward by Galileo Galilei and others. Given the limitations of the naked eye for making accurate observations, he devoted many of his efforts to improving the accuracy of the existing types of instrument ‚Äî the sextant and the quadrant. He designed larger versions of these instruments, which allowed him to achieve much higher accuracy. Because of the accuracy of his instruments, he quickly realized the influence of wind and the movement of buildings, and instead opted to mount his instruments underground directly on the bedrock. Tycho's observations of stellar and planetary positions were noteworthy both for their accuracy and quantity. With an accuracy approaching one arcminute, his celestial positions were much more accurate than those of any predecessor or contemporary ‚Äî about five times as accurate as the observations of the contemporary astronomer Wilhelm of Hesse. asserts of Tycho's Star Catalog D, \\"In it, Tycho achieved, on a mass scale, a precision far beyond that of earlier catalogers. Cat D represents an unprecedented confluence of skills: instrumental, observational, & computational‚Äîall of which combined to enable Tycho to place most of his hundreds of recorded stars to an accuracy of ordermag 1'!\\" Drawing of a large quadrant used by Tycho Brahe. He aspired to a level of accuracy in his estimated positions of celestial bodies of being consistently within an arcminute of their real celestial locations, and also claimed to have achieved this level. But, in fact, many of the stellar positions in his star catalogues were less accurate than that. The median errors for the stellar positions in his final published catalog were about 1.5', indicating that only half of the entries were more accurate than that, with an overall mean error in each coordinate of around 2'. Although the stellar observations as recorded in his observational logs were more accurate, varying from 32.3\\" to 48.8\\" for different instruments, systematic errors of as much as 3' were introduced into some of the stellar positions Tycho published in his star catalog ‚Äî due, for instance, to his application of an erroneous ancient value of parallax and his neglect of polestar refraction. Incorrect transcription in the final published star catalogue, by scribes in Tycho's employ, was the source of even larger errors, sometimes by many degrees. Celestial objects observed near the horizon and above appear with a greater altitude than the real one, due to atmospheric refraction, and one of Tycho's most important innovations was that he worked out and published the very first tables for the systematic correction of this possible source of error. But, as advanced as they were, they attributed no refraction whatever above 45¬∞ altitude for solar refraction, and none for starlight above 20¬∞ altitude. To perform the huge number of multiplications needed to produce much of his astronomical data, Tycho relied heavily on the then-new technique of prosthaphaeresis, an algorithm for approximating products based on trigonometric identities that predated logarithms. =The Tychonic cosmological model= In this depiction of the Tychonic system, the objects on blue orbits (the Moon and the Sun) revolve around the Earth. The objects on orange orbits (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) revolve around the Sun. Around all is a sphere of fixed stars. Although Tycho admired Copernicus and was the first to teach his theory in Denmark, he was unable to reconcile Copernican theory with the basic laws of Aristotelian physics, that he considered to be foundational. He was also critical of the observational data that Copernicus built his theory on, which he correctly considered to have a high margin of error. Instead, Tycho proposed a \\"geo-heliocentric\\" system in which the Sun and Moon orbited the Earth, while the other planets orbited the Sun. Tycho's system had many of the same observational and computational advantages that Copernicus' system had, and both systems also could accommodate the phases of Venus, although Galilei had yet to discover them. Tycho's system provided a safe position for astronomers who were dissatisfied with older models but were reluctant to accept the heliocentrism and the Earth's motion. It gained a considerable following after 1616 when Rome declared that the heliocentric model was contrary to both philosophy and Scripture, and could be discussed only as a computational convenience that had no connection to fact. Tycho's system also offered a major innovation: while both the purely geocentric model and the heliocentric model as set forth by Copernicus relied on the idea of transparent rotating crystalline spheres to carry the planets in their orbits, Tycho eliminated the spheres entirely. Kepler, as well as other Copernican astronomers, tried to persuade Tycho to adopt the heliocentric model of the Solar System, but he was not persuaded. According to Tycho, the idea of a rotating and revolving Earth would be \\"in violation not only of all physical truth but also of the authority of Holy Scripture, which ought to be paramount.\\" With respect to physics, Tycho held that the Earth was just too sluggish and heavy to be continuously in motion. According to the accepted Aristotelian physics of the time, the heavens (whose motions and cycles were continuous and unending) were made of \\"Aether\\" or \\"Quintessence\\"; this substance, not found on Earth, was light, strong, unchanging, and its natural state was circular motion. By contrast, the Earth (where objects seem to have motion only when moved) and things on it were composed of substances that were heavy and whose natural state was rest. Accordingly, Tycho said the Earth was a \\"lazy\\" body that was not readily moved. Thus while Tycho acknowledged that the daily rising and setting of the Sun and stars could be explained by the Earth's rotation, as Copernicus had said, still > such a fast motion could not belong to the earth, a body very heavy and > dense and opaque, but rather belongs to the sky itself whose form and subtle > and constant matter are better suited to a perpetual motion, however fast., > page 361. With respect to the stars, Tycho also believed that, if the Earth orbited the Sun annually, there should be an observable stellar parallax over any period of six months, during which the angular orientation of a given star would change thanks to Earth's changing position. (This parallax does exist, but is so small it was not detected until 1838, when Friedrich Bessel discovered a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of the star 61 Cygni.J J O'Connor and E F Robertson. Bessel biography. University of St Andrews. Retrieved 28 September 2008) The Copernican explanation for this lack of parallax was that the stars were such a great distance from Earth that Earth's orbit was almost insignificant by comparison. However, Tycho noted that this explanation introduced another problem: Stars as seen by the naked eye appear small, but of some size, with more prominent stars such as Vega appearing larger than lesser stars such as Polaris, which in turn appear larger than many others. Tycho had determined that a typical star measured approximately a minute of arc in size, with more prominent ones being two or three times as large. In writing to Christoph Rothmann, a Copernican astronomer, Tycho used basic geometry to show that, assuming a small parallax that just escaped detection, the distance to the stars in the Copernican system would have to be 700 times greater than the distance from the Sun to Saturn. Moreover, the only way the stars could be so distant and still appear the sizes they do in the sky would be if even average stars were gigantic ‚Äî at least as big as the orbit of the Earth, and of course vastly larger than the Sun. And, Tycho said, the more prominent stars would have to be even larger still. And what if the parallax was even smaller than anyone thought, so the stars were yet more distant? Then they would all have to be even larger still. Tycho said > Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many > absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion > of the earth] by inference., page 364. Copernicans offered a religious response to Tycho's geometry: titanic, distant stars might seem unreasonable, but they were not, for the Creator could make his creations that large if He wanted. In fact, Rothmann responded to this argument of Tycho's by saying: > \\"[W]hat is so absurd about [an average star] having size equal to the whole > [orbit of the Earth]? What of this is contrary to divine will, or is > impossible by divine Nature, or is inadmissible by infinite Nature? These > things must be entirely demonstrated by you, if you will wish to infer from > here anything of the absurd. These things that vulgar sorts see as absurd at > first glance are not easily charged with absurdity, for in fact divine > Sapience and Majesty is far greater than they understand. Grant the vastness > of the Universe and the sizes of the stars to be as great as you like ‚Äî > these will still bear no proportion to the infinite Creator. It reckons that > the greater the king, so much greater and larger the palace befitting his > majesty. So how great a palace do you reckon is fitting to GOD?\\". Religion played a role in Tycho's geocentrism also ‚Äì he cited the authority of scripture in portraying the Earth as being at rest. He rarely used Biblical arguments alone (to him they were a secondary objection to the idea of Earth's motion) and over time he came to focus on scientific arguments, but he did take Biblical arguments seriously. Tycho's 1587 geo-heliocentric model differed from those of other geo-heliocentric astronomers, such as Paul Wittich, Reimarus Ursus, Helisaeus Roeslin and David Origanus, in that the orbits of Mars and the Sun intersected. This was because Tycho had come to believe the distance of Mars from the Earth at opposition (that is, when Mars is on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun) was less than that of the Sun from the Earth. Tycho believed this because he came to believe Mars had a greater daily parallax than the Sun. But, in 1584, in a letter to a fellow astronomer, Brucaeus, he had claimed that Mars had been further than the Sun at the opposition of 1582, because he had observed that Mars had little or no daily parallax. He said he had therefore rejected Copernicus's model because it predicted Mars would be at only two-thirds the distance of the Sun., p 178‚Äì180 But, he apparently later changed his mind to the opinion that Mars at opposition was indeed nearer the Earth than the Sun was, but apparently without any valid observational evidence in any discernible Martian parallax. Such intersecting Martian and solar orbits meant that there could be no solid rotating celestial spheres, because they could not possibly interpenetrate. Arguably, this conclusion was independently supported by the conclusion that the comet of 1577 was superlunary, because it showed less daily parallax than the Moon and thus must pass through any celestial spheres in its transit. =Lunar theory= Tycho's distinctive contributions to lunar theory include his discovery of the variation of the Moon's longitude. This represents the largest inequality of longitude after the equation of the center and the evection. He also discovered librations in the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit, relative to the ecliptic (which is not a constant of about 5¬∞ as had been believed before him, but fluctuates through a range of over a quarter of a degree), and accompanying oscillations in the longitude of the lunar node. These represent perturbations in the Moon's ecliptic latitude. Tycho's lunar theory doubled the number of distinct lunar inequalities, relative to those anciently known, and reduced the discrepancies of lunar theory to about a fifth of their previous amounts. It was published posthumously by Kepler in 1602, and Kepler's own derivative form appears in Kepler's Rudolphine Tables of 1627. =Subsequent developments in astronomy = Kepler used Tycho's records of the motion of Mars to deduce laws of planetary motion, enabling calculation of astronomical tables with unprecedented accuracy (the Rudolphine Tables) and providing powerful support for a heliocentric model of the solar system. Valentin Naboth's drawing of Martianus Capella's geo-heliocentric astronomical model (1573) Galileo's 1610 telescopic discovery that Venus shows a full set of phases refuted the pure geocentric Ptolemaic model. After that it seems 17th-century astronomy mostly converted to geo-heliocentric planetary models that could explain these phases just as well as the heliocentric model could, but without the latter's disadvantage of the failure to detect any annual stellar parallax that Tycho and others regarded as refuting it. The three main geo-heliocentric models were the Tychonic, the Capellan with just Mercury and Venus orbiting the Sun such as favoured by Francis Bacon, for example, and the extended Capellan model of Riccioli with Mars also orbiting the Sun whilst Saturn and Jupiter orbit the fixed Earth. But the Tychonic model was probably the most popular, albeit probably in what was known as 'the semi-Tychonic' version with a daily rotating Earth. This model was advocated by Tycho's ex-assistant and disciple Longomontanus in his 1622 Astronomia Danica that was the intended completion of Tycho's planetary model with his observational data, and which was regarded as the canonical statement of the complete Tychonic planetary system. Longomontanus' work was published in several editions and used by many subsequent astronomers, and through him the Tychonic system was adopted by astronomers as far away as China. Johannes Kepler published the Rudolphine Tables containing a star catalog and planetary tables using Tycho's measurements. Hven island appears west uppermost on the base. The ardent anti-heliocentric French astronomer Jean-Baptiste Morin devised a Tychonic planetary model with elliptical orbits published in 1650 in a simplified, Tychonic version of the Rudolphine Tables. Another geocentric French astronomer, Jacques du Chevreul, rejected Tycho's observations including his description of the heavens and the theory that Mars was below the Sun. Some acceptance of the Tychonic system persisted through the 17th century and in places until the early 18th century; it was supported (after a 1633 decree about the Copernican controversy) by \\"a flood of pro-Tycho literature\\" of Jesuit origin. Among pro-Tycho Jesuits, Ignace Pardies declared in 1691 that it was still the commonly accepted system, and Francesco Blanchinus reiterated that as late as 1728. Persistence of the Tychonic system, especially in Catholic countries, has been attributed to its satisfaction of a need (relative to Catholic doctrine) for \\"a safe synthesis of ancient and modern\\". After 1670, even many Jesuit writers only thinly disguised their Copernicanism. But in Germany, the Netherlands, and England, the Tychonic system \\"vanished from the literature much earlier\\". James Bradley's discovery of stellar aberration, published in 1729, eventually gave direct evidence excluding the possibility of all forms of geocentrism including Tycho's. Stellar aberration could only be satisfactorily explained on the basis that the Earth is in annual orbit around the Sun, with an orbital velocity that combines with the finite speed of the light coming from an observed star or planet, to affect the apparent direction of the body observed. =Work in medicine, alchemy and astrology= Tycho also worked in medicine and alchemy. He was strongly influenced by Paracelsus, who considered the human body to be directly influenced by celestial bodies. The paracelsian view of man as a microcosm, and astrology as the science tying together the celestial and bodily universes was also shared by Philip Melanchthon, and was precisely one of the points of contention between Melanchthon and Luther, and hence between the philippists and the gnesio-Lutherans. For Tycho there was a close connection between empiricism and natural science on one hand and religion and astrology on the other. Using his large herbal garden at Uraniborg, Tycho produced several recipes for herbal medicines, using them to treat illnesses such as fever and plague. In his own time, Tycho was also famous for his contributions to medicine; his herbal medicines were in use as late as the 1900s. The expression Tycho Brahe days, in Scandinavian folklore, refers to a number of \\"unlucky days\\" that were featured in many almanacs beginning in the 1700s, but which have no direct connection to Tycho or his work. Whether because he realized that astrology was not an empirical science or because he feared religious repercussions Tycho seems to have had a somewhat ambiguous relation to his own astrological work. For example, two of his more astrological treatises, one on weather predictions and an almanac, were published in the names of his assistants, in spite of the fact that he worked on them personally. Some scholars have argued that he lost faith in horoscope astrology over the course of his career, and others that he simply changed his public communication on the topic as he realized that connections with astrology could influence the reception of his empirical astronomical work. Legacy Monument of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler in Prague =Biographies= The first biography of Tycho, which was also the first full- length biography of any scientist, was written by Pierre Gassendi in 1654. In 1779, Tycho de Hoffmann wrote of Tycho's life in his history of the Brahe family. In 1913, Dreyer published Tycho's collected works, facilitating further research. Early modern scholarship on Tycho tended to see the shortcomings of his astronomical model, painting him as a mysticist recalcitrant in accepting the Copernican revolution, and valuing mostly his observations that allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of planetary movement. Especially in Danish scholarship, Tycho was depicted as a mediocre scholar and a traitor to the nation ‚Äî perhaps because of the important role in Danish historiography of Christian IV as a warrior king. In the second half of the 20th century, scholars began reevaluating his significance, and studies by Kristian Peder Moesgaard, Owen Gingerich, Robert Westman, Victor E. Thoren, and John R. Christianson focused on his contributions to science, and demonstrated that while he admired Copernicus he was simply unable to reconcile his basic theory of physics with the Copernican view. Christianson's work showed the influence of Tycho's Uraniborg as a training center for scientists who after studying with Tycho went on to make contributions in various scientific fields. =Scientific legacy= Although Tycho's planetary model was soon discredited, his astronomical observations were an essential contribution to the scientific revolution. The traditional view of Tycho is that he was primarily an empiricist who set new standards for precise and objective measurements. This appraisal originated in Pierre Gassendi's 1654 biography, Tychonis Brahe, equitis Dani, astronomorum coryphaei, vita. It was furthered by Johann Dreyer's biography in 1890, which was long the most influential work on Tycho. According to historian of science Helge Kragh, this assessment grew out of Gassendi's opposition to Aristotelianism and Cartesianism, and fails to account for the diversity of Tycho's activities. =Cultural legacy= Tycho's discovery of the new star was the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"Al Aaraaf\\". In 1998, Sky & Telescope magazine published an article by Donald W. Olson, Marilynn S. Olson and Russell L. Doescher arguing, in part, that Tycho's supernova was also the same \\"star that's westward from the pole\\" in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Tycho is directly referenced in Sarah Williams' poem The Old Astronomer: \\"Reach me down my Tycho Brah√©,‚ÄîI would know him when we meet\\". Though, the poem's oft quoted line comes later: \\"Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; / I have loved the stars too truly to be fearful of the night.\\" Alfred Noyes also wrote a long biographical poem in honor of Brahe. The lunar crater Tycho is named in his honour,Kenneth R. Lang. 2003. The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System. Kenneth R. Lang.

He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, The Carpet People, was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in 1983, after which Pratchett wrote an average of two books a year. The final Discworld novel, The Shepherd's Crown, was published in August 2015, five months after his death. Pratchett, with more than 85 million books sold worldwide in 37 languages, was the UK's best-selling author of the 1990s. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and was knighted for services to literature in the 2009 New Year Honours. In 2001 he won the annual Carnegie Medal for The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents, the first Discworld book marketed for children. He received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010. In December 2007, Pratchett announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. He later made a substantial public donation to the Alzheimer's Research Trust, filmed a television programme chronicling his experiences with the condition for the BBC, and became a patron for Alzheimer's Research UK. Pratchett died on 12 March 2015, aged 66.  Biography  =Early life= Pratchett was born on 28 April 1948 in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, England, the only child of David (1921‚Äì2006), a mechanic, and Eileen Pratchett (1922‚Äì2010), a secretary, of Hay-on-Wye.Bucks Free Press, p. 121 Sir Terry Pratchett Tribute. 20 March 2015. His maternal grandparents came from Ireland. Pratchett attended Holtspur School, where he was bullied for his speech impediments. He was bothered by the head teacher, who, he said, thought \\"he could tell how successful you were going to be in later life by how well you could read or write at the age of six\\". Pratchett's family moved to Bridgwater, Somerset, briefly in 1957. He passed his eleven plus exam in 1959, earning a place at High Wycombe Technical High School, where he was a key member of the debating societyJ. R. Hughes U6A, \\"The Senior Debating Society 1965\\", in Cygnet, Wycombe Technical High School Magazine, May 1966, Vol. 2, no. 1, p. [20]. and wrote stories for the school magazine.Stories in the Technical Cygnet: \\"Business Rivals\\" (later to be revised and published under the title \\"The Hades Business\\"), 1: 8, December 1962, pp. 18‚Äì29; \\"Look for the Little ‚Äì Dragon?\\" and \\"The Searcher\\" 1: 9, March 1964, pp. 28‚Äì29; \\"Solution\\" 1: 10, July 1964, p. 25; and \\"The Picture\\" 1:11, May 1965, p. 12. Pratchett described himself as a \\"non-descript\\" student and, in his Who's Who entry, credits his education to the Beaconsfield Public Library. Pratchett's early interests included astronomy. He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space, owned a telescope and wanted to be an astronomer, but lacked the necessary mathematical skills. He developed an interest in science fiction and attended science fiction conventions from about 1963‚Äì1964, but stopped a few years later when he got his first job as a trainee journalist at the local paper. His early reading included the works of H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and \\"every book you really ought to read\\", which he later regarded as \\"getting an education\\". Pratchett published his first short story, \\"Business Rivals\\", in the High Wycombe Technical School magazine in 1962. It is the tale of a man named Crucible who finds the Devil in his flat in a cloud of sulphurous smoke. \\"The Hades Business\\", which was published in the school magazine when he was 13, was published commercially when he was 15. Pratchett earned five O-levels and started A-level courses in Art, English and History. His initial career choice was journalism and he left school at 17, in 1965, to start an apprenticeship with Arthur Church, the editor of the Bucks Free Press. In this position he wrote, among other things, over 80 stories for the Children's Circle section under the name Uncle Jim. Two of the stories contain characters found in his novel The Carpet People (1971).Bucks Free Press, issues of 8 October to 23 December 1965, and 20 January to 3 March 1967. While on day release from his apprenticeship, Pratchett finished his A-Level in English and took the National Council for the Training of Journalists proficiency course. =Career= In 1968, Pratchett interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director of a small publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. Pratchett mentioned he had written a manuscript, The Carpet People. Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by Pratchett. It received strong, although few, reviewsPeter Grosvenor in the Daily Express, 9 December 1971; Rosemary Doyle in The Irish Times, 7 January 1972; Michael Pollard in Teacher's World, 7 March 1972. and was followed by the science fiction novels The Dark Side of the Sun (10 May 1976) and Strata (15 June 1981). After various positions in journalism, in 1980 Pratchett became Press Officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in an area that covered four nuclear power stations. He later joked that he had demonstrated \\"impeccable timing\\" by making this career change so soon after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania, US, and said he would \\"write a book about my experiences, if I thought anyone would believe it\\". The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983. The paperback edition was published by Corgi, an imprint of Transworld, in 1985. Pratchett's popularity increased when the BBC's Woman's Hour broadcast The Colour of Magic as a serial in six parts, and later Equal Rites. Subsequently, the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd, which remained Pratchett's publisher until 1997, Colin Smythe having become Pratchett's agent. Pratchett was the first fantasy author published by Gollancz. Pratchett gave up working for the CEGB to make his living through writing in 1987, after finishing the fourth Discworld novel, Mort. His sales increased quickly and many of his books occupied top places on the best-seller list; he was the UK's best-selling author of the 1990s. According to The Times, Pratchett was the top-selling and highest earning UK author in 1996. Some of his books have been published by Doubleday, another Transworld imprint. In the US, Pratchett is published by HarperCollins. According to the Bookseller's Pocket Yearbook (2005), in 2003 Pratchett's UK sales amounted to 3.4% of the fiction market by hardback sales and 3.8% by value, putting him in second place behind J. K. Rowling (6% and 5.6%, respectively), while in the paperback sales list Pratchett came 5th with 1.2% and 1.3% by value (behind James Patterson (1.9% and 1.7%), Alexander McCall Smith, John Grisham, and J. R. R. Tolkien). He has UK sales of more than 2.5 million copies a year. His 2011 Discworld novel Snuff became the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. =Alzheimer's disease= In August 2007, Pratchett was misdiagnosed as having had a minor stroke a few years before, which doctors believed had damaged the right side of his brain. In December 2007, he announced that he had been newly diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which had been responsible for the \\"stroke\\". He had a rare form of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a disease in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel. Describing the diagnosis as an \\"embuggerance\\" in a radio interview, Pratchett appealed to people to \\"keep things cheerful\\" and proclaimed that \\"we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism.\\" He stated he felt he had time for \\"at least a few more books yet\\", and added that while he understood the impulse to ask \\"is there anything I can do?\\", in this case he would only entertain such offers from \\"very high-end experts in brain chemistry.\\" Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software. Pratchett at Worldcon 2005 in Glasgow, August 2005 In March 2008, Pratchett announced he would donate US$1,000,000 (about ¬£494,000) to the Alzheimer's Research Trust, and that he was shocked \\"to find out that funding for Alzheimer's research is just 3% of that to find cancer cures.\\" He said: \\"I am, along with many others, scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the cure comes along.\\" In April 2008, Pratchett worked with the BBC to make a two-part documentary series about his illness, Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer's. The first part was broadcast on BBC Two on 4 February 2009, drawing 2.6 million viewers and a 10.4% audience share. The second, broadcast on 11 February 2009, drew 1.72 million viewers and a 6.8% audience share. The documentary won a BAFTA award in the Factual Series category. On 26 November 2008, Pratchett met the Prime Minister Gordon Brown and asked for an increase in dementia research funding. Pratchett tested a prototype device to address his condition. The ability of the device to alter the course of the illness has been met with skepticism from Alzheimer's researchers. In an article published 2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide, a term he disliked, before his disease progressed to a critical point.Irvine, Chris. Sir Terry Pratchett: coroner tribunals should be set up for assisted suicide cases, Telegraph, 2 August 2009. He later said he felt \\"it should be possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with medical help, rather than suffer\\". Pratchett was selected to give the 2010 BBC Richard Dimbleby Lecture, Shaking Hands With Death, broadcast on 1 February 2010. Pratchett introduced his lecture on the topic of assisted death, but the main text was read by his friend Tony Robinson because his condition made it difficult for him to read. In June 2011, Pratchett presented a BBC television documentary, Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, about assisted suicide. It won the Best Documentary award at the Scottish BAFTAs in November 2011. In September 2012, Pratchett told an interviewer: \\"I have to tell you that I thought I'd be a lot worse than this by now, and so did my specialist.\\" In the same interview, he said that the cognitive part of his mind was \\"untouched\\" and his symptoms were physical (normal for PCA).Grice, Elizabeth (10 September 2012). Sir Terry Pratchett: \\"I thought my Alzheimer's would be a lot worse than this by now\\". The Telegraph. Retrieved 2 October 2013. However, in July 2014, he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, citing his condition and \\"other age-related ailments\\". = Death = Pratchett died at his home on the morning of 12 March 2015 from Alzheimer's. The Telegraph reported an unidentified source as saying that despite his previous discussion of assisted suicide, his death had been natural. After Pratchett's death, his assistant, Rob Wilkins, wrote from the official Terry Pratchett Twitter account: The use of small capitals is a reference to how the character of Death speaks in Pratchett's works. Public figures who paid tribute include British Prime Minister David Cameron, comedian Ricky Gervais, and authors Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Brooks, Margaret Atwood, George R. R. Martin, and Neil Gaiman. Pratchett was memorialised in graffiti in East London. The video game companies Frontier Developments and Valve added elements to their games named after him. Users of the social news site Reddit organised a tribute by which an HTTP header, \\"\`X-Clacks-Overhead: GNU Terry Pratchett\`\\", was added to web sites' responses, a reference to the Discworld novel Going Postal, in which \\"the clacks\\" (Discworld's equivalent to a telegraph) are programmed to repeat the name of its creator's deceased son; the sentiment in the novel is that no one is ever forgotten as long as their name is still spoken. A June 2015 web server survey reported that approximately 84,000 websites had been configured with the header. Pratchett's humanist funeral service was held on 25 March 2015. Personal life Pratchett married Lyn Purves at the Congregational Church, Gerrards Cross, on 5 October 1968. They moved to Rowberrow, Somerset, in 1970. Their daughter Rhianna Pratchett, also a writer, was born there in 1976. In 1993, the family moved to Broad Chalke, a village west of Salisbury, Wiltshire. He was the patron of the Friends of High Wycombe Library. In 2013 he gave a talk at Beaconsfield Library which he had visited as a child and donated the income from the event to it. He also visited his former school to speak to the students. Pratchett often wore large, black hats, a style described as \\"more that of urban cowboy than city gent\\". Concern for the future of civilisation prompted him to install five kilowatts of photovoltaic cells (for solar energy) at his house. Interests =Computing= Pratchett started to use computers for writing as soon as they were available to him. His first computer was a Sinclair ZX81; the first computer he used properly for writing was an Amstrad CPC 464, later replaced by a PC. Pratchett was one of the first authors to routinely use the Internet to communicate with fans, and was a contributor to the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett from 1992. However, he did not consider the Internet a hobby, just another \\"thing to use\\". He had many computers in his house, with a bank of six monitors rigged up to ease writing. When he travelled, he always took a portable computer with him to write. In a 1995 interview with Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Pratchett expressed concern about the potential spread of misinformation online: \\"Let‚Äôs say I call myself the Institute for Something-or-other and I decide to promote a spurious treatise saying the Jews were entirely responsible for the second world war and the Holocaust didn‚Äôt happen, and it goes out there on the Internet and is available on the same terms as any piece of historical research which has undergone peer review and so on. There‚Äôs a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net. It‚Äôs all there: there‚Äôs no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up.\\" Gates disagreed, saying that online authorities would index and check facts and reputations in a much more sophisticated way than in print. The interview was rediscovered in 2019, and seen by Pratchett's biographer as prescient of fake news. Pratchett was also an avid video game player, and collaborated in the creation of a number of game adaptations of his books. He favoured games that are \\"intelligent and have some depth\\", citing Half-Life 2 and fan missions from Thief as examples. The red army in Interesting Times alludes to the game Lemmings, and when asked about this connection, Pratchett stated \\"Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that ... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back.\\" Additionally, he played Oblivion, which he described as \\"wonderful\\", and used many of its non-combat-oriented, fan-made mods. Pratchett wrote dialogue for a mod for Oblivion which added a Nord companion named Vilja. He also worked on a similar mod for Skyrim which featured Vilja's \\"great-great- granddaughter\\". =Natural history= Pratchett had a fascination with natural history that he referred to many times, and he owned a greenhouse full of carnivorous plants. He described them in the biographical notes on the dust jackets of some of his books, and elsewhere,Alt.Fan.Pratchett FAQ http://faqs.cs.uu.nl/na-dir/pratchett/afp-faq.html seen November 2019 as \\"not as interesting as people think\\". By Carpe Jugulum the account had become that he used to, but the plants had taken over the greenhouse, and he avoided going in.Biographical note, inside rear dustcover flap, Carpe jugulum \\\\ In 1995, a fossil sea-turtle from the Eocene epoch of New Zealand was named Psephophorus terrypratchetti in his honour by the palaeontologist Richard K√∂hler. In 2016, Pratchett fans petitioned the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to name chemical element 117, temporarily called ununseptium, as octarine with the proposed symbol Oc (pronounced \\"ook\\"). The final name chosen for element 117 was tennessine with the symbol Ts. Pratchett was a trustee for Orangutan Foundation but was pessimistic about the future of orangutans. His activities included visiting Borneo with a Channel 4 film crew to make an episode of \\"Jungle Quest\\" in 1995, seeing orangutans in their natural habitat. Following Pratchett's lead, fan events such as the Discworld Conventions have adopted Orangutan Foundation as their nominated charity, which has been acknowledged by the foundation. One of Pratchett's most popular fictional characters, the Librarian, is a wizard who was transformed into an orangutan in a magical accident and decides to remain in that condition as it is so convenient for his work. =Amateur astronomy= Pratchett had an observatory in his back garden and was a keen astronomer from childhood. He made an appearance on the BBC programme The Sky at Night. He had an observatory built in his garden. =Terry Pratchett First Novel Award= Pratchett sponsored a biennial award for unpublished science fiction novelists, the Terry Pratchett First Novel Award. The prize is a publishing contract with his publishers Transworld. In 2011 the award was won jointly by David Logan for Half Sick of Shadows and Michael Logan for Apocalypse Cow. In 2013 the award was won by Alexander Maskill for The Hive. =Sir Terry Pratchett Memorial Scholarship= In 2015, Pratchett's estate announced an in- perpetuity endowment to the University of South Australia. The Sir Terry Pratchett Memorial Scholarship supports a Masters scholarship at the University's Hawke Research Institute. = Views on religion = Pratchett, who was brought up in a Church of England family, described himself as atheist and a humanist. He was a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association) and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. Pratchett wrote that he read the Old Testament as a child and \\"was horrified\\", but \\"quite liked\\" the New Testament and thought that Jesus \\"had a lot of good things to say ... But I could never see the two testaments as one coherent narrative.\\" He then read On the Origin of Species, which \\"all made perfect sense ... Evolution was far more thrilling to me than the biblical account.\\" He said he had never disliked religion and thought it had a purpose in human evolution. In his novel Nation, the protagonist says \\"It is better to build a seismograph than to worship the volcano\\", a statement Pratchett said he agreed with. Pratchett told the Times in 2008: \\"I believe in the same God that Einstein did ... And it is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that on the other side of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows.\\" In an interview on Front Row, he described an experience hearing his deceased father's voice and feeling a sense of peace. Commentators took these statements to mean Pratchett had become religious; Pratchett responded in an article published in the Daily Mail in which he denied that he had found God, and clarified that he believed the \\"voice in his head\\" had come from a memory of his father and sense of personal elation. Awards and honours Guinness shortly after receiving an honorary degree from Trinity College, Dublin, in 2008 Pratchett received a knighthood for \\"services to literature\\" in the 2009 UK New Year Honours list. He was previously appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire, also for \\"services to literature\\", in 1998. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Pratchett commented in the Ansible SF/fan newsletter, \\"I suspect the 'services to literature' consisted of refraining from trying to write any,\\" but added, \\"Still, I cannot help feeling mightily chuffed about it.\\" On 31 December 2008, it was announced that Pratchett would be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours. Afterwards he said, \\"You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword.\\" Pratchett was the British Book Awards' 'Fantasy and Science Fiction Author of the Year' for 1994. Pratchett won the British Science Fiction Award in 1989 for his novel Pyramids, and a Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 2008 for Making Money. Pratchett was awarded ten honorary doctorates: University of Warwick in 1999, the University of Portsmouth in 2001, the University of Bath in 2003, the University of Bristol in 2004, Buckinghamshire New University in 2008, the University of Dublin in 2008, Bradford University in 2009, University of Winchester in 2009, The Open University in 2013 for his contribution to Public Service and his last, from the University of South Australia, in May 2014. Pratchett won the 2001 Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognising The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents as the year's best children's book published in the UK. Night Watch won the 2003 Prometheus Award for best libertarian novel. In 2003, BBC conducted The Big Read to identify the \\"Nation's Best-loved Novel\\" and finally published a ranked list of the \\"Top 200\\". Pratchett's highest-ranking novel was Mort, number 65, but he and Charles Dickens were the only authors with five in the Top 100 (four of his were from the Discworld series). He also led all authors with fifteen novels in the Top 200. Three of the five Discworld novels that centre on the \\"trainee witch\\" Tiffany Aching won the annual Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book in 2004, 2005 and 2007. In 2005, Going Postal was shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel; however, Pratchett recused himself, stating that stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of Worldcon.Ansible by Dave Langford; published September 2005; retrieved 16 March 2014The Hugo Nominees 2005, by Nicholas Whyte; at NicholasWhyte.info; published 5 June 2005 Pratchett received the NESFA Skylark Award in 2009 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010. In 2011 he won Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association, a lifetime honour for \\"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\\". The librarians cited nine Discworld novels published from 1983 to 2004 and observed that \\"Pratchett's tales of Discworld have won over generations of teen readers with intelligence, heart, and undeniable wit. Comic adventures that fondly mock the fantasy genre, the Discworld novels expose the hypocrisies of contemporary society in an intricate, ever-expanding universe. With satisfyingly multilayered plots, Pratchett's humor honors the intelligence of the reader. Teens eagerly lose themselves in a universe with no maps.\\" He was made an adjunct Professor in the School of English at Trinity College Dublin in 2010, with a role in postgraduate education in creative writing and popular literature. I Shall Wear Midnight won the 2010 Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) as a part of the Nebula Award ceremony. In 2016, SFWA announced that Sir Terry would be the recipient of the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award, presented at the 2016 SFWA Nebula Conference. An asteroid (127005 Pratchett) is named after him. In 2013, Pratchett was named Humanist of the Year by the British Humanist Association for his campaign to fund research into Alzheimers, his contribution to the right to die public debate and his Humanist values. =Fanbase= Pratchett's Discworld novels have led to dedicated conventions, the first in Manchester in 1996, then worldwide, often with the author as guest of honour. Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book signing tour; queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as the author continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time. His fans were not restricted by age or gender, and he received a large amount of fan mail from them. Pratchett enjoyed meeting fans and hearing what they think about his books, saying that since he was well paid for his novels, his fans were \\"everything\\" to him. Writing Pratchett said that to write, you must read extensively, both inside and outside your chosen genre and to the point of \\"overflow\\". He advised that writing is hard work, and that writers must \\"make grammar, punctuation and spelling a part of your life.\\" However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as \\"an unavoidable consequence\\", rather than the reason for writing. =Fantasy genre= Although during his early career he wrote for the sci-fi and horror genres, Pratchett later focused almost entirely on fantasy, and said: \\"It is easier to bend the universe around the story.\\" In the acceptance speech for his Carnegie Medal he said: \\"Fantasy isn't just about wizards and silly wands. It's about seeing the world from new directions\\", pointing to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. In the same speech, he acknowledged benefits of these works for the genre. Pratchett believed he owed \\"a debt to the science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of\\" and disliked the term \\"magical realism\\" which, he said, is \\"like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people ... who, on the whole, do not care that much.\\" He expressed annoyance that fantasy is \\"unregarded as a literary form\\", arguing that it \\"is the oldest form of fiction\\"; he described himself as \\"infuriated\\" when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres. He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental to the way we understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction. On 31 July 2005, Pratchett criticised media coverage of Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, commenting that certain members of the media seemed to think that \\"the continued elevation of J. K. Rowling can be achieved only at the expense of other writers\\". Pratchett later denied claims that this was a swipe at Rowling, and said that he was not making claims of plagiarism, but was pointing out the \\"shared heritage\\" of the fantasy genre. Pratchett also posted on the Harry Potter newsgroup about a media-covered exchange of views with her. =Style and themes= Pratchett is known for a distinctive writing style that included a number of characteristic hallmarks. One example is his use of footnotes, which usually involve a comic departure from the narrative or a commentary on the narrative, and occasionally have footnotes of their own. Pratchett's earliest Discworld novels were written largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series evolved into straightforward (though still comedic) satire. Pratchett had a tendency to avoid using chapters, arguing in a Book Sense interview that \\"life does not happen in regular chapters, nor do movies, and Homer did not write in chapters\\", adding \\"I'm blessed if I know what function they serve in books for adults.\\" However, there were exceptions; Going Postal and Making Money and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters. Pratchett offered explanations for his sporadic use of chapters; in the young adult titles, he said that he must use chapters because '[his] editor screams until [he] does', but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary 'stopping point' that got in the way of the narrative. Characters, place names, and titles in Pratchett's books often contain puns, allusions and cultural references. Some characters are parodies of well-known characters: for example, Pratchett's character Cohen the Barbarian, also called Ghengiz Cohen, is a parody of Conan the Barbarian and Genghis Khan, and his character Leonard of Quirm is a parody of Leonardo da Vinci. Another hallmark of his writing was the use of capitalised dialogue without quotation marks, used to indicate the character of Death communicating telepathically into a character's mind. Other characters or types of characters were given similarly distinctive ways of speaking, such as the auditors of reality not having quotation marks around the words they speak, Ankh-Morpork grocers never using punctuation correctly, and Golems Capitalising Each Word In Everything They Say. Also, common spelling mistakes were used to indicate a person's level of literacy. Pratchett made up a new colour, octarine, a 'fluorescent greenish-yellow- purple', which is the eighth colour in the Discworld spectrum‚Äîthe colour of magic. Indeed, the number eight itself is regarded in the Discworld as being a magical number; for example, the eighth son of an eighth son will be a wizard, and his eighth son will be a \\"sourcerer\\", extremely powerful users of magic with abilities far beyond what most wizards usually achieve (which is one reason why wizards are not allowed to have children). Discworld novels often included a modern innovation and its introduction to the world's medieval setting, such as a public police force (Guards! Guards!), guns (Men at Arms), submarines (Jingo), cinema (Moving Pictures), investigative journalism (The Truth), the postage stamp (Going Postal), modern banking (Making Money), and the steam engine (Raising Steam). The \\"clacks\\", the tower-to-tower semaphore system that sprang up in later novels, is a mechanical optical telegraph (as created by the Chappe brothers and employed during the French revolution) before wired electric telegraph chains, with all the change and turmoil that such an advancement implies. The resulting social upheaval driven by these changes serves as the setting for the main story. =Influences= Pratchett made no secret of outside influences on his work: they were a major source of his humour. He imported numerous characters from classic literature, popular culture and ancient history, always adding an unexpected twist. Pratchett was a crime novel fan, which was reflected in frequent appearances of the Ankh- Morpork City Watch in the Discworld series. Pratchett was an only child, and his characters are often without siblings. Pratchett explained, \\"In fiction, only-children are the interesting ones\\". Pratchett's earliest inspirations were The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame, and the works of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. His literary influences were P.G. Wodehouse, Tom Sharpe, Jerome K. Jerome, Roy Lewis, Alan Coren, G. K. Chesterton, and Mark Twain. =Publishing history= While Pratchett's UK publishing history remained quite stable, his relationships with international publishers were turbulent (especially in America). He changed German publishers after an advertisement for Maggi soup appeared in the middle of the German-language version of Pyramids. Works =Discworld= Pratchett began writing the Discworld series in 1983 to \\"have fun with some of the cliches\\" and it is a humorous and often satirical sequence of stories set in the colourful fantasy Discworld universe. The series contains various story arcs (or sub-series), and a number of free-standing stories. All are set in an abundance of locations in the same detailed and unified world, such as the Unseen University and 'The Drum/Broken Drum/Mended Drum' public house in the twin city Ankh-Morpork, or places in the various continents, regions and countries on the Disc. Characters and locations reappear throughout the series, variously taking major and minor roles. The Discworld is a large disc resting on the backs of four giant elephants, all supported by the giant turtle Great A'Tuin as it swims its way through space. The books are essentially in chronological order, and advancements can be seen in the development of the Discworld civilisations, such as the creation of paper money in Ankh-Morpork. Many of the novels in Pratchett's Discworld series parody real-world subjects such as film making, newspaper publishing, rock and roll music, religion, philosophy, Ancient Greece, Egyptian history, the Gulf War, Australia, university politics, trade unions, and the financial world. Pratchett also included further parody as a feature within the stories, including such subjects as Ingmar Bergman films, numerous fiction, science fiction, and fantasy characters, and various bureaucratic and ruling systems. The Science of Discworld Pratchett wrote four Science of Discworld books in collaboration with Professor of mathematics Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen, both of the University of Warwick: The Science of Discworld (1999), The Science of Discworld II: The Globe (2002), The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch (2005), and The Science of Discworld IV: Judgement Day (2013). All four books have chapters that alternate between fiction and non-fiction: the fictional chapters are set within the Discworld universe, where characters observe, and experiment on, a universe with the same physics as ours. The non-fiction chapters (written by Stewart and Cohen) explain the science behind the fictional events. In 1999, Pratchett appointed both Cohen and Stewart as \\"Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University\\" at the same ceremony at which the University of Warwick awarded him an honorary degree. Folklore of Discworld Pratchett collaborated with the folklorist Dr Jacqueline Simpson on The Folklore of Discworld (2008), a study of the relationship between many of the persons, places and events described in the Discworld books and their counterparts in myths, legends, fairy tales and folk customs on Earth. =Other writing= Pratchett's first two adult novels, The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place partly on a disc-shaped world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which was nominated for both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and Nation (2008), a book for young adults. After writing Good Omens, Pratchett brainstormed with Larry Niven on a story that would become the short novel \\"Rainbow Mars\\". Niven eventually completed the story on his own, but states in the afterword that a number of Pratchett's ideas remained in the finished version. Pratchett also collaborated with British science fiction author Stephen Baxter on a parallel earth series. The first novel, entitled The Long Earth was released on 21 June 2012. A second novel, The Long War, was released on 18 June 2013. The Long Mars was published in 2014. The fourth book in the series, The Long Utopia, was published in June 2015, and the fifth, The Long Cosmos, in June 2016. In 2012, the first volume of Pratchett's collected short fiction was published under the title A Blink of the Screen. In 2014, a similar collection was published of Pratchett's non- fiction, entitled A Slip of the Keyboard. = Children's literature = Pratchett's first children's novel was also his first published novel: The Carpet People in 1971, which Pratchett substantially rewrote and re-released in 1992. The next, Truckers (1988), was the first in The Nome Trilogy of novels for young readers (also known as The Bromeliad Trilogy), about small gnome-like creatures called \\"Nomes\\", and the trilogy continued in Diggers (1990) and Wings (1990). Subsequently, Pratchett wrote the Johnny Maxwell trilogy, about the adventures of a boy called Johnny Maxwell and his friends, comprising Only You Can Save Mankind (1992), Johnny and the Dead (1993) and Johnny and the Bomb (1996). Nation (2008) marked his return to the non- Discworld children's novel, and this was followed in 2012 by Dodger, a children's novel set in Victorian London. On 21 November 2013 Doubleday Children's released Pratchett's Jack Dodger's Guide to London. In September 2014 a collection of children's stories, Dragons at Crumbling Castle, written by Pratchett, and illustrated by Mark Beech, was published. This was followed by another collection, The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner, also illustrated by Mark Beech, in 2016. A third volume, Father Christmas's Fake Beard, was released in 2017. A fourth and final collection, The Time-travelling Caveman, was released in September 2020. =Collaborations and contributions= * The Unadulterated Cat (1989) is a humorous book of cat anecdotes written by Pratchett and illustrated by Gray Jolliffe. * Digital Dreams, edited by David V Barrett (1990), contains the science fiction short story '\\"#ifdefDEBUG + \\"world/enough\\" + \\"time\\". * Good Omens, written with Neil Gaiman (1990) * After the King: Stories In Honour of J.R.R.

The notes left behind outline ideas about \\"how the old folk of the Twilight Canyons solve the mystery of a missing treasure and defeat the rise of a Dark Lord despite their failing memories\\", \\"the secret of the crystal cave and the carnivorous plants in the Dark Incontinent\\", about Constable Feeney of the Watch, first introduced in Snuff, involving how he \\"solves a whodunnit among the congenitally decent and honest goblins\\", and on a second book about Amazing Maurice from The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents. Pratchett's daughter, writer Rihanna Pratchett, is the custodian of the Discworld franchise. She has said she has no plans to publish her father's unfinished work or continue the Discworld series. Pratchett told Neil Gaiman that anything that he had been working on at the time of his death should be put in the middle of a road and then destroyed by a steamroller. On 25 August 2017, Wilkins fulfilled this wish by crushing Pratchett's hard drive under a steamroller at the Great Dorset Steam Fair.

The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919 in Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which had directly led to the war. The other Central Powers on the German side signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919. Of the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required \\"Germany [to] accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage\\" during the war (the other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles). This article, Article 231, later became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty required Germany to disarm, make ample territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion gold marks (then $31.4 billion or ¬£6.6 billion, roughly equivalent to US$442 billion or UK¬£284 billion in ). At the time economists, notably John Maynard Keynes (a British delegate to the Paris Peace Conference), predicted that the treaty was too harsh‚Äîa \\"Carthaginian peace\\"‚Äîand said the reparations figure was excessive and counter-productive, views that, since then, have been the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists. On the other hand, prominent figures on the Allied side, such as French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently. The result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left no one satisfied, and, in particular, Germany was neither pacified nor conciliated, nor was it permanently weakened. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the Locarno Treaties, which improved relations between Germany and the other European powers, and the re-negotiation of the reparation system resulting in the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan, and the indefinite postponement of reparations at the Lausanne Conference of 1932. The treaty has sometimes been cited as a cause of World War II: although its actual impact was not as severe as feared, its terms led to great resentment in Germany which powered the rise of the Nazi Party. Although it is often referred to as the \\"Versailles Conference\\", only the actual signing of the treaty took place at the historic palace. Most of the negotiations were in Paris, with the \\"Big Four\\" meetings taking place generally at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay. Background =First World War= Newsreel footage of the signing of the peace treaty at Versailles On 28 June 1914, the heir to the throne of Austria- Hungary, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist. This caused a rapidly escalating July Crisis resulting in Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, followed quickly by the entry of most European powers into the First World War. Two alliances faced off, the Central Powers (led by Germany) and the Triple Entente (led by Britain, France and Russia). Other countries entered as fighting raged widely across Europe, as well as the Middle East, Africa and Asia. In 1917, two revolutions occurred within the Russian Empire. The new Bolshevik government under Vladimir Lenin in March 1918 signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that was highly favourable to Germany. Sensing victory before American armies could be ready, Germany now shifted forces to the Western Front and tried to overwhelm the Allies. It failed. Instead, the Allies won decisively on the battlefield and forced an armistice in November 1918 that resembled a surrender. =US entry and the Fourteen Points= On 6 April 1917, the United States entered the war against the Central Powers. The motives were twofold: German submarine warfare against merchant ships trading with France and Britain, which led to the sinking of the RMS Lusitania and the loss of 128 American lives; and the interception of the German Zimmermann Telegram, urging Mexico to declare war against the United States. The American war aim was to detach the war from nationalistic disputes and ambitions after the Bolshevik disclosure of secret treaties between the Allies. The existence of these treaties tended to discredit Allied claims that Germany was the sole power with aggressive ambitions.https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1918/commissar/gov.htm Statement by Trotsky on the publication of the secret treaties On 8 January 1918, President Woodrow Wilson issued the nation's postwar goals, the Fourteen Points. It outlined a policy of free trade, open agreements, and democracy. While the term was not used self-determination was assumed. It called for a negotiated end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a League of Nations to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all states.Fourteen Points Speech It called for a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial annexation. The Fourteen Points were based on the research of the Inquiry, a team of about 150 advisors led by foreign-policy advisor Edward M. House, into the topics likely to arise in the expected peace conference. =Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, 1918= alt=Map of Eastern Europe. A bold line shows the new border of Soviet Russia. The coloured portion indicates the area occupied by the Central Powers. After the Central Powers launched Operation Faustschlag on the Eastern Front, the new Soviet Government of Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany on 3 March 1918. This treaty ended the war between Russia and the Central powers and annexed of territory and 62 million people. This loss equated to a third of the Russian population, a quarter of its territory, around a third of the country's arable land, three-quarters of its coal and iron, a third of its factories (totalling 54 percent of the nation's industrial capacity), and a quarter of its railroads. =Armistice= During the autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse. Desertion rates within the German army began to increase, and civilian strikes drastically reduced war production. On the Western Front, the Allied forces launched the Hundred Days Offensive and decisively defeated the German western armies. Sailors of the Imperial German Navy at Kiel mutinied, which prompted uprisings in Germany, which became known as the German Revolution. The German government tried to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that they surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium. =Occupation= The terms of the armistice called for an immediate evacuation of German troops from occupied Belgium, France, and Luxembourg within fifteen days.Edmonds, (1943), p. 1 In addition, it established that Allied forces would occupy the Rhineland. In late 1918, Allied troops entered Germany and began the occupation. =Blockade= Both Germany and Great Britain were dependent on imports of food and raw materials, most of which had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The Blockade of Germany (1914‚Äì1919) was a naval operation conducted by the Allied Powers to stop the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs reaching the Central Powers. The German Kaiserliche Marine was mainly restricted to the German Bight and used commerce raiders and unrestricted submarine warfare for a counter-blockade. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 stated that civilians had died during the Allied blockade, although an academic study in 1928 put the death toll at Negotiations Big Four\\" nations at the Paris Peace Conference, 27 May 1919. From left to right: David Lloyd George, Vittorio Orlando, Georges Clemenceau, and Woodrow Wilson Talks between the Allies to establish a common negotiating position started on 18 January 1919, in the Salle de l'Horloge at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Initially, 70 delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. Russia was excluded due to their signing of a separate peace (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) and early withdrawal from the war. Furthermore, German negotiators were excluded to deny them an opportunity to divide the Allies diplomatically. Initially, a \\"Council of Ten\\" (comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) met officially to decide the peace terms. This council was replaced by the \\"Council of Five\\", formed from each country's foreign ministers, to discuss minor matters. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and United States President Woodrow Wilson formed the \\"Big Four\\" (at one point becoming the \\"Big Three\\" following the temporary withdrawal of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando). These four men met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions, which were later ratified by the entire assembly. The minor powers attended a weekly \\"Plenary Conference\\" that discussed issues in a general forum but made no decisions. These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final text of the treaty. =French aims= France had lost 1.3 million soldiers, including French men aged France had also been more physically damaged than any other nation (the so-called zone rouge (Red Zone); the most industrialized region and the source of most coal and iron ore in the north-east had been devastated and in the final days of the war mines had been flooded and railways, bridges and factories destroyed.) Clemenceau intended to ensure the security of France, by weakening Germany economically, militarily, territorially and by supplanting Germany as the leading producer of steel in Europe.Brown, p. 187 British economist and Versailles negotiator John Maynard Keynes summarized this position as attempting to \\"set the clock back and undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had accomplished.\\" Clemenceau told Wilson: \\"America is far away, protected by the ocean. Not even Napoleon himself could touch England. You are both sheltered; we are not\\". The French wanted a frontier on the Rhine, to protect France from a German invasion and compensate for French demographic and economic inferiority. American and British representatives refused the French claim and after two months of negotiations, the French accepted a British pledge to provide an immediate alliance with France if Germany attacked again, and Wilson agreed to put a similar proposal to the Senate. Clemenceau had told the Chamber of Deputies, in December 1918, that his goal was to maintain an alliance with both countries. Clemenceau accepted the offer, in return for an occupation of the Rhineland for fifteen years and that Germany would also demilitarise the Rhineland. French negotiators required reparations, to make Germany pay for the destruction induced throughout the war and to decrease German strength. The French also wanted the iron ore and coal of the Saar Valley, by annexation to France. The French were willing to accept a smaller amount of reparations than the Americans would concede and Clemenceau was willing to discuss German capacity to pay with the German delegation, before the final settlement was drafted. In April and May 1919, the French and Germans held separate talks, on mutually acceptable arrangements on issues like reparation, reconstruction and industrial collaboration. France, along with the British Dominions and Belgium, opposed mandates and favored annexation of former German colonies. =British aims= alt=A man poses for a photograph. Britain had suffered heavy financial costs but suffered little physical devastation during the war. However, the British wartime coalition was re-elected during the so-called Coupon election at the end of 1918, with a policy of squeezing the Germans \\"'til the pips squeak\\". Public opinion favoured a \\"just peace\\", which would force Germany to pay reparations and be unable to repeat the aggression of 1914, although those of a \\"liberal and advanced opinion\\" shared Wilson's ideal of a peace of reconciliation. In private Lloyd George opposed revenge and attempted to compromise between Clemenceau's demands and the Fourteen Points, because Europe would eventually have to reconcile with Germany. Lloyd George wanted terms of reparation that would not cripple the German economy, so that Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner. By arguing that British war pensions and widows' allowances should be included in the German reparation sum, Lloyd George ensured that a large amount would go to the British Empire. Lloyd George also intended to maintain a European balance of power to thwart a French attempt to establish itself as the dominant European power. A revived Germany would be a counterweight to France and a deterrent to Bolshevik Russia. Lloyd George also wanted to neutralize the German navy to keep the Royal Navy as the greatest naval power in the world; dismantle the German colonial empire with several of its territorial possessions ceded to Britain and others being established as League of Nations mandates, a position opposed by the Dominions. =American aims= Prior to the American entry into the war, Wilson had talked of a 'peace without victory'. This position fluctuated following the US entry into the war. Wilson spoke of the German aggressors, with whom there could be no compromised peace. However, on 8 January 1918, Wilson delivered a speech (known as the Fourteen Points) that declared the American peace objectives: the rebuilding of the European economy, self-determination of European and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, the promotion of free trade, the creation of appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, the creation of a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace. The aim of the latter was to provide a forum to revise the peace treaties as needed, and deal with problems that arose as a result of the peace and the rise of new states. Wilson brought along top intellectuals as advisors to the American peace delegation, and the overall American position echoed the Fourteen Points. Wilson firmly opposed harsh treatment on Germany. While the British and French wanted to largely annex the German colonial empire, Wilson saw that as a violation of the fundamental principles of justice and human rights of the native populations, and favored them having the right of self-determination via the creation of mandates. The promoted idea called for the major powers to act as disinterested trustees over a region, aiding the native populations until they could govern themselves. In spite of this position and in order to ensure that Japan did not refuse to join the League of Nations, Wilson favored turning over the former German colony of Shandong, in Eastern China, to Japan rather than return the area to Chinese control. Further confounding the Americans, was US internal partisan politics. In November 1918, the Republican Party won the Senate election by a slim margin. Wilson, a Democrat, refused to include prominent Republicans in the American delegation making his efforts seem partisan, and contributed to a risk of political defeat at home. =Italian aims= Vittorio Emanuele Orlando and his foreign minister Sidney Sonnino, an Anglican of British origins, worked primarily to secure the partition of the Habsburg Empire and their attitude towards Germany was not as hostile. Generally speaking, Sonnino was in line with the British position while Orlando favored a compromise between Clemenceau and Wilson. Within the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles, Orlando obtained certain results such as the permanent membership of Italy in the security council of the League of Nations and a promised transfer of British Jubaland and French Aozou strip to the Italian colonies of Somalia and Libya respectively. Italian nationalists, however, saw the War as a mutilated victory for what they considered to be little territorial gains achieved in the other treaties directly impacting Italy's borders. Orlando was ultimately forced to abandon the conference and resign. Orlando refused to see World War One as a mutilated victory, replying at nationalists calling for a greater expansion that \\"Italy today is a great state....on par with the great historic and contemporary states. This is, for me, our main and principal expansion.\\" Francesco Saverio Nitti took Orlando's place in signing the treaty of Versailles.da Atti Parlamentari, Camera dei Deputati, Discussioni Treaty content and signing German delegate alt=Numerous men stand and sit around a long table, while the man sitting in the foreground signs a document. In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including Articles 227, 230 and 231. In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within On 23 June, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty. On 28 June 1919, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the immediate impetus for the war), the peace treaty was signed. The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes, the prohibition on the merging of the Republic of German Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations, freedom of navigation on major European rivers, to the returning of a Koran to the king of Hedjaz.Articles 227‚Äì230Article 80Part XIIArticle 246 =Territorial changes= thumbrightGermany after Versailles: alt=A map of Germany. It is colour-coded to show the transfer of territory from German to the surrounding countries and define the new borders. The treaty stripped Germany of of territory and 7 million people. It also required Germany to give up the gains made via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and grant independence to the protectorates that had been established. In Western Europe Germany was required to recognize Belgian sovereignty over Moresnet and cede control of the Eupen-Malmedy area. Within six months of the transfer, Belgium was required to conduct a plebiscite on whether the citizens of the region wanted to remain under Belgian sovereignty or return to German control, communicate the results to the League of Nations and abide by the League's decision.Articles 33 and 34 To compensate for the destruction of French coal mines, Germany was to cede the output of the Saar coalmines to France and control of the Saar to the League of Nations for 15 years; a plebiscite would then be held to decide sovereignty.Articles 45 and 49 The treaty restored the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to France by rescinding the treaties of Versailles and Frankfurt of 1871 as they pertained to this issue.Section V preamble and Article 51 France was able to make the claim that the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine were indeed part of France and not part of Germany by disclosing a letter sent from the Prussian King to the Empress Eug√©nie that Eug√©nie provided, in which William I wrote that the territories of Alsace- Lorraine were requested by Germany for the sole purpose of national defense and not to expand the German territory. The sovereignty of Schleswig-Holstein was to be resolved by a plebiscite to be held at a future time (see Schleswig Plebiscites). In Central Europe Germany was to recognize the independence of Czechoslovakia (which had actually been controlled by Austria) and cede parts of the province of Upper Silesia.Articles 81 and 83 Germany had to recognize the independence of Poland and renounce \\"all rights and title over the territory\\". Portions of Upper Silesia were to be ceded to Poland, with the future of the rest of the province to be decided by plebiscite. The border would be fixed with regard to the vote and to the geographical and economic conditions of each locality.Article 88 and annex The province of Posen (now Pozna≈Ñ), which had come under Polish control during the Greater Poland Uprising, was also to be ceded to Poland. Pomerelia (Eastern Pomerania), on historical and ethnic grounds, was transferred to Poland so that the new state could have access to the sea and became known as the Polish Corridor. The sovereignty of part of southern East Prussia was to be decided via plebiscite while the East Prussian Soldau area, which was astride the rail line between Warsaw and Danzig, was transferred to Poland outright without plebiscite.Article 94 An area of was granted to Poland at the expense of Germany. Memel was to be ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, for disposal according to their wishes.Article 99 Germany was to cede the city of Danzig and its hinterland, including the delta of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea, for the League of Nations to establish the Free City of Danzig.Articles 100‚Äì104 =Mandates= German colonies (light blue) were made into League of Nations mandates. Article 119 of the treaty required Germany to renounce sovereignty over former colonies and Article 22 converted the territories into League of Nations mandates under the control of Allied states.Articles 22 and 119 Togoland and German Kamerun (Cameroon) were transferred to France. Ruanda and Urundi were allocated to Belgium, whereas German South-West Africa went to South Africa and Britain obtained German East Africa. As compensation for the German invasion of Portuguese Africa, Portugal was granted the Kionga Triangle, a sliver of German East Africa in northern Mozambique.Roberts, p. 496 Article 156 of the treaty transferred German concessions in Shandong, China, to Japan, not to China. Japan was granted all German possessions in the Pacific north of the equator and those south of the equator went to Australia, except for German Samoa, which was taken by New Zealand.Article 156 =Military restrictions= The treaty was comprehensive and complex in the restrictions imposed upon the post-war German armed forces (the Reichswehr). The provisions were intended to make the incapable of offensive action and to encourage international disarmament.Part V preamble Germany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920 to leave an army of no more than in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions. The treaty laid down the organisation of the divisions and support units, and the General Staff was to be dissolved.Articles 159, 160, 163 and Table 1 Military schools for officer training were limited to three, one school per arm, and conscription was abolished. Private soldiers and non- commissioned officers were to be retained for at least twelve years and officers for a minimum of with former officers being forbidden to attend military exercises. To prevent Germany from building up a large cadre of trained men, the number of men allowed to leave early was limited.Articles 173, 174, 175 and 176 alt=Three men sit on top of a large artillery piece. The number of civilian staff supporting the army was reduced and the police force was reduced to its pre-war size, with increases limited to population increases; paramilitary forces were forbidden.Articles 161, 162, and 176 The Rhineland was to be demilitarized, all fortifications in the Rhineland and east of the river were to be demolished and new construction was forbidden.Articles 42, 43, and 180 Military structures and fortifications on the islands of Heligoland and D√ºne were to be destroyed.Article 115 Germany was prohibited from the arms trade, limits were imposed on the type and quantity of weapons and prohibited from the manufacture or stockpile of chemical weapons, armoured cars, tanks and military aircraft.Articles 165, 170, 171, 172, 198 and tables No. II and III. The German navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and was limited to a maximum of six light cruisers (not exceeding ), twelve destroyers (not exceeding ) and twelve torpedo boats (not exceeding ) and was forbidden submarines.Articles 181 and 190 The manpower of the navy was not to exceed including manning for the fleet, coast defences, signal stations, administration, other land services, officers and men of all grades and corps. The number of officers and warrant officers was not allowed to exceed Article 80 Germany surrendered eight battleships, eight light cruisers, forty-two destroyers, and fifty torpedo boats for decommissioning. Thirty-two auxiliary ships were to be disarmed and converted to merchant use.Articles 185 and 187 Article 198 prohibited Germany from having an air force, including naval air forces, and required Germany to hand over all aerial related materials. In conjunction, Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft or related material for a period of six months following the signing of the treaty.Articles 198, 201, and 202 =Reparations= In Article 231 Germany accepted responsibility for the losses and damages caused by the war \\"as a consequence of the ... aggression of Germany and her allies.\\"Article 231 The treaty required Germany to compensate the Allied powers, and it also established an Allied \\"Reparation Commission\\" to determine the exact amount which Germany would pay and the form that such payment would take. The commission was required to \\"give to the German Government a just opportunity to be heard\\", and to submit its conclusions by . In the interim, the treaty required Germany to pay an equivalent of 20 billion gold marks ($5 billion) in gold, commodities, ships, securities or other forms. The money would help to pay for Allied occupation costs and buy food and raw materials for Germany.Articles 232‚Äì235 =Guarantees= Location of the alt=Map of northwest Europe showing France, Germany and the Low Countries. The Yellow area highlights the Rhineland of Germany. To ensure compliance, the Rhineland and bridgeheads east of the Rhine were to be occupied by Allied troops for fifteen years.Article 428 If Germany had not committed aggression, a staged withdrawal would take place; after five years, the Cologne bridgehead and the territory north of a line along the Ruhr would be evacuated. After ten years, the bridgehead at Coblenz and the territories to the north would be evacuated and after fifteen years remaining Allied forces would be withdrawn.Article 429 If Germany reneged on the treaty obligations, the bridgeheads would be reoccupied immediately.Article 430 =International organizations= Part I of the treaty, as per all the treaties signed during the Paris Peace Conference, was the Covenant of the League of Nations, which provided for the creation of the League, an organization for the arbitration of international disputes.Part I Part XIII organized the establishment of the International Labour Officer, to regulate hours of work, including a maximum working day and week; the regulation of the labour supply; the prevention of unemployment; the provision of a living wage; the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment; the protection of children, young persons and women; provision for old age and injury; protection of the interests of workers when employed abroad; recognition of the principle of freedom of association; the organization of vocational and technical education and other measures.Part XIII preamble and Article 388 The treaty also called for the signatories to sign or ratify the International Opium Convention.Article 295 Reactions =Britain= alt=An off white poster with bold black letters. The delegates of the Commonwealth and British Government had mixed thoughts on the treaty, with some seeing the French policy as being greedy and vindictive. Lloyd George and his private secretary Philip Kerr believed in the treaty, although they also felt that the French would keep Europe in a constant state of turmoil by attempting to enforce the treaty. Delegate Harold Nicolson wrote \\"are we making a good peace?\\", while General Jan Smuts (a member of the South African delegation) wrote to Lloyd-George, before the signing, that the treaty was unstable and declared \\"Are we in our sober senses or suffering from shellshock? What has become of Wilson's 14 points?\\" He wanted the Germans not be made to sign at the \\"point of the bayonet\\". Smuts issued a statement condemning the treaty and regretting that the promises of \\"a new international order and a fairer, better world are not written in this treaty\\". Lord Robert Cecil said that many within the Foreign Office were disappointed by the treaty. The treaty received widespread approval from the general public. Bernadotte Schmitt wrote that the \\"average Englishman ... thought Germany got only what it deserved\\" as a result of the treaty. However, public opinion changed as German complaints mounted. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, following the German re-militarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, stated that he was \\"pleased\\" that the treaty was \\"vanishing\\", expressing his hope that the French had been taught a \\"severe lesson\\".  Status of British Dominions  The Treaty of Versailles was an important step in the status of the British Dominions under international law. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa had each made significant contributions to the British war effort, but as separate countries, rather than as British colonies. India also made a substantial troop contribution, although under direct British control, unlike the Dominions. The four Dominions and India all signed the Treaty separately from Britain, a clear recognition by the international community that the Dominions were no longer British colonies. \\"Their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers, but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of Britain.\\" By signing the Treaty individually, the four Dominions and India also were founding members of the League of Nations in their own right, rather than simply as part of the British Empire. =France= The signing of the treaty was met with roars of approval, singing, and dancing from a crowd outside the Palace of Versailles. In Paris proper, people rejoiced at the official end of the war, the return of Alsace and Lorraine to France, and that Germany had agreed to pay reparations. While France ratified the treaty and was active in the League, the jubilant mood soon gave way to a political backlash for Clemenceau. The French Right saw the treaty as being too lenient and saw it as failing to achieve all of France's demands. Left-wing politicians attacked the treaty and Clemenceau for being too harsh (the latter turning into a ritual condemnation of the treaty, for politicians remarking on French foreign affairs, as late as August 1939). Marshal Ferdinand Foch stated \\"this (treaty) is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.\\"; a criticism over the failure to annex the Rhineland and for compromising French security for the benefit of the United States and Britain. When Clemenceau stood for election as President of France in January 1920, he was defeated. =Italy= Reaction in Italy to the treaty was extremely negative. The country had suffered high casualties, yet failed to achieve most of its major war goals, notably gaining control of the Dalmatian coast and Fiume. President Wilson rejected Italy's claims on the basis of \\"national self-determination.\\" For their part, Britain and France‚Äîwho had been forced in the war's latter stages to divert their own troops to the Italian front to stave off collapse‚Äîwere disinclined to support Italy's position at the peace conference. Differences in negotiating strategy between Premier Vittorio Orlando and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino further undermined Italy's position at the conference. A furious Vittorio Orlando suffered a nervous collapse and at one point walked out of the conference (though he later returned). He lost his position as prime minister just a week before the treaty was scheduled to be signed, effectively ending his active political career. Anger and dismay over the treaty's provisions helped pave the way for the establishment of Benito Mussolini's dictatorship three years later. =Portugal= Portugal entered the war on the Allied side in 1916 primarily to ensure the security of its African colonies, which were threatened with seizure by both Britain and Germany. To this extent, she succeeded in her war aims. The treaty recognized Portuguese sovereignty over these areas and awarded her small portions of Germany's bordering overseas colonies. Otherwise, Portugal gained little at the peace conference. Her promised share of German reparations never materialized, and a seat she coveted on the executive council of the new League of Nations went instead to Spain‚Äîwhich had remained neutral in the war. In the end, Portugal ratified the treaty, but got little out of the war, which cost more than 8,000 Portuguese troops and as many as 100,000 of her African colonial subjects their lives. =United States= Borah, Lodge and Johnson refuse Lady Peace a seat, referring to efforts by Republican isolationists to block ratification of Treaty of Versailles establishing the League of Nations After the Versailles conference, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson claimed that \\"at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!\\" However, the Republican Party, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, controlled the US Senate after the election of 1918, and the senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two-thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty. A discontent bloc of 12‚Äì18 \\"Irreconcilables\\", mostly Republicans but also representatives of the Irish and German Democrats, fiercely opposed the treaty. One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge. A second group of Democrats supported the treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article 10, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the US Congress. All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them. However, Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills. The closest the treaty came to passage was on 19 November 1919, as Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to end the chances of ratification permanently. Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the treaty, saying it favored the British. After Wilson's presidency, his successor Republican President Warren G. Harding continued American opposition to the formation of the League of Nations. Congress subsequently passed the Knox‚ÄìPorter Resolution bringing a formal end to hostilities between the United States and the Central Powers. It was signed into law by President Harding on 2 July 1921. Soon after, the US‚ÄìGerman Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Berlin on 25 August 1921, and two similar treaties were signed with Austria and Hungary on 24 and 29 August 1921, in Vienna and Budapest respectively. House's views Wilson's former friend Edward Mandell House, present at the negotiations, wrote in his diary on 29 June 1919: > I am leaving Paris, after eight fateful months, with conflicting emotions. > Looking at the conference in retrospect, there is much to approve and yet > much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more > difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those who are saying that the > treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve > Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting > it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new > states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries > is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have > preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been > made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were > lacking at Paris. =China= Many in China felt betrayed as the German territory in China was handed to Japan. Wellington Koo refused to sign the treaty and the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only nation that did not sign the Treaty of Versailles at the signing ceremony. The sense of betrayal led to great demonstrations in China such as the May 4th movement. There was immense dissatisfaction with Duan Qirui's government, which had secretly negotiated with the Japanese in order to secure loans to fund their military campaigns against the south. On 12 June 1919, the Chinese cabinet was forced to resign and the government instructed its delegation at Versailles not to sign the treaty. As a result, relations with the West deteriorated. =Germany= German delegates in Versailles: Professor Walther Sch√ºcking, Reichspostminister Johannes Giesberts, Justice Minister Otto Landsberg, Foreign Minister Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Prussian State President Robert Leinert, and financial advisor Carl Melchior On 29 April, the German delegation under the leadership of the Foreign Minister Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau arrived in Versailles. On 7 May, when faced with the conditions dictated by the victors, including the so-called \\"War Guilt Clause\\", von Brockdorff-Rantzau replied to Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd George: \\"We know the full brunt of hate that confronts us here. You demand from us to confess we were the only guilty party of war; such a confession in my mouth would be a lie.\\"Foreign Minister Brockdorff-Ranzau when faced with the conditions on 7 May: \\"Wir kennen die Wucht des Hasses, die uns hier entgegentritt. Es wird von uns verlangt, da√ü wir uns als die allein Schuldigen am Krieg bekennen; ein solches Bekenntnis w√§re in meinem Munde eine L√ºge\\". 2008 School Projekt Heinrich-Heine-Gesamtschule, D√ºsseldorf http://www.fkoester.de/kursbuch/unterrichtsmaterial/13_2_74.html Because Germany was not allowed to take part in the negotiations, the German government issued a protest against what it considered to be unfair demands, and a \\"violation of honour\\",2008 School Projekt Heinrich-Heine-Gesamtschule, D√ºsseldorf http://www.fkoester.de/kursbuch/unterrichtsmaterial/13_2_74.html soon afterwards withdrawing from the proceedings of the peace conference. Germans of all political shades denounced the treaty ‚Äî particularly the provision that blamed Germany for starting the war ‚Äî as an insult to the nation's honour. They referred to the treaty as \\"the Diktat\\" since its terms were presented to Germany on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Germany's first democratically elected head of government, Philipp Scheidemann, resigned rather than sign the treaty. In a passionate speech before the National Assembly on 12 May 1919, he called the treaty a \\"murderous plan\\" and exclaimed, ‚Äî After Scheidemann's resignation, a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer. President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west‚Äîand there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg‚Äîafter prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener‚Äîconcluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. However, rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities. Upon receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty. The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline. Foreign minister Hermann M√ºller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116. Reichstag =Japan= The Japanese felt they had been treated unfairly by the Allies, notably by the United States, France, and Great Britain, in the Treaty, for that they got as what they saw as not enough in return for their efforts against the German Empire during the course of the war. Japan attempted to amend Racial Equality Proposal in the treaty, which would require racial equality among members of the League of Nations. The amendment had broad support, but was effectively declined when it was rejected by the United States and Australia. Japanese nationalism grew in response to their growing mistrust of Western powers. As a result, Japan became alienated among world powers, allowing it to pursue its own strategic interests in Asia and the Pacific. Implementation =Reparations= On 5 May 1921, the reparation Commission established the London Schedule of Payments and a final reparation sum of 132 billion gold marks to be demanded of all the Central Powers. This was the public assessment of what the Central Powers combined could pay, and was also a compromise between Belgian, British, and French demands and assessments. Furthermore, the Commission recognized that the Central Powers could pay little and that the burden would fall upon Germany. As a result, the sum was split into different categories, of which Germany was only required to pay 50 billion gold marks ( billion); this being the genuine assessment of the commission on what Germany could pay, and allowed the Allied powers to save face with the public by presenting a higher figure. Furthermore, payments made between 1919 and 1921 were taken into account reducing the sum to 41 billion gold marks. In order to meet this sum, Germany could pay in cash or kind: coal, timber, chemical dyes, pharmaceuticals, livestock, agricultural machines, construction materials, and factory machinery. Germany's assistance with the restoration of the university library of Leuven, which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum. Territorial changes imposed by the treaty were also factored in. The payment schedule required million within twenty-five days and then million annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports. The German Government was to issue bonds at five per cent interest and set up a sinking fund of one per cent to support the payment of reparations. =Territorial changes= alt=A large number of people crowd outside a building. In February and March 1920, the Schleswig Plebiscites were held. The people of Schleswig were presented with only two choices: Danish or German sovereignty. The northern Danish-speaking area voted for Denmark while the southern German-speaking area voted for Germany, resulting in the province being partitioned. The East Prussia plebiscite was held on 11 July 1920. There was a out with the population wishing to remain with Germany. Further plebiscites were held in Eupen, Malmedy, and Prussian Moresnet. On 20 September 1920, the League of Nations allotted these territories to Belgium. These latter plebiscites were followed by a boundary commission in 1922, followed by the new Belgian-German border being recognized by the German Government on 15 December 1923. The transfer of the Hultschin area, of Silesia, to Czechoslovakia was completed on 3 February 1921. Following the implementation of the treaty, Upper Silesia was initially governed by Britain, France, and Italy. Between 1919 and 1921, three major outbreaks of violence took place between German and Polish civilians, resulting in German and Polish military forces also becoming involved. In March 1921, the Inter-Allied Commission held the Upper Silesia plebiscite, which was peaceful despite the previous violence. The plebiscite resulted in the population voting for the province to remain part of Germany. Following the vote, the League of Nations debated the future of the province. In 1922, Upper Silesia was partitioned: Oppeln, in the north-west, remained with Germany while Silesia Province, in the south-east, was transferred to Poland. Memel remained under the authority of the League of Nations, with a French military garrison, until January 1923. On 9 January 1923, Lithuanian forces invaded the territory during the Klaipƒóda Revolt. The French garrison withdrew, and in February the Allies agreed to attach Memel as an \\"autonomous territory\\" to Lithuania. On 8 May 1924, after negotiations between the Lithuanian Government and the Conference of Ambassadors and action by the League of Nations, the annexation of Memel was ratified. Lithuania accepted the Memel Statute, a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status while responsibility for the territory remained with the great powers. The League of Nations mediated between the Germans and Lithuanians on a local level, helping the power-sharing arrangement last until 1939. On 13 January 1935, 15 years after the Saar Basin had been placed under the protection of the League of Nations, a plebiscite was held to determine the future of the area. were cast, with ( the ballot) in favour of union with Germany; were cast for the status quo, and for union with France. The region returned to German sovereignty on 1 March 1935. When the result was announced including from Germany fled to France. =Rhineland occupation= alt=A soldier, on the right, faces a civilian, on the left. A second soldier, far center, walks towards the two. In late 1918, American, Belgian, British, and French troops entered the Rhineland to enforce the armistice. Prior to the treaty, the occupation force stood at roughly 740,000 men. Following the signing of the peace treaty, the numbers drastically decreased and by 1926 the occupation force numbered only 76,000 men. As part of the 1929 negotiations that would become the Young Plan, Stresemann and Aristide Briand negotiated the early withdrawal of Allied forces from the Rhineland. On 30 June 1930, after speeches and the lowering of flags, the last troops of the Anglo-French-Belgian occupation force withdrew from Germany. Belgium maintained an occupation force of roughly 10,000 troops throughout the initial years. This figure fell to 7,102 by 1926, and continued to fall as a result of diplomatic developments. The British Second Army, with some 275,000 veteran soldiers, entered Germany in late 1918. In March 1919, this force became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). The total number of troops committed to the occupation rapidly dwindled as veteran soldiers were demobilized, and were replaced by inexperienced men who had finished basic training following the cessation of hostilities. By 1920, the BAOR consisted of only 40,594 men and the following year had been further reduced to 12,421. The size of the BAOR fluctuated over the following years, but never rose above 9,000 men.Edmonds, Occupation of the Rhine, p. 147 The British did not adhere to all obligated territorial withdrawals as dictated by Versailles, on account of Germany not meeting her own treaty obligations. A complete withdrawal was considered, but rejected in order to maintain a presence to continue acting as a check on French ambitions and prevent the establishment of an autonomous Rhineland Republic. The French Army of the Rhine was initially 250,000 men strong, including at a peak 40,000 African colonial troops (Troupes coloniales). By 1923, the French occupation force had decreased to roughly 130,000 men, including 27,126 African troops. The troop numbers peaked again at 250,000 during the occupation of the Ruhr, before decreasing to 60,000 men by 1926. Germans viewed the use of French colonial troops as a deliberate act of humiliation, and used their presence to create a propaganda campaign dubbed the Black shame. This campaign lasted throughout the 1920s and 30s, although peaked in 1920 and 1921. For example, a 1921 German Government memo detailed 300 acts of violence from colonial troops, which included 65 murders and 170 sexual offenses. Historical consensus is that the charges were exaggerated for political and propaganda purposes, and that the colonial troops behaved far better than their white counterparts. An estimated 500‚Äì800 Rhineland Bastards were born as a result of fraternization between colonial troops and German women, and who would later be persecuted. The United States Third Army entered Germany with . In June 1919, the Third Army demobilized and by 1920 the US occupation force had been reduced to . Wilson further reduced the garrison to , prior to the inauguration of Warren G. Harding in 1921. On 7 January 1923, after the Franco‚ÄìBelgian occupation of the Ruhr, the US senate legislated the withdrawal of the remaining force. On 24 January, the American garrison started their withdrawal from the Rhineland, with the final troops leaving in early February. Violations =Reparations= Hitler announcing the Anschluss in violation of Art. 80 on the Heldenplatz, Vienna, 15 March 1938 The German economy was so weak that only a small percentage of reparations was paid in hard currency. Nonetheless, even the payment of this small percentage of the original reparations (132 billion gold marks) still placed a significant burden on the German economy. Although the causes of the devastating post-war hyperinflation are complex and disputed, Germans blamed the near-collapse of their economy on the treaty, and some economists estimated that the reparations accounted for as much as one-third of the hyper-inflation. In March 1921, French and Belgian troops occupied Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf, and other areas which formed part of the demilitarized Rhineland, according to the Treaty of Versailles. In January 1923, French and Belgian forces occupied the rest of the Ruhr area as a reprisal after Germany failed to fulfill reparation payments demanded by the Versailles Treaty. The German government answered with \\"passive resistance\\", which meant that coal miners and railway workers refused to obey any instructions by the occupation forces. Production and transportation came to a standstill, but the financial consequences contributed to German hyperinflation and completely ruined public finances in Germany. Consequently, passive resistance was called off in late 1923. The end of passive resistance in the Ruhr allowed Germany to undertake a currency reform and to negotiate the Dawes Plan, which led to the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr Area in 1925. =Military= In 1920, the head of the Reichswehr Hans von Seeckt clandestinely re-established the General Staff, by expanding the Truppenamt (Troop Office); purportedly a human resources section of the army. In March, German troops entered the Rhineland under the guise of attempting to quell possible unrest by communists and in doing so violated the demilitarized zone. In response, French troops advanced further into Germany until the German troops withdrew. German officials conspired systematically to evade the clauses of the treaty, by failing to meet disarmament deadlines, refusing Allied officials access to military facilities, and maintaining and hiding weapon production. As the treaty did not ban German companies from producing war material outside of Germany, companies moved to the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. Bofors was bought by Krupp, and in 1921 German troops were sent to Sweden to test weapons. The establishment of diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, via the Genoa Conference and Treaty of Rapallo, was also used to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles. Publicly, these diplomatic exchanges were largely in regards to trade and future economic cooperation. However, secret military clauses were included that allowed for Germany to develop weapons inside the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it allowed for Germany to establish three training areas for aviation, chemical and tank warfare.Fisher, p. 168Fisher, p. 171 In 1923, the British newspaper The Times made several claims about the state of the German Armed Forces: that it had equipment for , was transferring army staff to civilian positions in order to obscure their real duties, and warned of the militarization of the German police force by the exploitation the Kr√ºmper system. The Weimar Government also funded domestic rearmament programs, which were covertly funded with the money camouflaged in \\"X-budgets\\", worth up to an additional the disclosed military budget. By 1925, German companies had begun to design tanks and modern artillery. During the year, over half of Chinese arms imports were German and worth 13 million Reichsmarks. In January 1927, following the withdrawal of the Allied disarmament committee, Krupps ramped up production of armor plate and artillery. Production increased so that by 1937, military exports had increased to Reichsmarks. Production was not the only violation: \\"Volunteers\\" were rapidly passed through the army to make a pool of trained reserves, and paramilitary organizations were encouraged with the illegally militarized police. Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) were not limited by the treaty, thus this loophole was exploited and as such the number of NCOs were vastly in excess to the number needed by the Reichswehr. In December 1931, the Reichswehr finalized a second rearmament plan that called for 480 million Reichsmarks to be spent over the following five years: this program sought to provide Germany the capability of creating and supplying a defensive force of 21 divisions supported by aircraft, artillery, and tanks. This coincided with a 1 billion Reichsmark programme that planned for additional industrial infrastructure that would be able to permanently maintain this force. As these programs did not require an expansion of the military, they were nominally legal. On 7 November 1932, the Reich Minister of Defense Kurt von Schleicher authorized the illegal Umbau Plan for a standing army of 21 divisions based on soldiers and a large militia. Later in the year at the World Disarmament Conference, Germany withdrew to force France and Britain to accept German equality of status. London attempted to get Germany to return with the promise of all nations maintaining an equality in armaments and security. The British later proposed and agreed to an increase in the Reichswehr to men, and for Germany to have an air force half the size of the French. It was also negotiated for the French Army to be reduced. In October 1933, following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the founding of Nazi regime, Germany withdrew from League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. In March 1935, Germany reintroduced conscription followed by an open rearmament programme, the official unveiling of the Luftwaffe (air force), and signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement that allowed a surface fleet the size of the Royal Navy. The resulting rearmament programs was allotted 35 billion Reichsmarks over an eight-year period. =Territorial= On 7 March 1936, German troops entered and remilitarized the Rhineland. On 12 March 1938, following German pressure to the collapse the Austrian Government, German troops crossed into Austria and the following day Hitler announced the Anschluss: the annexation of Austria by Germany. The following year, on 23 March 1939, Germany annexed Memel from Lithuania. Historical assessments upright Historians are split on the impact of the treaty. Some saw it as a good solution in a difficult time, others saw it as a disastrous measure that would anger the Germans to seek revenge. The actual impact of the treaty is also disputed. In his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace, John Maynard Keynes referred to the Treaty of Versailles as a \\"Carthaginian peace\\", a misguided attempt to destroy Germany on behalf of French revanchism, rather than to follow the fairer principles for a lasting peace set out in President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Germany had accepted at the armistice. He stated: \\"I believe that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.\\" Keynes had been the principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference, and used in his passionate book arguments that he and others (including some US officials) had used at Paris. He believed the sums being asked of Germany in reparations were many times more than it was possible for Germany to pay, and that these would produce drastic instability.

Designed by Karl Goetz, the obverse of the coin depicts George Clemenceau presenting a bound treaty, decorated with skull and crossbones to Ulrich von Brockdorff- Rantzau. Other members of the Conference are standing behind Clemenceau, including Lloyd-George, Wilson and Orlando. French economist √âtienne Mantoux disputed that analysis. During the 1940s, Mantoux wrote a posthumously published book titled The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes in an attempt to rebut Keynes' claims. More recently economists have argued that the restriction of Germany to a small army saved it so much money it could afford the reparations payments. It has been argued ‚Äì for instance by historian Gerhard Weinberg in his book A World at Arms ‚Äì that the treaty was in fact quite advantageous to Germany. The Bismarckian Reich was maintained as a political unit instead of being broken up, and Germany largely escaped post-war military occupation (in contrast to the situation following World War II). In a 1995 essay, Weinberg noted that with the disappearance of Austria-Hungary and with Russia withdrawn from Europe, that Germany was now the dominant power in Eastern Europe. The British military historian Correlli Barnett claimed that the Treaty of Versailles was \\"extremely lenient in comparison with the peace terms that Germany herself, when she was expecting to win the war, had had in mind to impose on the Allies\\". Furthermore, he claimed, it was \\"hardly a slap on the wrist\\" when contrasted with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that Germany had imposed on a defeated Russian SFSR in March 1918, which had taken away a third of Russia's population (albeit mostly of non-Russian ethnicity), one-half of Russia's industrial undertakings and nine- tenths of Russia's coal mines, coupled with an indemnity of six billion marks. Eventually, even under the \\"cruel\\" terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany's economy had been restored to its pre-war status. Barnett also claims that, in strategic terms, Germany was in fact in a superior position following the Treaty than she had been in 1914. Germany's eastern frontiers faced Russia and Austria, who had both in the past balanced German power. Barnett asserts that its post-war eastern borders were safer, because the former Austrian Empire fractured after the war into smaller, weaker states, Russia was wracked by revolution and civil war, and the newly restored Poland was no match for even a defeated Germany. In the West, Germany was balanced only by France and Belgium, both of which were smaller in population and less economically vibrant than Germany. Barnett concludes by saying that instead of weakening Germany, the treaty \\"much enhanced\\" German power. Britain and France should have (according to Barnett) \\"divided and permanently weakened\\" Germany by undoing Bismarck's work and partitioning Germany into smaller, weaker states so it could never have disrupted the peace of Europe again. By failing to do this and therefore not solving the problem of German power and restoring the equilibrium of Europe, Britain \\"had failed in her main purpose in taking part in the Great War\\". upright The British historian of modern Germany, Richard J. Evans, wrote that during the war the German right was committed to an annexationist program which aimed at Germany annexing most of Europe and Africa. Consequently, any peace treaty that did not leave Germany as the conqueror would be unacceptable to them. Short of allowing Germany to keep all the conquests of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Evans argued that there was nothing that could have been done to persuade the German right to accept Versailles. Evans further noted that the parties of the Weimar Coalition, namely the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Christian democratic Centre Party, were all equally opposed to Versailles, and it is false to claim as some historians have that opposition to Versailles also equalled opposition to the Weimar Republic. Finally, Evans argued that it is untrue that Versailles caused the premature end of the Republic, instead contending that it was the Great Depression of the early 1930s that put an end to German democracy. He also argued that Versailles was not the \\"main cause\\" of National Socialism and the German economy was \\"only marginally influenced by the impact of reparations\\". Ewa Thompson points out that the treaty allowed numerous nations in Central and Eastern Europe to liberate themselves from oppressive German rule, a fact that is often neglected by Western historiography, more interested in understanding the German point of view. In nations that found themselves free as the result of the treaty ‚Äî such as Poles or Czechs ‚Äî it is seen as a symbol of recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by their much larger aggressive neighbours. Resentment caused by the treaty sowed fertile psychological ground for the eventual rise of the Nazi Party, but the German- born Australian historian J√ºrgen Tampke argued that it was \\"a perfidious distortion of history\\" to argue that the terms prevented the growth of democracy in Germany and aided the growth of the Nazi party; saying that its terms were not as punitive as often held and that German hyper-inflation in the 1920s was partly a deliberate policy to minimise the cost of repatriations. As an example of the arguments against the Versaillerdiktat he quotes Elizabeth Wiskemann who heard two officer's widows in Wiesbaden complaining that \\"with their stocks of linen depleted they had to have their linen washed once a fortnight (every two weeks) instead of once a month!\\" The German historian Detlev Peukert wrote that Versailles was far from the impossible peace that most Germans claimed it was during the interwar period, and though not without flaws was actually quite reasonable to Germany. Rather, Peukert argued that it was widely believed in Germany that Versailles was a totally unreasonable treaty, and it was this \\"perception\\" rather than the \\"reality\\" of the Versailles treaty that mattered. Peukert noted that because of the \\"millenarian hopes\\" created in Germany during World War I when for a time it appeared that Germany was on the verge of conquering all of Europe, any peace treaty the Allies of World War I imposed on the defeated German Reich were bound to create a nationalist backlash, and there was nothing the Allies could have done to avoid that backlash. Having noted that much, Peukert commented that the policy of rapprochement with the Western powers that Gustav Stresemann carried out between 1923 and 1929 were constructive policies that might have allowed Germany to play a more positive role in Europe, and that it was not true that German democracy was doomed to die in 1919 because of Versailles. Finally, Peukert argued that it was the Great Depression and the turn to a nationalist policy of autarky within Germany at the same time that finished off the Weimar Republic, not the Treaty of Versailles. French historian Raymond Cartier states that millions of Germans in the Sudetenland and in Posen-West Prussia were placed under foreign rule in a hostile environment, where harassment and violation of rights by authorities are documented. Cartier asserts that, out of 1,058,000 Germans in Posen-West Prussia in 1921, 758,867 fled their homelands within five years due to Polish harassment. These sharpening ethnic conflicts would lead to public demands to reattach the annexed territory in 1938 and become a pretext for Hitler's annexations of Czechoslovakia and parts of Poland. According to David Stevenson, since the opening of French archives, most commentators have remarked on French restraint and reasonableness at the conference, though Stevenson notes that \\"[t]he jury is still out\\", and that \\"there have been signs that the pendulum of judgement is swinging back the other way.\\" =Territorial changes= Map of territorial changes in Europe after World War I (as of 1923) The Treaty of Versailles resulted in the creation of several thousand miles of new boundaries, with maps playing a central role in the negotiations at Paris. The plebiscites initiated due to the treaty have drawn much comment. Historian Robert Peckham wrote that the issue of Schleswig \\"was premised on a gross simplification of the region's history. ... Versailles ignored any possibility of there being a third way: the kind of compact represented by the Swiss Federation; a bilingual or even trilingual Schleswig- Holsteinian state\\" or other options such as \\"a Schleswigian state in a loose confederation with Denmark or Germany, or an autonomous region under the protection of the League of Nations.\\" In regards to the East Prussia plebiscite, historian Richard Blanke wrote that \\"no other contested ethnic group has ever, under un-coerced conditions, issued so one-sided a statement of its national preference\\". Richard Debo wrote \\"both Berlin and Warsaw believed the Soviet invasion of Poland had influenced the East Prussian plebiscites. Poland appeared so close to collapse that even Polish voters had cast their ballots for Germany\\". In regards to the Silesian plebiscite, Blanke observed \\"given that the electorate was at least 60% Polish-speaking, this means that about one 'Pole' in three voted for Germany\\" and \\"most Polish observers and historians\\" have concluded that the outcome of the plebiscite was due to \\"unfair German advantages of incumbency and socio-economic position\\". Blanke alleged \\"coercion of various kinds even in the face of an allied occupation regime\\" occurred, and that Germany granted votes to those \\"who had been born in Upper Silesia but no longer resided there\\". Blanke concluded that despite these protests \\"there is plenty of other evidence, including Reichstag election results both before and after 1921 and the large- scale emigration of Polish-speaking Upper Silesians to Germany after 1945, that their identification with Germany in 1921 was neither exceptional nor temporary\\" and \\"here was a large population of Germans and Poles‚Äînot coincidentally, of the same Catholic religion‚Äîthat not only shared the same living space but also came in many cases to see themselves as members of the same national community\\". Prince Eustachy Sapieha, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, alleged that Soviet Russia \\"appeared to be intentionally delaying negotiations\\" to end the Polish-Soviet War \\"with the object of influencing the Upper Silesian plebiscite\\". Once the region was partitioned, both \\"Germany and Poland attempted to 'cleanse' their shares of Upper Silesia\\" via oppression resulting in Germans migrating to Germany and Poles migrating to Poland. Despite the oppression and migration, Opole Silesia \\"remained ethnically mixed.\\" Frank Russell wrote that, in regards to the Saar plebiscite, the inhabitants \\"were not terrorized at the polls\\" and the \\"totalitarian [Nazi] German regime was not distasteful to most of the Saar inhabitants and that they preferred it even to an efficient, economical, and benevolent international rule.\\" When the outcome of the vote became known, 4,100 (including 800 refugees who had previously fled Germany) residents fled over the border into France. =Military terms and violations= During the formulation of the treaty, the British wanted Germany to abolish conscription but be allowed to maintain a volunteer Army. The French wanted Germany to maintain a conscript army of up to 200,000 men in order to justify their own maintenance of a similar force. Thus the treaty's allowance of 100,000 volunteers was a compromise between the British and French positions. Germany, on the other hand, saw the terms as leaving them defenseless against any potential enemy. Bernadotte Everly Schmitt wrote that \\"there is no reason to believe that the Allied governments were insincere when they stated at the beginning of Part V of the Treaty ... that in order to facilitate a general reduction of the armament of all nations, Germany was to be required to disarm first.\\" A lack of American ratification of the treaty or joining the League of Nations left France unwilling to disarm, which resulted in a German desire to rearm. Schmitt argued \\"had the four Allies remained united, they could have forced Germany really to disarm, and the German will and capacity to resist other provisions of the treaty would have correspondingly diminished.\\" Max Hantke and Mark Spoerer wrote \\"military and economic historians [have] found that the German military only insignificantly exceeded the limits\\" of the treaty prior to 1933. Adam Tooze concurred, and wrote \\"To put this in perspective, annual military spending by the Weimar Republic was counted not in the billions but in the hundreds of millions of Reichsmarks\\"; for example, the Weimar Republic's 1931 program of 480 million Reichsmarks over five years compared to the Nazi Government's 1933 plan to spend 4.4 billion Reichsmarks per year. P. M. H. Bell argued that the British Government was aware of later Weimar rearming, and lent public respectability to the German efforts by not opposing them, an opinion shared by Churchill.The Second World War Norman Davies wrote that \\"a curious oversight\\" of the military restrictions were that they \\"did not include rockets in its list of prohibited weapons\\", which provided Wernher von Braun an area to research within eventually resulting in \\"his break [that] came in 1943\\" leading to the development of the V-2 rocket. = Rise of the Nazis = The Treaty created much resentment in Germany, which was exploited by Adolf Hitler in his rise to power at the helm of Nazi Germany. Central to this was belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, which held that the German army had not lost the war and had been betrayed by the Weimar Republic, who negotiated an unnecessary surrender. The Great Depression exacerbated the issue and led to a collapse of the German economy. Though the treaty may not have caused the crash, it was a convenient scapegoat. Germans viewed the treaty as a humiliation and eagerly listened to Hitler's oratory which blamed the treaty for Germany's ills. Hitler promised to reverse the depredations of the Allied powers and recover Germany's lost territory and pride, which has led to the treaty being cited as a cause of World War II.

Published in 1987, it is the fourth Discworld novel and the first to focus on the character Death, who only appeared as a side character in the previous novels. The title is the name of its main character, and is also a play on words: in French, mort means \\"death\\". The French language edition is titled Mortimer. In the BBC's 2003 Big Read contest, viewers voted on the \\"Nation's Best-loved Book\\"; Mort was among the Top 100 and chosen as the most popular of Pratchett's novels.BBC ‚Äì The Big Read ‚Äì Top 100 Books April 2003, Retrieved 2009-05-9 In 2004, Pratchett stated that Mort was the first Discworld novel with which he was \\"pleased\\", stating that in previous books, the plot had existed to support the jokes, but that in Mort, the plot was integral.Terry Pratchett, interviewed on Bookclub; broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 4 July 2004; retrieved 25 March 2016 Plot summary As a teenager, Mort has a personality and temperament that makes him unsuited to the family farming business. Mort's father Lezek takes him to a local hiring fair in the hope that Mort will land an apprenticeship; not only would this provide a job for his son, but it would also make his son's propensity for thinking into someone else's problem. Just before the last stroke of midnight, Death arrives and takes Mort on as an apprentice (though his father thinks he has been apprenticed to an undertaker). Death takes Mort to his domain, where he meets Death's elderly manservant Albert, and his adopted daughter Ysabell. Mort later accompanies Death as he travels to collect the soul of a king, who is due to be assassinated by the scheming Duke of Sto Helit. After Mort unsuccessfully tries to prevent the assassination, Death warns him that all deaths are predetermined, and that he cannot interfere with fate. Later on, Death assigns Mort to collect the soul of Princess Keli, daughter of the murdered king, but he instead kills the assassin the Duke had sent after her. Keli lives, but shortly after the assassin's death people begin acting as if something had happened without knowing why such as a solemn song being played. She soon finds that the rest of the world no longer acknowledges her existence at all unless she confronts them and even then only in a confused manner which is forgotten immediately after. She subsequently employs the wizard Igneous Cutwell, who is able to see her as he is trained to see things that are invisible to normal people (like death) to make her existence clear to the public. Mort eventually discovers that his actions have created an alternate reality in which Keli lives, but he also learns that it is being overridden by the original reality and will eventually cease to exist, killing Keli. While consulting Cutwell, Mort sees a picture of Unseen University's founder, Alberto Malich, noting that he bears a resemblance to Albert. Mort and Ysabell travel into the Stack, a library in Death's domain that holds the biographies of everyone who has ever lived, in order to investigate Albert, eventually discovering that he is indeed Malich. They further learn that Malich had feared monsters waiting for him in the afterlife, and performed a reversed version of the Rite of AshkEnte in the hope of keeping Death away from him. However, the spell backfired and sent him to Death's side, where he has remained in order to put off his demise. During this time, Death, yearning to relish what being human is like, travels to Ankh-Morpork to indulge in new experiences, including getting drunk, dancing, gambling and finding a job. Mort in turn starts to become more like Death, adopting his mannerisms and aspects of his personality, while his own is slowly overridden. Death's absence forces Mort to collect the next two souls, who are both located on separate parts of the Disc, and due to die on the same night that the alternate reality will be destroyed. Before he and Ysabell leave to collect the souls, Mort uses the part of Death within him to force Albert to provide a spell that will slow down the alternate reality's destruction. After Mort and Ysabell leave, Albert returns to Unseen University, under the identity of Malich. His eagerness to live on the Disc is reinvigorated during this time, and he has the wizards perform the Rite of AshkEnte in the hope of finally escaping Death's grasp. The ritual summons both Death and the part of Death that had been taking Mort over, restoring him to normal. Unaware of Albert's treachery, Death takes him back into his service, the Librarian preventing the wizard's escape. Mort and Ysabell travel to Keli's palace, where the princess and Cutwell have organised a hasty coronation ceremony in the hope that Keli can be crowned queen before the alternate reality is destroyed. With the reality now too small for Albert's spell, Mort and Ysabell save Keli and Cutwell from being destroyed with the alternate reality. They return to Death's domain to find a furious Death waiting for them, the latter having learned of Mort's actions from Albert. Death dismisses Mort and attempts to take the souls of Keli and Cutwell, but Mort challenges him to a duel for them. Though Death eventually wins the duel, he spares Mort's life and sends him back to the Disc. Death convinces the gods to change the original reality so that Keli rules in place of the Duke, who was inadvertently killed during Death and Mort's duel. Mort and Ysabell ‚Äì who have fallen in love over the course of the story ‚Äì get married, and are made Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit by Keli, while Cutwell is made the Master of the Queen's Bedchamber. Death attends Mort and Ysabell's reception, where he warns Mort that he will have to make sure that the original Duke's destiny is fulfilled, and presents him with the alternate reality he created, now shrunk to the size of a large pearl, before the two part on amicable terms.

He is a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Berners- Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989, then implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in mid-November.Tim Berners Lee's own reference. The exact date is unknown. Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe. In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. In April 2009, he was elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the \\"Inventor of the World Wide Web\\" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium. He tweeted \\"This is for everyone\\" which appeared in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the audience. He received the 2016 Turing Award \\"for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale\\". Early life and education Berners- Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England, the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is an expert on greenhouse gases. His parents were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. He studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first- class bachelor of arts degree in physics. While at university, Berners-Lee made a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop. Career and research Berners-Lee, 2005 After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for printers. Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE. After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset. He ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a \\"real-time remote procedure call\\" which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow. In 1989, CERN was the largest internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the internet: This NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee at CERN and became the world's first web server Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall, who called his proposals 'vague, but exciting'. He used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first web browser. His software also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon). Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get started with your own website. In a list of 80 cultural moments that shaped the world, chosen by a panel of 25 eminent scientists, academics, writers, and world leaders, the invention of the World Wide Web was ranked number one, with the entry stating, \\"The fastest growing communications medium of all time, the internet has changed the shape of modern life forever. We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world\\". In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone. In 2001, Berners- Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset.Klooster, John W., (2009), Icons of Invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates, ABC-CLIO, p. 611. In December 2004, he accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web. In a Times article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes (\\"//\\") in a web address were \\"unnecessary\\". He told the newspaper that he easily could have designed web addresses without the slashes. \\"There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time\\", he said in his lighthearted apology. =Policy work= Tim Berners-Lee at the Home Office, London, on 11 March 2010 In June 2009, then- British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would work with the UK government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force. Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk, a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free re-use. Commenting on the opening up of Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said that: \\"The changes signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to‚Äînot the other way around.\\" He went on to say: \\"Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.\\" Berners-Lee speaking at the launch of the World Wide Web Foundation In November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation (WWWF) in order to campaign to \\"advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change.\\"FAQ‚ÄîWorld Wide Web Foundation.

As W3C director he went on to approve the finalised specification in July 2017. His stance was opposed by some including Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the anti-DRM campaign Defective by Design and the Free software foundation. Varied concerns raised included being not supportive of the internet's open philosophy against commercial interests and risks of users being forced to use a particular web browser to view specific DRM content. The EFF raised a formal appeal which did not succeed and the EME specification became a formal W3C recommendation in September 2017. On 30 September 2018, Berners-Lee announced his new open-source startup Inrupt to fuel a commercial ecosystem around the Solid project, which aims to give users more control over their personal data and lets users choose where the data goes, who's allowed to see certain elements and which apps are allowed to see that data. In November 2019 at the Internet Governance Forum in Berlin Berners-Lee and the WWWF launched Contract for the Web, a campaign initiative to persuade governments, companies and citizens to commit to nine principles to stop \\"misuse\\" with the warning that \\"if we don't act nowand act togetherto prevent the web being misused by those who want to exploit, divide and undermine, we are at risk of squandering [its potential for good]\\". =Awards and honours= Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours \\"for services to the global development of the internet\\", and was invested formally on 16 July 2004. On 13 June 2007, he was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM), an order restricted to 24 (living) members. Bestowing membership of the Order of Merit is within the personal purview of the Queen, and does not require recommendation by ministers or the Prime Minister. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001. He has been conferred honorary degrees from a number of Universities around the world, including Manchester (his parents worked on the Manchester Mark 1 in the 1940s), Harvard and Yale.\\"Yale awards 12 honorary degrees at 2014 graduation\\".

In 2012, Berners-Lee was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork ‚Äì the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover ‚Äì to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires to mark his 80th birthday. In 2013, he was awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. On 4 April 2017, he received the 2016 ACM Turing Award \\"for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale\\". Personal life Berners-Lee has said \\"I like to keep work and personal life separate\\". Berners-Lee married Nancy Carlson, an American computer programmer, in 1990. She was also working in Switzerland at the World Health Organization. They had two children and divorced in 2011. In 2014, he married Rosemary Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London.\\"Ms Rosemary Leith and Sir Tim Berners-Lee are delighted to announce that they celebrated their marriage on 20 June 2014....\\" World Wide Web Foundation. Leith is a Canadian internet and banking entrepreneur and a founding director of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation. The couple also collaborate on venture capital to support artificial intelligence companies. Berners-Lee was raised as an Anglican, but he turned away from religion in his youth. After he became a parent, he became a Unitarian Universalist (UU). When asked whether he believes in God, he stated: \\"Not in the sense of most people, I'm atheist and Unitarian Universalist\\".

He is known as \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. The stories regarding Huxley's famous debate in 1860 with Samuel Wilberforce were a key moment in the wider acceptance of evolution and in his own career, although historians think that the surviving story of the debate is a later fabrication.Livingstone, David. \\"Myth 17. That Huxley Defeated Wilberforce in Their Debate over Evolution and Religion,\\" in Numbers, Ronald L., ed. Galileo goes to jail and other myths about science and religion. No. 74. Harvard University Press, 2009, 152-160. Huxley had been planning to leave Oxford on the previous day, but, after an encounter with Robert Chambers, the author of Vestiges, he changed his mind and decided to join the debate. Wilberforce was coached by Richard Owen, against whom Huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes. Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as gradualism, and was undecided about natural selection, but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. Instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain, he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition. Originally coining the term in 1869, Huxley elaborated on \\"agnosticism\\" in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not. Huxley states > Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which > lies in the rigorous application of a single principle... the fundamental > axiom of modern science... In matters of the intellect, follow your reason > as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration... In > matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which > are not demonstrated or demonstrable.Huxley, T. H. (Feb, 1889). II. > Agnosticism. In Christianity and Agnosticism: A controversy. New York, NY: > The Humboldt Publishing Co. Retrieved from > https://archive.org/stream/agnosticism00variuoft/agnosticism00variuoft_djvu.txt Use of that term has continued to the present day (see Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism).Huxley T. H. 1889. Agnosticism: a rejoinder. In Collected Essays vol 5 Science and Christian tradition. Macmillan, London. Much of Huxley's agnosticism is influenced by Kantian views on human perception and the ability to rely on rational evidence rather than belief systems.Lightman, B. (1987) The Origins of Agnosticism: Victorian Unbelief and the Limits of Knowledge.. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1086/ahr/94.2.444 Huxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self-taught. He became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the later 19th century.Poulton E. B. 1909. Charles Darwin and the origin of species. London. He worked on invertebrates, clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on vertebrates, especially on the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing Archaeopteryx with Compsognathus, he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, a theory widely accepted today. The tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution, and by his extensive public work on scientific education, both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere.Lankester E. Ray 1895. The Right Hon. T. H. Huxley. Athenaeum, 6 July. Lankester commented that Huxley was \\"only accidentally a zoologist\\". 'Huxley in perspective', 235‚Äì261, an outstanding summary of Huxley in his social & historical context, scarcely mentions his zoological work. Huxley's 1893 Romanes Lecture, ‚ÄúEvolution and Ethics‚Äù is exceedingly influential in China; the Chinese translation of Huxley's lecture even transformed the Chinese translation of Darwin's Origin of Species.  Early life  Thomas Henry Huxley was born in Ealing, which was then a village in Middlesex. He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers. Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as Alfred Russel Wallace, Huxley was brought up in a literate middle- class family which had fallen on hard times. His father was a mathematics teacher at Ealing School until it closed,Bibby, amongst others, queried this account, which owes its origin to Leonard Huxley's biography (1900). Bibby, Cyril. 1959. T. H. Huxley: scientist, humanist and educator. Watts, London. p. 3‚Äì4 putting the family into financial difficulties. As a result, Thomas left school at the age of 10, after only two years of formal schooling. Despite this unenviable start, Huxley was determined to educate himself. He became one of the great autodidacts of the nineteenth century. At first he read Thomas Carlyle, James Hutton's Geology, and Hamilton's Logic. In his teens he taught himself German, eventually becoming fluent and used by Charles Darwin as a translator of scientific material in German. He learned Latin, and enough Greek to read Aristotle in the original. Huxley, aged 21 Later on, as a young adult, he made himself an expert, first on invertebrates, and later on vertebrates, all self-taught. He was skilled in drawing and did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates. In his later debates and writing on science and religion his grasp of theology was better than many of his clerical opponents. Huxley, a boy who left school at ten, became one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain. He was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his brother-in-law John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments using mesmerism for medical purposes. Chandler's practice was in London's Rotherhithe amidst the squalor endured by the Dickensian poor. Here Thomas would have seen poverty, crime and rampant disease at its worst.Chesney, Kellow 1970. The Victorian underworld. Temple Smith, London; Pelican 1972, pp. 105, 421. Next, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister's husband. Now 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind University College Hospital), a cut-price anatomy school whose founder, Marshall Hall, discovered the reflex arc. All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading, which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling. A year later, buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the Apothecaries' yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital, where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones, Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at University College London. Jones had been Robert Knox's assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare.The cut-price anatomy schools and Robert Knox are well treated in Desmond's account of materialist medical dissidents of the 1820s and 30s: Desmond A. 1989. The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine and reform in radical London. Chicago. The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley's layer. No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor. At twenty he passed his First M.B. examination at the University of London, winning the gold medal for anatomy and physiology. However, he did not present himself for the final (Second M.B.) exams and consequently did not qualify with a university degree. His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy.  Voyage of the Rattlesnake  Aged 20, Huxley was too young to apply to the Royal College of Surgeons for a licence to practise, yet he was 'deep in debt'. p. 35 So, at a friend's suggestion, he applied for an appointment in the Royal Navy. He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy. Sir William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a viva voce). HMS Rattlesnake by the ship's artist Oswald Brierly Finally Huxley was made Assistant Surgeon ('surgeon's mate', but in practice marine naturalist) to HMS Rattlesnake, about to set sail on a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia. The Rattlesnake left England on 3 December 1846 and, once they had arrived in the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates. He began to send details of his discoveries back to England, where publication was arranged by Edward Forbes FRS (who had also been a pupil of Knox). Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley. Huxley's paper \\"On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae\\" was published in 1849 by the Royal Society in its Philosophical Transactions. Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of Hydrozoa. The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers, enclosing a central cavity or stomach. This is characteristic of the phylum now called the Cnidaria. He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals. When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates, Huxley was able to summarise this work in The Oceanic Hydrozoa, published by the Ray Society in 1859. Australian woman: Pencil drawing by Huxley The value of Huxley's work was recognised and, on returning to England in 1850, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, at the age of twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council. He met Joseph Dalton Hooker and John Tyndall, pp. 7, 9, 66, 71. who remained his lifelong friends. The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the Rattlesnake. He solved the problem of Appendicularia, whose place in the animal kingdom Johannes Peter M√ºller had found himself wholly unable to assign. It and the Ascidians are both, as Huxley showed, tunicates, today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum Chordata. pp. 153‚Äì5 Other papers on the morphology of the cephalopods and on brachiopods and rotifers are also noteworthy. The Rattlesnake's official naturalist, John MacGillivray, did some work on botany, and proved surprisingly good at notating Australian aboriginal languages. He wrote up the voyage in the standard Victorian two volume format.  Later life  Huxley effectively resigned from the navy (by refusing to return to active service) and, in July 1854, he became Professor of Natural History at the Royal School of Mines and naturalist to the British Geological Survey in the following year. In addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution 1855‚Äì58 and 1865‚Äì67; Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons 1863‚Äì69; President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1869‚Äì1870; President of the Quekett Microscopical Club 1878; President of the Royal Society 1883‚Äì85; Inspector of Fisheries 1881‚Äì85; and President of the Marine Biological Association 1884‚Äì1890. The thirty-one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life. Huxley retired in 1885, after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884. He resigned the presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six months' leave. His pension was a fairly handsome ¬£1200 a year. Huxley's grave in East Finchley Cemetery in north London In 1890, he moved from London to Eastbourne where he edited the nine volumes of his Collected Essays. In 1894 he heard of Eugene Dubois' discovery in Java of the remains of Pithecanthropus erectus (now known as Homo erectus). Finally, in 1895, he died of a heart attack (after contracting influenza and pneumonia), and was buried in North London at St Marylebone. This small family plot had been purchased upon the death of his beloved eldest son Noel, who died of scarlet fever in 1860; Huxley's wife Henrietta Anne n√©e Heathorn and son Noel are also buried there. No invitations were sent out, but two hundred people turned up for the ceremony; they included Joseph Dalton Hooker, William Henry Flower, Mulford B. Foster, Edwin Lankester, Joseph Lister and, apparently, Henry James. p. 230 Huxley and his wife had five daughters and three sons: = Public duties and awards = From 1870 onwards, Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty. He served on eight Royal Commissions, from 1862 to 1884. From 1871 to 1880 he was a Secretary of the Royal Society and from 1883 to 1885 he was president. He was president of the Geological Society from 1868 to 1870. In 1870, he was president of the British Association at Liverpool and, in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted London School Board. He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1877 to 1879. He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities. Before him, science was mostly a gentleman's occupation; after him, science was a profession. p. 235 He was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science. The Royal Society, who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the Royal Medal the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award. He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition. Then later in life came the Copley Medal in 1888 and the Darwin Medal in 1894; the Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston Medal in 1876; the Linnean Society awarded him the Linnean Medal in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards are listed in the Life and Letters. He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of University College, Oxford. Bassano c. 1883 In 1873 the King of Sweden made Huxley, Hooker and Tyndall Knights of the Order of the Polar Star: they could wear the insignia but not use the title in Britain. p. 431 Huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies, academic awards and honorary doctorates from Britain and Germany. He also became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1892. As recognition of his many public services he was given a pension by the state, and was appointed Privy Councillor in 1892. Despite his many achievements he was given no award by the British state until late in life. In this he did better than Darwin, who got no award of any kind from the state. (Darwin's proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisers, including Wilberforce) Perhaps Huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours, or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment‚Äîhe had vigorous debates in print with Benjamin Disraeli, William Ewart Gladstone and Arthur Balfour, and his relationship with Lord Salisbury was less than tranquil. Huxley was for about thirty years evolution's most effective advocate, and for some Huxley was \\"the premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century [for] the whole English-speaking world\\". p. 11 Though he had many admirers and disciples, his retirement and later death left British zoology somewhat bereft of leadership. He had, directly or indirectly, guided the careers and appointments of the next generation, but none were of his stature. The loss of Francis Balfour in 1882, climbing the Alps just after he was appointed to a chair at Cambridge, was a tragedy. Huxley thought he was \\"the only man who can carry out my work\\": the deaths of Balfour and W. K. Clifford were \\"the greatest losses to science in our time\\". = Vertebrate palaeontology = The first half of Huxley's career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the Palaeozoic era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct. Much paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea.Desmond A. 1982. Archetypes and ancestors: palaeontology in Victorian London 1850‚Äì1875. Muller, London. Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed. Huxley's detailed anatomical work was, as always, first-rate and productive. His work on fossil fish shows his distinctive approach: whereas pre-Darwinian naturalists collected, identified and classified, Huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups. Huxley by Wirgman a drawing in pencil, 1882 The lobed-finned fish (such as coelacanths and lung fish) have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone, the humerus or femur. His interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of tetrapods, one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology. pp. 67‚Äì84 pp. 163‚Äì187 The study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles, which he united under the title of Sauropsida. His papers on Archaeopteryx and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are. p. 171‚Äì224. pp. 550‚Äì561. Apart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate, and had descended from the same stock as the apes, Huxley did little work on mammals, with one exception. On his tour of America Huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses, discovered by O. C. Marsh, in Yale's Peabody Museum. p. 88 An Easterner, Marsh was America's first professor of palaeontology, but also one who had come west into hostile Indian territory in search of fossils, hunted buffalo, and met Red Cloud (in 1874).Plate, Robert. The Dinosaur Hunters: Othniel C. Marsh and Edward D. Cope, p. 52, 141-60, David McKay Company, Inc., New York, New York, 1964. Funded by his uncle George Peabody, Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries: the huge Cretaceous aquatic bird Hesperornis, and the dinosaur footprints along the Connecticut River were worth the trip by themselves, but the horse fossils were really special. After a week with Marsh and his fossils, Huxley wrote excitedly, \\"The collection of fossils is the most wonderful thing I ever saw.\\"Plate, Robert. The Dinosaur Hunters: Othniel C. Marsh and Edward D. Cope, p. 203, David McKay Company, Inc., New York, New York, 1964. Huxley's sketch of then hypothetical five-toed Eohippus being ridden by \\"Eohomo\\" The collection at that time went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling Orohippus from the Eocene through three-toed species such as Miohippus to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line. The horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual, and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia. If so, then something must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when Europeans arrived. The experience with Marsh was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.Plate, Robert. The Dinosaur Hunters: Othniel C. Marsh and Edward D. Cope, p. 204, David McKay Company, Inc., New York, New York, 1964. Marsh's and Huxley's conclusions were initially quite different. However, Marsh carefully showed Huxley his complete sequence of fossils. As Marsh put it, Huxley \\"then informed me that all this was new to him and that my facts demonstrated the evolution of the horse beyond question, and for the first time indicated the direct line of descent of an existing animal. With the generosity of true greatness, he gave up his own opinions in the face of new truth, and took my conclusions as the basis of his famous New York lecture on the horse.\\"Plate, Robert. The Dinosaur Hunters: Othniel C. Marsh and Edward D. Cope, p. 204, David McKay Company, Inc., New York, New York, 1964. Darwin's bulldog The frontispiece to Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature (1863): the image compares the skeletons of apes to humans. The gibbon (left) is double size. Huxley was originally not persuaded of \\"development theory\\", as evolution was once called. This can be seen in his savage review p.425‚Äì439. of Robert Chambers' Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution. Huxley had also rejected Lamarck's theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution, p. 82‚Äì85. which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind. It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man. p. 222. Huxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about Darwin's ideas before they were published (the group included Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell). The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection, which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the Linnean Society in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin's notebook and a Darwin letter to Asa Gray. Huxley's famous response to the idea of natural selection was \\"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\\" vol. 1, p.189. However, he never conclusively made up his mind about whether natural selection was the main method for evolution, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis. Logically speaking, the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin's On the Origin of Species was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication. Huxley's support started with his anonymous favourable review of the Origin in the Times for 26 December 1859, pp. 1‚Äì20 and continued with articles in several periodicals, and in a lecture at the Royal Institution in February 1860. p. 400. At the same time, Richard Owen, whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the Origin in the Edinburgh Review, also primed Samuel Wilberforce who wrote one in the Quarterly Review, running to 17,000 words. The authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until Wilberforce's son wrote his biography. So it can be said that, just as Darwin groomed Huxley, so Owen groomed Wilberforce; and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves. Though we do not know the exact words of the Oxford debate, we do know what Huxley thought of the review in the Quarterly: Carlo Pellegrini in Vanity Fair 1871 > Since Lord Brougham assailed Dr Young, the world has seen no such specimen > of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as this > remarkable production, in which one of the most exact of observers, most > cautious of reasoners, and most candid of expositors, of this or any other > age, is held up to scorn as a \\"flighty\\" person, who endeavours \\"to prop up > his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation,\\" and whose \\"mode of > dealing with nature\\" is reprobated as \\"utterly dishonourable to Natural > Science.\\" > If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the Origin of Species to a > twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do not > recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the Quarterly Review > article...Darwin, Francis (ed) 1887. The life and letters of Charles Darwin, > including an autobiographical chapter. Murray, London, volume 2.A more > complete version is available in Wikiquote Huxley said \\"I am Darwin's bulldog\\". While the second half of Darwin's life was lived mainly within his family, the younger combative Huxley operated mainly out in the world at large. A letter from Huxley to Ernst Haeckel (2 November 1871) states: \\"The dogs have been snapping at [Darwin's] heels too much of late.\\" At Oxford and Cambridge Universities, \\"Bulldog\\" was and still is student slang for a university policeman, whose job was to corral errant students and maintain their moral rectitude. =Debate with Wilberforce= Famously, Huxley responded to Wilberforce in the debate at the British Association meeting, on Saturday 30 June 1860 at the Oxford University Museum. Huxley's presence there had been encouraged on the previous evening when he met Robert Chambers, the Scottish publisher and author of \\"Vestiges\\", who was walking the streets of Oxford in a dispirited state, and begged for assistance. The debate followed the presentation of a paper by John William Draper, and was chaired by Darwins's former botany tutor John Stevens Henslow. Darwin's theory was opposed by the Lord Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, and those supporting Darwin included Huxley and their mutual friends Hooker and Lubbock. The platform featured Brodie and Professor Beale, and Robert FitzRoy, who had been captain of HMS Beagle during Darwin's voyage, spoke against Darwin.Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. p. 209, note 67. Wilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' Vestiges. For the more challenging task of opposing the Origin, and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by Richard Owen‚ÄîOwen stayed with him the night before the debate. p. 493 On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his Quarterly Review article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate‚Äîthe exact wording is not certain‚Äîwas widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play. The letters of Alfred Newton include one to his brother giving an eyewitness account of the debate, and written less than a month afterwards.Wollaston AFR 1921. Life of Alfred Newton: late Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Cambridge University 1866‚Äì1907, with a Preface by Sir Archibald Geikie OM. Dutton, NY. pp. 118‚Äì120. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought he had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event.Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. [Chapter 3 is an excellent survey, and its notes gives references to all the eyewitness accounts except Newton: see notes 61, 66, 67, 78, 79, 80, 81, 84, 86, 87, 89, 90, 93, 95: pp. 208‚Äì211] The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.Huxley to Dr FD Dyster, 9 September 1860, Huxley Papers 15.117. p. 118. Chapter 14 pp. 276‚Äì281. p. 313‚Äì330. A pro-Wilberforce account; lists many sources, but not Alfred Newton's letter to his brother. Many of Lucas' points are treated adversely in Jensen 1991, for example, note 77, p. 209. Chapter 26 'Knight takes Bishop?' is Gould's take on the Huxley-Wilberforce debate. One effect of the debate was to increase hugely Huxley's visibility amongst educated people, through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals. Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate: a lesson he never forgot. A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed: on the contrary, they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority.Darwin F. (ed) 1897‚Äì99. Life and letters of Charles Darwin. 2 vols, Murray, London. I, 156-7 Darwin to Huxley: \\"It is of enormous importance the showing the world that a few first-rate men are not afraid of expressing their opinion.\\"Darwin F. and A.C.Seward (eds) 1903. More letters of Charles Darwin. 2 vols, Murray, London. II, 204 Leonard Huxley: \\"The importance... lay in the open resistance that was made to authority\\". A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science, with its implied need for scientific education. A fifth consequence was indirect: as Wilberforce had feared, a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the Old Testament, especially the Book of Genesis. Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate; they were supporters, perhaps, of the controversial Essays and Reviews. Thus both on the side of science, and on the side of religion, the debate was important, and its outcome significant.Jensen, J. Vernon 1991. Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. p. 83-86. (see also below) That Huxley and Wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate (and able to work together on projects such as the Metropolitan Board of Education) says something about both men, whereas Huxley and Owen were never reconciled. Man's place in nature For nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes. This led him directly into a clash with Richard Owen, a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability. The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen. Huxley's Croonian Lecture, delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull was the start. In this, he rejected Owen's theory that the bones of the skull and the spine were homologous, an opinion previously held by Goethe and Lorenz Oken. p. 538‚Äì606. Huxley at 32 From 1860‚Äì63 Huxley developed his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, students and the general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December. Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work Evidence as to Man's place in Nature (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before Charles Darwin published his Descent of Man in 1871. Although Darwin did not publish his Descent of Man until 1871, the general debate on this topic had started years before (there was even a precursor debate in the 18th century between Monboddo and Buffon). Darwin had dropped a hint when, in the conclusion to the Origin, he wrote: \\"In the distant future... light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history\\". Not so distant, as it turned out. A key event had already occurred in 1857 when Richard Owen presented (to the Linnean Society) his theory that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus Homo. Having reached this opinion, Owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own. p. 1‚Äì37. No other biologist held such an extreme view. Darwin reacted \\"Man...as distinct from a chimpanzee [as] an ape from a platypus... I cannot swallow that!\\" Neither could Huxley, who was able to demonstrate that Owen's idea was completely wrong. Huxley with sketch of a gorilla skull (c1870) The subject was raised at the 1860 BA Oxford meeting, when Huxley flatly contradicted Owen, and promised a later demonstration of the facts. In fact, a number of demonstrations were held in London and the provinces. In 1862 at the Cambridge meeting of the B.A. Huxley's friend William Flower gave a public dissection to show that the same structures (the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor) were indeed present in apes. The debate was widely publicised, and parodied as the Great Hippocampus Question. It was seen as one of Owen's greatest blunders, revealing Huxley as not only dangerous in debate, but also a better anatomist. Owen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes, but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size. pp. 109‚Äì111 Huxley's ideas on this topic were summed up in January 1861 in the first issue (new series) of his own journal, the Natural History Review: \\"the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed\\". This paper was reprinted in 1863 as chapter 2 of Man's Place in Nature, with an addendum giving his account of the Owen/Huxley controversy about the ape brain.For the full text of the addendum see s:The cerebral structure of man and apes In his Collected Essays this addendum was removed. The extended argument on the ape brain, partly in debate and partly in print, backed by dissections and demonstrations, was a landmark in Huxley's career. It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy, and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with Wilberforce. It also marked the start of Owen's decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists. The following was written by Huxley to Rolleston before the BA meeting in 1861: :\\"My dear Rolleston... The obstinate reiteration of erroneous assertions can only be nullified by as persistent an appeal to facts; and I greatly regret that my engagements do not permit me to be present at the British Association in order to assist personally at what, I believe, will be the seventh public demonstration during the past twelve months of the untruth of the three assertions, that the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and the hippocampus minor, are peculiar to man and do not exist in the apes. I shall be obliged if you will read this letter to the Section\\" Yours faithfully, Thos. H. Huxley.Athenaeum 21 September 1861, p. 498. [key sentence italicised] During those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology. In 1862 he examined the Neanderthal skull-cap, which had been discovered in 1857. It was the first pre-sapiens discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large., pp. 420‚Äì422 Perhaps less productive was his work on physical anthropology, a topic which fascinated the Victorians. Huxley classified the human races into nine categories, and discussed them under four headings as: Australoid, Negroid, Xanthocroic and Mongoloid types. Such classifications depended mainly on appearance and anatomical characteristics.Huxley, Thomas Henry. \\"On the geographical distribution of the chief modifications of mankind\\". The Journal of the Ethnological Society of London (1869-1870) 2.4 (1870): 404-412.Brantlinger, Patrick. Dark vanishings: discourse on the extinction of primitive races, 1800-1930. Cornell University Press, 2003. Natural selection Huxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was a difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right. Huxley's reservations on natural selection were of the type \\"until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other, natural selection cannot be proved\\".Variously worded in , , , and chapter 18 gives detailed quotations from Huxley and discussion‚ÄîDarwin's letters to Huxley being not yet published Huxley's position on selection was agnostic; yet he gave no credence to any other theory. Despite this concern about evidence, Huxley saw that if evolution came about through variation, reproduction and selection then other things would also be subject to the same pressures. This included ideas because they are invented, imitated and selected by humans: ‚ÄòThe struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.‚Äô This is the same idea as meme theory put forward by Richard Dawkins in 1976. Darwin's part in the discussion came mostly in letters, as was his wont, along the lines: \\"The empirical evidence you call for is both impossible in practical terms, and in any event unnecessary. It's the same as asking to see every step in the transformation (or the splitting) of one species into another. My way so many issues are clarified and problems solved; no other theory does nearly so well\\".Letters CD to THH in vol 1, pp. 137‚Äì8, 225‚Äì6, 230‚Äì2, 274, 277, 287 Huxley's reservation, as Helena Cronin has so aptly remarked, was contagious: \\"it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of Darwinism\\". p. 397. One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent, but not the question of mechanism. Pallbearer Huxley was a pallbearer at the funeral of Charles Darwin on 26 April 1882.Linder, Doug (2004) \\"Thomas Huxley\\" The X Club In November 1864, Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club, the X Club, composed of like-minded people working to advance the cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends. There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more. The members were: Huxley, John Tyndall, J. D. Hooker, John Lubbock (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), Herbert Spencer (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), William Spottiswoode (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), Thomas Hirst (Professor of Physics at University College London), Edward Frankland (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and George Busk, zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for HMS Dreadnought). All except Spencer were Fellows of the Royal Society. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in glaciology. p. 241. pp. 338‚Äì339, 359, 379‚Äì383, 406. \\"During the summer of 1857 he carefully experimented with coloured liquids on the Mer de Glace and its tributaries...\\" Philosophical Magazine 1857, vol xiv, p. 241. p. 327‚Äì346. From the portrait of A. Legros. There were also some quite significant X-Club satellites such as William Flower and George Rolleston, (Huxley proteg√©s), and liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster. Guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time. pp. 63‚Äì72 They would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel, planning what to do; high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business. It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening. First item for the Xs was to get the Copley Medal for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle. The next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas. This was the weekly Reader, which they bought, revamped and redirected. Huxley had already become part-owner of the Natural History Review pp. 284, 289‚Äì290. bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites). The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861. After a stream of good articles the NHR failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution. The Reader also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science. The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley's time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors. This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not so astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him. However, the experience gained with the Reader was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of Nature in 1869. This time no mistakes were made: above all there was a permanent editor (though not full-time), Norman Lockyer, who served until 1919, a year before his death. In 1925, to celebrate his centenary, Nature issued a supplement devoted to Huxley. p. 1. The peak of the X Club's influence was from 1873 to 1885 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were Presidents of the Royal Society in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science. p. 191. After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now Lord Avebury) was the last surviving member. Huxley was also an active member of the Metaphysical Society, which ran from 1869 to 1880. Chapter 15 It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions. Tyndall and Huxley later joined The Club (founded by Dr. Johnson) when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up. p. 123. Educational influence When Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation. =School of Mines and Zoology= In the early 1870s the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington; ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London. The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching, an idea suggested by practice in German universities. In the main, the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types, and depended on the dissection of anatomy, supplemented by microscopy, museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster. The typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9am, followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators. Huxley's demonstrators were picked men‚Äîall became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley's ideas as well as their own. Michael Foster became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; E. Ray Lankester became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875‚Äì91), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891‚Äì98) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898‚Äì1907); S.H. Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; W.T. Thiselton-Dyer became Hooker's successor at Kew (he was already Hooker's son-in-law!); T. Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at University College, Cardiff; and William Rutherford p. 14, 60. became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh. William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH's assistant in many dissections, became Sir William Flower, Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum. It's a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all. \\"No one fact tells so strongly against Owen... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower\\".Charles Darwin to Asa Gray 1860 in p. 153. Photograph of Huxley (c. 1890) Huxley's courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: \\"The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism\\"; p. 67. Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said \\"Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices\\". p. 102. E.W MacBride said \\"Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist. p. 65. To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes. This largely morphological program of comparative anatomy remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink. It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution (Darwin, Wallace, Fritz M√ºller, Henry Bates) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley's program. Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount. Michael Ruse finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes. Since Darwin, Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers (and M≈±ller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Adrian Desmond suggests that \\"[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function\\". p. 273, note 20. That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man. Huxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy, at which he was the greatest master of the day. He was not an all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life. Huxley chose, in his teaching (and to some extent in his research) to take a more straightforward course, concentrating on his personal strengths. =Schools and the Bible= Huxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools: in November 1870 he was voted onto the London School Board. p. 19‚Äì20. In primary schooling, he advocated a wide range of disciplines, similar to what is taught today: reading, writing, arithmetic, art, science, music, etc. In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper-division work, focusing on a more specific area of study. A practical example of the latter is his famous 1868 lecture On a Piece of Chalk which was first published as an essay in Macmillan's Magazine in London later that year.On a Piece of Chalk (1868) The piece reconstructs the geological history of Britain from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as \\"organized common sense\\". Huxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions, but he believed that the Bible's significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life. \\"I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches\\".Said of those who wished to abolish all religious teaching, when really all they wanted was to free education from the Church. THH 1873. Critiques and Addresses p. 90. However, what Huxley proposed was to create an edited version of the Bible, shorn of \\"shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe\\". p. 397. p. 153. The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said \\"I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools\\".School Board Chronicle vol. 2, p. 326. p. 155. The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught. It may be right to see Huxley's life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said \\"It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems\\" p. 80.‚Äîand Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain. Some modern Christian apologists consider Huxley the father of antitheism, though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist. He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all organised religion throughout his life, especially the \\"Roman Church... carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature, in the intellectual freedom, and in the political freedom of mankind\\".School Board Chronicle vol 2, p. 360. In the same line of thought, in an article in Popular Science, Huxley used the expression \\"the so-called Christianity of Catholicism,\\" explaining: \\"I say 'so-called' not by way of offense, but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth.\\"Bonnier Corporation. Popular Science April 1887, Vol. 30, No. 46. . Scientific and pseudo-scientific realism pp. 789-803 In 1893, during preparation for the second Romanes Lecture, Huxley expressed his disappointment at the shortcomings of 'liberal' theology, describing its doctrines as 'popular illusions', and the teachings they replaced 'faulty as they are, appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth'. Vladimir Lenin remarked (in Materialism and empirio-criticism) \\"In Huxley's case... agnosticism serves as a fig-leaf for materialism\\" (see also the Debate with Wilberforce above). =Adult education= Thomas Henry Huxley, c. 1885, from a carte de visite Method and results, 1893 Huxley's interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self- educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public. For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals‚Äîthe Westminster Review, the Saturday Review, the Reader, the Pall Mall Gazette, Macmillan's Magazine, the Contemporary Review. Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries. p. 69.Note: articles are listed, and some are available, in The Huxley File at Clark University In 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in Blackfriars Road. The moving spirit was a portmanteau worker, Wm. Rossiter, who did most of the work; the funds were put up mainly by F.D. Maurice's Christian Socialists. p. 33. p. 361‚Äì362. At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire. Chapter 19 The technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective. A good example was \\"The Physical Basis of Life\\", a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme‚Äîthat vital action is nothing more than \\"the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it\\"‚Äîshocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the Fortnightly Review for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said \\"No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation\\". p. 90. The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; Punch added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets. The topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells, which is indeed a sensational sight. For these audiences Huxley's claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking. Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do, but little of that was known in the nineteenth century. When the Archbishop of York thought this 'new philosophy' was based on Auguste Comte's positivism, Huxley corrected him: \\"Comte's philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity\\" (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays Methods & Results 156). A later version was \\"[positivism is] sheer Popery with M. Comte in the chair of St Peter, and with the names of the saints changed\\". (lecture on The scientific aspects of positivism Huxley 1870 Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews p. 149). Huxley's dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte's ideas withered in Britain. Huxley and the humanities During his life, and especially in the last ten years after retirement, Huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities.Paradis, James G. T. H. Huxley: Man's place in nature. University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln 1978.Peterson, Houston 1932. Huxley: prophet of science. Longmans Green, London.Huxley T. H. 1893-4. Collected essays: vol 4 Science and Hebrew tradition; vol 5 Science and Christian tradition; vol 6 Hume, with helps to the study of Berkeley; vol 7 Man's place in nature; vol 9: Evolution and ethics, and other essays. Macmillan, London. Perhaps the best known of these topics is Evolution and Ethics, which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy. Both Huxley and his grandson Julian Huxley gave Romanes Lectures on this theme.Huxley T.H. and Huxley J. 1947. Evolution and ethics 1893‚Äì1943. Pilot, London. In USA as Touchstone for ethics, Harper, N.Y. [includes text from the Romanes lectures of both T. H. Huxley and Julian Huxley]Paradis, James & Williams, George C 1989. Evolution and Ethics: T. H. Huxley's 'Evolution and Ethics', with new essays on its Victorian and sociobiological context. Princeton, N.J.Reed J. R. 'Huxley and the question of morality'. In For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority. Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, our emotions, our intellect, our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution, and therefore inherited. Despite this, the details of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly determined by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the struggle for existence: \\"Of moral purpose I see not a trace in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture.\\" vol. 2, p. 285. It is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices (see Ethics and Evolutionary ethics). This seems to put Huxley as a compatibilist in the Free Will vs Determinism debate. In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend Herbert Spencer. Huxley's dissection of Rousseau's views on man and society is another example of his later work. The essay undermines Rousseau's ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property. Characteristic is: \\"The doctrine that all men are, in any sense, or have been, at any time, free and equal, is an utterly baseless fiction.\\"Huxley T. H. 1890. The natural inequality of man. Nineteenth Century January; reprinted in Collected Essays vol. 1, p. 290‚Äì335. Huxley's method of argumentation (his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print) is itself much studied. His career included controversial debates with scientists, clerics and politicians; persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions and other public bodies; lectures and articles for the general public, and a mass of detailed letter-writing to friends and other correspondents. A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies., p. 196. Royal and other commissions Huxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions (titles somewhat shortened here). The Royal Commission is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution. A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education; three involved medicine and three involved fisheries. Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues. All deal with possible changes to law and/or administrative practice. =Royal Commissions= *1862: Trawling for herrings on the coast of Scotland. *1863‚Äì65: Sea fisheries of the United Kingdom. *1870‚Äì71: The Contagious Diseases Acts. *1870‚Äì75: Scientific instruction and the advancement of science. *1876: The practice of subjugating live animals to scientific experiments (vivisection). *1876‚Äì78: The universities of Scotland. *1881‚Äì82: The Medical Acts. [i.e. the legal framework for medicine] *1884: Trawl, net and beam trawl fishing. Other commissions *1866: On the Royal College of Science for Ireland. *1868: On science and art instruction in Ireland.  Family  In 1855, he married Henrietta Anne Heathorn (1825‚Äì1915), an English √©migr√©e whom he had met in Sydney. They kept correspondence until he was able to send for her. They had five daughters and three sons: * Noel Huxley (1856‚Äì60), died aged 4. * Jessie Oriana Huxley (1858 ‚àí1927), married architect Fred Waller in 1877. * Marian Huxley (1859‚Äì87), married artist John Collier in 1879. * Leonard Huxley, (1860‚Äì1933) author, father of Julian, Aldous and Andrew Huxley. * Rachel Huxley (1862‚Äì1934) married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884; he died 1895. They were parents of the physicist Thomas Eckersley and the first BBC Chief Engineer Peter Eckersley. * Henrietta (Nettie) Huxley (1863‚Äì1940), married Harold Roller, travelled Europe as a singer. * Henry Huxley (1865‚Äì1946), became a fashionable general practitioner in London. * Ethel Huxley (1866‚Äì1941), married artist John Collier (widower of sister) in 1889. Huxley's relationships with his relatives and children were genial by the standards of the day‚Äîso long as they lived their lives in an honourable manner, which some did not. After his mother, his eldest sister Lizzie was the most important person in his life until his own marriage. He remained on good terms with his children, more than can be said of many Victorian fathers. This excerpt from a letter to Jessie, his eldest daughter is full of affection: *\\"Dearest Jess, You are a badly used young person‚Äîyou are; and nothing short of that conviction would get a letter out of your still worse used Pater, the b√™te noir of whose existence is letter-writing. Catch me discussing the Afghan question with you, you little pepper-pot! No, not if I know it...\\" [goes on nevertheless to give strong opinions of the Afghans, at that time causing plenty of trouble to the British Raj‚Äîsee Second Anglo-Afghan War] \\"There, you plague‚Äîever your affec. Daddy, THH.\\" (letter 7 December 1878, Huxley L 1900)T. H. Huxley Letters and Diary 1878 Huxley's descendants include children of Leonard Huxley: * Sir Julian Huxley FRS was the first Director of UNESCO and a notable evolutionary biologist and humanist. * Aldous Huxley was a famous author (Brave New World 1932, Eyeless in Gaza 1936, The Doors of Perception 1954). * Sir Andrew Huxley OM PRS won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. He was the second Huxley to become President of the Royal Society. Other significant descendants of Huxley, such as Sir Crispin Tickell, are treated in the Huxley family. =Mental problems in the family= Biographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the Huxley family. His father became \\"sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind\\",letter THH to eldest sister Lizzie 1853 HP 31.21 and later died in Barming Asylum; brother George suffered from \\"extreme mental anxiety\\"THH to Lizzie 1858 HP 31.24 and died in 1863 leaving serious debts. Brother James, a well known psychiatrist and Superintendent of Kent County Asylum, was at 55 \\"as near mad as any sane man can be\\";THH to Lizzie HP 31.44 and there is more. His favourite daughter, the artistically talented Mady (Marian), who became the first wife of artist John Collier, was troubled by mental illness for years. She died of pneumonia in her mid-twenties.THH to JT 1887 HP 9.164 pp. 175‚Äì176 About Huxley himself we have a more complete record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards he sank into a 'deep lethargy' and though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Bibby p. 7 and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the depression. Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill. The next episode we know of in Huxley's life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS Rattlesnake in 1848. Chapter 5 'Wanderings of a human soul' Huxley had further periods of depression at the end of 1871, p. 27 and again in 1873. p. 49 Finally, in 1884 he sank into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of 60. p. 151 This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate bi- polar disorder) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times. The problems continued sporadically into the third generation. Two of Leonard's sons suffered serious depression: Trevennen committed suicide in 1914 and Julian suffered a breakdown in 1913, and five more later in life.  Satires  Darwin's ideas and Huxley's controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires. It was the debate about man's place in nature that roused such widespread comment: cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count; Darwin's head on a monkey's body is one of the visual clich√©s of the age. The \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" attracted particular attention: * \\"Monkeyana\\" (Punch vol. 40, 18 May 1861). Signed 'Gorilla', this turned out to be by Sir Philip Egerton MP, amateur naturalist, fossil fish collector and‚ÄîRichard Owen's patron! p. 296. The last two stanzas include a reference to Huxley's comment that \\"Life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once.\\": > Next HUXLEY replies > That OWEN he lies > And garbles his Latin quotation; > That his facts are not new, > His mistakes not a few, > Detrimental to his reputation. > > To twice slay the slain > By dint of the Brain > (Thus HUXLEY concludes his review) > Is but labour in vain, > unproductive of gain, > And so I shall bid you \\"Adieu\\"! * \\"The Gorilla's Dilemma\\" (Punch 1862, vol. 43, p. 164). First two lines: > Say am I a man or a brother, > Or only an anthropoid ape? * Report of a sad case recently tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley.Pamphlet, published by George Pycraft, London 1863; Huxley Papers 79.6 Lord Mayor asks whether either side is known to the police: > Policeman X‚ÄîHuxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very > vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone > man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his > bones. People did say that the old man never got over it, and Owen worritted > him to death; but I don't think it was so bad as that. Hears as Owen takes > the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don't think it will be a harmonic > meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street. (Tom Huxley's 'low set' included Hooker 'in the green and vegetable line' and 'Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier'; Owen's 'crib in Bloomsbury' was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. Jermyn Street is known for its shops of men's clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a dandy.) Huxley (right) and Richard Owen inspect a \\"water baby\\" in Edward Linley Sambourne's 1881 illustration * The Water Babies, a fairy tale for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862‚Äì63, published in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having \\"long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species\\", 287 and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: > Dear Grandpater‚ÄîHave you seen a Waterbaby? Did you put it in a bottle? Did > it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?‚ÄîYour loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: > My dear Julian‚ÄîI could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend > who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. > Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did‚ÄîThere are some > people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things. > > When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers, and see > things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see > nothing.

It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth,Anderson, Don L.; \\"Chemical Composition of the Mantle\\" in Theory of the Earth, pp. 147-175 and partly to tellurium's low affinity for oxygen, which causes it to bind preferentially to other chalcophiles in dense minerals that sink into the core. Tellurium- bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph M√ºller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for \\"earth\\", tellus. Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production. Commercially, the primary use of tellurium is copper (tellurium copper) and steel alloys, where it improves machinability. Applications in CdTe solar panels and cadmium telluride semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production. Tellurium is considered a technology-critical element. Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning. Characteristics =Physical properties= Tellurium has two allotropes, crystalline and amorphous. When crystalline, tellurium is silvery-white with a metallic luster. It is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid. Amorphous tellurium is a black-brown powder prepared by precipitating it from a solution of tellurous acid or telluric acid (Te(OH)6). Tellurium is a semiconductor that shows a greater electrical conductivity in certain directions depending on atomic alignment; the conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light (photoconductivity). When molten, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron, and stainless steel. Of the chalcogens (oxygen-family elements), tellurium has the highest melting and boiling points, at and , respectively.Periodic Table. ptable.com =Chemical properties= Tellurium adopts a polymeric structure consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is not volatile. =Isotopes= Naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Six of those isotopes, 120Te, 122Te, 123Te, 124Te, 125Te, and 126Te, are stable. The other two, 128Te and 130Te, have been found to be slightly radioactive, with extremely long half-lives, including 2.2 √ó 1024 years for 128Te. This is the longest known half-life among all radionuclides and is about 160 trillion (1012) times the age of the known universe. Stable isotopes comprise only 33.2% of naturally occurring tellurium. A further 31 artificial radioisotopes of tellurium are known, with atomic masses ranging from 104 to 142 and with half-lives of 19 days or less. Also, 17 nuclear isomers are known, with half- lives up to 154 days. With the exception of beryllium-8 and beta-delayed alpha emission branches in some lighter nuclides, tellurium (104Te to 109Te) is the lightest element with isotopes known to undergo alpha decay. The atomic mass of tellurium (127.60 g¬∑mol‚àí1) exceeds that of iodine (126.90 g¬∑mol‚àí1), the next element in the periodic table. =Occurrence= Tellurium on quartz (Moctezuma, Sonora, Mexico) Native tellurium crystal on sylvanite (Vatukoula, Viti Levu, Fiji). Picture width 2 mm. With an abundance in the Earth's crust comparable to that of platinum (about 1 ¬µg/kg), tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements. In comparison, even the rarest of the stable lanthanides have crustal abundances of 500 ¬µg/kg (see Abundance of the chemical elements). This rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance. Tellurium is more abundant than rubidium in the cosmos, though rubidium is 10,000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The rarity of tellurium on Earth is thought to be caused by conditions during preaccretional sorting in the solar nebula, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of oxygen and water, was controlled by the reductive power of free hydrogen. Under this scenario, certain elements that form volatile hydrides, such as tellurium, were severely depleted through evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process. Tellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of gold such as calaverite and krennerite (two different polymorphs of AuTe2), petzite, Ag3AuTe2, and sylvanite, AgAuTe4. The city of Telluride, Colorado, was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium. Although tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium. In the gold rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie discarded a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, and it was used to fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets. History Klaproth named the new element and credited von Reichenstein with its discovery Tellurium (Latin tellus meaning \\"earth\\") was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in Kleinschlatten (today Zlatna), near today's city of Alba Iulia, Romania. This ore was known as \\"Faczebajer wei√ües bl√§ttriges Golderz\\" (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja, German name of Faceb√°nya, now Fa»õa BƒÉii in Alba County) or antimonalischer Goldkies (antimonic gold pyrite), and according to Anton von Rupprecht, was Spie√üglask√∂nig (argent molybdique), containing native antimony.v. Born, Abh. Privatges. v. B√∂hmen 5 (1782): 383. In 1782 Franz-Joseph M√ºller von Reichenstein, who was then serving as the Austrian chief inspector of mines in Transylvania, concluded that the ore did not contain antimony but was bismuth sulfide. The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests, M√ºller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated, the new metal gives off a white smoke with a radish-like odor; that it imparts a red color to sulfuric acid; and that when this solution is diluted with water, it has a black precipitate. Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names aurum paradoxum (paradoxical gold) and metallum problematicum (problem metal), because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony. In 1789, a Hungarian scientist, P√°l Kitaibel, discovered the element independently in an ore from Deutsch-Pilsen that had been regarded as argentiferous molybdenite, but later he gave the credit to M√ºller. In 1798, it was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who had earlier isolated it from the mineral calaverite.Klaproth (1798) \\"Ueber die siebenb√ºrgischen Golderze, und das in selbigen enthaltene neue Metall\\" (On the Transylvanian gold ore, and the new metal contained in it), Chemische Annalen f√ºr die Freunde der Naturlehre, Arzneygelahrtheit, Haushaltungskunst und Manufacturen (Chemical Annals for the Friends of Science, Medicine, Economics, and Manufacturing), 1 : 91‚Äì104. From page 100: \\" ‚Ä¶ ; und welchem ich hiermit den, von der alten Muttererde entlehnten, Namen Tellurium beylege.\\" ( ‚Ä¶ ; and to which I hereby bestow the name tellurium, derived from the old Mother of the Earth.) The 1960s brought an increase in thermoelectric applications for tellurium (as bismuth telluride), and in free-machining steel alloys, which became the dominant use. Production The principal source of tellurium is from anode sludges from the electrolytic refining of blister copper. It is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining of lead. Treatment of 1000 tons of copper ore typically yields one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of tellurium. alt=Grey and white world map with four countries colored to show the percentage of worldwide tellurium production. US to produce 40%; Peru 30%; Japan 20% and Canada 10%. The anode sludges contain the selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in compounds with the formula M2Se or M2Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500 ¬∞C the anode sludges are roasted with sodium carbonate under air. The metal ions are reduced to the metals, while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite. :M2Te + O2 \\\\+ Na2CO3 ‚Üí Na2TeO3 \\\\+ 2 M + CO2 Tellurites can be leached from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydrotellurites HTeO3‚àí in solution.

The year-end price for tellurium in 2000 was US$14 per pound. In recent years, the tellurium price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply, reaching as high as US$100 per pound in 2006. Despite the expectation that improved production methods will double production, the United States Department of Energy (DoE) anticipates a supply shortfall of tellurium by 2025. Tellurium is produced mainly in the United States, Peru, Japan and Canada. The British Geological Survey gives the following production numbers for 2009: United States 50 t, Peru 7 t, Japan 40 t and Canada 16 t. Compounds Tellurium belongs to the chalcogen (group 16) family of elements on the periodic table, which also includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and polonium: Tellurium and selenium compounds are similar. Tellurium exhibits the oxidation states ‚àí2, +2, +4 and +6, with +4 being most common. ;Tellurides Reduction of Te metal produces the tellurides and polytellurides, Ten2‚àí. The ‚àí2 oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals, such as zinc telluride, , produced by heating tellurium with zinc. Decomposition of with hydrochloric acid yields hydrogen telluride (), a highly unstable analogue of the other chalcogen hydrides, , and : :ZnTe + 2 HCl ‚Üí + is unstable, whereas salts of its conjugate base [TeH]‚àí are stable. ;Halides The +2 oxidation state is exhibited by the dihalides, , and . The dihalides have not been obtained in pure form, although they are known decomposition products of the tetrahalides in organic solvents, and the derived tetrahalotellurates are well- characterized: :Te + + 2 ‚Üí where X is Cl, Br, or I. These anions are square planar in geometry. Polynuclear anionic species also exist, such as the dark brown , and the black . Fluorine forms two halides with tellurium: the mixed- valence and . In the +6 oxidation state, the structural group occurs in a number of compounds such as , , , and . The square antiprismatic anion is also attested. The other halogens do not form halides with tellurium in the +6 oxidation state, but only tetrahalides (, and ) in the +4 state, and other lower halides (, , , and two forms of ). In the +4 oxidation state, halotellurate anions are known, such as and . Halotellurium cations are also attested, including , found in . ;Oxocompounds A sample of tellurium dioxide powder Tellurium monoxide was first reported in 1883 as a black amorphous solid formed by the heat decomposition of in vacuum, disproportionating into tellurium dioxide, and elemental tellurium upon heating. Since then, however, existence in the solid phase is doubted and in dispute, although it is known as a vapor fragment; the black solid may be merely an equimolar mixture of elemental tellurium and tellurium dioxide. Tellurium dioxide is formed by heating tellurium in air, where it burns with a blue flame. Tellurium trioxide, Œ≤-, is obtained by thermal decomposition of . The other two forms of trioxide reported in the literature, the Œ±- and Œ≥- forms, were found not to be true oxides of tellurium in the +6 oxidation state, but a mixture of , and . Tellurium also exhibits mixed-valence oxides, and . The tellurium oxides and hydrated oxides form a series of acids, including tellurous acid (), orthotelluric acid () and metatelluric acid (). The two forms of telluric acid form tellurate salts containing the TeO and TeO anions, respectively. Tellurous acid forms tellurite salts containing the anion TeO. ;Zintl cations When tellurium is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, the result is a red solution of the Zintl ion, . The oxidation of tellurium by in liquid produces the same square planar cation, in addition to the trigonal prismatic, yellow- orange : :4 Te + 3 ‚Üí + :6 Te + 6 ‚Üí + 2 Other tellurium Zintl cations include the polymeric and the blue-black , consisting of two fused 5-membered tellurium rings. The latter cation is formed by the reaction of tellurium with tungsten hexachloride: :8 Te + 2 ‚Üí Interchalcogen cations also exist, such as (distorted cubic geometry) and . These are formed by oxidizing mixtures of tellurium and selenium with or . ;Organotellurium compounds Tellurium does not readily form analogues of alcohols and thiols, with the functional group ‚ÄìTeH, that are called tellurols. The ‚ÄìTeH functional group is also attributed using the prefix tellanyl-. Like H2Te, these species are unstable with respect to loss of hydrogen. Telluraethers (R‚ÄìTe‚ÄìR) are more stable, as are telluroxides. Applications =Metallurgy= The largest consumer of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where the presence of electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid. =Semiconductor and electronic industry uses= CdTe photovoltaic array Tellurium is used in cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of tellurium demonstrated some of the greatest efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges. Infrared sensitive semiconductor material is formed by alloying tellurium with cadmium and mercury to form mercury cadmium telluride. Organotellurium compounds such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl allyl telluride are precursors for synthesizing metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is the preferred precursor for low-temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes. The compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification.Mullin, J.B.; Cole-Hamilton, D.J.; Shenai-Khatkhate, D.V.; Webb P. (May 26, 1992) \\"Method for purification of tellurium and selenium alkyls\\" Tellurium, as tellurium suboxide, is used in the media layer of rewritable optical discs, including ReWritable Compact Discs (CD-RW), ReWritable Digital Video Discs (DVD-RW), and ReWritable Blu-ray Discs. Tellurium dioxide is used to create acousto-optic modulators (AOTFs and AOBSs) for confocal microscopy. Tellurium is used in the new phase change memory chips developed by Intel. Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) and lead telluride are working elements of thermoelectric devices. Lead telluride is used in far- infrared detectors. =Other uses= * Tellurium compounds are used as pigments for ceramics. * Selenides and tellurides greatly increase the optical refraction of glass widely used in glass optical fibers for telecommunications. * Mixtures of selenium and tellurium are used with barium peroxide as an oxidizer in the delay powder of electric blasting caps. * Organic tellurides have been employed as initiators for living radical polymerization and electron-rich mono- and di-tellurides possess antioxidant activity. The tellurium compounds are used widely in synthetic organic chemistry for reduction- and oxidation-, cyclofunctionalization-, dehalogenation-, carbanion generation reactions and removal of protecting groups. The organometallic compounds are intermediates in the synthesis of amines, diols, and natural products. * Rubber can be vulcanized with tellurium instead of sulfur or selenium. The rubber produced in this way shows improved heat resistance. * Tellurite agar is used to identify members of the corynebacterium genus, most typically Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the pathogen responsible for diphtheria. * Tellurium is a key constituent of high performing mixed oxide catalysts for the heterogeneous catalytic selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid. The surface elemental composition changes dynamically and reversibly with the reaction conditions. In the presence of steam the surface of the catalyst is enriched in tellurium and vanadium which translates into the enhancement of the acrylic acid production. * Neutron bombardment of tellurium is the most common way to produce iodine-131.[Nordion fact sheet: I-131 http://www.nordion.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/10/MI_Iodine-131_Solution_Canada.pdf] This in turn is used to treat some thyroid conditions, and as a tracer compound in hydraulic fracturing, among other applications. Biological role Tellurium has no known biological function, although fungi can incorporate it in place of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro- methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. Tellurium accumulation seems to account for a major part of the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize tellurium partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations. Precautions Tellurium and tellurium compounds are considered to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium. Tellurium is not reported to be carcinogenic. Humans exposed to as little as 0.01 mg/m3 or less in air exude a foul garlic-like odor known as \\"tellurium breath\\". This is caused by the body converting tellurium from any oxidation state to dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te. This is a volatile compound with a pungent garlic-like smell. Even though the metabolic pathways of tellurium are not known, it is generally assumed that they resemble those of the more extensively studied selenium because the final methylated metabolic products of the two elements are similar. People can be exposed to tellurium in the workplace by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits (permissible exposure limit) tellurium exposure in the workplace to 0.1 mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL) at 0.1 mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In concentrations of 25 mg/m3, tellurium is immediately dangerous to life and health. See also * The 1862 telluric helix of Alexandre-√âmile B√©guyer de Chancourtois.

It is a silvery-white, rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile, and soft enough to be cut with a knife. The ninth member of the lanthanide series, terbium is a fairly electropositive metal that reacts with water, evolving hydrogen gas. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium as a chemical element in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide, Y2O3. Yttrium and terbium, as well as erbium and ytterbium, are named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques. Terbium is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures. As a component of Terfenol-D (an alloy that expands and contracts when exposed to magnetic fields more than any other alloy), terbium is of use in actuators, in naval sonar systems and in sensors. Most of the world's terbium supply is used in green phosphors. Terbium oxide is in fluorescent lamps and television and monitor cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Terbium green phosphors are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide trichromatic lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light used for standard illumination in indoor lighting.  Characteristics  =Physical properties= Terbium is a silvery-white rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is relatively stable in air compared to the earlier, more reactive lanthanides in the first half of the lanthanide series. Terbium exists in two crystal allotropes with a transformation temperature of 1289 ¬∞C between them. The 65 electrons of a terbium atom are arranged in the electron configuration [Xe]4f96s2; normally, only three electrons can be removed before the nuclear charge becomes too great to allow further ionization, but in the case of terbium, the stability of the half-filled [Xe]4f7 configuration allows further ionization of a fourth electron in the presence of very strong oxidizing agents such as fluorine gas. The terbium(III) cation is brilliantly fluorescent, in a bright lemon-yellow color that is the result of a strong green emission line in combination with other lines in the orange and red. The yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite owes its creamy-yellow fluorescence in part to terbium. Terbium easily oxidizes, and is therefore used in its elemental form specifically for research. Single terbium atoms have been isolated by implanting them into fullerene molecules. Terbium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below 219 K. Above 219 K, it turns into a helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered paramagnetic state at 230 K. =Chemical properties= Terbium metal is an electropositive element and oxidizes in the presence of most acids (such as sulfuric acid), all of the halogens, and even water. :2 Tb (s) + 3 H2SO4 ‚Üí 2 Tb3+ \\\\+ 3 \\\\+ 3 H2‚Üë :2 Tb + 3 X2 ‚Üí 2 TbX3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) :2 Tb (s) + 6 H2O ‚Üí 2 Tb(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 H2‚Üë Terbium also oxidizes readily in air to form a mixed terbium(III,IV) oxide: :8 Tb + 7 O2 ‚Üí 2 Tb4O7 The most common oxidation state of terbium is +3 (trivalent), such as . In the solid state, tetravalent terbium is also known, in compounds such as TbO2 and TbF4. In solution, terbium typically forms trivalent species, but can be oxidized to the tetravalent state with ozone in highly basic aqueous conditions. The coordination and organometallic chemistry of terbium is similar to other lanthanides. In aqueous conditions, terbium can be coordinated by nine water molecules, which are arranged in a tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry. Complexes of terbium with lower coordination number are also known, typically with bulky ligands like bis(trimethyl-silylamide), which forms the three-coordinate Tb[N(SiMe3)2]3 complex. Most coordination and organometallic complexes contain terbium in the trivalent oxidation state. Divalent (Tb2+) complexes are also known, usually with bulky cyclopentadienyl-type ligands. A few coordination compounds containing terbium in its tetravalent state are also known. = Compounds = Terbium combines with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic at elevated temperatures, forming various binary compounds such as TbH2, TbH3, TbB2, Tb2S3, TbSe, TbTe and TbN. In those compounds, Tb mostly exhibits the oxidation states +3 and sometimes +2. Terbium(II) halogenides are obtained by annealing Tb(III) halogenides in presence of metallic Tb in tantalum containers. Terbium also forms sesquichloride Tb2Cl3, which can be further reduced to TbCl by annealing at 800 ¬∞C. This terbium(I) chloride forms platelets with layered graphite-like structure. Other compounds include * Chlorides: TbCl3 * Bromides: TbBr3 * Iodides: TbI3 * Fluorides: TbF3, TbF4 Terbium(IV) fluoride is a strong fluorinating agent, emitting relatively pure atomic fluorine when heated rather than the mixture of fluoride vapors emitted from CoF3 or CeF4. =Isotopes= Naturally occurring terbium is composed of its only stable isotope, terbium-159; the element is thus mononuclidic and monoisotopic. Thirty-six radioisotopes have been characterized, with the heaviest being terbium-171 (with atomic mass of 170.95330(86) u) and lightest being terbium-135 (exact mass unknown). The most stable synthetic radioisotopes of terbium are terbium-158, with a half-life of 180 years, and terbium-157, with a half-life of 71 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are much less than a quarter of a year, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half a minute. The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 159Tb, is electron capture, which results in production of gadolinium isotopes, and the primary mode after is beta minus decay, resulting in dysprosium isotopes. The element also has 27 nuclear isomers, with masses of 141‚Äì154, 156, and 158 (not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer). The most stable of them are terbium-156m, with a half-life of 24.4 hours, and terbium-156m2, with a half-life of 22.7 hours; this is longer than half-lives of most ground states of radioactive terbium isotopes, except those with mass numbers 155‚Äì161.  History  Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide, Y2O3. Yttrium is named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques. Mosander first separated yttria into three fractions, all named for the ore: yttria, erbia, and terbia. \\"Terbia\\" was originally the fraction that contained the pink color, due to the element now known as erbium. \\"Erbia\\" (containing what we now call terbium) originally was the fraction that was essentially colorless in solution. The insoluble oxide of this element was noted to be tinged brown. Later workers had difficulty in observing the minor colorless \\"erbia\\", but the soluble pink fraction was impossible to miss. Arguments went back and forth as to whether erbia even existed. In the confusion, the original names got reversed, and the exchange of names stuck, so that the pink fraction referred eventually to the solution containing erbium (which in solution, is pink). It is now thought that workers using double sodium or potassium sulfates to remove ceria from yttria inadvertently lost the terbium into the ceria-containing precipitate. What is now known as terbium was only about 1% of the original yttria, but that was sufficient to impart a yellowish color to the yttrium oxide. Thus, terbium was a minor component in the original fraction containing it, where it was dominated by its immediate neighbors, gadolinium and dysprosium. Thereafter, whenever other rare earths were teased apart from this mixture, whichever fraction gave the brown oxide retained the terbium name, until at last, the brown oxide of terbium was obtained in pure form. The 19th century investigators did not have the benefit of the UV fluorescence technology to observe the brilliant yellow or green Tb(III) fluorescence that would have made terbium easier to identify in solid mixtures or solutions.  Occurrence  Xenotime Terbium is contained along with other rare earth elements in many minerals, including monazite ((Ce,La,Th,Nd,Y)PO4 with up to 0.03% terbium), xenotime (YPO4) and euxenite ((Y,Ca,Er,La,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)2O6 with 1% or more terbium). The crust abundance of terbium is estimated as 1.2 mg/kg. No terbium-dominant mineral has yet been found. Currently, the richest commercial sources of terbium are the ion-adsorption clays of southern China; the concentrates with about two-thirds yttrium oxide by weight have about 1% terbia. Small amounts of terbium occur in bastn√§site and monazite; when these are processed by solvent extraction to recover the valuable heavy lanthanides as samarium-europium-gadolinium concentrate, terbium is recovered therein. Due to the large volumes of bastn√§site processed relative to the ion-adsorption clays, a significant proportion of the world's terbium supply comes from bastn√§site. In 2018, a rich terbium supply was discovered off the coast of Japan's Minamitori Island, with the stated supply being \\"enough to meet the global demand for 420 years\\".  Production  Crushed terbium-containing minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water- soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3‚Äì4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are decomposed to oxides by heating. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Terbium is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. The most efficient separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal. Calcium and tantalum impurities can be removed by vacuum remelting, distillation, amalgam formation or zone melting.  Applications  Terbium is used as a dopant in calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate, and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures, together with ZrO2. Terbium is also used in alloys and in the production of electronic devices. As a component of Terfenol-D, terbium is used in actuators, in naval sonar systems, sensors, in the SoundBug device (its first commercial application), and other magnetomechanical devices. Terfenol-D is a terbium alloy that expands or contracts in the presence of a magnetic field. It has the highest magnetostriction of any alloy. Terbium oxide is used in green phosphors in fluorescent lamps and color TV tubes. Sodium terbium borate is used in solid state devices. The brilliant fluorescence allows terbium to be used as a probe in biochemistry, where it somewhat resembles calcium in its behavior. Terbium \\"green\\" phosphors (which fluoresce a brilliant lemon-yellow) are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide the trichromatic lighting technology which is by far the largest consumer of the world's terbium supply. Trichromatic lighting provides much higher light output for a given amount of electrical energy than does incandescent lighting. Terbium is also used to detect endospores, as it acts as an assay of dipicolinic acid based on photoluminescence.  Precautions  As with the other lanthanides, terbium compounds are of low to moderate toxicity, although their toxicity has not been investigated in detail. Terbium has no known biological role.

The name tungsten comes from the former Swedish name for the tungstate mineral scheelite, which means \\"heavy stone\\". Tungsten is a rare metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively combined with other elements in chemical compounds rather than alone. It was identified as a new element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite. The free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at . It also has the highest boiling point, at . Its density is 19.25 times that of water, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw. Tungsten's many alloys have numerous applications, including incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in gas tungsten arc welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts. Tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules, being found in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any living organism. However, tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to more familiar forms of animal life. Characteristics =Physical properties= In its raw form, tungsten is a hard steel-grey metal that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough that it can be worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding but it is more commonly formed by sintering. Of all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above ), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons. Alloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness. Tungsten exists in two major crystalline forms: Œ± and Œ≤. The former has a body-centered cubic structure and is the more stable form. The structure of the Œ≤ phase is called A15 cubic; it is metastable, but can coexist with the Œ± phase at ambient conditions owing to non-equilibrium synthesis or stabilization by impurities. Contrary to the Œ± phase which crystallizes in isometric grains, the Œ≤ form exhibits a columnar habit. The Œ± phase has one third of the electrical resistivityBean, Heather (October 19, 1998). Material Properties and Analysis Techniques for Tungsten Thin Films. frii.com and a much lower superconducting transition temperature TC relative to the Œ≤ phase: ca. 0.015 K vs. 1‚Äì4 K; mixing the two phases allows obtaining intermediate TC values. The TC value can also be raised by alloying tungsten with another metal (e.g. 7.9 K for W-Tc). Such tungsten alloys are sometimes used in low-temperature superconducting circuits. =Isotopes= Naturally occurring tungsten consists of four stable isotopes (182W, 183W, 184W, and 186W) and one very long-lived radioisotope, 180W. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so, with a half-life of years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W per gram of natural tungsten per year. The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be at least 4 √ó 1021 years. Another 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been characterized, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2 days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1 days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4 days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6 days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3 hours, and most of these have half- lives below 8 minutes. Tungsten also has 11 meta states, with the most stable being 179mW (t1/2 6.4 minutes). =Chemical properties= Tungsten is a mostly non-reactive element: it does not react with water, is immune to attack by most acids and bases, and does not react with oxygen or air at room temperature. At elevated temperatures (i.e., when red-hot) it reacts with oxygen to form the trioxide compound tungsten(VI), WO3. It will, however, react directly with fluorine (F2) at room temperature to form tungsten(VI) fluoride (WF6), a colorless gas. At around 250 ¬∞C it will react with chlorine or bromine, and under certain hot conditions will react with iodine. Finely divided tungsten is pyrophoric. The most common formal oxidation state of tungsten is +6, but it exhibits all oxidation states from ‚àí2 to +6. Tungsten typically combines with oxygen to form the yellow tungstic oxide, WO3, which dissolves in aqueous alkaline solutions to form tungstate ions, . Tungsten carbides (W2C and WC) are produced by heating powdered tungsten with carbon. W2C is resistant to chemical attack, although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form tungsten hexachloride (WCl6). In aqueous solution, tungstate gives the heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate anions under neutral and acidic conditions. As tungstate is progressively treated with acid, it first yields the soluble, metastable \\"paratungstate A\\" anion, , which over time converts to the less soluble \\"paratungstate B\\" anion, . Further acidification produces the very soluble metatungstate anion, , after which equilibrium is reached. The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten-oxygen octahedra known as the Keggin anion. Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species. The inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus in place of the two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids, such as phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40. Tungsten trioxide can form intercalation compounds with alkali metals. These are known as bronzes; an example is sodium tungsten bronze. History In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten).Scheele, Carl Wilhelm (1781) \\"Tungstens best√•nds-delar\\" (Tungsten's constituents), Kungliga Vetenskaps Academiens Nya Handlingar (Royal Scientific Academy's New Proceedings), 2 : 89‚Äì95 (in Swedish).English translation on pp. 4‚Äì13 of: de Luyart, John Joseph and Fausto, with Charles Cullen, trans., A Chemical Analysis of Wolfram and Examination of a New Metal, Which Enters its Composition (London, England, G. Nicol, 1785). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that it might be possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, Jos√© and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element (they called it \\"wolfram\\" or \\"volfram\\").de Luyart, J.J. and F.

Available at: University of Illinois (USA) The strategic value of tungsten came to notice in the early 20th century. British authorities acted in 1912 to free the Carrock mine from the German owned Cumbrian Mining Company and, during World War I, restrict German access elsewhere. In World War II, tungsten played a more significant role in background political dealings. Portugal, as the main European source of the element, was put under pressure from both sides, because of its deposits of wolframite ore at Panasqueira. Tungsten's desirable properties such as resistance to high temperatures, its hardness and density, and its strengthening of alloys made it an important raw material for the arms industry, both as a constituent of weapons and equipment and employed in production itself, e.g., in tungsten carbide cutting tools for machining steel. Now tungsten is used in many more applications such as aircraft & motorsport ballast weights, darts, anti-vibration tooling, and sporting equipment. =Etymology= The name \\"tungsten\\" (which means \\"heavy stone\\" in Swedish) is used in English, French, and many other languages as the name of the element, but not in the Nordic countries. \\"Tungsten\\" was the old Swedish name for the mineral scheelite. \\"Wolfram\\" (or \\"volfram\\") is used in most European (especially Germanic, Spanish and Slavic) languages and is derived from the mineral wolframite, which is the origin of the chemical symbol W. The name \\"wolframite\\" is derived from German \\"wolf rahm\\" (\\"wolf soot\\" or \\"wolf cream\\"), the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747. This, in turn, derives from Latin \\"lupi spuma\\", the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546, which translates into English as \\"wolf's froth\\" and is a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction. Occurrence Wolframite mineral, with a scale in cm. Tungsten is found mainly in the minerals wolframite (iron‚Äìmanganese tungstate (Fe,Mn)WO4, which is a solid solution of the two minerals ferberite FeWO4, and h√ºbnerite MnWO4) and scheelite (calcium tungstate (CaWO4). Other tungsten minerals range in their level of abundance from moderate to very rare, and have almost no economical value. Chemical compounds Structure of W6Cl18 (\\"tungsten trichloride\\"). Tungsten forms chemical compounds in oxidation states from -II to VI. Higher oxidation states, always as oxides, are relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles, mid-level oxidation states are often associated with metal clusters, and very low oxidation states are typically associated with CO complexes. The chemistries of tungsten and molybdenum show strong similarities to each other, as well as contrasts with their lighter congener, chromium. The relative rarity of tungsten(III), for example, contrasts with the pervasiveness of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3). Molybdenum trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures, is the precursor to virtually all other Mo compounds as well as alloys. Tungsten(VI) oxide is soluble in aqueous base, forming tungstate (WO42‚àí). This oxyanion condenses at lower pH values, forming polyoxotungstates. The broad range of oxidation states of tungsten is reflected in it various chlorides: * Tungsten(II) chloride, which exists as the hexamer W6Cl12 * Tungsten(III) chloride, which exists as the hexamer W6Cl18 * Tungsten(IV) chloride, WCl4, a black solid, which adopts a polymeric structure. * Tungsten(V) chloride WCl5, a black solid which adopts a dimeric structure. * Tungsten(VI) chloride WCl6, which contrasts with the instability of MoCl6. Organotungsten compounds are numerous and also span a range of oxidation states. Notable examples include the trigonal prismatic W(CH3)6 and octahedral W(CO)6. Production Tungsten mining in Rwanda forms an important part of the country's economy. The world's reserves of tungsten are 3,200,000 tonnes; they are mostly located in China (1,800,000 t), Canada (290,000 t),Tungsten. Mineral Commodity Summaries. USGS (2017) Russia (160,000 t), Vietnam (95,000 t) and Bolivia. As of 2017, China, Vietnam and Russia are the leading suppliers with 79,000, 7,200 and 3,100 tonnes, respectively. Canada had ceased production in late 2015 due to the closure of its sole tungsten mine. Meanwhile, Vietnam had significantly increased its output in the 2010s, owing to the major optimization of its domestic refining operations, and overtook Russia and Bolivia. China remains the world's leader not only in production, but also in export and consumption of tungsten products. The tungsten production gradually increases outside China because of the rising demand. Meanwhile, its supply by China is strictly regulated by the Chinese Government, which fights illegal mining and excessive pollution originating from mining and refining processes.Tungsten. Mineral Commodity Summaries. USGS (2018) Tungsten is considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There is a large deposit of tungsten ore on the edge of Dartmoor in the United Kingdom, which was exploited during World War I and World War II as the Hemerdon Mine. Following increases in tungsten prices, this mine was reactivated in 2014, but ceased activities in 2018. Tungsten is extracted from its ores in several stages. The ore is eventually converted to tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3), which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten. Because of tungsten's high melting point, it is not commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots. Instead, powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals, and sintered. During the sintering process, the nickel diffuses into the tungsten, producing an alloy. Tungsten can also be extracted by hydrogen reduction of WF6: :WF6 \\\\+ 3 H2 ‚Üí W + 6 HF or pyrolytic decomposition: :WF6 ‚Üí W + 3 F2 (ŒîHr = +) Tungsten is not traded as a futures contract and cannot be tracked on exchanges like the London Metal Exchange. The tungsten industry often uses independent pricing references such as Argus Media or Metal Bulletin as a basis for contracts. The prices are usually quoted for tungsten concentrate or WO3.Shedd, Kim B. (December 2018) Tungsten. 2016 Minerals Yearbook. USGS Applications Close-up of a tungsten filament inside a halogen lamp Tungsten carbide ring (jewelry) Approximately half of the tungsten is consumed for the production of hard materials ‚Äì namely tungsten carbide ‚Äì with the remaining major use being in alloys and steels. Less than 10% is used in other chemical compounds.Erik Lassner, Wolf-Dieter Schubert, Eberhard L√ºderitz, Hans Uwe Wolf, \\"Tungsten, Tungsten Alloys, and Tungsten Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . Because of the high ductile-brittle transition temperature of tungsten, its products are conventionally manufactured through powder metallurgy, spark plasma sintering, chemical vapor deposition, hot isostatic pressing, and thermoplastic routes. A more flexible manufacturing alternative is selective laser melting, which is a form of 3D printing and allows creating complex three-dimensional shapes. =Hard materials= Tungsten is mainly used in the production of hard materials based on tungsten carbide, one of the hardest carbides, with a melting point of 2770 ¬∞C. WC is an efficient electrical conductor, but W2C is less so. WC is used to make wear-resistant abrasives, and \\"carbide\\" cutting tools such as knives, drills, circular saws, reloading ammunition dies, milling and turning tools used by the metalworking, woodworking, mining, petroleum and construction industries. Carbide tooling is actually a ceramic/metal composite, where metallic cobalt acts as a binding (matrix) material to hold the WC particles in place. This type of industrial use accounts for about 60% of current tungsten consumption. The jewelry industry makes rings of sintered tungsten carbide, tungsten carbide/metal composites, and also metallic tungsten.Tungsten: The Element, History, Uses and Wedding Bands.tungstenworld.com WC/metal composite rings use nickel as the metal matrix in place of cobalt because it takes a higher luster when polished. Sometimes manufacturers or retailers refer to tungsten carbide as a metal, but it is a ceramic. Because of tungsten carbide's hardness, rings made of this material are extremely abrasion resistant, and will hold a burnished finish longer than rings made of metallic tungsten. Tungsten carbide rings are brittle, however, and may crack under a sharp blow. =Alloys= The hardness and density of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal alloys. A good example is high speed steel, which can contain as much as 18% tungsten. Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile. Tungsten alloys are used in a wide range of applications, including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding.Tungsten Applications. wolfmet.com Superalloys containing tungsten, such as Hastelloy and Stellite, are used in turbine blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings. Quenched (martensitic) tungsten steel (approx. 5.5% to 7.0% W with 0.5% to 0.7% C) was used for making hard permanent magnets, due to its high remanence and coercivity, as noted by John Hopkinson (1849‚Äì1898) as early as 1886. The magnetic properties of a metal or an alloy are very sensitive to microstructure. For example, while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic (but iron is), when it is present in steel in these proportions, it stabilizes the martensite phase, which has greater ferromagnetism than the ferrite (iron) phase due to its greater resistance to magnetic domain wall motion. Tungsten's heat resistance makes it useful in arc welding applications when combined with another highly-conductive metal such as silver or copper. The silver or copper provides the necessary conductivity and the tungsten allows the welding rod to withstand the high temperatures of the arc welding environment. =Armaments= Tungsten, usually alloyed with nickel and iron or cobalt to form heavy alloys, is used in kinetic energy penetrators as an alternative to depleted uranium, in applications where uranium's radioactivity is problematic even in depleted form, or where uranium's additional pyrophoric properties are not desired (for example, in ordinary small arms bullets designed to penetrate body armor). Similarly, tungsten alloys have also been used in cannon shells, grenades and missiles, to create supersonic shrapnel. Germany used tungsten during World War II to produce shells for anti-tank gun designs using the Gerlich squeeze bore principle to achieve very high muzzle velocity and enhanced armor penetration from comparatively small caliber and light weight field artillery. The weapons were highly effective but a shortage of tungsten used in the shell core limited that effectiveness. Tungsten has also been used in Dense Inert Metal Explosives, which use it as dense powder to reduce collateral damage while increasing the lethality of explosives within a small radius.Dense Inert Metal Explosive (DIME). Defense-update.com. Retrieved on 2011-08-07. =Chemical applications= Tungsten(IV) sulfide is a high temperature lubricant and is a component of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization. MoS2 is more commonly used for such applications. Tungsten oxides are used in ceramic glazes and calcium/magnesium tungstates are used widely in fluorescent lighting. Crystal tungstates are used as scintillation detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear medicine. Other salts that contain tungsten are used in the chemical and tanning industries. Tungsten oxide (WO3) is incorporated into selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts found in coal-fired power plants. These catalysts convert nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) using ammonia (NH3). The tungsten oxide helps with the physical strength of the catalyst and extends catalyst life. =Niche uses= Applications requiring its high density include weights, counterweights, ballast keels for yachts, tail ballast for commercial aircraft, rotor weights for civil and military helicopters, and as ballast in race cars for NASCAR and Formula One. Depleted uranium is also used for these purposes, due to similarly high density. Seventy-five-kg blocks of tungsten were used as \\"cruise balance mass devices\\" on the entry vehicle portion of the 2012 Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft. It is an ideal material to use as a dolly for riveting, where the mass necessary for good results can be achieved in a compact bar. High-density alloys of tungsten with nickel, copper or iron are used in high-quality darts (to allow for a smaller diameter and thus tighter groupings) or for fishing lures (tungsten beads allow the fly to sink rapidly). Tungsten is also used as a heavy bolt to lower the rate of fire of the SWD M11/9 machine gun from 1300 RPM to 700 RPM. Tungsten has seen use recently in nozzles for 3D printing; the high wear resistance and thermal conductivity of tungsten carbide improves the printing of abrasive filaments. Some cello C strings are wound with tungsten. The extra density gives this string more projection and often cellists will buy just this string and use it with three strings from a different set. Tungsten is used as an absorber on the electron telescope on the Cosmic Ray System of the two Voyager spacecraft. =Gold substitution= Its density, similar to that of gold, allows tungsten to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum. Metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic, and is harder than gold alloys (though not as hard as tungsten carbide), making it useful for rings that will resist scratching, especially in designs with a brushed finish. Because the density is so similar to that of gold (tungsten is only 0.36% less dense), and its price of the order of one-thousandth, tungsten can also be used in counterfeiting of gold bars, such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold,\\"Zinc Dimes, Tungsten Gold & Lost Respect \\", Jim Willie, Nov 18 2009 which has been observed since the 1980s, or taking an existing gold bar, drilling holes, and replacing the removed gold with tungsten rods.Tungsten filled Gold bars , ABC Bullion, Thursday, March 22, 2012 The densities are not exactly the same, and other properties of gold and tungsten differ, but gold-plated tungsten will pass superficial tests. Gold-plated tungsten is available commercially from China (the main source of tungsten), both in jewelry and as bars.Tungsten Alloy for Gold Substitution , China Tungsten =Electronics= Because it retains its strength at high temperatures and has a high melting point, elemental tungsten is used in many high-temperature applications, such as Incandescent light bulb, cathode-ray tube, and vacuum tube filaments, heating elements, and rocket engine nozzles. Its high melting point also makes tungsten suitable for aerospace and high-temperature uses such as electrical, heating, and welding applications, notably in the gas tungsten arc welding process (also called tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding). Tungsten electrode used in a gas tungsten arc welding torch Because of its conductive properties and relative chemical inertness, tungsten is also used in electrodes, and in the emitter tips in electron-beam instruments that use field emission guns, such as electron microscopes. In electronics, tungsten is used as an interconnect material in integrated circuits, between the silicon dioxide dielectric material and the transistors. It is used in metallic films, which replace the wiring used in conventional electronics with a coat of tungsten (or molybdenum) on silicon. The electronic structure of tungsten makes it one of the main sources for X-ray targets,Hasz, Wayne Charles et al. (August 6, 2002) \\"X-ray target\\" and also for shielding from high-energy radiations (such as in the radiopharmaceutical industry for shielding radioactive samples of FDG). It is also used in gamma imaging as a material from which coded apertures are made, due to its excellent shielding properties. Tungsten powder is used as a filler material in plastic composites, which are used as a nontoxic substitute for lead in bullets, shot, and radiation shields. Since this element's thermal expansion is similar to borosilicate glass, it is used for making glass-to-metal seals. In addition to its high melting point, when tungsten is doped with potassium, it leads to an increased shape stability (compared with non-doped tungsten). This ensures that the filament does not sag, and no undesired changes occur. =Nanowires= Through top-down nanofabrication processes, tungsten nanowires have been fabricated and studied since 2002. Due to a particularly high surface to volume ratio, the formation of a surface oxide layer and the single crystal nature of such material, the mechanical properties differ fundamentally from those of bulk tungsten. Such tungsten nanowires have potential applications in nanoelectronics and importantly as pH probes and gas sensors. In similarity to silicon nanowires, tungsten nanowires are frequently produced from a bulk tungsten precursor followed by a thermal oxidation step to control morphology in terms of length and aspect ratio. Using the Deal‚ÄìGrove model it is possible to predict the oxidation kinetics of nanowires fabricated through such thermal oxidation processing. = Fusion power = Due to its high melting point and good erosion resistance, tungsten is a lead candidate for the most exposed sections of the plasma-facing inner wall of nuclear fusion reactors. It will be used as the plasma-facing material of the divertor in the ITER reactor, and is currently in use in the JET test reactor. Biological role Tungsten, at atomic number Z = 74, is the heaviest element known to be biologically functional. It is used by some bacteria and archaea, but not in eukaryotes. For example, enzymes called oxidoreductases use tungsten similarly to molybdenum by using it in a tungsten-pterin complex with molybdopterin (molybdopterin, despite its name, does not contain molybdenum, but may complex with either molybdenum or tungsten in use by living organisms). Tungsten-using enzymes typically reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes. The tungsten oxidoreductases may also catalyse oxidations. The first tungsten-requiring enzyme to be discovered also requires selenium, and in this case the tungsten- selenium pair may function analogously to the molybdenum-sulfur pairing of some molybdopterin-requiring enzymes. One of the enzymes in the oxidoreductase family which sometimes employ tungsten (bacterial formate dehydrogenase H) is known to use a selenium-molybdenum version of molybdopterin. Acetylene hydratase is an unusual metalloenzyme in that it catalyzes a hydration reaction. Two reaction mechanisms have been proposed, in one of which there is a direct interaction between the tungsten atom and the C‚â°C triple bond. Although a tungsten-containing xanthine dehydrogenase from bacteria has been found to contain tungsten-molydopterin and also non-protein bound selenium, a tungsten-selenium molybdopterin complex has not been definitively described. In soil, tungsten metal oxidizes to the tungstate anion. It can be selectively or non-selectively imported by some prokaryotic organisms and may substitute for molybdate in certain enzymes. Its effect on the action of these enzymes is in some cases inhibitory and in others positive. The soil's chemistry determines how the tungsten polymerizes; alkaline soils cause monomeric tungstates; acidic soils cause polymeric tungstates. Sodium tungstate and lead have been studied for their effect on earthworms. Lead was found to be lethal at low levels and sodium tungstate was much less toxic, but the tungstate completely inhibited their reproductive ability. Tungsten has been studied as a biological copper metabolic antagonist, in a role similar to the action of molybdenum. It has been found that salts may be used as biological copper chelation chemicals, similar to the tetrathiomolybdates. =In archaea= Tungsten is essential for some archaea. The following tungsten-utilizing enzymes are known: * Aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) in Thermococcus strain ES-1 * Formaldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (FOR) in Thermococcus litoralis * Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GAPOR) in Pyrococcus furiosus A wtp system is known to selectively transport tungsten in archaea: * WtpA is tungsten-binding protein of ABC family of transporters * WptB is a permease * WtpC is ATPase  Health factors  Because tungsten is a rare metal and its compounds are generally inert, the effects of tungsten on the environment are limited. The abundance of tungsten in the Earth's crust is thought to be about 1.5 parts per million. It is one of the rarer elements. It was at first believed to be relatively inert and an only slightly toxic metal, but beginning in the year 2000, the risk presented by tungsten alloys, its dusts and particulates to induce cancer and several other adverse effects in animals as well as humans has been highlighted from in vitro and in vivo experiments. The median lethal dose LD50 depends strongly on the animal and the method of administration and varies between 59 mg/kg (intravenous, rabbits) also reported in and 5000 mg/kg (tungsten metal powder, intraperitoneal, rats). People can be exposed to tungsten in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10 mg/m3. Patent claim Tungsten is unique amongst the elements in that it has been the subject of patent proceedings. In 1928, a US court rejected General Electric's attempt to patent it, overturning granted in 1913 to William D. Coolidge.General Electric Co. v.

It is the thirteenth and third-last element in the lanthanide series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the nearly full 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules. In 1879, the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve separated from the rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components, which he called holmia and thulia; these were the oxides of holmium and thulium, respectively. A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911. Thulium is the second- least abundant of the lanthanides, after radioactively unstable promethium which is only found in trace quantities on Earth. It is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery-gray luster. It is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air. Despite its high price and rarity, thulium is used as the radiation source in portable X-ray devices, and in some solid-state lasers. It has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic. Properties =Physical properties= Pure thulium metal has a bright, silvery luster, which tarnishes on exposure to air. The metal can be cut with a knife, as it has a Mohs hardness of 2 to 3; it is malleable and ductile. Thulium is ferromagnetic below 32K, antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56K, and paramagnetic above 56K. Thulium has two major allotropes: the tetragonal Œ±-Tm and the more stable hexagonal Œ≤-Tm. =Chemical properties= Thulium tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at 150¬∞C to form thulium(III) oxide: :4 Tm + 3 O2 ‚Üí 2 Tm2O3 Thulium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form thulium hydroxide: :2 Tm (s) + 6 H2O (l) ‚Üí 2 Tm(OH)3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g) Thulium reacts with all the halogens. Reactions are slow at room temperature, but are vigorous above 200¬∞C: :2 Tm (s) + 3 F2 (g) ‚Üí 2 TmF3 (s) (white) :2 Tm (s) + 3 Cl2 (g) ‚Üí 2 TmCl3 (s) (yellow) :2 Tm (s) + 3 Br2 (g) ‚Üí 2 TmBr3 (s) (white) :2 Tm (s) + 3 I2 (g) ‚Üí 2 TmI3 (s) (yellow) Thulium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the pale green Tm(III) ions, which exist as [Tm(OH2)9]3+ complexes: :2 Tm (s) + 3 H2SO4 (aq) ‚Üí 2 Tm3+ (aq) + 3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g) Thulium reacts with various metallic and non-metallic elements forming a range of binary compounds, including TmN, TmS, TmC2, Tm2C3, TmH2, TmH3, TmSi2, TmGe3, TmB4, TmB6 and TmB12. In those compounds, thulium exhibits valence states +2 and +3, however, the +3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in thulium solutions. Thulium exists as a Tm3+ ion in solution. In this state, the thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water. Tm3+ ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence. Thulium's only known oxide is Tm2O3. This oxide is sometimes called \\"thulia\\". Reddish-purple thulium(II) compounds can be made by the reduction of thulium(III) compounds. Examples of thulium(II) compounds include the halides (except the fluoride). Some hydrated thulium compounds, such as TmCl3¬∑7H2O and Tm2(C2O4)3¬∑6H2O are green or greenish-white. Thulium dichloride reacts very vigorously with water. This reaction results in hydrogen gas and Tm(OH)3 exhibiting a fading reddish color. Combination of thulium and chalcogens results in thulium chalcogenides. Thulium reacts with hydrogen chloride to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride. With nitric acid it yields thulium nitrate, or Tm(NO3)3.Thulium. Chemicool.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-29. =Isotopes= The isotopes of thulium range from 145Tm to 179Tm. The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 169Tm, is electron capture, and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before 169Tm are element 68 (erbium) isotopes, and the primary products after are element 70 (ytterbium) isotopes. Thulium-169 is thulium's only primordial isotope and is the only isotope of thulium that is thought to be stable; it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to holmium-165 with a very long half-life. The longest-lived radioisotopes are thulium-171, which has a half-life of 1.92 years, and thulium-170, which has a half-life of 128.6 days. Most other isotopes have half-lives of a few minutes or less. Thirty-five isotopes and 26 nuclear isomers of thulium have been detected. Most isotopes of thulium lighter than 169 atomic mass units decay via electron capture or beta-plus decay, although some exhibit significant alpha decay or proton emission. Heavier isotopes undergo beta-minus decay. History Thulium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements (this was the same method Carl Gustaf Mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements).See: * Cleve named thulium on p. 480: \\"Pour le radical de l'oxyde plac√© entre l'ytterbine et l'erbine, qui est caract√©ris√© par la bande x dans la partie rouge du spectre, je propose la nom de thulium, d√©riv√© de Thul√©, le plus ancien nom de la Scandinavie.\\" (For the radical of the oxide located between the oxides of ytterbium and erbium, which is characterized by the x band in the red part of the spectrum, I propose the name of \\"thulium\\", [which is] derived from Thule, the oldest name of Scandinavia.) * * Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia (Er2O3). Upon additional processing, he obtained two new substances; one brown and one green. The brown substance was the oxide of the element holmium and was named holmia by Cleve, and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element. Cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after Thule, an Ancient Greek place name associated with Scandinavia or Iceland. Thulium's atomic symbol was once Tu, but this was changed to Tm. Thulium was so rare that none of the early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham, USA. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous. High-purity thulium oxide was first offered commercially in the late 1950s, as a result of the adoption of ion-exchange separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash & Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% purity. The price per kilogram oscillated between US $4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% purity, and it was the second highest for the lanthanides behind lutetium. Occurrence Thulium is found in the mineral monazite The element is never found in nature in pure form, but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Thulium has not been found in prevalence over the other rare earths in any mineral yet. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5 mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1 part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for the radioactive promethium. Production Thulium is principally extracted from monazite ores (~0.007% thulium) found in river sands, through ion exchange. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques have led to easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China. In these, where about two-thirds of the total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural compounds are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced. In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram. Applications Thulium has a few applications: =Laser= Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is an active laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2080 nm in the Infra-Red and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single- element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate at 2010 nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery. =X-ray source= Despite its high cost, portable X-ray devices use thulium that has been bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source. These radioactive sources have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection ‚Äì only a small cup of lead. Thulium-170 is gaining popularity as an X-ray source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy ((sealed source radiation therapy)). This isotope has a half- life of 128.6 days and five major emission lines of comparable intensity (at 7.4, 51.354, 52.389, 59.4 and 84.253 keV).Ayoub, Amal Hwaree et al. Development of New Tm-170 Radioactive Seeds for Brachytherapy, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Thulium-170 is one of the four most popular radioisotopes for use in industrial radiography. =Others= Thulium has been used in high-temperature superconductors similarly to yttrium. Thulium potentially has use in ferrites, ceramic magnetic materials that are used in microwave equipment. Thulium is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum, in this case, its green emission lines, which are not covered by other elements. Because thulium fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light, thulium is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting. The blue fluorescence of Tm-doped calcium sulfate has been used in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation. Tm-doped halides in which Tm is in its 2+ valence state, are promising luminescent materials that can make efficient electricity generating windows based on the principle of a luminescent solar concentrator, possible. Biological role and precautions Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble thulium salts are completely nontoxic. When injected, thulium can cause degeneration of the liver and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate. Liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice. Despite this, thulium has a low level of toxicity. In humans, thulium occurs in the highest amounts in the liver, kidneys, and bones. Humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year. The roots of plants do not take up thulium, and the dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part per billion of thulium. Thulium dust and powder are toxic upon inhalation or ingestion and can cause explosions.

Previously known as tantalium, it is named after Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology.Euripides, Orestes Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment, and as a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers. Tantalum, always together with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the mineral groups tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite, though not recognised as a separate mineral species). Tantalum is considered a technology-critical element. History Tantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg, in two mineral samples ‚Äì one from Sweden and the other from Finland. One year earlier, Charles Hatchett had discovered columbium (now niobium), and in 1809 the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared its oxide, columbite with a density of 5.918 g/cm3, to that of tantalum, tantalite with a density of 7.935 g/cm3. He concluded that the two oxides, despite their difference in measured density, were identical and kept the name tantalum. After Friedrich W√∂hler confirmed these results, it was thought that columbium and tantalum were the same element. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample, and he named them after the children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe, the goddess of tears), and pelopium (from Pelops). The supposed element \\"pelopium\\" was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium, and it was found that the niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett. The differences between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, as well as by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so-called ilmenium until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864, when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum, and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903. Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use. The name tantalum was derived from the name of the mythological Tantalus, the father of Niobe in Greek mythology. In the story, he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee-deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally tantalized him. (If he bent to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.) Anders Ekeberg wrote \\"This metal I call tantalum ... partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated.\\" For decades, the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, a process that was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum. Characteristics =Physical properties= Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, and highly conductive of heat and electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150 ¬∞C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, as well as with a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017 ¬∞C (boiling point 5458 ¬∞C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon. Tantalum exists in two crystalline phases, alpha and beta. The alpha phase is relatively ductile and soft; it has body-centered cubic structure (space group Im3m, lattice constant a = 0.33058 nm), Knoop hardness 200‚Äì400 HN and electrical resistivity 15‚Äì60 ¬µŒ©‚ãÖcm. The beta phase is hard and brittle; its crystal symmetry is tetragonal (space group P42/mnm, a = 1.0194 nm, c = 0.5313 nm), Knoop hardness is 1000‚Äì1300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170‚Äì210 ¬µŒ©‚ãÖcm. The beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to 750‚Äì775 ¬∞C. Bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase, and the beta phase usually exists as thin films obtained by magnetron sputtering, chemical vapor deposition or electrochemical deposition from an eutectic molten salt solution. =Isotopes= Natural tantalum consists of two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half- life of 2.0 √ó 1016 years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half- life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-lived nuclides). It is also the rarest primordial isotope in the Universe, taking into account the elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-lived nuclides). Tantalum has been examined theoretically as a \\"salting\\" material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is the better-known hypothetical salting material). An external shell of 181Ta would be irradiated by the intensive high-energy neutron flux from a hypothetical exploding nuclear weapon. This would transmute the tantalum into the radioactive isotope 182Ta, which has a half-life of 114.4 days and produces gamma rays with approximately 1.12 million electron-volts (MeV) of energy apiece, which would significantly increase the radioactivity of the nuclear fallout from the explosion for several months. Such \\"salted\\" weapons have never been built or tested, as far as is publicly known, and certainly never used as weapons. Tantalum can be used as a target material for accelerated proton beams for the production of various short-lived isotopes including 8Li, 80Rb, and 160Yb. Chemical compounds Tantalum forms compounds in oxidation states ‚àíIII to +V. Most commonly encountered are oxides of Ta(V), which includes all minerals. The chemical properties of Ta and Nb are very similar. In aqueous media, Ta only exhibit the +V oxidation state. Like niobium, tantalum is barely soluble in dilute solutions of hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids due to the precipitation of hydrous Ta(V) oxide. In basic media, Ta can be solubilized due to the formation of polyoxotantalate species. =Oxides, nitrides, carbides, sulfides= Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) is the most important compound from the perspective of applications. Oxides of tantalum in lower oxidation states are numerous, including many defect structures, and are lightly studied or poorly characterized. Tantalates, compounds containing [TaO4]3‚àí or [TaO3]‚àí are numerous. Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) adopts a perovskite structure. Lanthanum tantalate (LaTaO4) contains isolated tetrahedra. As in the cases of other refractory metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. The best studied chalcogenide is TaS2, a layered semiconductor, as seen for other transition metal dichalcogenides. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. =Halides= Tantalum halides span the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0 ¬∞C. The anion [TaF7]2- is used for its separation from niobium. The chloride , which exists as a dimer, is the main reagent in synthesis of new Ta compounds. It hydrolyzes readily to an oxychloride. The lower halides and , feature Ta-Ta bonds. =Organotantalum compounds= Organotantalum compounds include pentamethyltantalum, mixed alkyltantalum chlorides, alkyltantalum hydrides, alkylidene complexes as well as cyclopentadienyl derivatives of the same. Diverse salts and substituted derivatives are known for the hexacarbonyl [Ta(CO)6]‚àí and related isocyanides. Ta(CH3)5. Occurrence Pilbara district, Australia Tantalum is estimated to make up about 1 ppm or 2 ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only some of which are so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite (a series consisting of tantalite-(Fe), tantalite-(Mn) and tantalite-(Mg)) microlite (now a group name), wodginite, euxenite (actually euxenite-(Y)), and polycrase (actually polycrase-(Y)). Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite. alt=Grey and white world map with China, Australia, Brazil and Kongo colored blue representing less than 10% of the tantalum world production each and Rwanda colored in green representing 60% of tantalum world production The primary mining of tantalum is in Australia, where the largest producer, Global Advanced Metals, formerly known as Talison Minerals, operates two mines in Western Australia, Greenbushes in the Southwest and Wodgina in the Pilbara region. The Wodgina mine was reopened in January 2011 after mining at the site was suspended in late-2008 due to the global financial crisis. Less than a year after it reopened, Global Advanced Metals announced that due to again \\"... softening tantalum demand ...\\", and other factors, tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of February 2012. Wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the Greenbushes operation before being sold to customers. Whereas the large-scale producers of niobium are in Brazil and Canada, the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum. Some other countries such as China, Ethiopia, and Mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum, and they produce a significant percentage of the world's output of it. Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of the tin mining there. During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits, not only is cassiterite (SnO2) found, but a small percentage of tantalite also included. The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum, which is leached from the slag. alt=Grey and white world map with Canada, Brazil and Mozambique colored blue representing less than 20% of the tantalum world production each and Australia colored in green representing 60% of tantalum world production World tantalum mine production has undergone an important geographic shift since the start of the 21st century when production was predominantly from Australia and Brazil. Beginning in 2007 and through 2014, the major sources of tantalum production from mines dramatically shifted to the DRC, Rwanda, and some other African countries. Future sources of supply of tantalum, in order of estimated size, are being explored in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Greenland, China, Mozambique, Canada, Australia, the United States, Finland, and Brazil. It is estimated that there are less than 50 years left of tantalum resources, based on extraction at current rates, demonstrating the need for increased recycling. Status as a conflict resource Tantalum is considered a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite‚Äìtantalite mineral from which niobium and tantalum are extracted,Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center: Coltan Retrieved 2008-01-27 can also be found in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 ‚Äì making it the world's deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002‚Äì2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008. The stated aim of the Solutions for Hope Tantalum Project is to \\"source conflict- free tantalum from the Democratic Republic of Congo\\"  Production and fabrication  Time trend of tantalum production until 2012 Several steps are involved in the extraction of tantalum from tantalite. First, the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation. This is generally carried out near the mine site. = Refining = The refining of tantalum from its ores is one of the more demanding separation processes in industrial metallurgy. The chief problem is that tantalum ores contain significant amounts of niobium, which has chemical properties almost identical to those of Ta. A large number of procedures have been developed to address this challenge. In modern times, the separation is achieved by hydrometallurgy. Extraction begins with leaching the ore with hydrofluoric acid together with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. This step allows the tantalum and niobium to be separated from the various non-metallic impurities in the rock. Although Ta occurs as various minerals, it is conveniently represented as the pentoxide, since most oxides of tantalum(V) behave similarly under these conditions. A simplified equation for its extraction is thus: : Ta2O5 \\\\+ 14 HF ‚Üí 2 H2[TaF7] + 5 H2O Completely analogous reactions occur for the niobium component, but the hexafluoride is typically predominant under the conditions of the extraction. : Nb2O5 \\\\+ 12 HF ‚Üí 2 H[NbF6] + 5 H2O These equations are simplified: it is suspected that bisulfate (HSO4‚àí) and chloride compete as ligands for the Nb(V) and Ta(V) ions, when sulfuric and hydrochloric acids are used, respectively. The tantalum and niobium fluoride complexes are then removed from the aqueous solution by liquid-liquid extraction into organic solvents, such as cyclohexanone, octanol, and methyl isobutyl ketone. This simple procedure allows the removal of most metal-containing impurities (e.g. iron, manganese, titanium, zirconium), which remain in the aqueous phase in the form of their fluorides and other complexes. Separation of the tantalum from niobium is then achieved by lowering the ionic strength of the acid mixture, which causes the niobium to dissolve in the aqueous phase. It is proposed that oxyfluoride H2[NbOF5] is formed under these conditions. Subsequent to removal of the niobium, the solution of purified H2[TaF7] is neutralised with aqueous ammonia to precipitate hydrated tantalum oxide as a solid, which can be calcined to tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5). Instead of hydrolysis, the H2[TaF7] can be treated with potassium fluoride to produce potassium heptafluorotantalate: : H2[TaF7] + 2 KF ‚Üí K2[TaF7] + 2 HF Unlike H2[TaF7], the potassium salt is readily crystallized and handled as a solid. K2[TaF7] can be converted to metallic tantalum by reduction with sodium, at approximately 800 ¬∞C in molten salt. : K2[TaF7] + 5 Na ‚Üí Ta + 5 NaF + 2 KF In an older method, called the Marignac process, the mixture of H2[TaF7] and H2[NbOF5] was converted to a mixture of K2[TaF7] and K2[NbOF5], which was then be separated by fractional crystallization, exploiting their different water solubilities. = Electrolysis = Tantalum can also be refined by electrolysis, using a modified version of the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process. Instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form, tantalum electrolysis operates on non-liquid powdered oxides. The initial discovery came in 1997 when Cambridge University researchers immersed small samples of certain oxides in baths of molten salt and reduced the oxide with electric current. The cathode uses powdered metal oxide. The anode is made of carbon. The molten salt at is the electrolyte. The first refinery has enough capacity to supply 3‚Äì4% of annual global demand. = Fabrication and metalworking = All welding of tantalum must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets. Applications =Electronics= Tantalum electrolytic capacitor The major use for tantalum, as the metal powder, is in the production of electronic components, mainly capacitors and some high-power resistors. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer, using tantalum powder, pressed into a pellet shape, as one \\"plate\\" of the capacitor, the oxide as the dielectric, and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other \\"plate\\". Because the dielectric layer can be very thin (thinner than the similar layer in, for instance, an aluminium electrolytic capacitor), a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume. Because of the size and weight advantages, tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones, personal computers, automotive electronics and cameras. =Alloys= Tantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, missile parts, heat exchangers, tanks, and vessels. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue. Tantalum is inert against most acids except hydrofluoric acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property makes it a useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used in the production of ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. Tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helped to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes when used for internal parts such as grids and plates. =Other uses= Bimetallic coins minted by the Bank of Kazakhstan with silver ring and tantalum center. The high melting point and oxidation resistance lead to the use of the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts. Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts, such as thermowells, valve bodies, and tantalum fasteners. Due to its high density, shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum. Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and high melting point. It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe, Hublot, Montblanc, Omega, and Panerai. Tantalum is also highly bioinert and is used as an orthopedic implant material. The high stiffness of tantalum makes it necessary to use it as highly porous foam or scaffold with lower stiffness for hip replacement implants to avoid stress shielding. Because tantalum is a non-ferrous, non-magnetic metal, these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures. The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses.  Environmental issues  Tantalum receives far less attention in the environmental field than it does in other geosciences. Upper Crust Concentration (UCC) and the Nb/Ta ratio in the upper crust and in minerals are available because these measurements are useful as a geochemical tool. The latest value for upper crust concentration is 0.92 ppm, and the Nb/Ta(w/w) ratio stands at 12.7. Little data is available on tantalum concentrations in the different environmental compartments, especially in natural waters where reliable estimates of ‚Äòdissolved‚Äô tantalum concentrations in seawater and freshwaters have not even been produced. Some values on dissolved concentrations in oceans have been published, but they are contradictory. Values in freshwaters fare little better, but, in all cases, they are probably below 1 ng L‚àí1, since ‚Äòdissolved‚Äô concentrations in natural waters are well below most current analytical capabilities. Analysis requires pre-concentration procedures that, for the moment, do not give consistent results. And in any case, tantalum appears to be present in natural waters mostly as particulate matter rather than dissolved. Values for concentrations in soils, bed sediments and atmospheric aerosols are easier to come by. Values in soils are close to 1 ppm and thus to UCC values. This indicates detrital origin. For atmospheric aerosols the values available are scattered and limited. When tantalum enrichment is observed, it is probably due to loss of more water-soluble elements in aerosols in the clouds. Pollution linked to human use of the element has not been detected. Tantalum appears to be a very conservative element in biogeochemical terms, but its cycling and reactivity are still not fully understood. Precautions Compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory. The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings, therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound. People can be exposed to tantalum in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for tantalum exposure in the workplace as 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 10 mg/m3. At levels of 2500 mg/m3, tantalum is immediately dangerous to life and health.

An unlit torch as used for fire breathing. Torch construction Torch construction has varied through history depending on the torch's purpose. Torches were usually constructed of a wooden stave with one end wrapped in a material which was soaked in a flammable substance. In ancient Rome some torches were made of sulfur mixed with lime. This meant that the fire would not diminish after being plunged into water. Modern procession torches are made from coarse hessian rolled into a tube and soaked in wax. A wooden handle is usually used, and a cardboard collar is attached to deflect any wax droplets. They are an easy, safe and relatively cheap way to hold a flame aloft in a parade or to provide illumination in any after-dark celebration. Modern torches suitable for juggling are made of a wooden-and- metal or metal-only stave with one end wrapped in a Kevlar wick. This wick is soaked in a flammable liquid, usually paraffin (kerosene).

Uses =Olympics= Li Ning lighting the torch at the 2008 Summer Olympics. A torch carried in relay by runners is used to light the Olympic flame which burns without interruption until the end of the Games. These torches and the relay tradition were introduced in the 1936 Summer Olympics by Carl Diem, the chairman of the event because during the duration of the Ancient Olympic Games in Olympia, a sacred flame burnt inside of the temple of Hera, kept in custody by her priestess. =Juggling= Juggling torches are often used as a prop in toss juggling: they can be flipped into the air in an end-over-end motion while being juggled, in the same manner as juggling clubs or juggling knives, but because of their sound and 'trail of flame', they can appear much more impressive to audiences. To a skilled juggler, there is only a slight chance of being burned, but they are still dangerous. =In Roman Catholic liturgy= In former times, liturgical torches were carried in Eucharistic processions simply to give light. The Church eventually adopted their use for Solemn High Masses. According to Adrian Fortescue,\\"The Mass: A Study of the Roman Liturgy [1912]\\" the more correct form of liturgical torches are non-freestanding (i.e. cannot stand up on their own). However, today, even in the Vatican, freestanding, tall candles in ornate candle-stick holders have replaced the former type. The torches are carried by torchbearers, who enter at the Sanctus and leave after Communion. Anglicans of the High Church and some Lutherans use torches in some of their liturgical celebrations as well. =Torchlight march= Torchlight march is a type of illuminated procession which is held after dark so that torches carried by the participants form a spectacle (other types of an illuminated procession involve candles, lanterns etc).
