It is situated by Dangan Church on the Trim Road. The castle is the former seat of the Wesley (Wellesley) family and is located outside the village of Summerhill. It was the childhood home of Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Wellesleys The Wesley (later spelled and pronounced Wellesley) family had occupied the land since the conquests of Henry II of England. The medieval castle, which was once their seat, now exists only as a ruined tower. The modern house was originally built in the early 1700s as Dangan House by Richard Colley, who demolished the old castle. Colley had inherited the estate from the childless Gerald Wesley, on condition that he changed his surname. He became the Right Honourable Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington, and spent a considerable sum of money improving and maintaining the gardens of 600 Irish acres. These included a lake covering 26 acres, with a fort, several islands, and several ships.Coole & Summerhill Irish Countrywomen's Association, The History and Folklore of Coole and Summerhill Parish, 1999. These were described in detail by Mary Delany. Richard was succeeded by his son Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. Garret's son Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, spent most of his childhood at the castle and gardens. The property passed out of the hands of the Wellesley family after Arthur's older brother Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley inherited it in 1781. He sold it to Thomas Burrowes of the East India Company. Later history The castle was occupied in the early years of the 19th century by Roger O'Connor, who acquired it from Burrowes on a permanently renewable lease. O'Connor, a passionate Irish nationalist, asserted that he had acquired it as \\"a suitable residence in which to entertain Napoleon\\" after the defeat of Britain.James Dunkerley, Americana: The Americas in the World Around 1850, Verso, 2000, pp.449-50.Donald Read & Eric Glasgow, Feargus O'Connor: Irishman and Chartist, Edward Arnold, 1961, p.13. In 1809, during O'Connor's occupation, there was a serious fire that destroyed much of the building. Insurance fraud was suspected, but O'Connor's son Francisco Burdett O'Connor wrote in his autobiography 60 years later that he had accidentally started the fire himself when melting lead to create bullets.Francisco Burdett O'Connor, Recuerdos (1895) (La Paz, 1972), p. 5. In 1817 O'Connor was accused of having plotted with his estate manager and labourers to rob a mail coach, during which a guard was shot and killed. He was acquitted after a sensational trial, but left the building soon afterwards. The already seriously damaged castle and grounds rapidly fell into a state of irretrievable disrepair after O'Connor's departure. By 1841, The Irish Penny Journal noted that \\"nothing but the outer walls remain, and the interior space, once formed into ample halls and chambers, has been converted into a flower garden\\". It added that in the recent past it had been \\"a place of concealment for plunder and a resort of thieves\\".\\"Dangan Castle, County of Meath\\", The Irish Penny Journal, Vol. 1, No. 46 (15 May 1841), pp. 361-362 In September 2013 Dangan Castle and its surroundings were put up for sale.

Known by his title of Andhra Ratna, Gopalakrishnayya was the first Andhra leader to become secretary of the All India Congress Committee.  Early life and education  Gopalakrishnayya was born in Penuganchiprolu in the Nandigama taluk of Krishna District in 1889 in a Brahmin family. His father, Kodandaramaswamy, was a school teacher but came from a family of landlords from Guntur and his mother Sitamma died soon after giving birth to him, her only child. Gopalkrishnayya's father remarried but died when he was still young and he was raised by his uncle and grandmother. He did his schooling from the Bapatla Municipal High School and worked for a year at the Bapatla taluk office after completing his matriculation. In 1911 he chose go to the University of Edinburgh along with his childhood friend Sri Nadimpalli Narasimha Rao (Barrister of Guntur) where he lived for six years and earned a postgraduate degree in economics.  Freedom fighter  Gopalakrishnayya returned to Guntur in 1917 and worked as a teacher Government College at Rajahmundry and at the National College at Machilipatnam but he also became involved in Annie Besant's Home Rule Movement. In 1919 he gave up his teaching career to become a full-time political activist. He attended the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1920 where he was attracted to the idea of non-cooperation that the Congress endorsed. = Rama Dandu = Gopalakrishnayya was a devotee of the Hindu deity Rama and he organised a cadre of workers whom he called Rama Dandu (meaning Rama's Army) to work for the cause of swaraj. In 1921 the Congress held its annual session at Bezwada (or Vijayawada) where the Rama Dandu played a prominent role in organising it. Members of the Dandu wore saffron clothes and donned rudraksha beads and vermilion and they participated in the meeting in large numbers. Mohammed Ali, the president of the session, was impressed enough to call it the Red Army of India. = Chirala anti-tax agitation = Gopalakrishnayya is perhaps best known for the anti-tax satyagraha he led in Chirala during the Non-Cooperation Movement. The satyagraha had its roots in the decision of the colonial government of the Madras Presidency to combine the villages of Chirala and Perala in Guntur district into a municipality. While the villages yielded an annual tax of revenue of 4000 per annum, their reclassification as a municipal area would yield the government a revenue of 40,000 per annum. The move was opposed by the residents as it would impose a greater tax burden on them. The government however chose to press ahead with its decision prompting the municipal council to resign en masse. In January 1921 the residents decided not to pay the taxes and the government in response clamped down by arresting, prosecuting and sentencing several of the protesters to imprisonment. Following the Bezwada Congress session, Mahatma Gandhi visited Chirala where Gopalakrishnayya sought his advice on the future course of action. Gandhi advised the continuation of a nonviolent struggle and the mass movement of people residing in the municipal area to regions beyond town limits as this would also render a depopulated municipality meaningless. Heeding Gandhi's advice, Gopalakrishnayya, in April 1921, led the residents of Chirala town to move out of the town and set up temporary settlements beyond town limits. Nearly 13,000 out of the town's total population of 15,000 responded to his call and shifted to a new settlement called Ramanagar where he set up an assembly comprising members from all castes and a court of arbitration. Gopalakrishnayya and the Rama Dandu worked to keep up the morale of the people and this establishment continued for a period of eleven months. Ultimately a combination of dwindling finances, the arrest and imprisonment of Gopalakrishnayya at Trichnopoly and the absence of leaders to continue the struggle in the absence of Gopalakrishnayya led to the winding up of Ramanagara. = Swarajya Party = Following the withdrawal of the Non Cooperation Movement, dissension spread across the Congress party on the issue of its future course of action. When C R Das and Motilal Nehru founded the Swarajya Party in 1925, Gopalakrishnayya joined it and became one of its secretaries from Andhra. For his work with Rama Dandu and the establishment of Ramanagar, he came to be known as Ramadas and as a leader of the Swarajya Party he would sometimes introduce himself with a tinge of humour as C R Das or Chirala Rama Das.  Literature  Gopalakrishnayya was a polyglot fluent in Sanskrit, Telugu, Hindi and English and an extempore composer of verse. He was a powerful orator and set up the Andhra Vidya Peetha Gosthi, a literary society but gave primacy to his political career over his literary talents. During his years in England, Gopalakrishnayya became friends with Ananda Coomaraswamy with whom he translated the Abhinayadarpana of Nandikesvara into English as The Mirror of Gesture. He was a mentor to the Telugu writer Abburi Ramakrishna Rau and had a strong influence on the poet B Sundararama Sastri.  Family  Gopalakrishnayya married Durga Bhavani Amma as a 14-year-old in 1903.  Death and commemoration  Gopalakrishnayya was diagnosed with advanced tuberculosis in 1926 and spent much of his last days in poverty and suffering. He died on 10 June 1928, aged 39. He is known by the title Andhra Ratna (or Jewel of Andhra). The Congress Party's headquarters in Vijayawada, the Andhra Ratna Bhavan, is named after Gopalakrishnayya. There are biographies of his by Chalapathi Rao and K Kutumbasastri. A bronze statue of his, unveiled by K Kamaraj, stands in Chirala.

It was updated in 2006, and the new version was renamed as the MG3. Both cars used the same naturally-aspirated 3.0 L Alfa Romeo V6 engine. The Mac3, in conjunction with the older M1 model, helped Centenari to take joint-second in the 1998 International Sports Racing Series CN Team's Championship. History =1998= For 1998, Centenari developed a new car for the International Sports Racing Series (ISRS) - the Mac3 - and the team expanded to a two-car effort, with the older M1 being retained. The team started their season at the 1000 km Monza, which was part of the GT Italian Challenge and the Challenge Endurance Italia, with Loic Depailler, Xavier Pompidou, Giovanna Amati and Marco Lucchinelli driving the new Mac3, and Merzario, Giovanni Li Calzi, Robin Donovan and Fulvio Ballabio driving the older M1. Although the two cars were qualified in seventh and twelfth respectively, neither car had a successful race; the Mac3 didn't make the start, and the M1 retired after 73 laps. The Mac3 did, however, finish sixth in the ISRS season opener at Paul Ricard; both Centenaris were classified in the CN category, and they were the only cars in that category to finish the race. This was followed by a ninth overall finish (second in the CN class) for the Mac3 at Brno. For Misano, Centenari entered three cars; two M1s, and a Mac3. Both M1s retired, but the Mac3 finished twelfth, and fifth in class. At Donington Park, the Mac3 completed too few laps to be classified. Anderstorp saw the Mac3's gearbox fail after 31 laps. N√ºrburgring saw the Mac3 finish in twelfth place overall; however, this was the second-to-last position in the CN class (the M1, which finished in thirteenth overall, was last in class). At the penultimate round at Le Mans, the Mac3 finished tenth overall and second in class. A Mac3 was then used in the Hockenheim round of the Internationales FRC Rennen by G. Gomez, but was not classified. The Mac3 was not entered in the ISRS season finale at Kyalami. Centenari were classified joint-second in the CN Team's Championship, and eleventh overall, at the end of the ISRS season. =1999-2001= Josef Pfyl and Joa Barbosa drove the Mac3 in multiple events in 1999. Pfyl won twice, at Dijon on 3 April, and at Varano on 2 May; whilst Barbosa won at Dijon on 19 June. Frederico Leone also entered a Mac3 that year, in a race at Hockenheim on 23 October, but did not finish. Pfyl and \\"Gianfranco\\" were the main Mac3 drivers in 2000. Pfyl's best finish was second in a race at Gurnigel on 10 September, whilst \\"Gianfranco\\" won at Vallelunga on 2 April. Luigi Francucci drove the Mac3 to 16th in a race at Misano on 22 October. Centenari entered Jo√£o Barbosa, Georg Paulin and Andrea Piccini in the Mac3 at the 6 Hours of Vallelunga, but retired after 53 laps. In 2001, \\"Gianfranco\\", Pfyl and Walter Margelli were the car's most regular drivers; \\"Gianfranco\\"'s best finish was a fourth at Misano on 8 July, Pfyl's was a second at Dijon on 15 April, whilst Margelli's best finish was fourth at a race held on the Autodromo del Levante on 23 September. =2002-2005= In 2002, the Mac3 was entered in two rounds of the Interserie by Jo Zeller Racing. Classified as a Division 5 car and driven by Pfyl, it won its class (finishing fourth overall) in the first race it was entered in, the first race of the Most weekend, and second in class, seventh overall, in the second race at Most. Jo Zeller Racing entered the car again at the Hockenheimring round of the Interserie, with Pfyl finishing tenth overall (fourth in Group L) in race one, and eighth in race two, third in Group L. Motori di Carlotta entered the Mac3 at the 6 Hours of Vallelunga in 2005; the car, driven by Filippo Vita, Diego Borgese and Luigi De Luca, qualified in second place overall, but retired from the race just after the two-hour mark, having completed 75 laps. =2006-2007= Centenari Racing entered the 6 Hours of Vallelunga in 2006, with the Mac3 being updated to create the new MG3. The new car featured an Alfa Romeo engine, just like the M1 and Mac3, with Giovanni Mezzasalma and Giovanni Cassibba being employed to drive it.

It was established by Augustinians in 1156 and dissolved in 1536. A domestic house, which still exists today, was built upon the former monastic site soon afterwards. History The priory was established by Ralph Brito (of Annesley) in 1156 on the site of an earlier chapel served by a Hermit (listed as \\"Brother Robert\\" in the charter of foundation). The hermitage was dedicated to Saint Helen and had, in 1151, been endowed by Brito who placed it under the control of Worksop Priory. Worksop retained control when the priory was established, a situation which was confirmed in a papal bull by Pope Alexander III in 1161.'Houses of Austin canons: The priory of Felley', A History of the County of Nottingham: Volume 2 (1910), pp. 109-12. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40089 Date accessed: 30 July 2013 Worksop remained in control until 1260, when Felley became an independent priory. Ralph Brito and his son donated to the priory the church at Felley. Other donations include the church of Annesley (donated by Ralph de Annesley), a mill at Bradley, land in Nottinghamshire (donated by Serlo de Pleasley, lord of the manor of Ashover), land at Ogston and Brackenfield (donated by Ivo de Heriz), land at Tibshelf (donated by John and Sarah de Heriz), land at Ashover (donated by Geoffrey de Langley), land in Derbyshire (donated by Sir Geoffrey de Dethick), land at Whiteborough (donated by Geoffrey Barry), land and rents in Chesterfield (donated by William Britton), and land at Newark, Colwick and Southwell. The priory also received charters of confirmation from both Pope Celestine III and Pope Gregory IX. The priory was never very large: It was probably home to only five or six canons (monks), and the priory church is thought to have been only a simple nave and chancel. The 1534 Valor Ecclesiasticus records the priory as having an income of ¬£61 4s. 8d. The priory was visited by two commissioners (Legh and Layton) who recorded the priory had an annual income of around ¬£40 but was almost as much in debt. The priory was dissolved in 1536, as part of King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last prior, Christopher Bolton, was given an annual pension of ¬£6; this was, however, cancelled when Bolton became rector of Attenborough. =Priors of Felley= *Walter, probably first prior *Adam de Nokton, *William de Lovetot, *Henry *Thomas *Walter, occurs c. 1240 *Henry, occurs 1260 *Ralph de Pleasley, occurs 1268, deposed 1276 *Thomas de Wathenowe, 1276 *Alan de Elksley, 1281 *William de Toveton, resigned 1315 *Elias de Lyndeby, 1315 *John de Kirkeby, 1328 *John de Holebroke, 1349 *Richard de Shirebrook, 1349 *Robert Eavys, died 1378 *Thomas Elmeton, 1378 *John de Mansfield, 1381 *William Tuxford, died 1405 *John Gaynesburgh, died 1442 *Peter Methlay, 1442 *John Throghcroft, died 1454 *William Acworth, 1454 *Richard Congreve, 1463 *William Symondson alias Bolton, 1482 *Laurence Ynggam, 1500 *Thomas Gatesford, resigned 1519 *Thomas Stokk, 1519 *Christopher Bolton Monastic remains Felley Priory. The older stonework attributed to the monastery is clearly visible Little survives of the priory. Following the dissolution, a house was built on the location of the western arm of the cloister. This house is also known as Felley Priory. The core of the house dates from the 15th and 16th-centuries and is thought to incorporate some old masonry from the priory. It has, however, been extended and remodelled since the 17th-century. Four semi-circular columns, thought to be from the priory church, survive and have been reused as gateposts for the house. The priory's precinct wall and fishponds also survive. History after dissolution In 1539 the priory's land was granted to William Bolles, but he did not hold them for long as Queen Mary sold the land to Sir Anthony Strelley, whose family held Strelley, near Nottingham. After the former priory reverted to the Crown again, King James I leased the former priory to Anthony Millington, who made it his family seat. Gilbert Millington, Anthony's eldest son was probably born at the house built upon the former monastery (also known as Felley Priory).Richard L.

Having started his career as an officer in the Dutch army, he later studied law and philosophy. His active life as a publishing philosopher started around 1947. In 1949 he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Leiden. Due to a scarcity of translated works he is little known in the English-speaking world but he was influential for a number of other Dutch philosophers. He was one of the second generation of reformational philosophers arising from the Free University (VU) in Amsterdam, after the first generation of Herman Dooyeweerd and D. H. Th. Vollenhoven. Other second generationers were: Hendrik van Riessen, S. U. Zuidema and K. J. Popma. Brief outline of his thinking Mekkes¬¥s philosophy is first of all characterized by his passionate attention to the individual subjective concreteness of human life even in its societal and historical relatedness. Being dissatisfied with Kant¬¥s formalism, just as much as with the scholastic tradition seeking to hold on to the reality of some supernatural form of being, he developed an integral way of thinking in which the natural and the typically human modes of experience are equally important. According to Mekkes, the basic shortcoming of most Western philosophical traditions is their abstractness. This has its root in the absolutization of abstractive analytical thought, as opposed to the concreteness of living persons. In response to the basic problem of human existence, philosophy has tried to find a solution via its theoretical insights. However, theory can only deal with abstractions. But the problem of human existence is not at all abstract. It is a problem of concrete, finite existence. In his concrete finiteness man lacks existential meaning. Therefore, if there is something of a solution, it is only to be found in personal concreteness. The way of supernatural religion just as much as the way of theoretical absolutization are dead-ends. So, man has to concentrate on his individual concrete subjectivity. It is there that the decision about meaning is made. But meaning appears to be a difficult something, not in the last place because man¬¥s natural existence is finite. It being the only existence he has, the problem becomes one of love. How are we to love our reality? It is along this idea of meaning that Mekkes reads Scripture. The Biblical way of life and experience is a finite one, full of misfortune. But it is a way of basic love. Mekkes finds these two characteristics of existence, finiteness and life-by-love, in the oldest Hebraic traditions. His hermeneutics of meaning takes us back before the beginning of all later scholasticism, without turning to what are understood today as typical Jewish traditions. Since he differs in principle from the Greek tradition of the absolutization of theory, as well as from the attempt to synthesize Greek ways of thought with Hebraic thought (scholasticism), as well as from Jewish traditions, Mekkes would seem to be tapping an original source of meaning. In fact, central in his thinking is the idea of Origin, to which we are ‚Äúrelated‚Äù in the very core of our being. This central ‚Äúrelation‚Äù is beyond the grasp of our theoretical insight, for it is in fact presupposed by all theoretical activity. Our being is as such originating, and its core must be of an affective nature. Working consistently from these basic insights, he continued to follow and discuss the developments in phenomenology and existentialism. Throughout his publications he remained in discussion, at increasingly penetrating levels, with the philosophies of Scheler, Heidegger, Jaspers, Sartre. By keeping time, subjective individuality, and the problem of meaning in the forefront of his attention, he intended to contribute to a fundamental reformation of philosophy itself.

He was the son of Austrian physician and pediatrician Ernst Moro. Life and works Moro was born in Heidelberg, Germany to Professor Ernst Moro, a renowned Austrian physician and pediatrician, and Margareta H√∂nigswald. He initially trained in Stuttgart and then at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical Academy. Having a Jewish grandmother, he was obliged to move to Zurich for his final two years, studying under Otto Salvisberg. On graduating in 1936 he moved to London with no money and limited English. He worked for two years with Berthold Lubetkin, \\"by far the most interesting architect I ever worked with.\\" In 1938, Moro and Richard Llewelyn-Davies were commissioned to build a house, Harbour Meadow at Birdham, Sussex, one of the least known but most original modern houses of the 1930s, now Grade II listed. Moro was briefly interned as an \\"enemy alien\\" on the Isle of Wight, then from 1941-47 taught at the Regent Street Polytechnic establishing a reputation as someone who knew how to teach architecture in a modern way. Students from his class were drafted into the design team for the Festival Hall. \\"I chose a handful of the best of my former students whose ideas of design were sympathetic to my own.\\" He was made a RIBA Fellow in 1948. From 1952 to 1984 he led Peter Moro and Partners, designing Fairlawn Primary School, Lewisham in 1957. His design for his own house at 20, Blackheath Park, a pavilion with a raised living floor, was one of the first post-war buildings to be listed. The practice also designed public housing for the Greater London Council and the London Borough of Southwark. In 1964, Moro completed his first theatre, The Playhouse, Nottingham. It was one of the earliest theatres to be adaptable either as a proscenium stage or as a thrust stage (\\"peninsular\\"), projecting forward. Moro is quoted as saying that \\"a theatre, however attractive, which does not work backstage, is a nuisance: a theatre which has the correct technology, but no magic, is even worse.\\" He also designed theatres at Hull University, the Theatre Royal, Plymouth (1982) with an adaptable auditorium, and three theatres at the Academy of Performing Arts, Hong Kong (1983‚Äì85). He was appointed a CBE in 1977. Moro rejected criticisms of modern architecture, but in a way his whole output was a critique of what he called \\"the banality of functionalism\\", which, as he repeatedly demonstrated, could be overcome by the imaginative and technically skilful transformation of the ordinary. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/7) with Peter Moro in 1996 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.National Life Stories, 'Moro, Peter (1 of 15) National Life Stories Collection: Architects' Lives', The British Library Board, 1996.

It was one of the two Communist insurgencies to challenge the former British colony of Malaysia during the Cold War. As with the earlier Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960), the Sarawak Communist insurgents were predominantly ethnic Chinese, who opposed to British rule over Sarawak and later opposed the merger of the state into the newly created Federation of Malaysia. The insurgency was triggered by the 1962 Brunei Revolt, which had been instigated by the left-wing Brunei People's Party in opposition to the proposed formation of Malaysia. The Sarawak Communist insurgents were also supported by Indonesia until 1965 when the pro-Western President Suharto assumed power and ended the confrontation with Malaysia. During that period, the NKCP's two main military formations were created: the Sarawak People's Guerilla Force (SPGF) or Pasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak (PGRS), and the North Kalimantan People's Army (NKPA) or the Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara (PARAKU). Following the end of the Confrontation, Indonesian military forces would co-operate with the Malaysians in counter-insurgency operations against their former allies. The North Kalimantan Communist Party was formally established in March 1970 through the merger of several Communist and left- wing groups in Sarawak including the Sarawak Liberation League (SLL), the Sarawak Advanced Youths' Association (SAYA), and the NKPA. In response to the insurgency, the Malaysian federal government created several \\"controlled areas\\" along the Kuching-Serian road in Sarawak's First and Third Divisions in 1965. In addition, the Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub also managed to convince many of the NKCP insurgents to enter into peace negotiations and lay down their arms between 1973 and 1974. Following the successful peace talks between the Malaysian government and the Malayan Communist Party in 1989, the remaining NKCP insurgents signed a peace agreement on 17 October 1990 which formally ended the insurgency. History =Background= Members of the Sarawak People's Guerilla Force (SPGF), North Kalimantan National Army (NKNA) and Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) taking photograph together marking the close relations between them during Indonesia under the rule of Sukarno. Besides the communist insurgency in Peninsular Malaysia, a second one was waged in Sarawak, one of Malaysia's Borneo states. As with their MCP counterparts, the Sarawak Communist Organisation (SCO) or the Communist Clandestine Organisation (CCO), was predominantly dominated by ethnic Chinese but also included Dayak supporters. However, the Sarawak Communist Organisation had little support from ethnic Malays and the indigenous Sarawak races. At its height, the SCO had 24,000 members.Robin Corbett, 124 During the 1940s, Maoism had spread among Chinese vernacular schools in Sarawak. Following the Second World War, Communist influence also penetrated the labour movement, trade unions, the Chinese-language media, and the predominantly- Chinese Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP), the state's first political party which was founded in June 1959.Vernon Porritt, Rise and Fall of Communism in Sarawak, Chapters 1‚Äì4 Communist objectives in Sarawak were to achieve self-government and independence for the colony, and to establish a Communist society. The Communist Organisation operated through both legitimate and secret organisations to propagate Communist ideology. Their tactic was to establish a \\"united front\\" with other left-wing and anti-colonial groups in Sarawak to achieve their goal of independence of the colony from British rule. According to the Australian historian Vernon L. Porritt, the first known Sarawak Communist Organisation operation was an assault on the Batu Kitang bazaar on 5 August 1952. In response, the Sarawak colonial government approved more funding for security measures, strengthen the security forces, and introduced legislation to deal with internal security. Sarawak Communists were also opposed to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia, a sentiment that was shared by the Indonesian Communist Party, A.M. Azahari's Brunei People's Party, and the Sarawak United People's Party.Vernon Porritt, pp.81‚Äì83 =The Brunei Revolt= According to the historians Cheah Boon Kheng and Vernon L. Porritt, the Sarawak Insurgency formally began after the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. The Brunei Revolt was a failed uprising against the British by the A.M. Azahari's Brunei People's Party and its military wing, the North Kalimantan National Army (Tentera Nasional Kalimantan Utara, TNKU), who were opposed to the Malaysian Federation and wanted to create a North Borneo state consisting of Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo.Vernon Porritt, pp.85‚Äì86 According to Porritt, the SCO leaders Wen Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok were aware about A.M Azahari's planned revolt but were initially reluctant to resort to guerrilla warfare due to their weak presence in Sarawak's Fourth and Fifth Divisions, which were located adjacent to Brunei. In December 1962, the SCO still lacked a military wing and its members had not yet undergone military training. Following the Brunei Revolt, the SCO switched to a policy of armed insurgency from January 1963 since the defeat of the Bruneian rebels deprived it of a source of weapons. The Sarawak Communist Organisation's guerrillas would fight alongside the TNKU and Indonesian forces during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation (1963‚Äì1966).Vernon Porritt, pp.84‚Äì87 Following the Brunei Revolt, the British authorities in British Borneo, in co- operation with the Malaysian Special Branch, launched a crackdown of suspected Communists in Sarawak which prompted 700‚Äì800 Chinese youths to flee to Indonesian Kalimantan. There, these Communists received military-style training at Indonesian camps. At that time, President Sukarno was pro- Communist and anti-Western. As with Sukarno and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), the Sarawak Communists opposed the newly formed Federation of Malaysia as a \\"neo-colonialist conspiracy\\" and supported the unification of all former British territories in Borneo to create an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. According to the former British soldier and writer Will Fowler, the so-called \\"Clandestine Communist Organisation\\" had plans to launch attacks on police stations and to ambush security forces, paralleling similar tactics used by the Malayan National Liberation Army during the Malayan Emergency. =The Indonesian confrontation= Due to the Sukarno government's hostility to Britain and Malaysia, the Sarawak Communist Organisation used Indonesian Kalimantan as a base for building up a guerrilla force.Vernon Porritt, p.87 These Communist exiles in Indonesia would form the core of the North Kalimantan Communist Party's two guerrilla formations: the Sarawak People's Guerilla Force (SPGF‚ÄîPasukan Gerilya Rakyat Sarawak (PGRS)) and the North Kalimantan People's Army (PARAKU). The Sarawak People's Guerilla Force was formed on 30 March 1964 at Mount Asuansang in West Kalimantan with the assistance of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The SPGF's leaders included Bong Kee Chok, Yang Chu Chung, and Wen Ming Chyuan.Vernon Porritt lists the date of the Sarawak People's Gueriella Force's establishment as 20 March 1964. According to Conboy, the PGRS numbered about 800 and was based in West Kalimantan at Batu Hitam, with a contingent of 120 from the Indonesian intelligence agency and a small cadre trained in China. The Indonesian Communist Party was also present and was led by an ethnic Arab revolutionary, Sofyan. The PGRS ran some raids into Sarawak but spent more time developing their supporters in Sarawak. The Indonesian armed forces did not approve of the leftist nature of the PGRS and generally avoided them.Conboy p. 156 Meanwhile, the North Kalimantan People's Army was formed by Bong Kee Chok near Melawi River in West Kalimantan with the assistance of the PKI on 26 October 1965. While the SPGF under its commander Yang operated in western Sarawak, the NKPA operated in eastern Sarawak. The NKPA was initially commanded by Lam Wah Kwai, who was succeeded by Bong Kee Chok. According to Kenneth Conboy, Soebandrio met with a group of Sarawak Communist leaders in Bogor, and Nasution sent three trainers from Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat (RPKAD) Battalion 2 to Nangabadan near the Sarawak border, where there were about 300 trainees. Some three months later, two lieutenants were also sent there.Conboy p. 93-95 The Indonesians had planned to use the Sarawak Communists as an indigenous front for their operations during the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation. To support this ruse, they even named the organisation the North Kalimantan National Army (TNKU), to link the SCO to the original Bruneian rebels. While the first raids included SCO members, they were often led by regular Indonesian officers or Non-commissioned officers from the Marine commandos (Korps Komando Operasi, KKO), the Army para-commandos (Regimen Para Kommando Angaton Darat, RPKAD), and the Air Force paratroopers ( Pasukan Gerak Tjepat, PGT). Following an attempted coup by pro-PKI elements in the Indonesian military in October 1965, General Suharto assumed power and launched a purge of Communist elements. Overnight, the Sarawak Communists lost a safe haven and the Indonesian military would subsequently co-operate with the Malaysians in counter-insurgency operations against their former allies.Vernon Porritt, pp. 135‚Äì139, 143‚Äì47. According to Porritt, the Indonesian anti-Communist purge was also accompanied by a Dayak-led pogrom targeting the ethnic Indonesian Chinese in West Kalimantan, which received tacit support from the Indonesian authorities.Vernon Porritt, pp. 157‚Äì60 =Counter-insurgency efforts= In response to the Sarawak Communist Organisation's activities, the Sarawak and Malaysian Federal resorted to various counter-insurgency operations. On 30 June 1965, the Sarawak government's Operations Sub-Committee of the State Security Executive Council (Ops SSEC) implemented the Goodsir Plan. This plan involved the resettlement of 7,500 people in five \\"temporary settlements\\" along the Kuching-Serian road in Sarawak's First and Third Divisions. The Goodsir Plan was named after David Goodsir, the British acting commissioner of police in Sarawak.Vernon Porritt, p.121 These settlements were protected by barbed wire and modelled after the successful New Villages used earlier during the Malayan Emergency. As with the Briggs Plan, the Goodsir Plan's \\"controlled areas\\" succeeded in denying the SCO access to food supplies, basic materials, and intelligence from their Chinese supporters. By the end of 1965, 63 suspected Communists activists had been identified by the authorities. By the end of 1965, the Federal Government had built three permanent settlements at Siburan, Beratok, and Tapah to replace the five temporary settlements, which covered 600 acres and were designed to accommodate 8,000 inhabitants.Vernon Porritt, pp. 129‚Äì30, 141 By 22 July 1966, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman estimated that there were approximately 700 Communists in Indonesian Kalimantan and about 2,000 sympathisers. The Tunku also offered amnesty and safe-conduct passes to SCO guerrillas under Operation Harapan, but only 41 guerrillas accepted this offer. The end of the Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation also enabled the establishment of military co-operation between the Indonesian and Malaysian armed forces against SCO guerrillas in Borneo. In October 1966, both governments allowed their military forces to cross the border in \\"hot pursuit\\" operations. Between 1967 and 1968, Indonesian and Malaysian military forces took part in joint operations against the Sarawak Communists, which took an increasingly heavy toll on both the Sarawak People's Guerrilla Force and the North Kalimantan Liberation Army. Due to a decline in manpower, resources and increased isolation from their support base, the SCO shifted from guerrilla warfare towards reestablishing the movement's link with the masses, including the Natives, to preserve the 'Armed Struggle'.Vernon Porritt, pp.153‚Äì66 In February 1969, the Sarawak United People's Party's leadership reversed the party's anti-Malaysia policy following a meeting between the party's leader Stephen Yong and Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. Prior to that, the SUPP had been the main left-wing opposition party in Sarawak and enjoyed the support of Sarawak's ethnic Chinese community. Several members of the party were also members of Communist-affiliated organisations like the Sarawak Advanced Youths' Association (SAYA), the Sarawak Farmers' Organisation, and the Brunei People Party's guerrilla wing, the North Kalimantan National Army. The SUPP's Communist elements were decimated as a result of a statewide crackdown by the authorities between 1968 and 1969. Following state elections in July 1970, the SUPP then entered into a coalition with the Alliance Party's Sarawak partners, the Bumiputera Party and the Parti Pesaka Anak Sarawak, in the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly. This enabled the Malaysian Federal government to consolidate its control over Sarawak. In exchange, Stephen Yong was appointed to the State Operation's Committee, the state's security committee, which enabled the party to influence counter-insurgency operations and to look after the welfare of SUPP detainees and Chinese settlers in the resettlement centresVernon Porritt, pp.169‚Äì75 On 25 March 1969, Indonesian forces eliminated the Third Branch of the SPGF at Songkong in West Kalimantan following a two-day battle, wiping out the Sarawak People's Guerrilla Force's largest corps. To replace the decimated SPGF, the Sarawak Communist Organisation created the North Kalimantan People's Guerrilla Force at Nonok on 13 July 1969.Vernon Porritt, p. 176 =The North Kalimantan Communist Party= On 30 March 1970, Wen Ming Chyuan, the Head of the Sarawak People's Guerrillas in Sarawak's First Division, formed the North Kalimantan Communist Party. However, 19 September 1971 was chosen as the official date of the formation of the party to coincide with the Pontianak Conference, which had been held on 17‚Äì19 September 1965. While the Pontianak Conference was regarded as the foundation of the Sarawak Communist Movement, none of the conference attendees were Communist. Instead, they consisted of members of the left-wing Liberation League and the \\"O Members\\" of the Advanced Youths Association. While they had discussed creating a Communist party in Sarawak, they delayed doing so until 1971 due to the tense political situation in Indonesia. =Rajang Area Security Command (RASCOM)= The Rajang Area Security Command or simply known as RASCOM is a Malaysian security area that covers the area of Rajang River in Sarawak. It was established on 18 April 1972 by the Malaysian government and its main headquarters is located at Sibu. Poster of Communist terrorist remnants in RASCOM area, Borneo, circa 1980. =Defections and decline= The Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub also made several overtures to the NKCP insurgents and managed to convince several of the insurgents to lay down their arms. In 1973‚Äì74, the Malaysian government scored a key victory when Rahman Ya'kub successfully convinced one of the NKCP leaders Bong Kee Chok to surrender along with 481 of his supporters. This was a heavy loss for the NKCP since this number comprised approximately 75 per cent of the NKCP's entire force in Sarawak. After this defection, only 121 guerilla fighters led by Hung Chu Ting and Wong Lian Kui remained. By 1974, the Communist insurgency had become confined to the Rejang Delta. Both sides sustained casualties and many civilians were also killed and wounded in the cross-fire. Following the successful Hat Yai peace accords between the MCP and the Malaysian government in 1989, the remaining NKCP guerillas decided to end their insurgency after one of their Chinese contacts Weng Min Chyuan convinced them to negotiate with the Sarawak state government. In July 1990, a series of negotiations between the NKCP and the Sarawak government took place at the town of Bintulu. By 17 October 1990, a peace agreement formally ending the insurgency was ratified at Wisma Bapa Malaysia in the state capital Kuching. Shortly afterwards, the last remaining NKCP operatives led by Ang Cho Teng surrendered. These developments ended the communist insurgency in Sarawak.

Songs About a year after forming the band and the release of the first album, Poogy Tales, the band released their second album, which succeed less from the first album, but included many hits. Most of the album's songs are a new recordings of older songs of Danny Sanderson, mostly from the rock operas that preceded Kaveret. In that album also the songs were characterized by Nonsense and wordplays. The greastest hit from the album, is \\"Natati La Khayay\\" (I Gave Her My Life) that was the Israeli entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, and won in the seventh place. The song \\"Okhel TaTzipornaim\\" (Eating the Fingernails) was originally a part of the rock opera \\"HaSipur Hamakhrid 'Al HaYeled MiBrazil\\" (The Horrific Story About the Boy from Brazil) (1971) and \\"Shir HaMekhiron\\" (The Price List Song) was originally a part of the \\"Poogy Opera\\" (1972). The song \\"Moshe Ken, Moshe Lo\\" (Moshe Yes, Moshe No) was originally called \\"Mushroom Revolution\\", and was written by Sanderson when he was in The Nahal Band.

The album also included nonsense that were performed at the band's live shows \\"Sukar BaTe\\" (Sugar in the Tea) or \\"Shir Mekha'a (Antibiotiqa)\\" (Protest song (Antibiotics)) that was written by Yoni Rechter, a short parody about Bob Dylan, and the first song which Rechter sang in solo. Some of the songs introduced new musical styles: The instrumental \\"HaTamnun Ha'Itter\\" (The Left-handed Octopus) included influences of oriental music. It was performed by \\"The Schnitzels\\", the beat band of Alon Olearthick and Sanderson, and played in the two versions of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra (Conductor: Zuzu Musa). Also the song \\"LeAmor 'E'Lavi\\" included Oriental influences. The song was written together with the qanun player, Abraham Slaman. The closing song \\"HaBalada Al Ari VeDerchi\\" (The Ballad of Ari and Derchi), is a progressive rock song, that wasn't a success in the band's live shows. In the song, Gidi Gov plays on a recorder, and Rechter plays mellotron, synthesizer and moog, which were unusual instruments for the band at the time. In 1990, the album was re-released on a CD, along with four bonus tracks that weren't included in the original release. Most of the bonus tracks are improvisations that were played during the band's rehearsals.

Many of the mountains of Mongolia were formed during the Late Neogene and Early Quaternary periods. The Mongolian climate was more humid hundreds of thousands of years ago.

The first scientifically confirmed dinosaur eggs were found in Mongolia during the 1923 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by Roy Chapman Andrews.

Stone Age Homo erectus possibly inhabited Mongolia as much as 800,000 years ago but fossils of H. erectus have not yet been found in Mongolia. Stone tools have been found in the southern part of the Gobi desert, perhaps dating back as much as 800,000 years.–•“Ø—Ä—ç—ç–ª—ç–Ω–≥–∏–π–Ω —ç—Ä–¥—ç–º —à–∏–Ω–∂–∏–ª–≥—ç—ç–Ω–∏–π –∞–∂–ª—ã–Ω –æ–ª–æ–ª—Ç –∞–º–∂–∏–ª—Ç, Institute of Mongolian Archaeology Deer stones (also known as reindeer stones) are ancient megaliths carved with symbols that can be found all over central and eastern Eurasia but are concentrated largely in Siberia and Mongolia. Most deer stones occur in association with ancient graves; it is believed that stones are the guardians of the dead. Out of 900 of these deer stones found in Central Asia and Siberia, around 700 are located in Mongolia. Their true purpose and creators are still unknown. Some researchers claim that deer stones are rooted in shamanism and are thought to have been set up during the Bronze Age around 1000 BC, and may mark the graves of important people. Later inhabitants of the area likely reused them to mark their own burial mounds, and perhaps for other purposes. In Mongolia, the Lake Baikal area, and the Sayan Altai and Altai Mountain regions, there are 550, 20, 20, and 60 known deer stones respectively. Moreover, there are another 20 deer stones in Kazakhstan and the Middle East (Samashyev 1992) and 10 further west, specifically in the Ukraine and parts of the Russian Federation, including the provinces of Orenburg and the Caucasus, and near the Elbe River (Mongolian History 2003). There are different viewpoints about the origins of deer stone art. According to H. L. Chlyenova, the artistic deer image originated from the Saka tribe and its branches (Chlyenova 1962). Volkov believes that some of the methods of crafting deer stone art are closely related to Scythians (Volkov 1967), whereas D. Tseveendorj regards deer stone art as having originated in Mongolia during the Bronze Age and spread thereafter to Tuva and the Baikal area (Tseveendorj 1979). D. G. Savinov (1994) and M. H. Mannai-Ool (1970) have also studied deer stone art and have reached other conclusions.

The Division's overarching mandate is to steer sustainable development and inclusive growth objectives through investment and enterprise development, productive capacity-building, industrialization and economic diversification. Its work programme is tailored to serve all UN member States, with a particular emphasis on the needs of least-developed and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies.  History  Prompted by a marked rise in cross-border investment activity, the UN in 1974 set up a permanent intergovernmental forum to deliberate on issues related to transnational corporations (TNCs), notably their developmental impact. The initial focus of the United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporations (UNCTC) was to contain the political and economic influence of TNCs. Over time a more nuanced approach evolved, which factored in the positive contribution TNCs can make to development. Analytical work thus expanded to cover strategies for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and harnessing such flows for growth, employment and poverty alleviation. The launch of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations ‚Äì which brought trade-related investment measures and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights into the trade negotiation ambit ‚Äì added another dimension to the UNCTC's work as it assisted developing countries to formulate negotiation positions on these new issues. In 1993 the TNC programme was brought under the auspices of UNCTAD. With an expanded work programme that includes investment and enterprise development issues at large, it is now formally known as the Division on Investment and Enterprise, with offices in Geneva.  Function and Work Programme  The Division's programme of work is driven by UN member States' evolving needs in the area of global investment and enterprise. Its formal mandate is principally determined by the quadrennial UNCTAD Ministerial Conference and its subsidiary bodies, the Trade and Development Board and the Investment, Enterprise and Development Commission. To holistically serve member States' interests, outputs are impact-oriented and span three interlinked operational spheres: (1) the compilation of a comprehensive body of knowledge through research, data collection and policy analysis; (2) achieving practical outcomes through capacity-building and technical assistance; and (3) contributing to systemic coherence in the area of international investment policy through consensus-building among UN member States. The DIAE's work programme spans two flagships ‚Äì the World Investment Report and the World Investment Forum ‚Äì and seven core products and/or services: the investment policy monitorhttp://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/Research%20on%20FDI%20and%20TNCs/Investment- Policy-Monitor.aspx and the global investment trends monitor;http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/Research%20on%20FDI%20and%20TNCs/Global- Investment-Trends-Monitor.aspx International Investment Agreements;http://unctad.org/en/pages/DIAE/International%20Investment%20Agreements%20(IIA)/International- Investment-Agreements-(IIAs).aspx investment policy reviews;http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/Investment%20Policy%20Reviews/Investment- Policy-Reviews.aspx investment information systems; the Investment Facilitation Compact;http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/Investment%20Facilitation%20Compact/Investment- Facilitation-Compact.aspx entrepreneurship developmenthttp://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneurship- Policy-Framework-and-Implementation-Guidance.aspx and International Standards for Accounting and Reporting.http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/ISAR/ISAR- Corporate-Transparency-Accounting.aspx In addition it maintains the World Investment Network, a subscription-based mailing list of more than 9 000 members to whom the DIAE's work on investment and enterprise is disseminated. The Division's body of work is highly relevant for policymakers, the private sector, practitioners and academics, and is recognized by government ministries and peer organizations as leading-edge and agenda-setting. It maintains one of the most comprehensive data bases on FDI and M&A; statistics,http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/FDI%20Statistics/FDI- Statistics.aspx FDI and TNChttp://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/Research%20on%20FDI%20and%20TNCs/Research- on-FDI-and-TNCs.aspx research and investment regulation,http://businessfacilitation.org/ with information and data on more than 200 economies spanning a period of 40 years. Other work is focused in the areas of corporate social responsibility (CSR)http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/ISAR/ISAR-Corporate-Transparency- Accounting.aspx and small and medium enterprise (SME) development, while enterprises in 30 countries receive direct, practical support through the Empretec programme.http://www.unctadxi.org/templates/Startpage____7428.aspx Several development-related activities are done in partnership with other key international entities. Within the corporate social responsibility ambit, the DIAE has developed, in collaboration with the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment (PRAI),http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/G-20/PRAI.aspx which emphasizes the preservation of rights, livelihoods and resources in farming communities. The Division is also involved in the Sustainable Stock Exchangeshttp://www.sseinitiative.org/ project, an initiative to enhance corporate transparency and performance on environmental, social and corporate governance and encourage responsible long-term approaches to investment. In addition, a key partnership has been forged between UNCTAD and the G20 in the area of investment and development. In service of this partnership, the DIAE supports the work of the G20 in several areas,http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/G-20/G20-Investment.aspx notably measuring the employment and development impact of investment and promoting private standards for responsible investment. The G20 and DIAE have also issued a joint report on private investment and job creation; and the DIAE collaborates with the OECD on tracking and compiling the annual report on G20 investment measures.  Organizational Structure  The DIAE, under guidance of director James Zhan, comprises four branches: Investment Trends and Issues; Investment Policies; Investment Capacity-Building and Enterprise Development. The branches focus on their individual issue areas but also work in concert on flagship outputs of the Division, such as the World Investment Report and the World Investment Forum.  Select Publications, Tools and Events  The DIAE's mainstay products are the annual World Investment Report (WIR) and the World Investment Forum. The World Investment Forum is a biennial, multi-stakeholder summit designed to facilitate dialogue and action on key emerging investment- related challenges. The World Investment Report is the primary reference document on global investment issues. Drawing on the expertise of in-house and external international investment specialists, the report compiles comprehensive data, and trends and policy analysis around a particular topical investment theme each year, supplemented by recommendations on how the findings can be harnessed to achieve pro-developmental outcomes. Themes covered in the past included investment in the low-carbon economy (WIR 2010)http://unctad.org/en/pages/PublicationArchive.aspx?publicationid=753 and non-equity modes of production and development (WIR 2011).http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/World%20Investment%20Report/WIR2011_WebFlyer.aspx The WIR 2012http://unctad.org/en/Pages/DIAE/World%20Investment%20Report/WIR2012_WebFlyer.aspx focused on the need to shape a new generation of investment policies. Two new tools were developed and launched to better assist policymakers: The Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Developmenthttp://www.unctad- docs.org/files/UNCTAD_IPFSD_2012.pdf was released alongside the WIR 2012 and consists of a set of core principles to guide investment policymaking and a framework for the design and negotiation of international investment agreements.

This documentary is based on the revolutionary Maoist movement in India. The documentary has been screened in various cities in India since 8 May 2013. It follows the Maoist protests and ambushes which feature the circumstances and environments of the Maoists. It sheds light on what goes on with the Maoists, what they are fighting for where they have been mistreated by the government. The movement is based on martyrs: Bhagat Singh and Avtar Sandu Singh \\"Pash\\" who are the faces for the Maoist movement in India. The film follows all parts of India where the Maoist movement exists and discusses the problems that they face such as: harsh living conditions and being on constant look out for Police in India. The documentary has a focus on the types of protests that the Maoists hold like singing, marching and chanting together. The documentary covers how guerilla warfare is a necessary tactic that has ‚Äúmade it impossible for them to be targeted\\". There is also no other way to defend themselves from Operation Green Hunt, which was an operation put in place by the Indian Government to eradicate the Maoists. The operation included 4000 Police Officers led by around 600 elite commanders of the Anti- Naxal Cobra Force which is the biggest ever counter-revolutionary operation.  Synopsis  This documentary deals with the issue of \\"Maoist insurgency in India\\". It focuses on the Maoists in Bastar in Chhattisgarh, tribals fighting against industrialists in Niyamgiri in Odisha and protestors acting in memory of the Leftist revolutionary Bhagat Singh in Punjab. This film depicts the people of these regions resisting oppression. The Movie begins by explaining what the catalyst was for the explosion of the Maoist movement in India which was the killing of Bhagat Singh who was an Indian Revolutionary in the 1930s when India was Imperialized by the British, and the killing of Pash, who was a Revolutionary poet. The Naxalites look to them as martyrs and try to finish what they started by continuing the Revolution. They have been called Naxalites ever since the armed uprising that had flared in Naxalbari, Bengal. The first part of the film reveals how the Maoists protest by showing the slogans they chant and different rally's where the leaders inspire the Maoist crowds. The film then moves into how the Indian government treats the Maoists. According to the film, the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, strongly opposed the Maoist movement labeling them as terrorists and making them his number one priority. The Maoists believe that the only real terror is State terror. The Government complains about the Maoists, but the Maoists believe the fight is for survival, everybody's survival. The film claims that there have been cases where the Government has labeled criminals not associated with Maoists as Maoists, in order to make them look worse to the general public. The next part of the film depicts the life of the Naxalites and how they survive by living in the forests. Making it clear that at this point they are fighting for survival as Capitalist companies are devastating the forests and scheming the system in order to pay the workers less than the official rate that the Companies list, effectively leaving the workers helpless. The Maoists fear that the Earth will be taken by Capitalist countries trying to make more money and will eventually leave the Naxalites without a home. As the movie progresses it shows the Maoist guerrilla warfare tactics: the soldiers are seen training in the forest because that is the only safe way for them to train and also the most realistic for how they fight against the government. Kak then moves into footage and interviews he found with Police officers recounting details of Maoist attacks as well as victims and their families telling stories of how they or a loved one was treated by the government, throughout the next 20 minutes of the documentary. The Police officers believe that the Naxalites have misled the people, trained them and in order to stop the Revolutionaries they need to turn the people on the Maoists. In the next interview a woman whose husband was brutally murdered recounts the scene when he was killed. She describes him as unarmed and surrounded by police, they proceeded to beat him up, attack him with axes and knives, chop off his limbs and take his child who they have not seen since. The end of this part of the documentary shows Maoist footage of 12 police officers attacking the Naxalites where the Naxalites let the remaining 3 police officers surrender and go home instead of killing them. The last part of the film starts off by focusing on the people who died fighting for the cause, and the Naxalites telling their story to get people to try to join the fight against the government. Since it's the end of the film Kak ties it all together by reiterating the reasons the Maoists are fighting. The Indian government is allowing Capitalist companies to mine and start other special projects which lead to the displacement of the tribes and the destruction of their way of life. The Maoists stress that most of the demands of the Naxalites fall within the Indian Constitution, but due to the mistreatment of the people the Maoists have become cynical of the Indian Constitution, hearkening to a poem written by Pash where he declares that the Indian Constitution is dead and not worth reading. The Maoists say that the Indian government is responsible for all of the violence occurring in India because the more intense and extensive havoc created by the government such as killing, torturing and raping will breed the intense resistance of the armed minorities. In the film Kak includes an audio of the police getting an order to seek out any possible Naxalites and to kill any journalists that come to cover them. He is trying to reiterate how little the government cares about the people. The documentary ends with the people marching together and kids training to join the fight, practicing to shoot in the forests.  Production  alt=Sanjay Kak is an independent Indian filmmaker who has made other documentaries such as Jashn-e-Azadi, Words on Water which won Best Long Film prize at the International Festival of Environmental Film & Video, Brazil, and In the Forests Hangs a Bridge which won Golden Lotus Best Documentary Film National Film Awards; Asian Gaze Award, Pusan Short Film Festival, Korea. In an interview with Red Pepper, Kak talks about why he chose India as his subject for his documentary, saying \\"In India, the legacy of Gandhi has been conveniently deployed by all sorts of political formations to delegitimise any kind of radical challenge to the form of the state. As if the inherent nature of Indian society is 'non-violent', and vegetarian to boot! Whereas the truth is that this is a society constructed on the violence of the caste system. And this is a system that has frequently reinvented itself with the passage of time, in order to fit newer forms of social and political mobilisation.\\" He sees himself as a political filmmaker who tries to capture beauty in complex and disturbing areas of the world. He describes \\"the struggle is always to find a language in film that is appropriate to one‚Äôs politics\\" while also trying to persuade his viewers with his own political understanding. A staple of Kak's films is his use of poetry in order to connect India's past to its present noting that India has a very rich history of poetry in relation with resistance and it helps him to emphasize the sentiments of his subjects in his films. He is not specifically focused on the people in the margins, but notes that he focuses on the people that he is \\"most excited, energised and renewed by\\" which continues to draw him back into the theme of resistance. Busan International Film Festival 2018 Red Ant Dream was financed by funds given by an International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam Fund grant and a prize from the Busan International Film Festival. During the Busan International Film Festival the Asian Cinema Fund provides filmmakers the opportunity to share their work with one another giving them a \\"pan-Asian network\\" which gives the filmmakers the ability to establish their films and \\"position themselves as important parts of the film industry\\". Their goal is to be able to show high quality Asian films around the world. Reviews The film has been well-received by critics. Sheikh Saaliq, editor of The Vox Kashmir, in one of his reviews in The Express Tribune said, \\"This film is a saga of heroism and sacrifice in the face of a brutal enemy camouflaged as the world‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest democracy‚Äù. Red Ant Dream is a moving meditation.\\"http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/18183/red-ant-dream-a- documentary-about-kashmir-india-and-freedom/ Tansuhree Bhasin,writer for Sunday Guardian, in his review of Red Ant Dream, said \\"In a sense Red Ant Dream gives a face to what the state calls the 'greatest internal security threat' to the country\\". He notes how Kak has been outspoken about the Indian state's oppressive Regime and it's \\"dodgy affair with capitalism and foreign investment\\"  References   External links  * * __FORCETOC__ Category:Indian documentary films Category:Indian films Category:Films about Naxalism Category:Documentary films about politics Category:2013 films Category:2013 documentary films ","title":"Red Ant Dream"},{"id":"40110467","text":"Thimmapur may refer to:  Andhra Pradesh  *Thimmapuram, Kakinada, a neighbourhood in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, India  Karnataka  *Timmapur, Gadag, a panchayat village in the Gadag district, Karnataka, India *Timmapur, Sindhanur, a panchayat village in the Sindhanur taluk, Raichur district, Karnataka, India  Telangana  *Thimmapur (Haveli), Warangal, a neighbourhood of Warangal, Telangana, India *Thimmapur, Karimnagar district, a village in the Virudhunagar district, Telangana, India *Thimmapur, Gudur mandal, a village in Gudur mandal, Warangal district, Telangana, India *Thimmapur, Kothagudem mandal, a village in Kothagudem mandal, Warangal district, Telangana, India *Thimmapur, Nalgonda district, a village in the Nalgonda district, Telangana, India *Thimmapur, Sangam mandal, a village in Sangam mandal, Warangal district, Telangana, India *Thimmapur, Venkatapuram mandal, a village in Venkatapuram mandal, Warangal district, Telangana, India *Thimmapur, Warangal district, a village in Zaffergadh mandal, Warangal district, Telangana, India  Tamil Nadu  *Thimmapuram, a village in the Virudhunagar district, Tamil Nadu, India *Thimmapur-M-Tadakod, a village in the Dharwad district, Karnataka, India ","title":"Thimmapur"},{"id":"40110470","text":"New Horizon is the fourth studio album by Northern Ireland rock band The Answer.

Simeon Ajigo spent part of his childhood living in Kibera and later worked for many years at the Kibera YMCA. After conducting research, Simeon learned that a number of single mothers were giving their children alcohol while they left the house for work.

Simeon made it his mission to build a daycare. Shortly, Simeon's vision for Facing the Future School (FAFU) grew to include a nursery, primary school, health center and a community outreach program for teenagers in Kibera.

The bridge was designed by the English engineer Rowland Mason Ordish. The design, which used the Ordish‚ÄìLefeuvre system, was originally created for the Albert Bridge over the River Thames in London. However, after construction of the Albert Bridge was delayed, Ordish decided to build a bridge in Prague first. The foundation stone was laid on 19 October 1865, and engineer Franti≈°ek Sch√∂n was charged with supervising the construction work. Emperor Franz Joseph, after whom the bridge was named, attended the ceremonies for its opening on 13 May 1868. Much like its London counterpart, the Franz Joseph Bridge featured a combination of stay and suspension rods. The latter formed a cable which held the diagonal stay rods. The main span was long and wide, while the entire structure was over long. The bridge was gradually strengthened and rebuilt in the 1890s. In 1919, following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and its monarchy, the Franz Joseph Bridge was renamed in honour of the Slovak politician and astronomer Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nik. In the 1930s, the bridge could no longer bear the increasing traffic in Czechoslovakia's capital, and the authorities began considering its replacement. It was named after the Czech composer Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek for a short period in the 1940s. The bridge was demolished in 1941 and replaced with a modern one named after the communist activist Jan ≈†verma in 1951.

The church is a Grade I listed building. Secular history Bulley has had a long association with Churcham. When a parish school was founded for Churcham and Bulley in 1856 it was built at Bulley. Under the Local Government Act 1894 Bulley was made a separate civil parish, but in 1935 it was merged with that of Churcham.

He became prominent following the 2004 publication of his autobiography, Taming The Tiger, in which he claimed to have been a violent criminal before converting to Christianity. The book was well received by the Christian community, and Anthony began an international ministry as an evangelist. However, an independent investigation in 2013 concluded that large sections of the book are false. Early life and conversion Tony Anthony was born in London. According to his books, his father is Italian and his mother is Chinese, and he spent part of his childhood with relatives in Canton, China. He claimed to have been trained in kung fu by his grandfather, and that he won three Kung Fu world championships after returning to London, before working as a bodyguard and turning to violence and crime, including murder, after his fiancee died in a car accident. He recounted that in 1989 he was arrested for burglary in Cyprus and was sentenced to three years imprisonment in the Central Jail of Nicosia, where his Buddhist upbringing did not give him much strength to endure the harsh conditions.David F. Dawes, A tiger's progress from Kung Fu champ to Christ , canadianchristianity.com, October 2005. Retrieved 6 January 2012. Over six months, he was visited every week by an Irish missionary, Michael Wright, and converted to Christianity. They developed a friendship which continued after Anthony's release. He was sentenced again in 2001 to 15 months in prison in the United Kingdom for perverting the course of justice and other charges.Couple lied about death crash, Reading Post, 5 June 2001. Retrieved 1 August 2013. By his own version of events, his car had hit a female motorcyclist at night, killing her, but he had not stayed at the scene and later denied it to police. The person killed was Elizabeth Bracewell, sister of footballer Paul Bracewell. Anthony's wife, Sara, received a sentence of 120 hours of community service for her role in the cover-up. When Anthony was jailed (as when he married) he used a false date of birth. Anthony set up Avanti Ministries in 2003 to support his evangelistic work (avanti is the Italian for 'go'). The organisation received charitable status on 3 June 2004.The Charity Commission regulates British charities. Its website, http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk, indicates that Avanti Ministries Limited is charity number 1104111, incorporated on 21 September 2003 and registered as a charity on 3 June 2004. In 2004, Authentic Media (then part of Christian publishers Send the Light and currently owned by the Australian company Koorong) published Anthony's autobiography, Taming The Tiger. The book won the 2005 Christian Booksellers Convention award, was translated into 25 languages, and 1.5 million copies were distributed. Taming The Tiger brought Anthony to the attention of Christians worldwide, who were enthralled by the conversion of such a violent criminal. He travelled internationally to tell his story; video interviews were broadcast in Canada on 100 Huntley Street in 2005 and 2011, and in the Netherlands by Evangelische Omroep. Anthony was also the keynote speaker at the Global Day of Prayer event in London in 2010. He was a member of Leigh Road Baptist Church. Investigation Concerns began to be expressed about Anthony's claims to have been a Kung Fu champion and violent enforcer. Christian journalist Gavin Drake writes: > Questions were asked about the authenticity of Taming the Tiger ever since > it was first published in 2004. Critics were quick to point out that it > reads like a work of fiction... Users of a martial arts website also began to doubt Anthony's story, starting in 2007. Mike Hancock is credited with initiating the events that finally exposed Anthony. Hancock was appointed as a director of Avanti Ministries in December 2010, but received evasive answers when he asked for proof of Anthony's claims. Having failed to convince the other directors of the need to verify Anthony's story, he resigned in January 2012. Hancock then joined with another former director of Avanti Ministries, Geoff Elliott, who had similar concerns, Anglican church leader Carl Chambers, and prison chaplain David Buick, and together they sought to uncover the truth about Anthony.Annual reports for Avanti Ministries are available on the website of the Charity Commission. The report for the year ended 31 December 2010 indicates that Mike Hancock and Geoff Elliott were appointed as directors in December 2010. The report for the year ended 31 December 2011 indicates that Geoff Elliott resigned on 18 August 2011 and Mike Hancock resigned on 2 January 2012. Chambers created a website documenting his research into Anthony's claims. Additional members of the group were Tony Pancaldi, Aaron Peterson and Jon Mason. Collectively, they became known as the Research Group. In October 2012, the Research Group presented a detailed complaint to the Evangelical Alliance, an umbrella organisation of which Avanti Ministries was a member. Following discussions with the Alliance, Avanti Ministries agreed to set up an independent investigation conducted by a panel comprising three senior members of the Evangelical Alliance council. A joint press release issued by Avanti Ministries and the Evangelical Alliance on 12 July 2013 advised: > The panel produced its report on 26 June 2013 and concluded, based on the > evidence submitted to it, that large sections of the book Taming the Tiger, > and associated materials, which claim to tell the true story of Tony > Anthony‚Äôs life, do not do so. Avanti Ministries have refused to release the panel's report, citing confidentiality, but Gavin Drake has indicated that the Research Group challenged virtually all of Anthony's claims regarding his life prior to becoming a Christian. A comment by Steve Clifford, General Director of the Evangelical Alliance, confirmed that the information available online comprises most of the issues raised in the original complaint. Specific aspects of Anthony's story that have been disputed include his birth in the early 1960s to an Italian father, his childhood in China, his training in Kung Fu and winning three world championships, and his role as a bodyguard and enforcer for international gangsters and diplomats. Drake indicated that Anthony confirmed that his real name is Andonis Andreou Athanasiou and he was born on 30 July 1971, which would make him too young to have participated in the events described in his book. Subsequent events On 16 July 2013, the Avanti Ministries board made public their decision to close down the organisation. Authentic Media, Anthony's publisher, also announced that they were withdrawing his materials from sale. In a statement published on his personal website, Anthony accepted that there were some errors in Taming the Tiger relating to his childhood, and claimed he was unaware of these details when the book was written. Anthony maintained that the substance of the book is true, but did not respond to the more significant allegations. The statement was reported by the Christian Today website. On 30 August 2013, John Langlois OBE, the chair of the inquiry panel, released a strongly-worded letter expressing his concerns at the lack of transparency shown by Avanti Ministries. He said that a statement from Avanti Ministries was \\"a deliberate deception\\" and explicitly accused Anthony of making false claims: > ...I concluded that: # Tony Anthony never went to China as a child as > claimed, # He was never involved in Kung Fu as claimed, and # He was never > involved in Close Protection as claimed. The inquiry's conclusion was reported in both secular and Christian media, with British national newspaper The Observer describing Anthony as a \\"serial fantasist\\". Christianity printed a lengthy article about the investigation and its conclusions. Other press coverage included Anthony's local newspaper the Southend Standard, Reform magazine, and French magazine Marianne. Following Avanti Ministries' refusal to release the report, and Anthony's trivialisation of the allegations, the Evangelical Alliance removed Avanti Ministries from membership on 19 September 2013. A few days later, Anthony's former church, Leigh Road Baptist Church, released a statement indicating that they accept the findings of the inquiry and can no longer support his ministry. They confirmed that Anthony was no longer a member of this church. On 21 October 2013, the New Zealand Herald reported that Anthony was making a six-week visit to New Zealand, and that the NZ Christian Network, a similar organisation to the Evangelical Alliance, had issued a warning because Anthony's biography had been found to be '99 per cent false'. The national leader of the Elim Pentecostal Church in New Zealand was reported as saying that they are suspending support for Anthony pending their own investigations. On 25 March 2014, British Christian website The Way published an article in support of Anthony. The article referred to a subsequent investigation by Ian Bruce which concluded that the allegations made against Anthony were unjust, and called on the Evangelical Alliance and Christianity magazine to apologise for them. However, Gavin Drake (the journalist who wrote the 2013 report) concluded that Bruce's website did not cast doubts on his investigation or the Evangelical Alliance/Avanti panel. Luke Hughes-Bunger, director of The Hub Christian Resource Centre which had published evidence related to the 2013 investigation, issued a further point-by-point response, concluding that Bruce's investigation had done further harm to Anthony's credibility. Republication of Taming The Tiger On 9 July 2015, RoperPenberthy Publishing announced that they have published a revised edition of Anthony's autobiography, Taming The Tiger, and media interest in Anthony was reawakened. The first report was on the Christian Today website, dated 17 July 2015. It covered the earlier controversy, the republication of Taming The Tiger, and also pointed out discrepancies in a report on Anthony's website about a 2014 meeting at Royal Holloway University. The author concluded, > For the majority, the holes in his [Anthony's] story are simply too big for > him to retain his credibility as an evangelical Christian witness. Premier Media (the parent company of Premier Christian Radio) followed, with an internet article dated 22 July 2015, again covering the events of 2013 and the republication of Taming The Tiger. A day later, the Evangelical Alliance reiterated their previous statement that Anthony's claims had been found to be untrue.

He was the most notable member of the gens T√ºrje.Mark√≥ 2006, p. 256. Biography He was born into the Szentgr√≥t branch of the gens T√ºrje from Zala County as the son of Denis I. In the old charters, the village of T√ºrje was first mentioned in 1234. The monastery of the premontre monks was founded at the beginning of the 13th century. In this time, the namesake kindred was the landowner of the village and the neighboring villages too. Formerly, historian J√°nos Kar√°csonyi incorrectly assumed that Denis II was the son of Gecse and made a difference between him and Denis, who served as master of the horse. His influence arose during the reign of Andrew II, as his name was first mentioned by contemporary records in 1220. However, his offices are unknown before 1233. Denis as a faithful supporter of crown prince B√©la, who held the title of Duke of Transylvania after 1226, following the agreement between the king and his son after a series of conflicts for the throne. As a result, he was appointed voivode of Transylvania for duke B√©la in 1233. He held that office until 1234.Zsoldos 2011, p. 38.Engel 2001, p. 381. When B√©la ascended the throne in 1235, Denis was nominated master of the horse and served in this capacity until 1241. Besides that he also functioned as isp√°n for the stablemen (; ) in 1235 and isp√°n (comes) of Temes County in 1240.Zsoldos 2011, p. 56. He served as ban of Slavonia from 1241 to 1244. In the latter case, he held the title of \\"ban and duke of Slavonia\\" () after 1242, later also adopted the title \\"ban of Primorje\\" (). According to a non- authentic charter he also functioned as ban in 1245.Zsoldos 2011, p. 45. Denis participated in the disastrous Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241, from where fled together with king B√©la IV to the Dalmatian coast. Denis as royal governor of Dalmatia, took part in the Siege of Zara in 1243. On 30 June 1244, B√©la made a peace with the Republic of Venice and he surrendered his supremacy over Zara (today Zadar, Croatia) but he retained the one third of the Dalmatian city's revenues of customs. In 1244, Denis led the royal army against Spalato (today: Split, Croatia), which rebelled against the Hungarian monarch. In 1245, he was appointed palatine of Hungary, the second-highest secular office after the king in 1245 and held the position until 1246. Besides that he also functioned as isp√°n of Somogy County.Zsoldos 2011, p. 19. He served as master of the treasury in 1247, according to L√°szl√≥ Mark√≥, he held that office between 1246 and 1248.

Life Born in October 1750, Frost was educated at Winchester College, and became an attorney. In 1782 he was a prominent member of a group meeting at the Thatched House tavern in London, who advocated constitutional reforms. There his associates included William who corresponded with Frost on parliamentary representation, the Duke of Richmond, Lord Surrey, Lord Mahon, Major John Cartwright, John Horne Tooke, and John Wilkes. At the beginning of the French Revolution Frost adopted republican principles, and in 1792 sheltered in his house a number of political prisoners. The same year he took a leading part in founding the Corresponding Society, for which he also acted as secretary. The Society began active propaganda for a reform of the parliamentary representation: one of its manifestoes, prepared by Frost and Thomas Hardy showed that 257 representatives of the people, a majority of the existing House of Commons, were returned by a number of voters that was less than 0.1% of the nation. The Society for Constitutional Information was active at the same time, with both societies having branches in the provinces. The Constitutional Society elected Frost a deputy to the convention of France in 1793, his colleague being Joel Barlow, whose expenses he paid. In this character he was present at the trial of Louis XVI (1792‚Äì3), and was denounced in one of Edmund Burke's speeches as the ambassador to his murderers. On the information of the attorney-general Frost was arrested in February 1793 on a charge of sedition. He was brought to trial in the following May, the charge being that he had uttered words in Percy's coffee-house, Marylebone in favour of equality, and against the king and constitution. Defended by Thomas Erskine, he was found guilty, and was sentenced to six months in Newgate Prison, to stand once in the pillory at Charing Cross, to find sureties, and to be struck off the roll of attorneys. On 19 December 1793, Frost was brought out of Newgate in a state of collapse; but the crowd took the horses out of his carriage and drew him along the streets, shouting. They went to his house in Spring Gardens, where John Thelwall made a speech. During a debate in the House of Commons in May 1794 Pitt stated that the Corresponding Society had proposed to the Society for Constitutional Information a plan for a convention for all England, to overturn the established system of government. On 28 July 1797 members of the Corresponding Society assembled in a field near St Pancras, London. They were interrupted when magistrates arrested the principal speakers. The Society itself was then suppressed by the government. Frost was a candidate as Member of Parliament for East Grinstead in 1802, and petitioned against his opponent's return; a committee of the House of Commons found that the petition was frivolous and vexatious. In December 1813 Frost received from the Prince Regent a free pardon; and on 8 February 1815, the Court of King's Bench replaced his name on the roll of attorneys, but held that he was presumably unfit for the employment. Frost lived to the age of 91, dying at Holly Lodge, near Lymington, Hampshire, on 25 July 1842.

It is a metropolitan district council, one of ten in Greater Manchester and one of 36 in the metropolitan counties of England, and provides the majority of local government services in Oldham. It is composed of 60 councillors, three for each of the 20 electoral wards of the borough. It is also branded and known simply as Oldham Council. Currently the council is controlled by the Labour Party, with Cllr Sean Fielding (The youngest UK council leader) fulfilling the role as leader. Carolyn Wilkins became the local authority's first-ever female chief executive, having been formally appointed to the post in summer 2014. Many, but not all, of the council's staff are based at Oldham Civic Centre in the town centre. History Oldham Council is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. The borough is named after its largest town, Oldham, but also includes the outlying towns of Chadderton, Failsworth, Royton and Shaw and Crompton, the village of Lees, and the parish of Saddleworth. The borough was formed in 1974 as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972. It is an amalgamation of the former County Borough of Oldham with the Chadderton, Crompton, Lees, Royton urban districts of Lancashire and the Saddleworth Urban District of the West Riding of Yorkshire. For its first 12 years the borough had a two-tier system of local government: Oldham Council sharing power with the Greater Manchester County Council. Since the Local Government Act 1985 Oldham Council has effectively been a unitary authority, serving as the sole executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local policy, setting council tax, and allocating budget in the district. The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham has two civil parishes and 20 electoral wards. The parish councils are involved in planning, management of town and parish centres, and promoting tourism. In 2001, 46,072 people lived in Oldham's two civil parishes‚ÄîSaddleworth and Shaw and Crompton‚Äî20.9% of the borough's population. The rest of the borough is unparished. Since 2011 Oldham is one of the ten member authorities of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) which is a top tier local authority with responsibility for Transport, Health, Housing and Economic matters. The membership of the Combined Authority is drawn from the Leaders or Executive Mayors of each of the ten councils. In 2011 Oldham declared its ambition to become a Co- operative Council, which it describes as \\"one where citizens, partners and staff work together to improve the borough and create a confident and ambitious place...Put simply, becoming a co-operative borough is about everybody doing their bit and everybody benefitting.\\" An early progress report by the RSA thinktank in 2012 said Co-operative principles could help councils manage and reduce demand for services and create ‚Äòa sustainable economic and social future‚Äô. Oldham leads the national Co-operative Councils Innovation Network ‚Äì a group of local authorities who say they are committed to finding better ways of for, and with, their local communities. Oldham Youth Council, formed in 2006, now has constitutional power on Oldham Council ‚Äì a national first. The Youth Council is democratically elected every two years via a borough-wide election run in schools, colleges and youth organisations. The group now has its own section on the agenda of each meeting of Full Council at Oldham Council where it can raise and debate issues and hold councillors to account. Honours The council can confer the title of Honorary Alderman of the Borough on persons who have, in the opinion of the council, rendered \\"eminent services\\" to it as a past member. Recipients to date are: Ralph Semple MBE, Ellen Brierley, Jack Armitage, George Edmond Lord, Sidney GW Jacobs, David Roger Jones, Christine Wheeler and Richard David Knowles. The Freedom of the Borough is the highest honour the council can bestow. It is awarded rarely and dates back to the Middle Ages when freemen had commercial privileges and route into a position of power in a town or city. Associated with this is a ‚Äòfreedom of entry‚Äô which the council can award to service units which have \\"rendered conspicuous service\\" and are closely associated with the borough. Freedom of entry grants the service unit the right, privilege and honour of marching through the streets of Oldham on ceremonial occasions with swords drawn, bayonets fixed, drums beating, bands playing and colours flying. Recipients to date are: Dame Sarah Anne Lees, Dr Thomas Fawsitt, Alderman William Schofield, Charles Ward, Marjory Lees, Rt Hon Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, Rt Hon JR Clynes, William E Freeman, James Bannon, Alderman Frank Tweedale, Thomas Driver, Alderman John Fletcher Waterhouse, the 41st (Oldham) Royal Tank Regiment TA, Sir William Turner Walton, Alice Amelia Kenyon, Charles Leslie Hale, Sir Frank lord, Dame Eva Turner, Arnold Tweedale OBE, 75 Engineer Regiment (Volunteers), Honorary Alderman Miss Ellen Brierley MBE, Sir Norman Kelvin Stoller CBE and Michael Hugh Meacher MP. Political makeup The most recent elections took place in 2019. The current makeup of the council is: Coat of arms/motto The borough's coat of arms is based on the crest of the former Oldham County Borough and includes within it symbols to identify the other six districts that make up the Borough. These are the former urban districts of Chadderton, Crompton, Failsworth, Lees, Royton and Saddleworth. The Shield is derived from the former arms of Oldham showing three white owls (a pun on \\"Owldham\\") and three red rings giving the initial letter \\"0\\". Above it is the closed helm proper to Civic arms with its twisted crest-wreath and decorative mantling. Upon the wreath stands the Crest. The owl is shown on its rock rising from a gold circlet charged with the three red rings from the shield. The two red griffins identify the other districts by the heraldry of their chief manorial families which are some of the most famous in history. They include the Chaddertons (connected with Chadderton, Failsworth, Crompton and Lees) and the Chethams (connected with Crompton). Both families are branches of the de Traffords whose red griffin is also seen at Eccles and elsewhere. As a necessary difference they wear collars with fluted edges like those in the arms of the Radcliffes (Oldham, Royton and Chadderton). On the collars are the three red \\"bendlets\\" on white, of the arms of the Byrons (Failsworth, Crompton and Royton). From each collar hangs a white heptagon symbolic of the united seven authorities. On the left one is the black \\"mullet\\" of the Asshetons (Oldham and Chadderton) and on the right Saddleworth is represented by a black saddle in reference to the name of its derivation ‚Äì a settlement on a saddle-shaped ridge. The Oldham Council motto \\"Sapere Aude\\" means \\"dare to be wise\\" with the word \\"Aude\\" containing the syllable \\"Owd\\" of the local pronunciation of \\"Owdham\\" or \\"Owldham.\\" Leaders Councillor Sean Fielding, Labour Party, has been leader of Oldham Council since May 2018. He succeeded Councillor Jean Stretton after she was out voted by the Labour party and Councillor Jim McMahon who was elected the authority's MP in a by-election the previous month. The by-election was the result of the death of the sitting MP Michael Meacher.

Lakatos has represented Canada at three Summer Paralympics, and at the 2012 Games he won three silver medals in the sprint and mid- distance events. In 2013 Lakatos reached the pinnacle of his sport when he collected four gold medals at the IPC Athletics World Championships and became world champion at his classification in the 100m, 200m and 400m events. Personal history Lakatos came from a sporting family and was swimming by the age of four. When he was six years-old a freak ice-skating accident resulted in the formation of a blood clot on his spine that left his legs paralyzed. Lakatos is married to Great Britain Paralympic sprinter and long jumper, Stefanie Reid and as of 2012 they live together in Britain. Athletics career Although Lakatos had taken part in racing events during the summer months since 1996, he did not initially take to athletics and was far more interested in wheelchair basketball, playing for the University of Texas. Eight months before the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Lakatos decided to switch sports permanently to wheelchair racing. At that time Lakatos was competing as a T54 athlete having not yet received an International IPC Classication. In 2004 he finally qualified and was selected for the 2004 Summer Paralympics, this was quite an accomplishment for him in the T54 class, a class he was incorrectly placed in. He raced in the 100m, 200m, 4 √ó 100 m relay and 4 √ó 400 m relay, though he failed to qualify for the finals in the solo events and in the relays Canada came fourth in the finals of the 4 √ó 100 m and were disqualified in the 4 √ó 400 m. Lakatos' career changed when receiving his International IPC Classification at the 2004 Paralympics, he was reclassified as a T53 racer. He now found that instead of struggling to just qualify he was now one of the fastest athletes in his new class and in 2007 he was breaking Canadian wheelchair sprint records. Lakatos again qualified for the Canadian team in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. He was entered for the 100m, 200m and 400 m T53 events, and whereas in 2004 he failed to qualify for the finals, he now qualified for all three finals. Despite his best efforts, Lakatos could only finish between 5th and 6th in all three final races. Lakatos bettered these results when he raced in the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships, finishing third in the 100m and second in the 200m finals. By 2012 Lakatos was a major challenger for gold medals in his T53 events. In the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London he took three silver medals; in the 200m, 400m and 800m. In the 200m and 400m finals he was beaten by China's Li Huzhao, while in the 800m he was just 11 hundredths of a second behind Richard Colman of Australia. The next year Lakatos stamped his mark on the international stage when he won five medals, four of them gold at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships, becoming world champion in the 100, 200 and 400m. Then the day after the World Championships he competed in the Sainsbury Anniversary Games in London, setting the World Record in the 100m with a time 14.34s. Lakatos won the 2020 London Marathon in a time of 1:36:04.

He was originally elected as a Republican in 2010. He was re-elected as such in 2012 and 2014, serving as House Minority Whip from 2011 to 2013 and as House Minority Leader from 2013 to December 29, 2014, when he changed his party affiliation and joined the Democratic Party. He was re-elected as a Democrat in 2016, defeating his Republican opponent with 70% of the vote. Early and personal life Johanson was born in Montana. When he was six years old, his family moved to Hawaii, where his maternal grandparents had lived since 1959 and his grandfather worked as a shipfitter at Naval Station Pearl Harbor for over 30 years. Johanson graduated from Moanalua High School in Salt Lake on the island of Oahu and then from Yale University, where he received a BA in history. He then studied abroad at Hiroshima Shudo University, the Hokkaido International Foundation and at East China Normal University in Shanghai. He is fluent in Japanese and speaks some Chinese. Political career Prior to elected office, Johanson served as the Deputy Chief of Staff at the United States Mint, a Deputy Associate Director in the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, a Deputy Chief of Staff to Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii Duke Aiona, a legislative analyst for State Representative Lynn Finnegan and the Commissioner of the Hawaii Legislative Federal Economic Stimulus Program Oversight Commission. When Republican State Representative Lynn Finnegan of the 31st District retired to run for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in the 2010 election, Johanson ran to succeed her. He defeated Democrat Eleanor Lei Sharsh in the general election by 3,303 votes (56.4%) to 2,553 (43.6%). Shortly after being sworn in, he was elected by his Republican colleagues to serve as the House Minority Whip. Johanson was redistricted to the 32nd District for the 2012 election. He defeated Democrat Eleanor Lei Sharsh in a rematch by 4,017 votes (65.21%) to 2,143 (34.79%). In 2013, he was elected House Minority Leader. Widely regarded to be a \\"rising star\\" in the Hawaii Republican Party, at just 32 years of age, he was the youngest person to hold the post in recent history. He was re-elected in 2014, defeating Sharsh in a second rematch by 3,698 votes (71.81%) to 1,452 (28.19%). After the 2014 elections, all eight Republicans in the State House were unable to organise because some of them wanted to replace Johanson as Minority Leader, saying that he was \\"too collaborative\\" with the Democrats. On December 29, 2014, he changed his party affiliation and joined the Democratic Party. He said that he had been increasingly at odds with Republican Party members, who had become \\"more narrow in their demands for ideological purity as well as in their demand for a combative tone and posture\\" and that rather than \\"being focused on remaining the loyal opposition as some would like\\", he \\"look[ed] forward to making a collaborative, constructive and positive difference.\\" Reaction to his decision in the Republican Party was mixed. State Representative Cynthia Thielen, the longest-serving Republican House member, cried when lamenting his move, blaming right-wing conservatives for pushing him out and saying that the Party had lost a \\"wonderful, moderate voice. And I'm very sorry about it.\\" By contrast, Party Chairwoman Pat Saiki called his move \\"disgraceful\\" because he had been re-elected as a Republican less than two months prior, saying that it was \\"disappointing\\" that he was \\"willing to sacrifice his own political principals for his own ambition.\\" Johanson replied that his decision had been a \\"gradual and deliberative one\\" over the last four years and said that many voters cast a ballot for him despite his being a Republican, not because of it. He was subsequently replaced by Beth Fukumoto as minority leader, who would later leave the party and join the Democrats herself for similar reasons in 2017. Johanson was re-elected to a fourth term as a Democrat in the 2016 elections, defeating Republican opponent Eric Ching by 4,170 votes (70%) to 1,787 (30%).

Technology  Intelligent Energy's fuel-cell technology is divided into two platforms: air-cooled (AC) and evaporatively-cooled (EC). The air-cooled fuel cell systems use low-power fans to provide cooling and the oxidant supply for operation. Heat from the fuel cell stack is conducted to cooling plates and removed through airflow channels, a simplified and cost-effective system for the power range from a few watts to several kilowatts. They are used in a wide range of UAV, stationary power and automotive applications for two-wheel and small car range extender applications. Evaporatively-cooled (EC) fuel cell systems provide power generation from a few kilowatts up to 200 kW. Efficient thermal management of the EC fuel cell stack reduces system complexity, mass and cost. These systems are designed for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, and use modular architecture that can be quickly modified to suit the application.

He founded the Plumb Plan League to support the proposal. Despite strong support from organized labor, including railroad workers, miners and farm workers, the plan was not adopted. Life Glenn Edward Plumb was born in Clay County, Iowa in 1866. He became a lawyer, and was counsel for the City of Chicago when they were fighting against promoters of street railways. Plumb was a member of the legal department of Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne's administration in Chicago, as were J. Hamilton Lewis and Clarence Darrow. They attacked corporate tax evasion and corporate privileges, winning a notable victory when the Supreme Court struck down the \\"eternal monopoly\\" laws. In Blair v. City of Chicago, 201 U.S. 400 (1906) Plumb and Clarence Darrow both represented the City of Chicago. They argued that the street railways did not have an irrevocable right to use Chicago's streets, but required city council authorization. Plumb was appointed counsel for sixteen major railroad workers' organizations. By late 1917, during World War I, the railroad system in the eastern U.S. had virtually come to a halt. Problems included a shortage of labor due to low wages, and policies designed to maximize profits that prevented movement of empty cars at a time when most traffic was from west to east. On 26 December 1917 the Federal government of Woodrow Wilson took over control of the railroads. Plumb was in favor of making this arrangement permanent, and defined a cooperative structure in his \\"Plumb plan\\". He set up the Plumb Plan League to promote the plan in February 1918. The Armistice with Germany took effect on 11 November 1918. The railway labor unions wanted to retain government control after the armistice, but on 2 December 1918 President Wilson told Congress that the railroads had to be returned to their owners. Later that month in a referendum of railroad workers 306,720 out of 308,186 voted to keep government control. The Railway Employees' Department of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) put its weight behind the Plumb Plan League. The Plumb plan was supported by labor leaders such as Warren Stanford Stone of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, who felt it should be extended to other industries. Workers should be given an incentive to make their industry productive, and a reward for their effort. The plan was opposed by others such as Samuel Gompers of the AFL who was opposed to socialism and felt that government involvement would result in loss of workers' rights to bargain for their labor. Gompers had been attending the Versailles conference in Europe when he was called home to deal with labor unrest. He landed at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 26 August 1919. He met with Plumb immediately on arrival, and was guardedly critical of the plan, which involved too much state control for his taste. He made it clear that he had not authorized use of his name as honorary president of the Plumb Plan League. Plumb submitted his plan to the U.S. Senate's interstate commerce committee in 1919. Frederic C. Howe, commissioner of immigration and later a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, resigned in the summer of 1919 to work for the Plan. He was labelled the \\"Plumb Plan agitator\\" by agents of J. Edgar Hoover's Bureau of Investigation on watch for Bolsheviks. At the United Mine Workers convention in Cleveland in September 1919 the delegates endorsed the plan, and also approved nationalizing the mining industry. The Labor Party of the United States held its first national convention in Chicago in November 1919. The party endorsed the Plumb Plan in the Declaration of Principles agreed during that meeting. When Plumb spoke at the January 1920 AFL convention the delegates ignored Gompers and voted by 29,159 to 8,349 to nationalize the railroads and place them under democratic management. Despite worker enthusiasm, the plan had little chance of being adopted. The National Association of Owners of Railroad Securities (NAORS) represented bank and insurance companies with railroad holdings. They had noted the improvements during the period of Federal control of the railways but rejected the Plumb plan, although they did call for some public ownership of railroad infrastructure. The railroad executives were hostile, and there was little support in the House or the Senate. According to former President William Howard Taft the plan was \\"radically socialistic.\\" Business groups also saw the proposal as being suspiciously similar to socialism. In February 1920 Congress passed the Cummins-Esch bill, returning the railroads to their private owners. Plumb's name was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate at the Farmer- Labor Party convention in Chicago in June 1920. Glenn Edward Plumb lost a leg to gangrene on 18 May 1922. He died on 1 August 1922 in Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. from heart disease. He was aged 56. Plumb plan Under the Plumb plan the railways would be owned cooperatively. The federal government would sell bonds and use them to purchase the railroads. All railroads would be merged in a public corporation. Rates would be set by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The government would be paid 5% of revenue as a rental fee. Half of the profits would be given to the employees of the railroad and the other half would be used to retire the bonds. A board of directors with 15 members would control the railroad. The President of the United States would appoint five members, who would represent the public. The workers would elect five members and management would elect five members. The administration would be tripartite, including representatives of workers' unions, shippers' organizations and bondholders. The plan showed how the interests of workers and farmers in the national transportation system could be protected. It could readily be adapted for industries such as mining. Plumb said the plan would The plan was considered in Congress in the Sims Bill of 1919, which did not pass.

It has existed under its current name since 2009 when the Department of Minerals and Energy was divided and the Department of Energy was created. the political head of the department, the Minister of Mineral Resources, is Ngoako Ramatlhodi and his deputy is Godfrey Oliphant. In the beginning of June 2014, during the platinum wage dispute between mining companies and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), Ramatlhodi threatened that the mineral resources department would withdraw from the negotiation process. An agreement between the sides was reached by the end of the same month. In September 2015, Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane was appointed as the Minister of Mineral Resources.[3] The replacement of Ngoako Ramatlhodi was considered controversial and greeted with criticism from Labour Unions. On his appointment, Zwane urged a quick resolution to mining disputes and labour disruptions.http://business.iafrica.com/news/1008135.html In 2016, he was applauded for his resolution of Section 54 mine stoppage issues that had been negatively impacting mine production. In January 2017, during a judgement on the case between Aquila Steel and six respondents, which include the Minister of Mineral Resource and the department management, the Guateng division of the High Court of South Africa stated that the DMR stood in the way of private investment into the mining industry in South Africa, and failed to resolve central issues in a time effective and responsible manner, thus building a solid case for its own substitution. The department has its head office in the Trevenna Office Campus in Sunnyside, a suburb of the national capital Pretoria. There are regional offices in Polokwane, eMalahleni, Johannesburg, Klerksdorp, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Mthatha, Cape Town, Kimberley, Springbok and Welkom.

His most high-profile roles were those of television newsreader and special correspondent for BBC News and senior news presenter and foreign correspondent for Sky News, the first 24-hour satellite television news channel in the United Kingdom launched by British Sky Broadcasting in 1989. During a career in broadcasting and journalism spanning 65 years he has reported from 120 countries, including 16 wars, and nearly lost his life in a series of minefield explosions while covering the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.  Career  = Early life = Christopher Morris was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, and grew up there and in Penrith, Cumberland. As a jazz enthusiast and drummer, he formed the Delta Jazz Band and opened the Delta Jazz Club in Luton where he played alongside famous traditional jazz groups of the 1950s including Ken Colyer, Chris Barber, Cy Laurie and Humphrey Lyttelton. While also playing guitar, he formed a skiffle group within the band and recruited John, Duke of Bedford to play the washboard and tea-chest string bass at a time when he was trying to pay off ¬£4 million in death duties on his stately home, Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire. In his autobiography, A Silver Plated Spoon, the Duke wrote: \\"I played the washboard for a visiting skiffle group which has made more people regard me as a human being than anything else I have ever done.\\" Morris was educated at St. Albans School, in Hertfordshire, Britain's oldest public school, before joining the Luton News in Luton as a proof reader at the age of 15. After an apprenticeship of 5 years training as a news reporter and also writing regular weekly columns reviewing films, jazz and pop records, he joined the Daily Sketch, aged 20, where he was the youngest reporter in Fleet Street. However, 5 years later in 1962, much to the shock of his family, friends and colleagues, he left his career in Fleet Street to gamble on setting up a British freelance news agency in Spain, then under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. = Foreign correspondent in Spain = For the next 10 years, based in Madrid, he established his reputation as a foreign correspondent for British national, evening and Sunday newspapers including the Daily Mail and Daily Express, Evening News and Evening Standard, Sunday Times, Sunday Mirror and News of the World, and for Independent Television News (ITN) and for BBC News as a television and radio reporter. In 1966, Franco ordered Morris to be expelled after he broke the story to the world of the worst nuclear accident in America's military history when a US Air Force B-52 on a Strategic Air Command patrol at the height of the Cold War was involved in a mid-air collision with a refuelling aircraft. The B-52 jettisoned four H-bombs as it crashed bringing terror and spreading radioactivity around the Mediterranean village of Palomares when two of the nuclear devices cracked open on impact spilling lethal plutonium over a vast area. Only hours later when the Pentagon in Washington admitted the radioactive contamination on Spain's Mediterranean coast was the expulsion order revoked. = Work with BBC and Sky News = In 1972 Morris returned to London and joined the BBC staff, soon to be sent back to Spain to report on first, the assassination by the Basque terrorist group ETA of Franco's chosen successor, deputy Prime Minister Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, and, then later, on Franco's own death and funeral. His first war assignment in Cyprus was to end in disaster when a press convoy strayed into a minefield. The Press Association (PA) newsflash on the morning of 8 August 1974, caused chaos and confusion in the BBC Newsroom. It read: \\"BBC newsman Paul Morris has been killed in a minefield explosion in Cyprus.\\" In fact, Morris was critically wounded. It was a BBC TV News colleague and sound recordist, Ted Stoddard, who had been killed and six other British and American journalists injured when five anti-personnel mines exploded. Morris came close to death after shrapnel hit him in the chest, collapsing a lung, shattering ribs and paralysing his left arm. After spending months in hospital, and with his arm permanently disabled, he returned to work a year later, and more war assignments for the BBC in the Western Sahara, Chad, Ghana. Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Mozambique, Nicaragua and the Lebanon Among many major stories he reported for BBC TV News was the world's worst oil tanker spill at the time off the Brittany coast in France when the Amoco Cadiz split in two, and the car bomb explosion at the Houses of Parliament in London that killed Airey Neave the Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary and war hero who was the first British prisoner to escape from Colditz On 23 February 1981, he was back in Madrid, and by chance the only journalist inside the Cortes, the Spanish parliament, when rebel civil guards burst in during an attempted coup to oust King Juan Carlos. Along with more than 300 Spanish MPs, Morris and his BBC TV crew were held hostage at gunpoint for several hours before being released. His eyewitness account and film of the shoot-out has become an historic record of the day democracy defeated dictatorship in Spain. Throughout the Falkland Islands conflict Morris was in Buenos Aires, one of only a handful of British journalists allowed into Argentina to report from the enemy side during a war.  Immediately after the war ended, he was assigned to Israel to cover the invasion of southern Lebanon. When the BBC decided to switch him to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) side he was trapped inside West Beirut with the guerrilla forces of Yasser Arafat and under daily shellfire from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). While in Beirut, Morris broke the news of the massacre of 3,500 Palestinians by Lebanese Phalangist militias in Sabra and Shatila. He managed to smuggle video-recorded evidence of the event to Damascus in neighbouring Syria where the pictures were sent by satellite to London. The pictures caused worldwide protests and almost led to the downfall of the Israeli government. Defence minister Ariel Sharon, later to become Prime Minister, was forced to resign over complicity in the refugee camp attacks. During the Iran-Iraq war, after being the first journalist to report the fall of the key oilport of Khorramshahr, Ayatollah Khalkhali broadcast on Iranian TV putting a price for Morris' capture and described him as \\"the serpent of imperialism and international Zionism\\" Evading capture by Republican Guards, he was at the frontline with the forces of Saddam Hussein to witness their use of chemical and biological weapons. In the 1991 Gulf War with Sky News he was the first British television journalist to reach Kuwait City on the day of liberation. He reported on the massacre at the Mutla Ridge when coalition forces intercepted the retreating Iraqi army. Morris also reported from the various frontlines during the civil war in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Srebrenica where 7,500 Muslims were rounded up and shot by the advancing Serb forces led by General Ratko Mladic. Morris was the only television journalist to accompany Bob Geldof on all his visits to the famine-stricken countries of Africa after Band Aid and Live Aid when his reports for BBC TV News helped to raise ¬£70 million in aid. Other major assignments he covered for the BBC and Sky News was the first television interview with Anthony Blunt after the master spy's exposure by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; Spain's re-opening of the border with the Rock of Gibraltar 13 years after it was closed by Franco; the 1989 earthquake in San Francisco; the fall of the Berlin Wall; the attempted coup in Russia against president Mikhail Gorbachev; the release after 27 years in prison and first face-to-face interview with Nelson Mandela on his long walk to freedom before becoming South Africa's first black President;  the assassinations of India's prime ministers Indira Gandhi and, 7 years later, her son, Rajiv Gandhi; the election of Bill Clinton for his first term as US president; the murder trial in Los Angeles, lasting 9 months, of O.J. Simpson; the murder of the Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace shot dead outside his mansion in Miami; and the handover of Hong Kong to China. He has also reported on several Royal tours for BBC Television with Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh in Canada and Australia, with Prince Charles and Prince Harry in Africa, the royal wedding and honeymoon of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales and on their first-ever royal tour together in Australia and New Zealand. He was the Sky News commentator at RAF Northolt for the return of the princess after she was killed in Paris, and later for her funeral at Althorp. While at BBC TV News, Morris was the newsreader on the day Lord Mountbatten was murdered by the IRA. The audience that night of 26 million is still the record for a British TV news bulletin as ITN was on strike. It's a record unlikely ever to be surpassed with the proliferation of so many digital satellite channels. For almost two years in 1988 he returned abroad, this time as Australia correspondent for the BBC setting up the Corporation's first TV news studios in Sydney, as he had done previously 21 years before in Madrid. He was also appointed Australasia correspondent for The Times newspaper. He joined Sky News in 1989 for the channel launch, and for 11 years he was both Senior Foreign Correspondent and one of the main News Anchors presenting over 10,000 live bulletins. He returned as a newsreader with BBC News 24 before launching OmniVision, an independent TV production company based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. As a producer and director, commissions included a television series, Only Food and Forces filmed in Afghanistan, Oman, Norway, the Falkland Islands and the United Kingdom. He also produced and directed documentaries on one of Britain's most distinguished actors, Sir John Mills: A Century in Films, in his last interview just before he died and another, Kate Winslet: Starmaker to Superstar, about the career of the Oscar-winning actress from the Reading charity theatre group Starmaker to Hollywood fame. Morris is also the author of a best-selling book The Day They Lost The H Bomb about the 1966 US military disaster in Spain. In his last OmniVision documentary, The Curse of America's H Bombs, he re-visited Palomares to assess the continuing radioactive fall-out from the nuclear accident.

Entering the colonial office as a junior clerk in 1826, he served under several secretaries of state, and on 11 February 1837 he became registrar of British Honduras. Transferred on 18 February 1839 to be treasurer of Trinidad he was colonial secretary there from June 1839 to September 1840. In January 1841 he accompanied, as his secretary, Sir Henry Macleod, special commissioner to British Guiana, to settle difficulties with the legislature over the civil list.

The forum brings together policymakers, including Heads of State and Government, Ministers and other government officials responsible for investment; representatives from the private sector, including CEOs; international organisations working in the area of sustainable development and poverty reduction; thought leaders from academia and research institutions; and other members of the international investment community, including treaty negotiators, investment promotion and location experts, heads of sovereign wealth funds, heads of stock exchanges, and NGOs.  Background  International investors, including foreign direct investment (FDI) by large corporations, or TNCs, can provide a significant source of external finance for many developing countries. Such investment has the potential to contribute to capital accumulation in those countries and provide employment and other benefits, such as the provision of infrastructure and the transfer of technology and management know-how. However, such outcomes are not automatically guaranteed. Countries increasingly need to align their investment policies with policies in other areas, such as trade and industrial development, to both encourage foreign investors and to ensure that countries reap the development benefits of international investment. The World Investment Forum's mission is to provide a platform where a debate on \\"investment for development\\" can take place and ultimately to promote investment flows that contribute to sustainable and inclusive development. With its ties to UN member States, the forum is able to bring together a broad coalition of investment stakeholders at the highest level who can influence the global investment landscape. The WIF has been described by former US President Bill Clinton as \\"an essential platform for the international community to accelerate investment and encourage sustainable development in ‚Ä¶ the world's poorest countries\\".  History of the World Investment Forum  = The WIF 2008 = The inaugural World Investment Forum was held in Accra, Ghana, on the occasion of the twelfth UNCTAD Ministerial Conference in April 2008. It focused on the future of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows: where FDI will come from and which sectors and regions will be the main targets of these flows, as well as the features of corporate strategies that will drive cross-border investment. = The WIF 2010 = The second UNCTAD World Investment Forumhttp://unctad-worldinvestmentforum.org/page/wif2010 took place in Xiamen, China, in September 2010. The forum consolidated its main mission to promote investment for sustainable development and provide a platform that could bring together the international investment community at the highest level. The 2010 forum examined some of the development challenges and opportunities presented by the post-crisis investment landscape. It also provided inputs into the formulation of a new generation of national and international investment policies to foster sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. With more than 1,800 participants from 120 countries, including nine heads of State, 79 ministerial-level officials and 1,160 senior business executives, the second forum established the WIF as arguably the most influential platform for open, inclusive, and high-level international investment discourse. The WIF 2010 also established some of the forum's signature events, such as the International Investment Agreement (IIA) Conference, which focused on key systemic and developmental challenges facing the IIA regime and the investor- State dispute settlement system. Its emphasis on \\"investment underpinned by sustainable development\\" paved the way for the drafting of UNCTAD's Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development, which was launched during WIF 2012. Another development-centered conference was hosted on Sustainable Stock Exchanges, highlighting the environmental, social, and governance dimensions of listed companies and how stock exchanges can help foster responsible long- term approaches to investment. = The WIF 2012 = The third forum was held in Doha, Qatar,http://unctad-worldinvestmentforum.org/page/about_wif alongside the thirteenth UNCTAD Ministerial Conference, in April 2012. The event addressed the investment challenges and opportunities arising from emerging global economic governance structures and contributed to the development of policy options and partnerships for promoting sustainable investment to foster inclusive growth. Against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and crisis-related unrest, notably in the Arab region, the WIF 2012 explored how international investment could be made more inclusive and contribute to addressing some of the perceived causes of economic and social unrest, such as unemployment. Participants debated ways in which governments could attract international investors to support economic transformation and set countries on a path towards sustainable and inclusive development. More than 1,400 investment stakeholders from 145 countries participated in WIF 2012's fifteen main events, as well as its other networking meetings and side events. Among the countries represented, high-level policymakers from more than 30 least- developed countries (LDCs) took part in the forum, giving credence to the forum's aim of promoting pro-poor investment in these economies. The World Investment Leaders' Summit, one of the forum's key events, brought together eight Heads and former Heads of State and Government and six global CEOs, while the Ministerial Roundtable gathered together over 30 ministerial-level participants. Reflecting the increasing prominence of Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), the 2012 forum brought together SWF executives and government ministers for the first time at the WIF. The 2012 forum led to the high-level recognition and endorsement by ministers and Heads of State and government of investment for sustainable development as a principle for policymaking and investor decisions, and the launch of three of UNCTAD's investment-related policy tools: namely the Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development, the Entrepreneurship Policy Framework, and a new accounting development toolkit. In addition to its political focus on shaping investment policy and thinking, the forum also emphasizes its networking opportunities and achieving practical outcomes through the facilitation of investment deals. An example of this at the 2012 forum was the consultations between the government of Comoros and Nestl√©, which led to an undertaking by Nestl√© to explore investment opportunities on the island for the production of vanilla bourbon. The WIF also recognizes outstanding public and private achievements in the investment arena: The 2012 Investment Promotion Awards acknowledged investment promotion agencies' endeavours to leverage investment for job creation and skills development; and the EMPRETEC Women in Business Awards honoured women-owned businesses that have benefited from the business development services of the Empretec programme (an UNCTAD programme for the promotion of entrepreneurship that operates in 33 developing countries).

It represented the first time plague had emerged in Southern California; plague outbreaks had previously arisen in San Francisco and Oakland. The Los Angeles outbreak began on October 30, lasted two weeks, and killed 30 people. Public health officials credited the lessons learned from the San Francisco outbreak coupled with swiftly implemented measures, including hospitalization of the sick and all their contacts, a neighborhood quarantine, and a large-scale rat eradication program, with saving lives.A.J. Viseltear. The Pneumonic Plague Epidemic of 1924 in Los Angeles. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1974 March; 47 (1): 40-54.Jacob L. Kool. Risk of Person to Person Transmission of Pneumonic Plague. Clin. Infect. Dis. (2005) 40 (8): 1166-1172.Martin Helen Eastman, The History of Los Angeles County Hospital, 1878‚Äì1968; and the Los Angeles County University of Southern California Medical Center 1969‚Äì1978. (Los Angeles: University of Southern California Press, 1979) 5‚Äì7.  Epidemiology  Traceback analysis to identify the index-patient revealed that the outbreak actually began sometime in late September or early October, 1924 in the Macy Street District. This area was one of the only districts, or ghettos, as the people of Los Angeles referred them, where Hispanics lived near downtown Los Angeles, segregated from the white communities. Furthermore, the 3000 residents of Macy Street were surrounded by the Los Angeles River where there was human waste and carcasses of animals, and factories that produced oil, lumber, bricks, and packed meat. In the Macy Street district a 51-year-old man named Jes√∫s Lujan fell ill with a fever and a painful lump in his groin. Prior to symptoms, Lujan had discovered a decaying rat under his house and picked it up and threw it in the trash. Within that same week, Lujan's fifteen-year-old daughter, Francisca (Concha), also fell ill. She complained of fever and respiratory distress. A physician called to the house misdiagnosed the daughter with 'lobar pneumonia' which found out to be secondary plague pneumonia. The physician also misdiagnosed Lujan's bubonic plague as a venereal disease due to his enlarged lymph node. Even after the City health officers' confirmation of the disease as pneumonic plague, the disease was referred as \\"strange malady,\\" \\"pneumonia,\\" \\"virulent pneumonia,\\" or \\"malignant pneumonia\\" until November 6.Cecilia Rasmussen \\"Los Angeles Then and Now,\\" March 5, 2006, The Los Angeles Times. Investigators believed that Jes√∫s Lujan initially contracted the bubonic form of plague. Left untreated, bubonic plague can move to the lungs and cause a secondary pneumonic infection.Jacob L. Kool. Risk of Person-to- Person Transmission of Pneumonic Plague. Clin Infect Dis. (2005) 40 (8): 1166-1172. As Lujan's end-stage symptoms included bloody sputum, it's believed his had converted to the pneumonic form. And because he fell ill before any of the others, Jes√∫s Lujan was identified as the index-patient. A week later, Francisca Lujan died. A young pregnant neighbor, Lucena Samarano, who had been caring for Francesca also developed the same respiratory symptoms and died days later. A Catholic priest, Father M. Brualla, who had administered last rites to the victims and said the requiem Mass for Samarano, as well as a dozen or so of the congregants at her funeral, developed the same respiratory symptoms and died days later. Within a week, Lucena Samarano's entire family of eight had died. The plague serum arrived in Los Angeles on November 5, which had been requested by the Los Angeles County General Hospital and the acting health officer of the City Health Department, but it was only secured in time to be used in one case. On October 30, 1924, the Los Angeles County Hospital pathologist, Dr. George Maner, identified plague as the cause of the illness. Dr. Maner identified it from a serum sample from a patient who had died after attending Lucena Samarano's funeral. He notified the City Health Department as well as state officials. City health officials quarantined an eight-block area Clara Street where the funeral had taken place as well as a six-block area in the Belvedere district after Jes√∫s Lujan was identified as the index-patient. Within the quarantined area, the health department set up a temporary laboratory to quickly identify new cases. At the same time, the city began a citywide rat and ground squirrel extermination program. Infected rats were found in downtown, Beverly Hills, and the harbor. Transmission Pneumonic plague is the only form of plague capable of person-to-person transmission, which occurs during droplet-respiration (breathing). Between 1900 and 2009, there were 1001 reported cases of pneumonic plague. Of these cases, 81% occurred before antibiotics were widely available (1900-1943). In that time period, 92% of cases were fatal. Many researchers and experts have stated that the Pneumonic Plague is not as transmissible person-to-person as has been believed. Based on data found, only 11% of patients that contracted the disease actually spread it to another person. After the 1924 Los Angeles outbreak, there have been no secondary transmissions (transmission of the disease from a secondary case). Humans can also become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal. In this case of spread, the pathogen was suspected to have come from the decaying rat found under the index patient's house. Transmission from an animal to human is the direct result of an epizootic, a flare-up of disease that spreads rapidly throughout animals. Epizootics are common in rodents that reside in big cities/urban areas of a large, but diverse specimen population.

A member of the Presbyterian Church, it is known for its Day School and music programs. It was founded as an offshoot of First Presbyterian Church. Its first building, in lower Manhattan, opened in 1768. The Park Avenue location opened April 14, 1940. History The first church building was constructed on the corner of Beekman and Nassau Streets. It opened doors on New Year's Day in 1768. During the American Revolutionary War, the British used the church to house prisoners of war. When the congregation moved uptown, the New-York Daily Times used the site for its new headquarters, a dedicated five-story building. In 1858, the congregation moved to a new building on Murray Hill at 37th Street and Fifth Avenue since its congregation had moved farther uptown. The dedication was on October 31. On April 23, 1910, Mark Twain's funeral was held at the church and the Rev. Henry van Dyke Jr. officiated. By the late 1930s, the congregation had decided to move yet farther north. The building at Fifth and 37th was sold and demolished in 1938. The church merged with Park Avenue Presbyterian Church in 1937 and the joint congregation built the 91st St. location. The church also acquired a residence on East 92nd St. to turn it into a Parish House. The cornerstone to the current building was laid on November 25, 1938, in the presence of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. The congregation first worshipped on 91st Street on April 14, 1940. The New York Times described the building as \\"a model of a colonial house of worship, is red brick with white trimmings and huge circular white pillars at the front.\\" Following the end of WWII, Mrs. Stephen C. Clark and some of her friends who had also lost sons and daughters in that war installed lighted trees along Park Avenue as a memorial not only to their children but to those from throughout the city who had given their lives. These trees were first lighted on Dec. 17, 1945, and dedicated to the memory of those who had died in all of our country's wars. Subsequently, they became known as the Park Avenue Memorial Trees. Every year since a ceremony involving caroling and the tree lighting takes place on the first Sunday in December on the Park Avenue steps of Brick Church.https://patch.com/new- york/upper-east-side-nyc/annual-park-avenue-tree-lighting-takes-place- tonight-6-30pmhttps://www.tripsavvy.com/the-best-christmas-trees-in- nyc-1612954 Brick Church School The Brick Church School has early childhood programs. It was founded in 1940 and has been led by Dr. Lydia Spinelli since 1983. In 2019, Dr. Spinelli retired, and Amy Warden became the new Director of the school. The Brick Church School‚Äôs mission is to provide an excellent early childhood education, nourishing children‚Äôs emotional, social, intellectual, physical, ethical, and spiritual well-being through an intentionally balanced approach in an atmosphere of warmth and mutual respect. Members of the church are given preference inthe competitive application process. Music Keith S. T√≥th has been the Minister of Music and Organist at The Brick Church since September 1993. He leads the church's acclaimed professional choir. The sanctuary has a French Symphonic style organ with 6,288 pipes built by Casavant Fr√®res of Quebec. It debuted in the fall of 2005 and was designed in the style of Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll, a 19th-century organ maker. Jean-Louis Coignet was a consultant in the project. Coignet had been a Parisian government employee who was in charge of the city‚Äôs organs. There is a two manual, 26 rank mechanical action by Guilbault-Th√©rien in the Chapel of the Reformed Faith.

TBDA was formed in the spring of 2012 by Staci Grodin, the co-founder of the Turn the Corner Foundation, and David Roth, the co-founder of the Tick-Borne Disease Initiative. Roth has stated that he knew very little about Lyme disease or any other tick-borne diseases until he was diagnosed with Lyme himself, motivating him to raise awareness and increase funding for diagnostic testing.  Bite Back for a Cure  In 2013, TBDA launched the Bite Back for a Cure campaign, a national grassroots campaign to build support for the fight against tick-borne diseases through raising awareness and through supporting tick-borne disease research. Candice Accola, star of The Vampire Diaries, is a spokesperson.  Fundraising  TBDA held its first annual gala on May 16, 2012, at Chelsea Piers in New York City. The benefit helped support TBDA's public awareness and advocacy campaign, and helped raise money for research to find an accurate diagnostic tool. On May 2, 2013, TBDA held the Tick-Borne Disease Alliance 2nd Annual Benefit, also at Chelsea Piers. Candice Accola was the host.  Advocacy  On March 11, 2013, TBDA hosted a forum with U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Congressman Chris Gibson (R-NY) at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City to discuss the fight against the silent epidemic of tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. Gillibrand, Blumenthal, Weill Cornell Medical College's dean Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher and co-chairman of TBDA David Roth were distinguished speakers at the forum.  Merger  In February 2014, TBDA merged with the Stamford-based Lyme Research Alliance to form a new charity, the Global Lyme Alliance.

After graduation, he went on to attend the University of Miami, where he graduated with a major in physics and a minor in mathematics. He then earned a master's degree in computer science, also from the University of Miami, and wrote his thesis on Automated reasoning. He is a mountain climber who has made three attempts to climb Mount Everest, and has scaled Alaska's Mount McKinley along with other mountains around the world.  Mental athletics  Dellis was originally inspired to improve his memory after seeing the decline of his grandmother's memory due to Alzheimer's disease, and entered his first memory competition in 2009.

In the show, geneticist Preston Estep says it is important to obtain genomic information from extraordinary people. Dr. Estep tests Nelson's recall abilities using playing cards and DNA, and then the two tour a genetics lab and observe large DNA sequencing machines as they discuss sequencing Nelson's genome.

The beta version was launched by China‚Äôs State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping (SBSM) on October 21, 2010. State media suggests that about 30 million netizens from over 210 countries and regions visited Tianditu after the beta version came online. After beta testing, Tianditu was officially launched on January 18, 2011. In June 2011, a trial version for mobile phones came online. And in October 2011, the mobile phone version was officially launched.  Licensing  Five months before Tianditu was officially launched in October 2010, the SBSM issued a regulation demanding that all companies wishing to provide online map services in China apply for a license. In order to obtain the license, companies have to agree to maintain their mapping servers in China. This created an unfavorable situation for Google, as the company aspires to greater control over its own data and servers. In March 2010, after the company‚Äôs mainland servers suffered major attacks in 2009 (presumably from the Chinese government), Google re-directed its search engine from Mainland China to Hong Kong. As Tianditu seeks to offer functions similar to those Google mapping service provides, one can see the creation of Tianditu as part of Beijing‚Äôs strategy to squeeze Google out of the China market, eventually making Tianditu the main source of geographic information for Chinese users. This can be seen in various government publications that tout Tianditu as the ‚Äòauthoritative‚Äô source for online geographic information. For example, SBSM Director General Xu Deming expressed that the ultimate aim is to create ‚Äòone web, one map, and one platform‚Äô, offering the most authoritative and comprehensive web mapping services to Chinese citizens. Xu Deming also emphasized that Tianditu would be a ‚Äòreliable and excellent national brand‚Äô in the field of online mapping services.Ma, H.-Y (2011) ‚ÄòObserving Digital China from Tianditu: An Interview with SBSM Director General Xi Deming‚Äô, China‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress Publication 46-47.  Criticisms  Technologically speaking, many users have questioned whether the Chinese mapping service is just a replica of Google Maps and Google Earth. Netizens based in China and elsewhere have posted images extracted from Tianditu and Google to make a comparison and found images from both sources to be identical, except that those from Tianditu are in Chinese. There are also complaints about the quality of the service because the data is only updated about twice a year, while Google can update its information more frequently, as often as every few minutes if it wishes. Given that the service is new, it is expected that more will be done to improve its quality in the coming years.  Disputed areas  China is shown to assert its political claims over a number of controversial geographic locations on Tianditu. Other Chinese mapping services, such as Amap and Baidu Maps, have similar modifications made to them. For example, Taiwan is labeled as a province of China on Tianditu. The Spratly Islands in the South China Sea are also included in the Chinese territory, although countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines also claim these islands. The nine-dash line is drawn around them. Arunachal Pradesh is also labeled as a part of Tibet belonging to China, while the Indian government believes it is part of India. In addition to above, the maps also show the partially recognized states of Kosovo under Serbia (see China-Serbia relations) and Russian-occupied territories of Georgia.

Background  After the huge success of the band's first two albums (Poogy Tales and Poogy in a Pita), they decided to change musical direction. The first two albums were written by Danny Sanderson, while all the band members participated in writing this album. Each song was played through and the band decided whether to include it in the album. The band worked for six months on the album while living in a kibbutz. The band members pursued different musical directions and contributed new influences to the band's sound. Yoni Rechter turned to progressive rock and was a member of the progressive rock duo 14 Octaves (along with Avner Kener) at the time. Efrahim Shamir and Alon Olearthick turned to jazz. The result was the band's most diversified album, but this cost the band many fans and finally led to the band's break-up in 1976.  Songs  Only two songs were written by Sanderson ‚Äì \\"HaYsh Hakhi Mahir\\" (The Fastest Man) and \\"Inspector Piqeakh\\" (Smart Inspector) that reprised the band's original sound, characterized by melodic rock and nonsense. The humor was still present in songs such as \\"Goliat\\" (Goliath) a parody about the biblical story, \\"Lu Lu\\" and \\"Tango Tzfardeim\\" (Frogs Tango) and more. The song \\"HaOlam Sameakh\\" (The World is Happy) was composed in the samba, a musical style that was popular in Israel at the time. The song was played after a skit in the band's shows. The song \\"Shi'ur Moledet\\" (Country Lesson) was originally composed by Shamir in Polish, and the lyricist Eli Mohar wrote Hebrew lyrics for the album. This song, along with other quiet songs in the album such as \\"Hi Kol Kakh Yafa\\" (She's So Beautiful), didn't initially become a success with the fans who expected humor, but as the time passed the songs became one a favorite. The album's back cover was painted by Yossi Abulafia using images inspired by the album's songs in the style of Terry Gilliam's artworks for Monty Python.  Reception  The third album sold 30,500 copies, fewer than the first two. The band's live shows also met with less success. Nonetheless, the band was the most successful band in Israel, winning \\"Band of the Year\\" for the third time in the Army Radio and the \\"Song of the Year\\" with \\"Goliat.\\"  Track listing  # Goliat ‚Äì Goliath (◊í◊ï◊ú◊ô◊ô◊™) ‚Äì 3:24 # Shir Malakhim ‚Äì Sailors Song (◊©◊ô◊® ◊û◊ú◊ó◊ô◊ù) ‚Äì 3:22 # Medina Qt'ana ‚Äì Small State (◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊î ◊ß◊ò◊†◊î) ‚Äì 3:08 # Tango Tzfardeim ‚Äì Frogs Tango (◊ò◊†◊í◊ï ◊¶◊§◊®◊ì◊¢◊ô◊ù) ‚Äì 3:50 # Inspector Piqeakh ‚Äì Smart Inspector (◊ê◊ô◊†◊°◊§◊ß◊ò◊ï◊® ◊§◊ô◊ß◊ó) ‚Äì 2:11 # Shi'ur Moledet ‚Äì Country Lesson (◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊® ◊û◊ï◊ú◊ì◊™) ‚Äì 3:09 # HaOlam Sameakh ‚Äì The World is Happy (◊î◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊©◊û◊ó) ‚Äì 3:32 # HaYsh Hakkhi Mahir ‚Äì The Fastest Man (◊î◊ê◊ô◊© ◊î◊õ◊ô ◊û◊î◊ô◊®) ‚Äì 3:21 # Shir HaT'embel ‚Äì The Idiot Song (◊©◊ô◊® ◊î◊ò◊û◊ë◊ú) ‚Äì 2:31) # Lekh Saper LeSavta ‚Äì Go Tell to Grandma (◊ú◊ö ◊°◊§◊® ◊ú◊°◊ë◊™◊ê) ‚Äì 3:11 # Hi Kol Kakh Yafa ‚Äì She's So Beautiful (◊î◊ô◊ê ◊õ◊ú ◊õ◊ö ◊ô◊§◊î) ‚Äì 3:14 # Lu Lu (◊ú◊ï ◊ú◊ï) ‚Äì 3:30 # Sof HaHatzaga HaLaila ‚Äì End of the Show Tonight (◊°◊ï◊£ ◊î◊î◊¶◊í◊î ◊î◊ú◊ô◊ú◊î) ‚Äì 0:48 # Kakha Hi Baemtza ‚Äì That's How She's in the Middle (◊õ◊õ◊î ◊î◊ô◊ê ◊ë◊ê◊û◊¶◊¢) ‚Äì 4:47 =Bonus tracks in the CD edition= # \\"Tzafuf BaOzen ‚Äì Haqdama Tizmortit\\" ‚Äì Crowded in the Ear ‚Äì Orchestal Prologue (◊¶◊§◊ï◊£ ◊ë◊ê◊ï◊ñ◊ü ‚Äì ◊î◊ß◊ì◊û◊î ◊™◊ñ◊û◊ï◊®◊™◊ô◊™) ‚Äì 5:27 # \\"Apchi\\" (◊ê◊§◊¶'◊ô) ‚Äì 0:16 (a parody about Neomi Shemer's translation to The Beatles' Let It Be) # \\"Ma Ata Ro'e\\" ‚Äì What Do You See (◊û◊î ◊ê◊™◊î ◊®◊ï◊ê◊î) ‚Äì 0:42 (a parody on the song \\"MiDarom Tipatah T'ova\\" ‚Äì \\"From the South Good will Come\\" by the Piqud HaDarom Band # \\"Tarzan (Yltur Khai)\\" ‚Äì Tarzan (Live Improvisation) (◊ò◊®◊ñ◊ü ‚Äì ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊™◊ï◊® ◊ó◊ô) ‚Äì 1:51 # \\"Mekhaqim LeShula\\" ‚Äì Waiting for Shula (◊û◊ó◊õ◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊©◊ï◊ú◊î) ‚Äì 2:50 Personnel *Danny Sanderson ‚Äì vocals, guitars, music, lyrics *Gidi Gov ‚Äì lead vocals, tambourine *Efraim Shamir ‚Äì lead vocals, guitars, 12-string guitar, harmonica, bass guitar on track 5Kaveret Returns Eran Russek, 14 June 2013, Ha-dibuk.blogspot.co.il *Alon Oleartchik ‚Äì vocals, bass guitar, music, lyrics (except 5) *Yitzhak \\"Churchill\\" Klepter ‚Äì vocals, electric guitar *Yoni Rechter ‚Äì vocals, piano, Fender Rhodes *Meir \\"Poogy\\" Fenigstein ‚Äì drums, percussion, spoken word and vocals as \\"Poogy\\"  References  Category:1975 albums Category:Kaveret albums ","title":"Crowded in the Ear"},{"id":"40111604","text":"South Union is an unincorporated community located in Logan County, Kentucky, United States.

During this period, the Shakers constructed 200 buildings, worked 6,000 acres (2,400 ha) of farmland, and produced garden seed, fruit preserves, brooms, baskets, rugs, linen, hats, bonnets and silk both for use within the community and sales to the outside world. After the Civil War, they hired about a dozen freedmen to work in their woolen and flour mills, allowing them to build cabins here. Other whites in Logan County were attacking blacks and trying to expel them from the county. In late August 1868, a mob of whites burned some of the freedmen's cabins. After the Shakers offered a reward to capture the men, whites returned and burned the Shakers' mills. These were uninsured, and their losses were close to $70,000.

It was opened on 24 January 1876 by the Bergisch- M√§rkische Railway Company (Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME) along the Ruhr to the southwest of the city of M√ºlheim an der Ruhr and connects M√ºlheim-Styrum on the Witten/Dortmund‚ÄìOberhausen/Duisburg railway and Essen-Kettwig on the Ruhr Valley Railway. Passenger services The first passenger services in 1876 ran from Kettwig over the Kettwig railway bridge and the Ruhr bridge in M√ºlheim to the M√ºlheim station of the BME, which was later renamed as M√ºlheim (Ruhr) and is now M√ºlheim (Ruhr) West. The passenger service was moved in 1909 to Styrum because the connecting curve to M√ºlheim BME was upgraded for the expansion of Friedrich Wilhelms-H√ºtte steel works and M√ºlheim (Ruhr) West station was in the way. At the end of World War II, the two Ruhr bridges were destroyed. Consequently, passenger services from M√ºlheim had to stop short of the Ruhr bridge at Kettwig and later a station was built there called Kettwig Stausee (\\"Kettwig reservoir\\", below the current S-Bahn station of the same name) as a terminus. In M√ºlheim, the passenger service was diverted over the Broich connecting curve to Speldorf. After the re- establishment of the M√ºlheim bridge in 1954 both of the north-west end points (Styrum and Speldorf) were served until the abandonment of passenger services in 1968.

It was founded in 1850 in the English mill town of Droylsden, Lancashire (now part of Greater Manchester). History John Rylands Library archives show that the roots of the Christy company date from at least 1833, when the Stockport firm of W. M. Christy & Sons Ltd ‚Äì established by banker and hatter William Miller Christy ‚Äì was manufacturing cotton goods. Christy's son, the noted collector and ethnologist Henry Christy, discovered the product that would make the company famous. While travelling in Istanbul, he saw an example of the looped pile fabric that is known today as terry towelling, but which was initially known as the 'Turkish towel'. The company found a method of weaving the looped pile fabric on an industrial scale using a machine designed by one of their employees Samuel Holt,Samuel Holt, ( 7 Feb 1811- 16 Sept 1887), Terry (Turkish) Towel Manufacturer. who patented the design. The first Christy towels factory opened in Droylsden in 1850. A year later, Christy towels were displayed at The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace, Queen Victoria became an early client. By 1891, the company's Fairfields Mill in Droylsden had 310 looms and 30,000 spindles, according to Worrall's Cotton Spinners Directory. Christy was purchased by Fine Spinners and Doublers in 1955, and became part of the Courtaulds group eight years later. The company relocated from its Droylsden base to Hyde, Greater Manchester in the late 1980s. When Courtaulds spun off its textile businesses in 2000, Christy was sold to a management buyout team. The company today Christy became a subsidiary of Welspun India Ltd in 2006, shifting towel manufacturing from its base in Hyde, Greater Manchester to Gujarat in 2010. The company's UK headquarters was relocated to Cheadle in 2012. In addition to retailing towels, bathrobes and bedlinen in stores throughout the UK, the company sells online and in Europe, the U.S. and Australia. Notably, it supplies towels to Bloomingdale's. Christy also produces for other brands, including Harlequin and Agent Provocateur. The company has a long-term relationship with tennis, producing the towels used by players at Wimbledon since 1987. In 2012, the company produced over 99,000 Wimbledon towels, which are also sold to tournament attendees. The Times reported in 2013 that only a third of the towels Christy supplies to the Championship are returned, due to the players keeping them or throwing them into the crowd as mementos.

Arab Movement for Renewal, ) is an Israeli Arab political party in Israel led by Ahmad Tibi. The party was part of the Joint List in the 2015 election, before it withdrew in January 2019, though it decided to rejoin the alliance for the September 2019 election. History Ta'al was founded by Tibi in the mid 1990s. It ran in the 1996 elections under the name Arab Union, but won only 2,087 votes (0.1%). For the 1999 elections it ran as part of the Balad list. Tibi won a seat, and broke away from Balad on 21 December that year. In the 2003 elections the party ran on a joint list with Hadash, with Tibi retaining his seat. On 7 February 2006 Tibi left the alliance with Hadash. For the 2006 elections the party ran on a joint list with the United Arab List, running as Ra'am‚ÄìTa'al (Ra'am is the Hebrew acronym for the UAL). On 12 January 2009, the Ra'am‚ÄìTa'al list was disqualified from the 2009 elections by the Central Elections Committee. Twenty-one committee members voted in favor of its disqualification, with eight members voting against and two members abstaining. Tibi said the decision was related to Operation Cast Lead, claiming \\"this is a racist country. We are accustomed to these types of struggles and we will win\\" and that \\"this decision strives for a Knesset without Arabs that will only lead to the increased solidarity between the Arab public and its leadership\\". He said he would appeal to the Israeli High Court of Justice. On 21 January the High Court of Justice overturned the Committee's decision unanimously. Tibi welcomed the decision and said: \\"We have beaten fascism. This fight is over but the battle is not. Racism has become a trend in Israel ... the court's decision has righted a wrong by Kadima and Labor\\". The list won four seats, with Tibi retaining his place in the Knesset.

He was a member of the central committee of Maki (the Israeli Communist Party and the largest faction within Hadash), an activist for socio-economic equality and an environmentalist. Political career Since 1990, Khenin has been a leading member of the Israeli Communist Party. During the elections for the 16th Knesset, he held the number four spot on the Hadash-Taal list. At the time, the party was only about 500 votes short in order for Khenin to be able to enter the Knesset. On January 14, 2006, Khenin placed third on the Hadash list, and was subsequently elected to the 17th Knesset. Khenin was a member of the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee, and he also headed the Knesset‚Äôs joint committee on Environment and Health. Additionally, he served as chairman, alongside Knesset member Rabbi Michael Melchior, of the social- environmental lobby, the largest lobby in the 17th Knesset. In the 18th Knesset, Khenin headed the social-environmental lobby together with MK Nitzan Horowitz. = General positions = One of Khenin's main focuses is the rights of workers, saying in April 2014 that, \\"the problem of low wages is the most critical of all. Not the price of cottage cheese and not even apartment prices\\". In 2014, he initiated legislation to increase the minimum wage from 23 NIS to 30 NIS. This legislation received widespread, cross-party support, with backing from 61 of the 120 members of the 19th Knesset. In December 2014, the minimum wage for workers was raised to 27 NIS through a contract agreement between the Histadrut labor union and the Manufacturers Association of Israel. Dov welcomed the progress, but vowed to keep pushing towards his original goal of a 30 NIS minimum wage. Khenin also works to keep the influence of money out of politics, supporting the campaign against the privatization of Israel's natural gas resources. In 2015, Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet voted to allow the development of natural gas harvesting off the coast of the Mediterranean sea. Khenin and other critics noted how this would give too much power to the American Nobel Energy group, as well as pose a conflict of interests to Netanyahu. In an effort to make the voting process more fair, Khenin along with MK Zehava Galon asked Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein to exclude the Prime Minister from voting on the issue. Dov also participated in the large protests in response to the deal. At a protest in Haifa, Khenin said, \\"this struggle is not only an economic struggle or a social struggle. It is also a struggle for democracy. There is no democracy where capital rules.‚Äù In addition to this, Khenin is also a supporter of broader ecological legislation. In 2012, Dov proposed setting up an \\"environmental court\\" for the country. He envisioned a court that would watch over the country's natural resources, as well as safeguard wildlife and ecosystems. Recognizing the municipality's lack of authority over traffic regulations, Khenin acted in 2008 to pass legislation that would have communities create their own policies. This legislation, aimed at allowing a more direct and local solution to automotive pollution problems, allows for effective public transportation changes to be implemented on the smaller scale. Khenin also battled against industrial pollution in Haifa. In 2014, Khenin headed a subcommittee calling for stricter environmental standards to be imposed on Haifa's oil refineries located along its port. The panel showed a possible link between pollution from the refineries to increased risk of cancer among residents in the area. In regards to past conflicts with Gaza, Khenin is clear that the fault is on Israel. During Operation Protective Edge, Khenin showed vehement opposition to the war, placing complete blame on Prime Minister Netanyahu. During the summer of 2014 Khenin spoke out against the operation both in the political and social sphere. At a protest in Tel Aviv, Khenin asked a crowd of 7,000, \\"we must answer truthfully: Has a drop of all this bloodshed really helped bring us to a better place?‚Äù = Mayoral campaign = In 2008, Khenin was the mayoral candidate for the Ir Lekhulanu (\\"City for All\\") party. The party was supported by the Jaffa Jewish-Arab list Yafa (whose partners are Balad and Hadash) and endorsed by the Green MovementThe endorsement is in: Dov Khenin and ‚ÄúCity for All‚Äù for the Tel Aviv Municipal Elections in Tel Aviv's 2008 municipal election. Khenin's platform was largely focused on improving civil infrastructure. Public transportation, housing, as well as education equality and ecology were focuses of his campaign. Khenin also ran on a concept of promoting communities within Tel Aviv, saying in an interview, \\"the most important thing in the city is not the streets and the buildings, but the people and the communities.\\" Khenin lost the election with 34.3% of the vote to incumbent mayor Ron Huldai, who got 50.6% of the vote. Khenin vowed to continue battling Huldai's policies from the Knesset and Tel Aviv's opposition. = Legislation = Khenin's legislation focuses mainly on issues pertaining to human rights, ecology, and social change. He has often been outright in his disagreement with the Israeli government's policies, speaking out against environmental, military and humanitarian issues.  Human and social rights  * Law for Adequate Prison Conditions ‚Äì Bill to ensure adequate prison conditions that protect the health and dignity of prisoners, including medical treatment, proper care, a bed, mattress and blankets, a cabinet, suitable and healthy food, ventilation and light in the cell and daily walks in the open air. The law applies to all prisoners without distinction, including security prisoners. * Transparency of Decisions of the Israel Lands Authority ‚Äì Requires the Israel Lands Authority (ILA), which controls more than 90% of state-owned lands, to publish all its decisions immediately on the Internet, in order to prevent the possibility of corruption, discrimination, nepotism and the favoring of financial interests. Prior to the enactment of the law, only 51 out of 1800 administrative decisions of the ILA were published. * Prohibition of Entrance Fees to Public Parks ‚Äì An amendment to the Municipalities Ordinance that prohibits local authorities to collect entrance fees to public parks. Together with MK Moshe Gafni and MK David Azoulay. * Prohibition of Attachments on Mobility Grants for the Blind ‚Äì Mobility grants, which enable blind people to pay for assistance for basic mobility needs (e.g. shopping at the supermarket) and to integrate in society, will henceforth be protected from all types of attachments. Since a significant proportion of the blind in Israel live below the poverty line, many suffer from attachments on their accounts due to debts. Together with MK Meir Shetreet. * Law for the Rights of Victims of Crime ‚Äì Grants status to victims of hit-and-run crimes during the process of plea bargaining with the offender. Together with MK Zeev Bielski. * Prevention of a Criminal Record for Military Offenses ‚Äì such as the refusal of an order or absence without leave. In December 2010 this bill passed the preliminary reading together with a similar bill by MK Miri Regev and was sent to the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. * Relaxation of Mandatory Helmet Requirement for Cyclists ‚Äì This law significantly narrows the law enacted by the 17th Knesset, which made cycling without a helmet a criminal offense. Under the new law, only those engaging in interurban and extreme sports cycling as well as children and juveniles are required to wear helmets. Together with MK Shelly Yachimovich. * Law of Entry to Israel (Extension of Work Permit for a Foreign Caregiver) ‚Äì Enables a foreign caregiver, under certain circumstances, to remain in Israel beyond the expiration date of their work permit. Together with MK David Azoulay. * Amendment to the Traffic Ordinance (Duty to Provide Information on the Pledge of a Vehicle) ‚Äì Provides that when transferring ownership of a vehicle, an automatic check will be made for information regarding the existence of a pledge on the vehicle. Together with MK Gideon Ezra. * Municipal Tax Exemption for Institutions for the Rehabilitation, Training, or Employment of Handicapped Persons ‚Äì Together with the members of the Hadash faction.  Workers' rights  * Employees Notification Law ‚Äì An amendment ensuring that employees of manpower contractors receive information about the terms of the contract under which they are employed. This law is intended to correct a situation where the employee is not informed of the terms that were agreed upon between the contractor and the actual employer, and to ensure that the employee is informed at the start of their employment of the employment terms to which the contractor is obligated towards the actual employer. The law requires that the employee be provided with the information needed to realize the rights. Together with MK Haim Oron. * Law for Amendment of the Mandatory Tenders Law (Prohibition of Discrimination Due to Age) ‚Äì The law is intended to prevent discrimination against a person in a tender process due to their age. This generally refers to discrimination against the older population segment, which due to its relatively advanced age is at risk of prejudiced and discriminatory treatment compared to younger contenders for the tender. Together with MK Zeev Bielski. * Prevention of Cyclic Dismissals ‚Äì Prevents the engagement of employees under a contract for a fixed period, at the end of which they are dismissed and then rehired, in a cyclic manner, enabling employers to avoid their obligation to secure the social benefits of their employees, including severance pay. Together with MK Shlomo Molla and MK Shelly Yachimovich. * Prohibition on Taking Securities from Employees ‚Äì Under the law, employers who take securities ‚Äì checks, notes or deposits from their employees are liable to be punished with imprisonment or a fine. The law also applies to employees of contractors. Together with MK Shelly Yachimovich. * Inclusion of Prohibition on Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation, Parenthood or Pregnancy by the Employment Service ‚Äì The law expands the scope of the prohibitions on discrimination by the Employment Service. Together with the Women's Lobby, MK Nachman Shai and MK Afou Agbaria. * Grant of Authority to the Labor Court to Extend Filing Deadlines ‚Äì The purpose of the law is to allow the Labor Court to extend the deadlines for submitting to the court claims against the National Insurance Institute and appeals against its decisions. Until now, the law did not allow the court the possibility to extend these deadlines, even on justified grounds. * Labor Laws Enforcement Law ‚Äì A private member's bill adopted by the government and passed as a government bill. The law contains effective protection mechanisms for employees of contractors, albeit thus far only in the cleaning, guarding and catering sectors. This is a further development of the Responsibility of a Purchaser of Services for the Rights of the Service Contractor's Employees, which imposes responsibility for protecting the rights of a contractor's employees not only on the contractor who is their employer but also on the institution that purchased the services. The law was prepared for the second and third reading towards the end of the term of the 17th Knesset and gave birth to the government bill.  Women's rights  * Extension of Maternity Leave to 14 Weeks ‚Äì MK Khenin was the first to initiate the law, which extended maternity leave to 14 weeks. * Income Support Benefits for Battered Women in Shelters\\" ‚Äì Battered women's shelters cannot serve the State as an alibi for divesting itself of responsibility. Women in these shelters need income support more than anyone, as they have no other source of income and arrive at the shelter penniless. Together with MK Zehava Galon. * Prohibition on Advertising Prostitution Services ‚Äì The law takes aim at the economic foundations of the prostitution industry. Together with MK Orit Zuaretz. * Guarantee of Alimony Payments to Women Traveling Abroad ‚Äì The new law forbids withholding alimony payments from the National Insurance Institute to a woman who travels abroad. Together with MK Faina Kirshenbaum.  Children's protection  * Amendment to the Juvenile Law (Trial, Punishment and Treatment) (Alternative Processes) ‚Äì Instead of sending juvenile delinquents to jail, where they will receive training as future criminals, the law provides for alternative processes in which the youth assume responsibility for their actions and engage in remedial activity within various frameworks. Experience around the world shows that this approach is more just and also more effective. Together with MK Zevulun Orlev. * Law for the Provision of Information to Parents ‚Äì Establishes the right of both separated parents of a child to receive information about the child. Together with MK Yariv Levin. * Law to Extend the Activity of the Fund for At-Risk Children and Youth ‚Äì The Fund for At-Risk Children and Youth was originally established as a means of dealing with the spread of poverty, economic hardship and social problems among children and youth following the slashing of child allowances. Over the years, the fund has developed a range of activities for aiding children and youth at risk, and its activity has garnered widespread praise. The fund was initially established under a temporary order that was due to expire at the end of 2007. The law extended the fund's activity for an additional year. * Law to Prohibit the Sale of Lottery Tickets to Minors ‚Äì The law prohibits the sale of lottery tickets to anyone under the age of 18, in order to protect minors from developing a gambling addiction and wasting large sums of money. Together with MK Ahmed Tibi. * Prohibition on Cigarette Vending Machines ‚Äì The law is intended to reduce the accessibility to youth of cigarettes and smoking products. Together with MK Uri Ariel.  Environmental protection and health  * The Polluter Pays Law ‚Äì A general law that updates and amends all the environmental laws in Israel. The law contains advanced mechanisms for the economic punishment of polluters, including both administrative and criminal penalties. It increases the punishment meted out to bodies that pollute without a pollution permit and also establishes a collection mechanism for bodies that pollute within the framework of the law. This mechanism is intended to encourage factories to switch to cleaner technologies. * Clean Air Law ‚Äì The law was approved in the first reading by the 16th Knesset, and was reformulated in the 17th Knesset with MK Khenin's active involvement. This is a comprehensive law that fully regulates, for the first time in Israel, the issue of the discharge of pollutants into the air, tightening the ring around polluting industries. * Environmental Enforcement Law ‚Äì Confers broad search and investigation powers on inspectors of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and for the first time subjects the different security bodies to civil enforcement. * Environmental Enforcement Law ‚Äì Powers of Local Authority Inspectors ‚Äì Empowers local authorities to enforce environmental laws, thereby simultaneously achieving two important goals ‚Äì the one, environmental (increasing enforcement of environmental laws), and the other, social (injecting fine moneys collected from environmental polluters directly into the coffers of the local authorities whose residents are the main victims of pollution). * Law to Reduce Air Pollution from Transportation (Amendment 84 to the Traffic Ordinance) ‚Äì The law creates a clear division of power between the government and the local authorities, putting an end to an impossible situation in which either side could paralyze initiatives of the other. The amendment obligates local authorities to act to reduce air pollution caused by transportation in every case where there is a high level of air pollution. * Environmental Transparency Law ‚Äì Duty to Report the Discharge of Pollutants ‚Äì The law establishes a requirement of transparency over the discharge of pollutants into the environment, imposes on factories detailed reporting duties, sets up a register of discharged pollutants and mandates the publication of the data to the public. Experience has shown that environmental reporting duties change the behavior of polluting factories and that environmental transparency is a major democratic tool for mobilizing the public to act against pollution and pollutants. Evasion of reporting will be a criminal offense and will also result in significant administrative-financial penalties. * Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings ‚Äì Establishes a comprehensive mechanism for reducing energy use in the public sector. Among other measures, every public institution must follow a defined plan for the reduction of energy consumption. The law also lists a series of energy-saving measures, including the installation of energy-efficient light bulbs, replacement of electricity-guzzling equipment and implementation of a procedure for the economic use of electric equipment. Together with MK Nitzan Horowitz and MK Orit Zuaretz. * Duty to Install Water-Saving Devices in Public Buildings ‚Äì Mandates the installation of water-saving devices, including flow regulators (\\"chaschamim\\"), in all public buildings. Together with MK Ophir Akunis. * Law for the Protection of the Gulf of Eilat Coastal Environment ‚Äì The law for the first time extends the scope of the Coastal Environment Protection Law, which applies to the Mediterranean coast, to include the coast of the Gulf of Eilat. * Kinneret Protection Law ‚Äì The law extends the scope of the Coastal Environment Protection Law to include the shores of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), and establishes an authority (the Kinneret Conurbation) that is responsible for protecting the Kinneret and its shores. * National Mine Action Authority Law ‚Äì Establishes an authority with responsibility for clearing hundreds of minefields that are scattered throughout Israel. Together with MK Tzahi Hanegbi, MK Roni Bar-On and a group of MKs. * Prohibition of Driving on Beaches ‚Äì Establishes clear prohibitions and definitions with respect to driving on beaches, clarifies the penalties for violations of the law, and creates effective and modern enforcement mechanisms to deal with this phenomenon. * New Deposit Law ‚Äì Assigns direct responsibility to manufacturers, based on the principle of \\"the polluter pays\\". * Municipal Tax Exemption for Field Schools Law ‚Äì Serves as a means for aiding environmental education institutions. Together with MK Zevulun Orlev. * Electronic Waste Recycling ‚Äì A law that originated in two similar private members' bills submitted by MK Khenin and MK Nitzan Horowitz. Subsequently, a government bill was submitted that adopted the main points of these bills. The law, which is predicated on the principle of \\"the polluter pays,\\" provides for extended producer responsibility for the treatment and reduction of electronic waste that can cause soil and groundwater contamination, and makes arrangements for the collection and recycling of purchased appliances.  Animal protection  * Prohibition on Import of Animal-Tested Cosmetics and Detergents ‚Äì The law prohibits importing into Israel cosmetic/cleaning products, not for health purposes, and detergents that were tested on animals during their production. Together with MK Eitan Cabel and MK Nitzan Horowitz. * Prohibition on Declawing Cats Other than for Medical Reasons ‚Äì The declawing prohibited by the law is generally performed by cat owners who want to protect their home furniture. This is an irreversible surgical procedure that causes the animal great pain. Together with MK Eitan Cabel. * Law for Neutering and Spaying Dogs ‚Äì The purpose of the law is to deal in the most humane way with the phenomenon of the thousands of stray dogs abandoned every year to suffer from abuse or die a painful death, by encouraging dog owners to neuter or spay their pet in order to prevent unwanted births. Under the law, whoever neuters or spays their dog will recover the cost within two years by means of a discount on the dog license fee.

Political positions Khenin described his worldview as based on three core principles: =Supporting social justice= Khenin advocates for socialism, which he describes as \\"a great change in the current unequal social-economic system, in which a minority lives in unprecedented abundance, while many are left behind. New kinds of poverty become widespread, the middle strata deteriorate, and social safety nets are being eroded\\".quoted [from Khenin's page on the Knesset website http://m.knesset.gov.il/mk/Pages/MKPersonalDetails.aspx?MKID=780] As a politician who is considered to be committed to Socialist values, Khenin legislated dozens of social laws, and stood many times in support of workers struggles. Yet, he made it clear on numerous occasions, that his support for Socialism does not mean uncritical support of the model that existed in the Soviet Union. In an article he published in the Communist Party's weekly newspaper in 1991, as the USSR and the East-European Socialist countries were collapsing, Khenin wrote that what is needed is \\"neither social-democracy nor stalinism, but a modern and revolutionary Left, that can truly advance the Socialist challenge\\"quoted from Dov's personal blog =Supporting peace= Khenin was active in the peace movement since an early age, and was one of the first protesters against the 1982 Lebanon War. Since his election to the Knesset, he continued to express criticism towards the wars in Gaza and towards the 2006 Second Lebanon War. In his opinion, \\"for Israel, achieving peace is an existential necessity. If Israel will not find a way to live with its neighbors in the great Arab and Muslim region in which we live, we don't have a future here. A true Israeli-Palestinian peace needs to guarantee justice and independence of both peoples, and should give to the Palestinian people what the people in Israel already have: an independent state\\". =Supporting Jewish-Arab partnership= As a teenager, Khenin was a member of a joint Jewish-Arab youth movement, and as a student he was active in a joint Jewish-Arab student club called CAMPUS. Having been elected to the Knesset on the list of Hadash, and afterwards in the Joint List, he continued to stress that Jewish-Arab partnership is a cornerstone in his worldview: \\"The reality in Israel continues to separate between Jews and Arabs, yet the interest of both our peoples lies in creating a partnership that would transform this country into a just and secure place for all. Clearly, Jewish-Arab partnership means swimming against the tide, both among Jews as well as among Arabs. Yet we must swim against the tide of racism and xenophobia, and I am certain, that if we work right, we can also change its direction\\". =Relation to Marxism and Communism= As a teenager, Dov Khenin was a member of the Young Communist League of Israel, and afterwards joined the ranks of the Communist Party of Israel and was elected to its leading bodies. In the late 1980s, he harshly criticized the \\"deformations in the Soviet regime, which are the result of Stalinism\\". He defined Stalinism as a terrible deformation of the Communist ideal , and in an interview in 2009 he said that \\"I believe Stalin was the worst disaster of 20th-century Socialism. But I still believe in the ideal of transforming our world\\". He added that \\"Communism, for me, is a form of horizon: It is a different kind of society, a different kind of division between people... Capitalism wants to establish the rule of profit over everything in life: economy, education, health, the environment. Socialism means the opposite: to try and free as many of these domains from the rule of profit. The Socialism that I aspire to means liberating politics from big capital, and expanding democracy to encompass all walks of life\\".:he:%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5 References External links * *Dov Khenin Ir LeKhulanu *Dov Khenin Green Prophet *DovBlog Khenin's official website Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Hadash politicians Category:Israeli communists Category:Israeli people of Belarusian- Jewish descent Category:Israeli political scientists Category:Jewish Israeli politicians Category:Members of the 17th Knesset (2006‚Äì2009) Category:Members of the 18th Knesset (2009‚Äì2013) Category:Members of the 19th Knesset (2013‚Äì2015) Category:Members of the 20th Knesset (2015‚Äì2019) Category:People from Petah Tikva Category:Tel Aviv University alumni ","title":"Dov Khenin"},{"id":"40111846","text":"Christian Conrad (born November 17, 1931) is a former Swiss ice hockey goaltender who played for the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team in the 1956 Winter Olympics.

It ended in the victory of the Mongol forces, who captured the city and burned it, massacring most of its residents.  Background  In early February 1241, some ten thousand Mongol warriors concentrated near Wlodzimierz Wolynski, and entered Lesser Poland. The invaders captured Lublin and Zawichost, on February 13 reaching Sandomierz. The Polish army under voivode W≈Çodzimierz Gryf was defeated in the Battle of Tursk and the Battle of Chmielnik. The latter victory meant that the way to Krakow was opened. When news of Polish losses reached the city, its residents fled in panic to Silesia, Bohemia and Germany. Also, local peasants abandoned the villages, hiding in forests, swamps and other places.  The sack  The Mongols probably entered Krakow on March 22, 1241. The city itself was not defended. Those residents who had not fled, decided to hide in churches and on the fortified Wawel Hill. According to a popular-20th century legend, a Polish sentry on a tower of St. Mary's Church sounded the alarm by playing the Hejna≈Ç, and the city gates were closed before the Mongols could ambush. The trumpeter, however, was shot in the throat by a Tartar marksman and did not complete the anthem. The invaders stayed in the city for ten days, and their stay resulted in the almost complete destruction of Krakow. The Mongols failed to capture the Wawel Hill or St. Andrew‚Äôs Church, the only church in Krak√≥w to withstand the attack. On March 31, 1241, the Mongols set Krakow on fire, and on the next day, they left the city, heading towards Silesia.  Sources  * Tomislaw Giergiel, Tatarzy w Sandomierzu * Piastowie.

Agios Konstantinos is a coastal village on the northern shores of the Greek island Samos between the island‚Äôs two major towns Karlovasi west 10 km by road and Vathy east 20 km by road. The village faces the waters of the Aegean Sea. Stretched behind a narrow pebble beach and a protective stone wall Agios Konstantinos ascends into a patch work of stepped garden plots and forest intermittent by agricultural canals that ultimately source from natural streams further up the mountain. Agios Konstantinos strictly consists of two zones. A narrow beachfront zone flanked by the main Vathy-Karlovasi road above and the sea below is referred to as Agios Konstantinos itself, while a zone across the main road elevates to form Ano (Upper) Agios Konstantinos.  History  The origin of Agios Konstantinos is obscure, with early maps of the Samos island not revealing the village. Around 1700 the only documented settlement in the north central region of Samos is Vourliotes nested inland up the mountain and sheltered down to the sea by forest (reported by Joseph Georgirenes in the 1670 and Tournefort in 1702). Towards the end of the 18th century it is thought that a growing population in the region predominating from Vourliotes but also supplemented from farther afield resulted in the establishment of other nearby settlements. By the beginning of the 19th century six feature settlements developed including Agios Konstantinos, along with Nenedes (today's Ampelos), Manolates, Stavrinides, Margarites and Valeontades. At the end of the Greek War of Independence (1821-1829) the island of Samos, despite strong local support and pressure, was not included in the newly formed Greek Kingdom. Instead, albeit under duress, Samos in 1834 became an autonomous principality under Ottoman suzerainty, which lasted until 1912 when Samos was finally united to the Greek Kingdom. During the period of the Principality (1834-1912), the six villages were known as the municipality of Exi Geitonies or \\"Six Neighborhoods\\".  Population and Economy  Ano (Upper) Agios Konstantinos. An 1828 census records for Agios Konstantinos 254 inhabitants with 112 men and 141 women. Agios Konstantinos was then mostly in place of the present day Ano (Upper) Agios Konstantinos. The lower beachfront settlement consisted mainly of a few wine warehouses closer to where shipping was accessible. Continued development of wine production in the region supported the population to reach 600 by 1920 and 800 by the end of the decade, which by then also included some refugees from the nearby Asia Minor Catastrophe. From Tournefort‚Äôs accounts in 1702 central northern Samos was primarily uncultivated forest. By the nineteenth century the region had developed into an agrarian economy. Records reveal that in 1828 Agios Konstantinos produced 8000 \\"cargoes\\" of wine (with a cargo being a quantity that can be carried by a donkey or mule). Wine remained the main produce and source of revenue into the twentieth century with the wines of Agios Konstantinos joining others in the region to gain recognition as light desert wines with export markets. Following wine, olives and fruit trees also were significant produce from Agios Konstantinos. The electoral list of 1914, records for occupied males 61 farmers, 16 sailors, 10 merchants, 4 coffee shop owners, 3 grocers, 2 butchers, an office worker, a ship builder and a ship hull repairer. Those engaged in traditional crafts included 4 carpenters, 3 chair-makers, 2 coopers, 2 millers and 2 blacksmiths and a picture frame maker. In more professional occupations were recorded 2 teachers, a doctor and a hotel employee (who was working in the capital). We can add to these priests of the area and some passing-by officers, i.e. gendarmes, and one customs officer. Women were typically indicated to be engaged with \\"home duties‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen's duties\\", however, it is known that most women were also taking part in agricultural and other jobs. After World War II the population of Agios Konstantinos slowly dwindled to 394 inhabitants by 2001. Contributing factors were the decline of the local agrarian economy, urbanisation towards Athens, and overseas immigration particularly to America and Australia. Today the economy of the Agios Konstantinos is focused towards tourism and less on agriculture and wine.  Traditional Architecture  Houses and rows of barrels on the beach of Agios Konstantinos, pre-war. Early photographs of Agios Konstantinos from around 1900 help reveal the architecture dating as far back as 1800. These photographs typically show Agios Konstantinos as a stretch of beachfront houses near a pebble beach close to the water. The houses are mostly dual-level, but a few are single-level. Evident also in the styling is a Near East influence reflecting the close proximity to Asia Minor. Old shoe shop with painted advertising of footwear. Early houses were typically built on a prepared stone ground layer that allowed construction of a rectangular stone perimeter for external walls with openings for doors and windows. For a dual-level home the lower and upper levels were segmented using parallel beams the width of the house covered with boards to establish the lower level ceiling and the upper level floor. To partition rooms interior wooden walls were prepared and covered with narrow horizontal wooden strips and then in plaster. The window opening had ledges prepared from lightweight materials such as boards coated with plaster, then dressed with wooden panels with two or four folds for opening and closing. Balconies and glass were generally absent since the harsh weather from the sea and the fragile materials then available prevented these. The upper level was then finished once more using beams to form a second ceiling but instead covered with roof titles. The lower level of early houses could serve one of several purposes including storage for produce or equipment, an animal pen, or as a shop such as cafe, goods shop, tailor shop, shoe shop, etc. The upper level served for sleeping, cooking and living space. Access to the upper level was by a staircase, which could be either external or internal. The tavern (wine warehouse) by Aristidis Folas on the eastern edge of the village. Later homes built after the union with Greece (1912) are often found in the second row from the sea behind the beachfront homes. These are found constructed using similar methods to the beachfront homes, but some are with small central balconies and generally have a more neoclassic appearance which was popular in many Greek cities and larger towns in the interwar period, as can be seen in nearby Karlovasi. Earlier buildings were also often updated to reflect the newer styling. Behind the beachfront row homes often found is a garden or farm plot used to provide fresh produce for the adjacent houses. This however, typically does not include grapevines since these were instead usually grown in estates outside the settlement. During periods of intensive agrarian activity small lodges called ‚ÄòKalyvia‚Äô outside the main settlements were often used by field workers and farmers for temporary accommodation. Closer to or within the village however are found wineries as well other light industry buildings such as olive oil mills.  Public work ‚Äì public buildings  Reflecting Agios Konstantinos origins as a commercial port is that it is one of the few Greek villages without a central square that helps focus the village including development. Instead cafes, and more recently taverns and bars, are established scattered along the beachfront. An enlarged space in front of the main church Agios Ioannis (Saint John) is a relatively recent inclusion. As Agios Konstantinos developed into a habitable settlement, protection from the sea was necessary and the beachfront was increasingly fortified with rocks, rubble and concrete. With time these widened and spread along the length of the beach into a functional promenade along the sea, which by 1970 joined a road accessing the forest on the eastern side of the village. On the western end of the promenade is a substantial concrete and stone pier which was prepared for mooring fishing boats. The pier provides additional protection from the sea complimenting the promenade.

He was ridden by G√©rald Moss√© in all his starts.  Background  Sendawar, a dark bay or brown horse, was bred at the Aga Khan Studs in Ireland. He was sired by Priolo who himself won three Group 1 races in France and sired only one other Group 1 winner, namely Mirio. His dam was Sendana, a Darshaan mare, who produced only one other notable progeny, namely Sendoro, who was placed in three Group races.  Racing career  = 1998: two-year-old season = Sendawar raced twice at two ‚Äì firstly over 1,800m in the Prix de Sablonville when he came half a length second to Royal Line, and secondly in the Prix Adaris over 1,600m when again he came second by one length. = 1999: three-year-old season = Sendawar lined up in the Prix de Ferrier over 2,200m and went off 7/5 favourite and won \\"at a canter\\" by one and half lengths. He then stepped up to Group company in the Prix Greffulhe over 2,100m at Longchamp where he came 4 lengths second to Montjeu, who as a 3 year old won the Prix du Jockey Club, Irish Derby, and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, amongst others. On 6 May 1999, Sendawar dropped back in trip to contest the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp over 1,600m. The joint favourites in the race were the unbeaten Dansili and Way of Light, who had won the Grand Crit√©rium. Sendawar won by one and a half lengths from Dansili with Way of Light in 4th. Next he went onto Royal Ascot to run in the St James's Palace Stakes. He went off as the 2/1 favourite and faced 10 rivals, including Godolphin's Aljabr, the only other Group 1 winner in the field, who having been sent to America to run in the Kentucky Derby was withdrawn due to injury. Sendawar won by one and a quarter lengths from Ajabar with the other rivals trailing another five lengths behind. It was the aim for Sendawar to face Dubai Millennium in the Prix Jacques Le Marois in the summer, but he was withdrawn due to very soft ground. On 5 September, he was back at Longchamp as the 4/5 favourite for the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp over 1,600m. He faced his old rivals Dansili, Aljabr, and Way of Light. He won by one and a half lengths from Gold Away with Dansili a further head back in third. = 2000: four-year-old season = Sendawar started his four-year-old campaign in the Prix d'Ispahan over 1,850m at Longchamp coming up against the Prix d'Harcourt and Prix Ganay winner Indian Danehill. Sendawar won by 3 lengths in \\"impressive\\" fashion from Indian Danehill. Following the Prix d'Ispahan win, he was targeted for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown; however, he was supplemented for the Prince of Wales Stakes at a cost of ¬£20,000. In the Prince of Wales Stakes, he faced the Dubai World Cup and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner, Dubai Millennium, who won, leaving Sendawar trailing eleven lengths back in fourth place. On 13 August, in his last race, Sendawar was sent off as the 7/10 favourite for the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1,600m at Deuville and came three lengths second to the Godolphin-trained five-year-old Muhtathir. It was the intention for Sendawar to run again in the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp, but he was withdrawn from the race, having been retired by his connections.  Career at Stud  At stud Sendawar had limited success, he only had one notable progeny, namely Viva Macau, who earned ¬£441,502 in prize money and who was placed in the Prix Jean Prat, the Hong Kong Classic Mile. Sendawar was then sold to Annshoon Stud in Ireland to become a National Hunt stallion.

Its area accounts for roughly the southern half of the territory of present-day Thun municipality, including the districts of Scherzligen, D√ºrrenast, Neufeld, Allmendingen, Buchholz, Schoren, Gwatt. The municipality consisted of a group of villages in the possession of the von Str√§ttligen noble family, named for their home castle of Str√§ttligburg, who during the 13th century ruled over much of the western Bernese Oberland. Str√§ttligburg was destroyed by the Bernese in 1332, and the Str√§ttligen possessions passed to Berne in 1594, administrated by the Oberhofen reeve from 1662. The site of the ruined castle is now marked by the Str√§ttligturm, a tower constructed in 1699. The municipality became destitute in the early 20th century and was forced to request its incorporation into Thun in 1920. During the later half of the 20th century, all former villages of Str√§ttligen other than Allmendingen and Buchholz became integral part of the built-up area of the town. Allmendingen is the site of an important cultic center of Gallo- Roman religion, in use during the 1st to 3rd centuries. The region of Lake Thun was at the time known as regio lindensis (i.e. Gaulish-Latin for \\"lake region\\"). The cultic center consisted of eight chapels or small temples surrounded by a wall. The Allmendingen cultic center was exemplary for the religious syncretism at the time; deities woshipped at the site included Mars (presumably in lieu of Caturix) and Rosmerta as well as Mithras.Pr√ºmm \\"zur kaiserzeitlichen Religionslage in der Schweiz\\", Religionsgeschichliches Handbuch (1954), p. 766. The medieval village of Allmendingen is first mentioned in 1287. Before the correction of the Kander river in 1714, its lands were often inundated and yielded meagre crops. The first school was built in 1843. Allmendingen remained a village of subsistence farmers with a few hundred inhabitants until the late 19th century; in the 20th century, it was gradually transformed into a working-class residence area connected with the federal military industry which had been established in Thun in the 1860s. It experienced significant growth during the 1960s to 1990s, developing its own industrial area (including a large martial arts center and golf course in 1997), and is now separated from Thun Neufeld (a city district also built up since the 1920s) just by the A6 motorway (Thun S√ºd junction).

She is emeritus professor of Linguistics at University College London and research professor at the Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature at the University of Oslo. Her most influential work has been in linguistic pragmatics‚Äîspecifically in the development of Relevance Theory with French anthropologist Dan Sperber. This work has been especially influential in the Philosophy of Language. Important influences on Wilson are Noam Chomsky, Jerry Fodor, and Paul Grice. Linguists and philosophers of language who have been students of Wilson include Stephen Neale (CUNY Graduate Center), and Robyn Carston (University College London). Biography Wilson completed her Bachelor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford while working with philosopher H. P. Grice. She completed her PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with linguist Noam Chomsky as her dissertation advisor. She was a lecturer at Somerville College, Oxford. Work Wilson's work is in linguistic pragmatics. Pragmatics is the study of how contextual factors interact with linguistic meaning in the interpretation of utterances.Wilson, D & Sperber, D. Meaning and Relevance. Cambridge University Press. 2012. Her 1975 book Presuppositions and Non-Truth-Conditional Semantics advocated a pragmatic approach to presuppositions. In her longstanding collaboration with French Anthropologist Dan Sperber she has published many books and articles over 30 years. Their 1986 book Relevance: Communication and Cognition laid the foundation for Relevance Theory which they have continued to develop in subsequent books and articles. Relevance Theory is, roughly, the theory that the aim of an interpreter is to find an interpretation of the speaker's meaning that satisfies the presumption of optimal relevance. An input is relevant to an individual when it connects with available contextual assumptions to yield positive cognitive effects. Publications Novel *Wilson, D. Slave of the Passions. Picador. 1992.

It is located in Westland, Michigan and roughly bounded by Palmer Road on the north, Wildwood Road on the west, Merriman Road on the east, and Glenwood Road and the Wayne County Lower Rouge Parkway on the south. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Construction The Norwayne Subdivision was begun in 1942 by the National Housing Agency in order to house workers employed at nearby defense industry plants, including the Willow Run Bomber Plant. The Detroit architectural firm of Lyndon and Smith was originally chosen to design the subdivision. However, Maynard Lyndon, one of the firm's principals, moved to California in 1942, and subsequent design work was done by Augustus O‚ÄôDell, Hewlett & Luckenbach. Substantial construction was completed in 1943, but additional work was carried out through 1947, when the community church was constructed. Due to wartime scarcity of materials, construction was done with materials at hand, and items like gutters were left off. The original occupancy of the Norwayne subdivision was restricted to war workers and military personnel whose income was under a specific level. In 1944, the income cap was $2000 yearly for a family of two persons, with an additional $200 for each child up to $2800 maximum. The project originally had 1189 residential buildings, which contained a total of 1900 individual dwelling units. The 1189 units were 192 one-bedroom row houses, 200 two- bedroom row houses, 362 two-bedroom twin houses, 674 two-bedroom single homes, and 472 three-bedroom twin homes. The subdivision also included a management office (now the Dorsey Community Center), a fire station (now demolished and replaced), a church, two elementary schools (Lincoln Elementary School and Jefferson-Barns Elementary School), and several commercial properties. Later history After the end of World War II, the federal government decided to sell houses to individual residents, with preference given to veterans. In 1948, the local township took over operation of water and sewer services for the subdivision, and in 1953, sales of individual homes began. However, by as early as 1962, some units had deteriorated to the point that demolition was required. Over the years, home ownership declined and some units deteriorated further, earning the neighborhood the pejorative name, \\"Shacktown.\\" Both elementary schools in the neighborhood were closed in 2010. The Hoover Elementary School building was torn down and the site is vacant. Jefferson- Barns school building now houses the Jefferson-Barns Community Vitality Center. Despite efforts to revitalize the area, low-income residents, apathy, and disrepair have remained. Description The Norwayne Historic District is bisected by Venoy Road, which runs north‚Äìsouth; Grand Traverse Street, which meanders roughly east‚Äìwest, serves as a main trunkline for the neighborhood. Cross-streets and half-circle courts extend from Grand Traverse; the residential structures all face onto these cross-streets and courts, set back a consistent distance from the street. Streets in the subdivision are primarily curvilinear, following the Federal Housing Administration guidelines published in the late 1930s. Commercial and public buildings are located on or near Venoy Road, with the exception of the former elementary schools, which were located at the east and west ends of the neighborhood. Of the original 1189 residential units, 1124 are still extant. The district includes these residential structures, as well as the former Lincoln and Jefferson-Barns Elementary Schools (both closed in 2010), the Community Church, Dorsey Center, and the commercial buildings located along Venoy. In all, there are 1069 contributing and 123 non-contributing structures in the neighborhood.

Each of the units are entered through a door in the front fa√ßade. Each unit has a kitchen, living room and 1 bedroom and bathroom. These units were originally flat-roofed and sided with weatherboard; in the 1990s, a federally funded project added gabled roofs and vinyl siding to all the rowhouses. =Three- bedroom duplexes= The 191 contributing three-bedroom duplexes measure long by wide and are two stories tall. The duplexes contain two mirror-image units, with entrance doors in the front facade at opposite ends. Each unit contains , with a living room and kitchen on the first floor, and three bedrooms and a bath on the second floor. Roofs were originally flat, but many have been gabled, and most units have vinyl or aluminum siding applied over the original clapboard. =Two-bedroom duplexes= The 193 two-bedroom duplexes measure long by wide and are two stories tall. The duplexes contain two mirror-image units, with entrance doors in the center of the unit. Each unit contains 864 square feet, with a living room and kitchen on the first floor, and two bedrooms and a bath on the second floor. Roofs were originally flat, but many have been gabled, and most units have vinyl or aluminum siding applied over the original clapboard. =Two-bedroom single family homes= The 618 single- family houses measure long by wide. They were originally built as a single story, but some have a second story addition. There are two entrances; one in the front and one in the rear. Each unit contains , with a living room, kitchen, dining room, two bedrooms and a bath. The houses have gable roofs, and most units have vinyl or aluminum siding applied over the original clapboard. Community Center =Dorsey Community Center= The Dorsey Community Center (originally the management office for the subdivision) is located at the southwest corner of Dorsey Road and Grand Traverse Road. It is a one-story structure built of beige brick with a flat roof. Large single-light casement windows are located on each side of the building. The interior includes office space, a conference room, and a large multi-purpose room. =Fire station= The subdivision originally had a fire station located just behind the Dorsey Community Center. The station had a single bay, a kitchen, dayroom, sleeping quarters, and bathroom. The station was demolished and replaced with another station at a different location in the 1980s. Norwayne Community Church =Norwayne Community Church= The Norwayne Community Church is located at the southeast corner of Grand Traverse Street and Dorsey Road, atop a small but prominent rise. It is a two-story T-shaped structure built from block, with a gabled roof and a small square belfry. The entrance is in the middle of the front facade under the gable, with eight steps leading to a brick porch. Tall windows line the side elevations. The church has been painted brown. =Schools= Jefferson-Barns Elementary School The Lincoln and Jefferson- Barns Elementary Schools were constructed roughly in the center of each half of the subdivision. Both school buildings are single-story brick structures, with wide flat roofs and a T-shape construction to accommodate both daycare and classrooms. Both have a taller multi-purpose room. Lincoln elementary was constructed with a longer classroom wing, although both schools have had additions constructed at some point. Both elementary schools are closed. The Lincoln Elementary School building was torn down in 2016. The Jefferson-Barns building is now the home of the Jefferson-Barns Community Vitality Center. =Parks in the Norwayne District= There are five parks in the Norwayne subdivision. Before 1958, they were simply vacant lots, but the township acquired the lots and cleaned them up. The parks include picnic pavilions and playground equipment. Commercial building =Commercial structures= A few commercial structures, located on the east side of Venoy Road just south of Dorsey Road, were part of the original Norwayne development. The two-story building at 2345 Venoy Road originally housed a grocery store, dry cleaner, barber shop, beauty parlor, and taxicab office on the first floor and a physician's and dentist's offices on the second. An addition to the building housed a drug store. A second commercial building housed a five-and-dime store References Category:Historic districts in Wayne County, Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wayne County, Michigan Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Westland, Michigan ","title":"Norwayne Historic District"},{"id":"40112047","text":"Klamath Northern Railway Company (KNOR) is a shortline railroad operating from Gilchrist, Oregon to Gilchrist Jct, Oregon where is connects with Union Pacific Railroad's Cascade Subdivision.

Several protests and disputes surrounding its use and the wider implications of the information gathered has gained the facility some local and international notoriety.  Function The construction of a new station on 30 hectares of stony ground was authorised by the Prime Minister David Lange and Finance Minister Roger Douglas in 1987. Gerald Hensley comments that Lange: \\"was ready to work with the Australians [as] ‚Ä¶ international communications were shifting to satellites ‚Ä¶ Lange was regularly briefed by me and despite his later claims knew exactly what was involved and why the station was needed. ‚Ä¶ The Australians were building a similar one at Geraldton [Western Australia] and their Defence Minister explained to the PM why the two installations separated by five time zones would enhance the benefit to both countries.\\"Final Approaches: A Memoir by Gerald Hensley (2006, Auckland University Press) p.304 It has been operating since 1989, and was expanded with the construction of a second interception dish in 1998. It is described as a satellite communications monitoring facility in the Waihopai Valley, near Blenheim. The facility has been identified by MP Keith Locke as part of ECHELON, the worldwide network of signals interception facilities run by the UKUSA consortium of intelligence agencies, which shares global electronic and signals intelligence among the intelligence agencies of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The dishes are shielded by giant radomes. Few details of the facility are known, but it is believed that it intercepts and processes all phone calls, faxes, e-mail and computer data communications. It is thought that this data is then sorted and shared with the other members of the UKUSA group. In June 2007, a torus antenna was installed, which is able to receive the signals of up to 35 satellites simultaneously. This antenna is not covered by a radome.Electrospaces.net: = Southern Cross Cable interception = In August 2014, it was revealed that an engineer from the United States National Security Agency had visited New Zealand and held a meeting at Waihopai Station. The topic of discussion was interception of all traffic on the Southern Cross Cable. Due to New Zealand's isolated location, the cable is the only point of international internet and telecommunications access to and from New Zealand. New Zealand politician and Green Party co-leader, Russel Norman, criticised this, saying that it would enable the New Zealand and United States Government to spy on all of New Zealand's internet traffic. The office of National Party Prime Minister, John Key, denied these claims but admitted they were negotiating a \\"cable access programme\\" with the NSA but refused to clarify what that was or why the United States NSA was involved. In May 2014, 3 months prior to this revelation, John Minto, vice-president of the New Zealand Mana Party, had alleged that the NSA was carrying out mass surveillance on all meta-data and content that went into and out of New Zealand through the cable. This followed disclosure in 2013 by the New Zealand Herald that the owners of the cable had asked the NSA for monetary compensation for mass surveillance on the cable. Protests and security breaches The site is a regular target for protesters and activists who are attempting to have the base closed down. The Anti-Bases Campaign have had regular yearly protests at the base. In 1996 Nicky Hager entered the base at night with John Campbell and a TV3 film crew, and filmed the operations room through a window. Hager returned in 1999 with Mikey Havoc and Jeremy Wells (as his \\"Newsboy\\" persona). They snuck into the base and danced in front of cameras for a television show in which Havoc and Newsboy were starring. One of the domes collapsed after the 2008 Ploughshares attack In April 2008, three Ploughshares Aotearoa or Anzac Ploughshares activists breached three security fences to enter the base and then used a sickle to deflate the kevlar covering over one of the two satellite dishes. Prime Minister Helen Clark condemned the attack on the spy base as a \\"senseless act of criminal vandalism\\". They waited there until they were arrested and charged with intentional damage and unlawful entry. They were tried in March 2010 where they readily admitted their actions in court but defended it as a \\"claim of right\\" to save human lives. Samuel Land (one of the 3) was represented by prominent human rights barrister Antony Shaw. The jury agreed with the argument of the three activists and despite their earlier admissions were acquitted on all charges. One of the protesters said \\"we broke a law to protect plastic to uphold a law to protect human life.\\" The New Zealand government sued the trio and won damages of $1.2 million toward the repair of the dome, however, it chose not to pursue the payment. With the publicity surrounding the base and this case, the GCSB directors released an announcement stating that \\"The claims that the Waihopai station is 'a United States spybase in our midst', contributing to 'torture, war, and the use of weapons of mass destruction' and other 'unspeakable evil' cannot be left unchallenged ‚Ä¶ It was not ‚Äì and is not ‚Äì contributing to 'unspeakable evil'.

He was one of 6 brothers and 3 sisters. He trained as an engineer at London University and did his early work on Crystal Palace, Sydenham station as well as a range of railway projects and public buildings around Europe.

In 1858 he was sent to the Cape, aged 22, to begin work on its first railway, for the infant Cape Railway and Dock Company (later to become the Cape Government Railways). This railway stretched from Cape Town to Wellington, and his team began work on it on 31 March 1859. Another section was built from Cape Town to Wynberg. In 1861 he worked on construction of Cape Town's tramways, including the line to Sea point, (originally horse-drawn) with the \\"Green Point Tramway Company\\". He later also completed a similar project for Port Elizabeth. During this time, he also worked on a range of architectural and engineering projects throughout the Cape, including the old Mutual Assurance building in Cape Town, Dutch Reformed Churches and several other buildings in Beaufort West and Graaff- reinet, as well as the Town Hall and principal churches of Port Elizabeth. Cape government railways The Cape Government Railways in 1882. The first railway line in East London. In 1872, the Cape attained a degree of independence from Britain and its first Prime Minister, John Molteno, driving a massive expansion in the Cape's economic infrastructure, consolidated the country's railway lines into the Cape Government Railways. The few existing rudimentary lines were to be turned into a nationwide network, connecting the country's ports to the diamond fields of Kimberley and the agricultural hinterland. James Bisset had played a significant part in deciding on the gauge to be used for the national railway system, and was involved in selecting Cape gauge for this purpose. He inaugurated and directed the first early railway line of the \\"Cape Midland Line\\", running from Port Elizabeth to Uitenhage. He was also appointed to lead construction of the \\"Cape Eastern Line\\", running from East London. Political career Bisset typically pursued several simultaneous occupations throughout his career. He served in the Anglo-Boer War and chaired the School, Municipal and Hospital Boards. He was a councillor for Liesbeeck Municipality (1883-1886), Mayor of Wynberg (1886, 1893) and briefly Mayor of Claremont. While Mayor of Wynberg, he obtained the grant of land for what became Wynberg Park. He also succeeded in making Wynberg the first municipality in the greater Cape Peninsula area to get electric street lighting.P. Brooke Simons. (1995). Old Mutual, 1845-1995.

Ford Memorial Museum, Homer, Louisiana Biographical sketch A native of Haynesville, Sale entered the United States Army in 1917 at the age of twenty- two and reached the rank of corporal with service in France. From 1920 to 1928, Sale was a deputy under Claiborne Parish Sheriff John Coleman. During this time of national prohibition, Sale attempted to halt illegal whisky being sold in Claiborne Parish during a petroleum boom. He joined the Louisiana Bureau of Investigations under Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr. On the night of Long's assassination on September 8, 1935, he transported the governor to the hospital in Baton Rouge, only to be told to return Long to the state capitol to find out who had shot him. Long died several days later from ramifications relating to the wound. A Democrat, Sale was elected sheriff of Claiborne Parish in 1936 and served until 1944. Oddly, another Long bodyguard, Elliot D. Coleman, was elected in 1936 as the sheriff of Tensas Parish in eastern Louisiana and remained in office until his defeat in 1960. On Sale's death, U.S. Representative Joe D. Waggonner of Louisiana's 4th congressional district penned a letter of condolences to Mrs. Eoline B. Sale (1905-1997), which is displayed at the Herbert S. Ford Memorial Museum in Homer.

Early life Born at Cockermouth in Cumberland on 31 July 1759, Walker was the son of a smith and ironmonger there. He was educated at Cockermouth grammar school, and then followed his father's occupation of blacksmith. In 1779 he went to Dublin, and worked for an artist named Esdale. Between 1780 and 1783 he contributed engraved plates to Joseph Walker's Hibernian Magazine. Influenced by Quaker ideas, though never admitted to the Society of Friends, Walker set up a school in Usher's Island, Dublin, in 1784, based on treating his pupils kindly. He journeyed through much of England and Ireland in 1793, returning to Dublin in the following year. Leaving Dublin for London, he made over his school to his friend John Foster. Walker became a medical student at Guy's Hospital. In 1797 he visited Paris, where he was on good terms with James Napper Tandy, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Muir. From Paris he went to the University of Leyden, and graduated M.D. in 1799. He passed the winter in Edinburgh, and in 1800 was at Stonehouse in Gloucestershire, staying with a Dr. Marshall. Vaccinator Marshall invited Walker to Naples to help introduce vaccination, and he left England in June 1800. He then accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby on his Egyptian expedition. Returning to London in 1802, Walker on 12 August started recommenced a course of public vaccination. The Jennerian Society was formed at the end of the year, and early in 1803 he was elected resident inoculator at the central house of the society in Salisbury Square. Walker, however, did not operate within the principles set down by Edward Jenner, and Jenner insisted he should be dismissed. Walker in consequence resigned the post on 8 August 1806, amid a public row. On 25 August the London Vaccine Institution, was formed, in which Walker was appointed to a post similar to one which he had resigned, and continued to practise in Salisbury Court. After the establishment of the national vaccine board by the government, the Jennerian Society, at a low ebb, was amalgamated with the London Vaccine Institution in 1813, and Jenner was elected president of the new society, with Walker as director, an office which he held until his death. Walker was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 30 September 1812. During the latter part of his life he worked on vaccination, six days a week at the various stations of the society. He boasted that he had vaccinated more than 100,000 persons. Walker died in London on 23 June 1830. He was an abolitionistl, and campaigned against sati. He had married at Glasgow on 23 October 1799. A biography was written by John Epps, to help support his widow. Works In 1788 Walker published in London Elements of Geography and of Natural and Civil History, which reached a third edition in 1800. His Universal Gazetteer (London) appeared in 1795, reaching a sixth edition in 1815. He wrote also: * On the Necessity for contracting Cavities between the Venous Trunks and the Ventricles of the Heart, Edinburgh, 1799. * Fragments of Letters and other Papers written in different parts of Europe and in the Mediterranean, London, 1802. He translated from the French the Manual of the Theophilanthropes, or Adorers of God and Friends of Man, London, 1797.

Ten years later in 1876, the group voted to dissolve itself in favor of enabling public access to their collection. The public library was officially created by the City Council on July 21, 1876 and budgeted $1,000 for the library. When the library opened it had almost 750 volumes in its collection.

It had a very short career, crashing on its first flight. Design The wing of the D.VI was of constant chord, with straight edges and square tips. It was mounted with slight sweep over the fuselage, parasol fashion, primarily braced by a pair of long parallel struts on each side from the lower fuselage to points well out along the wings. It was supported centrally on two outward leaning pairs of short parallel cabane struts from the upper fuselage. Unusually the space between each main strut pair was faired-in with a lift-providing aerofoil, supplementing the wing. These surfaces extended from the lower fuselage strut junction to the level of the cockpit and upper fuselage, the rest of the struts being normally exposed. The D.VI was powered by a Mercedes D.III water cooled six cylinder inline engine. The fuselage behind was rectangular in cross section and flat sided, with the single cockpit under the wing trailing edge where there was a small cut-out to aid the pilot's vision. The tailplane was placed on top of the fuselage and like the vertical tail was essentially straight edged. The rudder was balanced and extended down to the keel, moving in a cut-out between the elevators. The fixed conventional undercarriage had a single axle mounted on a pair of V-struts, aided by a sprung tailskid. Its first flight was on 29 May 1918. It crashed and was seriously damaged, but never rebuilt.

C., Nice, R., Bourdieu, P., & Bottomore, T. B. (2013). \\"Reproduction in education, society, and culture\\". Los Angeles; London; New Delhi; Singapore; Washington, D.C.: Sage. Symbolic violence describes a type of non-physical violence manifested in the power differential between social groups. It is often unconsciously agreed upon by both parties and is manifested in an imposition of the norms of the group possessing greater social power on those of the subordinate group. Symbolic violence can be manifested across different social domains such as nationality, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnic identity. The term began to be used by other sociologists and authors in the early 1990s.Bourdieu, P., & Wacquant, L. J. (1992). An invitation to reflexive sociology. Chicago, Il.: University of Chicago Press. Bourdieu made efforts to stress that symbolic violence is generally not a deliberate action by a hegemonic power, rather an unconscious reinforcement of the status quo that is seen as the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù by those who exist within that social stratification. Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek discusses symbolic violence in Violence (2008), arguing that it is located in the signification of language itself, i.e. the very ways in which we talk to one another sustain relations of domination.  History  The term symbolic violence first appeared in Pierre Bourdieu‚Äôs work alongside the similar concepts of symbolic power and cultural capital which make physical analogy to the power differentials between social groups within a hierarchy. Although La Distinction focused mainly on aesthetics and taste within modern French culture, it established a framework within which he and other sociologists would examine meta-behavior within society as it relates to power, social capital, and individual habitus.Bourdieu, P. (1998). \\"Masculine Domination\\". Polity. Bourdieu‚Äôs theory of symbolic violence further elaborates and develops Max Weber‚Äôs thoughts on the role of legitimation in domination. Power requires justification and belief. The concept of symbolic violence was created to argue that hard power is not sufficient for the effective exercise of power. Symbolic violence finds expression through body language, comportment, self-presentation, bodily care, and adornment.Dowding, K. M. (2011). Encyclopedia of power. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. Since its establishment in the sociological lexicon, symbolic violence has been applied in multiple disciplines of the social sciences and in numerous case studies. For example, in anthropologist, Douglas E. Foley‚Äôs Learning Capitalist Culture (2010) he mentions that Bourdieu‚Äôs ideas on symbolic violence have been used by critical race and feminist scholars to discuss the mistreatment of oppressed groups. In their work, critical race and feminist scholars have pointed out that patriarchal and racist social settings are where students from oppressed groups experience symbolic violence.Foley, Douglas E. (2010). Learning Capitalist Culture: Deep in the Heart of Tejas (Second ed.). Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 184. . In Learning Capitalist Culture (2010), Foley also mentions that many scholars in the United States have talked about Bourdieu‚Äôs ideas on symbolic violence as well as the monitoring of working-class minority students. Their work focuses on the ways in which institutional control is obtained. One method is whiteness discourse.Foley, Douglas E. (2010).

Anthropology of Education Quarterly. 39 ‚Äì via AnthroSource. Dr. Seth M. Holmes applies the theory of symbolic violence to the study of immigration between the United States and Mexico in Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies (2014). In his ethnography, Holmes explains that U.S border protection and laws aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration help perpetuate symbolic violence. Dr. Holmes also applies the lens of symbolic violence to the hierarchy between the indigenous Mexican migrant laborers and the farm supervisors in the United States. Here, Holmes indicates how because he is \\"light skinned\\" and \\"English speaking,\\" he is not subjected to the derogatory name calling that the farm supervisors repeat to the Oaxacan workers.  Domains  =Social media = In the decades following the creation of the term symbolic violence by Pierre Bourdieu, a rapid evolution in technology resulted in the creation of various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The introduction of these digital communities provided an additional medium for the spread of symbolic violence through the action of \\"trolling\\" which according to Claire Hardaker is defined as \\"the sending or submission of provocative emails, social media posts or 'tweets', with the intention of inciting an angry or upsetting response from its intended target, or victim.\\" While the act of trolling affects a wide range of social media users, with regard to symbolic violence it is frequently directed at women and minority groups. While the manner in which the victims are attacked varies by case, it is the response trolling that promotes symbolic violence within the affected groups. In the explanation by Lois McNay regarding the action of the trolling victims, she writes the advice given to victims of online abuse and/or trolling involve complicity with the symbolic violence enacted on them by the villain/troll, and therefore by entering into these online spaces, or ‚Äòfields‚Äô to use Bourdieu‚Äôs term, we can argue that ‚Äòcorporeal inculcation‚Äô of ‚Äòsymbolic violence‚Äô is ‚Äòexercised with the complicity‚Äô of the individual = Gender = Symbolic violence can be applied to the topic of the repression of women in the form of subordination. Beate Krais argued that regardless of whether within or outside the family, symbolic violence maintains a dominant relation upon women.Krais B. 1993. ‚ÄòGender and Symbolic Violence: Female Oppression in the Light of Pierre Bourdieu‚Äôs Theory of Social Practice‚Äô, in Calhoun C., Lipuma E., Postone M., (eds.), Bourdieu: Critical Perspectives. Cambridge: Polity and Blackwell, 156‚Äì177. A key aspect of the repression of women is \\"the social construction of women as the quintessential ‚Äòother‚Äô‚Äù portraying female behavior as weak, female jobs as less prestigious, female activities as of less value, etc. Social reproduction is important in analyzing symbolic violence in women as the adherence to sociocultural norms by both men and women plays a key role in subordination.de Beauvoir S. 1972. The Second Sex. Penguin: Harmondsworth. (First Published, 1949, Le Deuxi√®me Sexe). Symbolic violence towards women often takes the form of cultural lexical expressions. Normative phrases like, ‚Äúhit like a girl‚Äù or ‚Äúrun like a girl‚Äù subtly develop views about the subordination of women in a linguistic form.Allen J. 2003. Lost Geographies of Power. Oxford: Blackwell. = Race = Many studies have identified the influence of race and class on the different ways in which disciplinary action is handled by educators. In the United States there is a national rhetoric regarding the term ‚Äúghetto,‚Äù where a set of behavioral norms and traits symbolizing impoverished, crime-prone, dilapidated, and violent neighborhoods are ascribed to blacks in or near urban centers. A study led by Melanie Jones Gast, focused on 44 black students in the span of two months. Race, class, and status were combined in everyday language towards black students. With less than 10 percent of educators being black, many black students also had a lack of guidance from educators. Despite making up less than half the population of students, black students received more than 70 percent of all 500 disciplinary infractions. = Language = Another form of symbolic violence could be the domination through the normalization of certain language usage. A study was done by Ana Celia Zentella that explains how the Royal Spanish Academy produces symbolic violence by their policies and actions that are designed to produce a \\"pure\\" Spanish. Zentella proposes the idea that there are many different forms of English, that sound and are spelled differently (such as English in the United Kingdom vs English in the Northeast of the United States), therefore, the Spanish language should have the same implications. This idea exemplifies symbolic violence because people are ostracized if they do not speak the form of Spanish that the Academy coins ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù. Zentella explains how people would react if a person spoke with a ‚Äúlisp‚Äù in the area she grew up, ‚Äúif any Spaniard in our circle had ever dared to speak that way they would have been ridiculed‚Äù. The main way that the Royal Spanish Academy performs symbolic violence is by normalizing the language, and expecting all speakers to conform to the normalization that they provide. Another way that Zentella relates symbolic violence to the work of the Royal Spanish Academy is through human capital. Since there is a certain expectation of how Spanish is supposed to sound in Spain, speakers from Latin American that sound different are subject to decreased human capital based on the fact that they do not sound the way they should.

It is made up of members holding a Commercial Pilot License(CPL) or higher, as well as pilots currently enrolled in flight training working towards a CPL . They believe that the occupation of a Pilot should be a certified profession much like many other professions are, and will aid in working towards a safe and more self regulated profession in conjunction with Transport Canada. They aim to be recognized as the worldwide \\"gold standard\\" for the self-governing model for maintaining pilots credentials. The group became established not only with a common goal in mind but also because of an accident that occurred in Winnipeg, Manitoba on June 11, 2002. The accident occurred when a light twin engine aircraft piloted by Mr. Tayfel and operated by Keystone Air Service crashed, killing one of the six passengers. The aircraft, on a charter from a remote fishing lodge, performed a go-around in Winnipeg International Airport and ran out of fuel crashing into a busy intersection in the Winnipeg area. The defence argued that the flight operator, Keystone Air, should take the blame because Tayfel's bosses pressured him to go ahead with the flight as scheduled. During cross-examination, though, Tayfel admitted he did not push the issue of the auto-pilot system any further with the chief pilot. Aviation experts testified during the trial that if the aircraft had been equipped with a working auto pilot, the pilot would have most likely been able to land on the first attempt and not crashed. The accident subsequently led to the criminal conviction of the pilot in 2007 setting a legal precedent for all pilots in Canada.  About  The College is not a union, nor does it aim to be. A union protects individuals where the College is to care for the profession. The goal is to cultivate pilots professional excellence, and to teach and maintain safe and accepted practices in both pilots working for a living, and pilots in training. The principal functions of the College would be to certify pilots and accredit flight schools curriculums. They would provide ongoing support, guidance, and education to ensure pilots achieve and maintain the high levels of expertise the public has come to expect.  History  The College of Professional Pilots of Canada began in 2008 when group of pilots from the industry united after a 2007 conviction of a fellow pilot who crashed an aircraft after running out of fuel, killing one passenger. They met not only with this incident in mind but also to discuss the current state of the industry and its future, with focus on having a pilot be a professional. It was agreed that the best natural progression of the profession should be to have certification of a professional pilots licenses and credentials to a self-governing model. This, like most other professional organizations, would mean that pilots would be governing and licensing themselves. This led to the registration of a not-for-profit corporation in early 2009 and shortly after its first official meeting. At this meeting the College's first board of directors and executive members were appointed and the organization began. On August 8, 2012, the College of Professional Pilots of Canada officially unveiled their website as well as a press release to the public with the College's intentions. The College plans to hold its first true meeting including its members in the Fall of 2013 where the current board will resign, and its nationally elected board will be voted in by its growing membership.  Mission  The mission of the College of Professional Pilots of Canada is rooted in the interest of public safety with collaboration with all stakeholders, the College will oversee, maintain and promote the calibre of pilots in Canada. With this mission they would be able to uphold safe and accepted practices to make aviation safer for the flying public. As the President of the CPPC mentioned in an interview with AVweb in March 2013; \\"that if successful, the College would set and enforce standards for commercial pilots and provide needed input into regulations and laws that govern aviation in the same way that the governing bodies of other professions operate\\"  Membership  Membership is currently open to all Canadian Commercial and Airline Transport rated fixed wing and rotary wing pilots as well as pilots enrolled in commercial flight training.

He was the last commander of the force. Education Rabii was among the first military officers of the Imperial Iranian Air Force who were trained at the Furstenfeldbrook air base in Germany during the 1950s and later Reese Air Force Base in the United States. He and other military officers including Nader Jahanbani also took jet pilot instructor course at the air base. Career and activities Rabii was a fighter pilot on the F-86 Sabre and later the F-4 Phantom. After returning to Iran he contributed to the foundation of the acrobat team in the air force, named the Imperial Iranian Air Force Golden Crown Acro Jet Team, in 1958. He was the commander of the Tactical Air Command in Shiraz until 1976. He served as commander in chief of Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) from Spring 1976 to 1979 with the rank of lieutenant general. He succeeded Fazayel Tadayoun in the post. When he was in command, there were forty-eight thousand men in the air force. Barry Rubin, a veteran Middle East expert, described him as possibly \\"the most able officer in the top circles of the armed forces.\\" Rabii, right, with other Golden Crown pilots In August 1978, Rabii indirectly urged Moshe Dayan, then foreign minister of Israel, to meet the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and to tell him the increasing tension in Iran. Rabii complained that the Shah had been ignoring his and others' remarks. The visit was paid by Dayan in the following days. Rabii was one of the military officials who met General Robert Huyser, then deputy commander of US forces in Europe, during the latter's visit to Iran from 4 January to 3 February 1979. Three days before leaving the country on 13 January, the Shah told all commanders, including Rabii, that they should support the government of Shapour Bakhtiar. Following the 1979 revolution clashes occurred between supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini and people loyal to the Shah regime. Rabi'i instructed his men not to kill anyone on the other side. When then prime minister Bakhtiar ordered him to bomb the arms factory in central Tehran, he refused to carry out this order. Rabii did not support for the revolution, but a significant portion of the air force cadets and young skilled military technical personnel did. Sa'id Mehdiyun replaced Rabii as commander of the air force. Personal life Rabii married a German woman, Gerda, and had two sons, Arean and Arman. Death Rabii was arrested in February 1979 along with Tehran martial law governor Mehdi Rahimi, air force general Ayat Mahaghghi (Mohagheghi) and Isfahan martial law governor Reza Naji, and they were all taken to Alawi school in Tehran. Special press conferences were organized by the Islamic regime to publicly display these officials, including former prime minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, former SAVAK chief Nematollah Nasiri and Rabii, and these conferences were broadcast nationally. During the initial interrogations, Rabii stated that the air force purchased advanced warplanes and other military equipment from the US, which were all in the country, and that the air force of Iran was intact and the second powerful force in the world. Rabii was secretly tried and in the court, he stated \\"General Huyser threw the Shah out of the country like a dead mouse.\\" He was sentenced to death on charges of corruption on earth and treason among the others. Local dailies reported that the verdict was based on the confessions of other Shah-period officials. He and nine other civil and military officials were executed by the security forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Qasr prison of Tehran on 9 April 1979.

History  The Joshua Appleby was commissioned in August 8, 1998. The 6th of 14 Keeper-class cutters, the Joshua Appleby is one of the most advanced cutters currently in the United States Coast Guard's fleet. The Joshua Appleby is named in honor of Captain Joshua Appleby, Keeper of the Sand Key Lighthouse 1837-1846. All 14 Keeper-class cutters are named after lighthouse keepers. The Joshua Appleby' takes for its motto, \\"The Wrecking Keeper\\" after Joshua Appleby's very colorful history of shipwreck salvaging.  Mission  The Joshua Applebys primary mission is the maintenance of over 400 aids to navigation in the Tampa Bay and along the west coast of Florida, including the Florida Keys. Secondary missions include Alien Migration Intercept Operation (AMIO), search and rescue (SAR), and pollution response.  Design  The Keeper-class cutters are the first US Coast Guard cutters equipped with Z-drive propulsion units instead of the standard propeller and rudder configuration. They are designed to independently rotate 360 degrees. Combined with a thruster in the bow, they give the Keeper-class cutters unmatched maneuverability. With state-of-the-art electronics and navigation systems including Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) which uses a Differential Global Positioning System, and electronic chart displays, these buoy tenders maneuver and position aids more accurately and efficiently with fewer crew. The advancement in technology has allowed the crew size to be cut from 24-34 members to 18 members. Namesake The ship is named after an American lighthouse keeper Joshua Appleby. Appleby is remembered for having lost his life in the Great Havana Hurricane of 1846. A native of Rhode Island, Joshua Appleby served as keeper of the Sand Key Light in the Florida Keys. Hurricanes in 1841 and 1842 caused considerable damage to the key, destroying Appleby's house and undermining the foundation of the light. The government repaired the damage and built a seawall, in hopes of adding further protection. A hurricane in 1844 swept away half of the key, part of the sea wall, and again destroyed Appleby's house. Seemingly unfazed by the dangers of his station, Appleby rebuilt and remained as keeper of the light. On 11 October 1846, Appleby, his 51-year-old daughter Eliza, and his 11-year-old grandson Thomas were swept away to become additional victims of the hurricane which was calculated to have caused the deaths of at least 255 people.

He was President of the American Psychiatric Association. Biography Bartemeier was born on September 12, 1895, in Muscatine, Iowa, into a Roman Catholic family. He attended the local parochial school and then enrolled in St. Mary's College (Kansas), a Jesuit center, and completed two years of college. He learned shorthand and typing when working for the Associated Press. He transferred and completed college at The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, earning a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees, following acceptance of his thesis on animal research. He entered Georgetown Medical College and earned his MD in 1920. His first medical residency was at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and then, in 1924, he began his second residency in psychiatry in Baltimore, Maryland, under Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist). During this period, he published his first paper, \\"Decerebrate Rigidity of the Sloth\\", in 1926. He returned to Detroit in 1926 to begin his private psychiatric practice. In 1930, he began psychoanalytic training in Chicago, and in 1938, he became a training analyst. He was the first psychoanalyst in Detroit and helped to found the Detroit Psychoanalytic Society in 1940. He was president of the Society from 1940 to 1946. In 1945, during World War II, he was Chairman of a Commission to study combat exhaustion in Europe, and served as a consultant to the U.S. Army Surgeon General. After 1944, he was an associate professor at Wayne State University Medical School (1946-1950), director of the Veterans Psychiatric Clinic at the Harper Hospital (1946-1950), and the first visiting professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan (1950-1954). In 1954, Bartemeier moved to Baltimore to head Seton Hospital, a private mental hospital, where he practiced until 1980. Bartemeier‚Äôs professional life was filled with teaching and professional activities. He actively worked with the American Psychoanalytic Association (president, 1944-1945); director of the professional staff at the Haven Sanitarium (1942-1954); and director of professional education at the Pontiac State Hospital (1949-1954). In 1952, when the American Medical Association established a Council on Mental Health, he was its first chairman. He was Chairman of the Joint Commission of Mental Health in the 1950s. The U.S. Congress authorized the Joint Commission to make recommendations to improve mental health programs. The Commission‚Äôs recommendations resulted in legislation. He was secretary and president of the American Psychiatric Association (1951-1952). He was president of the Group for Psychiatry; a founder and president of the Detroit Psychoanalytic Institute; president of the American Psychoanalytic Society; and president of the International Psychoanalytic Association, an office he accepted after consultation with Pope Pius XII. At the request of the World Health Organization (WHO), he traveled to Ireland to consult on mental health programs for children which led to the establishment of the first child guidance clinic in Ireland. He helped found the Cornelian Corner to promote child-mother interactions. His consultant and committee appointments included the National Institute of Mental Health and the Veterans Administration Advisory Committee. Bartemeier received honors during his career including a Doctor of Science degree from Georgetown University and the John Carrick Medal of Honor.

Magnus is known for his color lithographs of city views, song sheets, maps and patriotic illustrations for stationery and covers during the American Civil War. Envelope illustration published by Charles Magnus Charles Magnus' map, named \\"The Army of Liberty\\" from 1863, showing the U.S. and a historical image of Washington used to promote a civil war song for Northern soldiers Early history Charles Magnus was born Julian Carl Magnus in Elberfeldt, Germany in 1826. His early career in Germany included sales for a silk firm. His family emigrated to New York City in the late 1840s presumably as a result of their opposition to Emperor Frederick William IV. He and his brother Carl Emil founded the weekly German-language newspaper \\"Deutsche Schnellposte,\\" which was later sold. He married Christina Koerner, a native of Munich, Germany, in 1854. They had at least four children. Lithographic Work After \\"Schnellposte\\" was sold, Magnus entered the publishing business as a mapmaker. :During the Civil War, he made a specialty of maps of the battlefields, with pictures made on the battlefields printed on the margins. He visited the scenes of many battles in order to secure these pictures. He was one of the very few persons to whom passes were issued giving permission to visit ALL the Union Camps. Bird's-eye views of North American cities, issued in large folio sizes, became popular in the mid- nineteenth century. Publishers, such as Charles Magnus, recognized a market for smaller octavo sized views, issued both as prints for framing and as illustrations on stationery. He employed lithographic transfers from engraved plates. Some were hand-colored. Magnus best-known and most extensive work is in the illustration of Civil War patriotic covers. His covers are among the most popular among collectors because of their print quality, \\"achieved by the utilization of steel, copper, and stone engraved plates and the old-world workmanship applied in hand or stencil coloring processes\\" :Magnus' color selection also deserves mention. Single color printings include bronze, silver, black and other, not commonly used colors. Multicolor printings were done by hand or by stencil. In using the stencil process, a color composition model was placed in front of his employees, each working with one color only. The more elaborate envelopes often were hand-colored by Magnus himself. Magnus was a good colorist. Color tones achieved by him were invariably rich and brilliant, thanks to his ability to exploit the full potential of his top quality permanent inks. Magnus was not an original designer. He adapted designs from a variety of published items, including bank notes, and rarely needed to credit an artist. For every design, he created many variations. :Magnus' Civil War patriotic designs run the gamut from portraits of Washington and Lincoln to flags, females, and shields. They include a birds' eye view of Alexandria, Va. (as made from a map), numerous views of Civil War camps and scenes, hospitals, U.S. cities, battle scenes, naval scenes, eagles, states, battle campaign maps, and the famous Roses of Washington. :Altogether, Magnus produced about 1,000 varieties of printing, as compared to about 7,500 produced by the then most popular Currier and Ives. While Currier's work represented substantial artistic creation, Magnus' excels with his superior printing technique.

With the eventual failure of the royalists to retake the city, Republicans won a de facto tactical victory in the war, retaining the seat of power, and gradually winning international recognition as a legitimate North Yemen government. Background On November 5, North Yemeni dissidents, supported by Republican tribesmen called down to Sana'a, moved four tanks into the city's dusty squares, took over the Presidential Palace and announced over the government radio station that Sallal had been removed \\"from all positions of authority\\". The coup went unopposed. In Baghdad, Sallal asked for political asylum, saying \\"every revolutionary must anticipate obstacles and difficult situations\\". The new republican government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The Prime Minister was Mohsin Ahmad al-Aini. Noman, however, remained in Beirut. He was doubtful of his colleagues reluctance to negotiate with the Hamidaddin family, preferring to expel it instead. On November 23, he resigned, and his place was taken by Hassan Amri.Schmidt (1968), p. 294 Siege Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs \\"We have money, and you will have your share if you join us. If not, we will go on without you\\". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as \\"the Fighting Rifles\\" surrounded Sana'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Soviet supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists. Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum: \\"Surrender the city or be annihilated\\". Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called \\"a medical checkup\\". Foreign Minister Hassan Macky also left Yemen, leaving the government in charge of Amri. Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units \\"to defend the republic\\". In Liberation Square, six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad, and their bodies were later strung up on poles. The republicans boasted a new air force, while the royalists claimed to have shot down a MiG-17 fighter with a Soviet pilot. The US State Department said that this claim, as well as reports of twenty-four MiGs and forty Soviet technicians and pilots who had arrived in Yemen, were correct. In January, the republicans were defending San'a with about 2,000 regulars and tribesmen, plus armed townsmen and about ten tanks. They also had the backing of a score or more fighter aircraft piloted by Soviet or Yemenis who had passed a crash course in the Soviet Union. The city could still feed itself from the immediately surrounding countryside. Between 4,000 and 5,000 royalists suffered from republican air power, but had the advantage of high ground. However, they did not have enough ammunition, as the Saudis had halted arms deliveries after the Khartoum agreement and stopped financing the royalists after December 1967.Schmidt (1968), pp. 296‚Äì297 By February 1968, the siege was lifted and the Republicans had essentially won the war.Dresch (2000), p. 115 Meanwhile, the British had withdrawn from the Federation of South Arabia, which had now become South Yemen. The royalists remained active until 1970. Talks between the two sides commenced while the fighting went on. The Foreign Minister, Hassan Makki, said \\"Better years of talk than a day of fighting\\". In 1970, Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire was effected. The Saudis gave the republic a grant of $20 million, which was later repeated intermittently, and Yemeni sheikhs received Saudi stipends.Dresch (2000), p. 124 References Category:1967 in North Yemen Category:Battles of the North Yemen Civil War Category:1968 in North Yemen Category:Conflicts in 1967 Category:Conflicts in 1968 Category:20th century in Sana'a ","title":"Siege of Sanaa (1967)"},{"id":"40112937","text":"Jos√© Teodoro Bonfim Queir√≥z, known as Z√© Teodoro (born 22 November 1963 in An√°polis), is a Brazilian football (soccer) manager.

He had a special interest in the heredity of psychiatric and neurologic disease. Early life and education Myerson was born in Lithuania, the son of a Jewish school teacher. His father emigrated to the United States in 1885, and sent for his family in 1886, settling in New Britain, Connecticut. In 1892, the family moved to Boston, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston public schools, graduated from high school in 1898, and then worked for seven years to earn money to attend medical school. He attended the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University for one year and then left for financial reasons. He worked as a street car conductor for a year, and then returned to Columbia for his second year. He transferred to Tufts Medical School in Boston, and graduated in 1908 with a M.D. At Tufts, Myerson was a student of Dr. Morton Prince, and in his later years, Myerson held the chair in neurology which had been Prince‚Äôs. Career as physician He opened his medical office in Boston, and also served as an assistant physician in neurology at Boston City Hospital for two years. He spent six months in the neuropathology laboratory of Dr. Elmer E. Southard at Harvard University. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri for his residency in neurology at the Alexian Brothers Hospital and an instructor in neurology at St. Louis University. He returned to Boston in 1912 to join the first group of residents at the newly opened Boston Psychopathic Hospital. From 1914 to 1918, he served as the clinical director and pathologist at Taunton State Hospital. In 1927, Myerson became director of research at Boston State Hospital. In 1933, the Massachusetts legislature approved the building of a new laboratory for Myerson with funds provided by the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1935, he was appointed professor of clinical psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in recognition of the accomplishments in his research. He was also appointed assistant professor of neurology at Tufts Medical School in 1924, and from 1921 to 1940, he served as the Chair of neurology at Tufts. In 1940, Myerson became Professor Emeritus. During the first decades of the 20th century, the eugenics movement became prominent and widely supported by lay and professional groups. Myerson disagreed with the involuntary sterilization of feeble minded and mentally ill patients. While at Taunton State Hospital, he conducted a study and published his findings in The Inheritance of Mental Disease (1925), which showed that only ten percent of in-patients had a relative who had been confined to the hospital since its opening in 1854. Myerson believed that while there could be a heredity factor involved, social environment also played a major role. =Career as Massachusetts state forensic examiner= Myerson maintained an active practice and served as Massachusetts state forensic examiner for eight years. He testified at the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti. He was a supporter of electric shock therapy and taught its use. He believed in the interdependence of mind and body and a physiological approach in psychiatry and neurology. Myerson introduced ‚Äútotal push‚Äù in treating patients with chronic schizophrenic patients and affected by the regressive and iatrogenic treatment patterns in state mental hospitals. The growth of psychoanalytic practices in the United States interested Myerson. He thought that psychoanalysis led to the examination of human beings more closely and stimulated better research in the areas of biology and physiology. Though he appreciated Sigmund Freud‚Äôs contributions, Myerson opposed psychoanalysis. =Work with professional associations= Myerson was active in professional organizations: the American Psychiatric Association (representative to the National Research Council), the American Neurological Association, the Greater Boston Medical Society, the American Psychopathological Society (president, 1938-1939), the Advisory Council for Research in nervous and mental disease for the U.S. Public Health Service, and director of the Mental Hygiene Society. He published ten books and numerous scholarly research articles. Death and legacy He died in 1948 of heart disease. The Infrequent Blinking Sign in Parkinson's Disease is named after him.

History  In October 2018, St. Mary Medical Center, Saint Francis Healthcare, and the three hospitals of Mercy Health System of Southeastern Pennsylvania, joined together as one regional health system to more closely share resources and clinical expertise. Mercy Health System was founded by the Sisters of Mercy more than 100 years ago in Philadelphia. The Sisters of Mercy were founded in 1831 in Dublin, Ireland by Catherine McAuley, an heiress who used her inheritance to serve the poor, especially women and children. In Catherine's House of Mercy, Sisters of Mercy cared for the poor, sick and uneducated. McAuley founded 12 Mercy convents in Ireland and two in England. Twenty years after McAuley died in 1841, the Sisters of Mercy relocated to Philadelphia where they developed schools and visited the sick. In 1918, Misericordia Hospital, now Mercy Philadelphia, was founded by the Sisters of Mercy. St. Mary Medical Center was founded by the Sisters of St. Francis who opened the Philadelphia-based, St. Mary Hospital in 1860. In 1973, the hospital relocated to Bucks County because of a regional need for health services in the county's most underserved area. And in 1996, the hospital name was changed to St. Mary Medical Center. Saint Francis Healthcare was founded by the Sisters of Saint Francis of Philadelphia in 1924 to serve all who require expert medical care regardless of religion, race, color, creed or economic status. Today, Trinity Health Mid-Atlantic includes five acute care facilities, three Programs for Acute Care of the Elderly (PACE), three home health agencies, physician network and accountable care organization. * Mercy Catholic Medical Center ‚Äì Mercy Fitzgerald Campus, Darby, PA * Mercy Catholic Medical Center ‚Äì Mercy Philadelphia Campus, Philadelphia, PA * Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia PA * Saint Francis Healthcare, Wilmington, DE * St. Mary Medical Center, Langhorne, PA * Mercy LIFE, Saint Francis LIFE and LIFE St. Mary * Mercy Home Health, Saint Francis at Home and St. Mary Home Care * Gateway Health Plan Trinity Health Mid- Atlantic is the largest Catholic healthcare system serving the Greater Philadelphia area and is a member of Trinity Health, a multi-institutional, Catholic health system, sponsored by Catholic Health Ministries.  Mercy Catholic Medical Center ‚Äì Mercy Fitzgerald Campus  Mercy Fitzgerald, part of Trinity Health Mid-Atlantic, is a 204-bed teaching hospital located in Darby, Pa., which offers advanced acute care services in Delaware County and Southwest Philadelphia. In 2015, the hospital admitted 8,834 patients, cared for 41,855 people in the Emergency Department, and saw 166,028 outpatient registrations. Mercy Fitzgerald is home to comprehensive heart and vascular care, cancer care, bariatrics, orthopedics and ambulatory services, advanced diagnostic and interventional radiology, diabetes education, a sleep center, orthopedics, wound care, acute inpatient rehabilitation, physical and occupational therapy. In 2012, a retail pharmacy was opened on Mercy Fitzgerald's campus and the hospital established a Mercy Cancer Center featuring a new Infusion Center. In 2013, a new Endoscopy Center opened with the advanced capabilities to diagnose and treat digestive disorders. The hospital also works collaboratively with first responders and local organizations to be a healing presence in its communities, especially in times of emergencies and disasters. In 2012, it was named the recipient of the Corporate Humanitarian Award from the American Red Cross Southeastern Pennsylvania Chapter. = History = In 1922, local banker and businessman Thomas M. Fitzgerald willed his property and funds to establish a hospital on Lansdowne Avenue in Darby, Pa. Seven years later, May Fitzgerald used $1.25 million from her late husband's trust and worked with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to plan Delaware County's first Catholic hospital. Ground broke in 1932 and a year later, 30,000 people witnessed the dedication of the hospital, known at that time as Fitzgerald Mercy Hospital. To manage hospital operations, the Archdiocese drew upon the vast health care experience of the Sisters of Mercy‚Äîwho had already experienced great success with Misericordia Hospital (now Mercy Philadelphia Hospital) that was established 15 years earlier in West Philadelphia. The Sisters agreed to rent Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital from the Archdiocese for $1 a year. Mercy Fitzgerald was the first to introduce a hospital-administered Home Care Program in 1969, first to open an inpatient psychiatric facility in 1977, and one of the first to provide paramedic services in the early 1980s. In more recent years, the hospital was the first in the County to install the cutting-edge 64-Slice CT scanner and the first in the region to launch photo ID bracelets for patients as part of efforts to improve patient safety.  Mercy Catholic Medical Center ‚Äì Mercy Philadelphia Campus  Mercy Philadelphia (formerly Misericordia Hospital), is a 157-bed community teaching hospital, founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1909,which serves the communities of West Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia. Services include emergency, surgical, cardiac, critical care, oncology, wound care, gastroenterology, mental wellness, physical and occupational rehabilitation, vascular, interventional and diagnostic radiology‚Äîincluding the latest in radiation oncology and diagnostic imaging technology. Its Mercy Cancer Care program is accredited by The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer and is affiliated with the Jefferson Cancer Network. In addition, a partnership with Penn Cardiac Care brought cardiovascular care to the West Philadelphia community. = History = In the summer of 1913, Mother M. Hildegarde, a Sister of Mercy, was asked by Archbishop Prendergast if the Sisters would manage a hospital in West Philadelphia. Since this was something that Reverend Mother Patricia Waldron was most interested in, they accepted. After deliberation and with the approval of His Grace, negotiations were begun for acquiring the lot at 54th Street and Cedar Avenue in West Philadelphia, at a cost of $108,000. Reverend Mother recognized the need of providing a qualified staff to maintain, what she hoped would be called Mercy Hospital. Two sisters were sent to Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and two others to Mercy Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, to become trained nurses. Other sisters were registered at the College of Pharmacy and the Polyclinic Hospital in Philadelphia, for courses in pathology. Mercy Philadelphia opened on July 2, 1918 as Misericordia Hospital. Two days later, the first patient was admitted to the hospital.  Nazareth Hospital  Nazareth Hospital, established in 1940 by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, serves Northeast Philadelphia with 205 acute beds and 28 skilled nursing beds. In 2012, Nazareth expanded the community's access to emergency hip fracture repair and cardiovascular care with its therapeutic hypothermia program. An affiliate of Penn Cardiac Care, Nazareth continued to provide emergency angioplasty for patients suffering heart attacks, as well as heart diagnostics, a state-of-the-art cath lab, a Vein Center and the Center of Wound Healing and Hyperbaric Medicine. Nazareth launched a Balance Program to prevent falls and improve quality of life for people with conditions that place them at risk. = History = To meet the healthcare needs of Northeast Philadelphia, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth prepared to open a hospital, by sending members of the Congregation to train at hospitals throughout the country, and by raising money to build. After six years of preparation, the Sisters founded Nazareth Hospital in 1940. On March 9, Nazareth Hospital opened with 116 beds and at a cost of $800,000‚Äîfinanced solely by the Sisters, their families and friends. Recognizing the necessity of partnering to strengthen the base on which the hospital was founded and of maintaining the Catholic identity of Nazareth Hospital, the Sisters transferred ownership of Nazareth Hospital to the Franciscan Health System on March 1, 1995. In 1996, through the Franciscan Health System, Nazareth Hospital became a member of Catholic Health Initiatives. In 2001, Catholic Health Initiatives transferred ownership of several facilities, Nazareth Hospital among them, to Catholic Health East (CHE). Through this transfer, Nazareth became a member of Mercy Health System, a member of CHE. In 2013 CHE joined together with Trinity Health of Livonia, Mich., to form one Catholic health system.  Mercy LIFE (Living Independence for the Elderly)  Mercy LIFE is a nationally recognized Program of All- inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). Mercy LIFE has provided a community based long-term care program for frail elders who reside in South Philadelphia, since 2001 and began serving North Philadelphia in early 2009. The program serves seniors with a range of health conditions that impact their daily life such as chronic illness, memory loss, difficulty providing personal care such as bathing and dressing, and more. Mercy LIFE also operates Adult Day Centers, which offer a location where the interdisciplinary care team of doctors, nurses, therapists, and social workers can provide preventive healthcare as well as observe and respond to changes in each senior's health. Mercy LIFE's services include primary care and physician specialist services, nursing care, prescribed medications, dental care, mental health services, physical, occupational and speech therapies, along with vision, hearing and foot care. = History = In 1998, the first Mercy LIFE center opened on Columbus Boulevard with just seven participants, a few staff members, and one vehicle to provide transportation. With the need still great in South Philadelphia, a second center was opened in 2005. The program was quickly established as a community asset which motivated seniors to remain active and improve their quality of life, and additional Centers were opened in North Philadelphia and Delaware County.

The episode aired on August 5, 2013. The episode was well received by most critics, with some noting the series's progression, and the revelation of the mini-egg. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 10.42 million viewers and received an 18‚Äì49 rating of 2.6; the ratings drop from the previous episode may have been due to Time Warner Cable temporarily stopping the broadcast of CBS to subscribers over a financial dispute. Plot Julia's (Rachelle Lefevre) friend, Harriet (played by Megan Ketch), touches the dome and goes into labor, so she takes her to the hospital. On their way, they are carjacked by the two Dundee brothers that killed Rose (Beth Broderick), but Barbie (Mike Vogel) arrives and the two flee. Barbie then takes the woman in labor to Alice (Samantha Mathis) to help them. While that's happening, Junior (Alexander Koch) and Big Jim (Dean Norris) argue about Junior disturbing Angie (Britt Robertson) and Jim forces Junior out of his house. Angie then decides to go see Rose and runs into Joe's (Colin Ford) friend Ben (John Elvis) and both fix the diner. Junior goes to the police station and comes with Linda (Natalie Martinez) to find the two murderers. Junior realizes that they are at an abandoned house and gets told by Linda that one of them almost raped Angie. Linda kills one of the brothers during a fight. Junior kills the other for the attempted rape when he tries to surrender after attempting escape. Elsewhere, Ollie (Leon Rippy) threatens Big Jim. Big Jim then checks on the city's stock piled propane but is stopped by an armed thug. At night, while the thug tries to take a truck full of propane, Jim shoots it and it explodes, killing the thug. Joe and Norrie (Mackenzie Lintz) try to find the center of the dome thus finding a second mini-dome that holds a mysterious egg in it. After touching it, Norrie and Joe see her mother Alice and Norrie runs off to find her. Back at Joe's house the baby is born and named Alice out of gratitude for her help. The original Alice then has a heart-attack (due to insuffient insulin, which was hard to get since the dome cut off resources) and dies in Norrie's arms. Joe and Angie reunite, but in the mini-dome, the egg's shell begins to glow. Production Executive producer Neal Baer said with TV Guide regarding questions of the \\"mini-dome,\\" specifically about its powers that \\"[the] question is completely addressed in the last episode of the season. It's so much a part of the next six episodes. We will be speaking to what the dome can and can't do, why it's doing it and for what reasons. The visions are really going to be profound.\\" Reception =Ratings= Ratings for the episode were expected to go down as Time Warner Cable had stopped broadcasting the CBS network over a financial dispute, which had blocked an estimated 3 million subscribers from the network. The episode was watched by 10.42 million American viewers, and received an 18‚Äì49 rating/share of 2.6/7, down considerably from the previous episode. The show tied for first for the night alongside the ninth season finale of The Bachelorette. =Critical reception= The episode was received moderately by most critics. Ashley Knierim of The Huffington Post said regarding the show's course that \\"things are getting really, really weird.\\" Ted Kindig of BuddyTV commented positively on Big Jim's role in the episode, saying \\"Dean Norris' snarling councilman has a pretty good night overall: while the rest of the episode gets tangled up in its weaker, soapier elements, Big Jim emerges as a pretty credible anti-hero.\\" Zach Dionne of Vulture gave the episode a 5 out of 5 rating, saying \\"This episode isn‚Äôt exempt from the things that make Under the Dome problematic, but it‚Äôs the strongest, most captivating hour since the pilot. Eschewing the trusty Dilemma of the Week format, ‚ÄúImperfect Circles‚Äù capably carries several stories at once. The characters are still primarily plot-delivery systems, but they‚Äôre starting to feel more like actual people we might become interested in spending time with. And now we know the show is capable of treating death poignantly rather than just mercilessly.\\" Andrea Reiher of Zap2it commented on the series' gradual progression, specifically on the meaning of the dome, saying \\"\\"Imperfect Circles\\" seems to have introduced the idea that the dome is perhaps a giant protective bubble for an egg of some sort. It's almost an incubator inside of an incubator. At this point, it's anybody's guess where exactly the egg came from and what exactly it is, but we're thinking aliens. Anybody else? Either way, this episode marks the halfway point of the season. And it continued last week's theme of the dome as sentient being, as it made important loved ones appear to people who touched the dome‚Äîfirst for pregnant Harriet and then for Norrie when her mother's health goes sharply downhill.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly compared the episode to the first season episode of Lost \\"All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues,\\" saying \\"this episode ties in nicely with the episode in the geographic center of Lost‚Äòs first season, wherein Locke and Boone took a stroll in the woods and discovered the Hatch. Last night, two Dome characters took a similar stroll in the woods‚Ä¶and found another mysterious thing that seems guaranteed to dominate the back half of this season.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com gave the ending of the episode a mixed review, saying the ending montage was \\"cheesy and nothing extraordinary, but dammit, it's the closest thing this show has ever had to a soul and I'd just like to point that out. And in the final shot, the Purple Egg of Mystery inside the Mini-Dome began to light up. This is what Under the Dome should be like all the time! I mean, I get a kick out of the terrible cornball stick-Angie-in-a-bunker-for-four-episodes Under the Dome, but if this show wants to be taken seriously and be somebody, then it's going to need more of this.\\" Adam Newland of TV Equals gave the episode a negative review, saying \\"One week after the show put together some competent drama, Under the Dome was back to business as usual. While last week‚Äôs episode ended in the one the more mind-numbing contrivances dome-based TV history, at least the episode told a worthwhile story with real stakes. Quickly realizing their mistake, the show decided to vault in as far in the opposite direction as possible with tonight‚Äôs episode. What resulted was a mostly pointless hour of television that made me long for the good old days with Duke‚Äôs house fire.\\" References Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Pregnancy- themed television episodes Category:Under the Dome episodes Category:Television episodes directed by Miguel Sapochnik ","title":"Imperfect Circles"},{"id":"40113114","text":"Fareed Parbati (), born Ghulam Nabi Bhat () on 4 August 1961 died 14 December 2011, was an Indian Urdu language poet and writer from Jammu and Kashmir, India.

The main activities are concentrated in Germany, Portugal and in the United Kingdom. The company sells developed facilities or takes the ownership. Energiekontor manages external wind farms for clients as well. Wind turbine of a German wind farm developed by Energiekontor  Achievements and market presence  Until May 2018, Energiekontor had built 118 wind farms with a total rated power of nearly 940 MW. The electricity generated by this facilities amounts to ca. 2 billion kWh per year which comes up to the demand of more than 600,000 households. The capital invested totals more than ‚Ç¨1.6 billion. Energiekontor itself owns and operates 34 wind farms and one solar park with a total rated power of nearly 259 MW in Germany, Portugal and in the UK (end of 2017). In addition to its headquarters in Bremen, the company has five offices in West, North and East Germany. Branch offices were established in Leeds (England), Glasgow (Scotland), Lisbon (Portugal), Nijmegen (Netherlands), Austin/Texas (US) and Toulouse (France).  Innovation  Energiekontor also develops new technologies and methods to improve efficiency and reliability of wind power facilities. Particular importance has got the Rotor Blade Extension (RBE) presented in 2009 together with the University of Bremerhaven. By increasing the rotor diameter with an additional modular segment that is applied over the blade tip, yield grows significantly. The extension modules for two AN Bonus turbines (1.0 and 1.3 MW) are specified with an Annual Energy Production (AEP) increase of 5 to 7 %. Energiekontor indicates a payback period of three years and recommends the solution as an alternative to repowering especially in countries with limited grid access. In December 2016, the company announced a new prototype for GE 1.5sl turbines (1.5 MW) with an expected AEP increase of around 9.5 %.  History  Energiekontor was founded in 1990 by Bodo Wilkens and G√ºnter Lammers on the basis of the German Electricity Feed-in Act, a precursor of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). The first two wind farms, located in Lower Saxony, were built in 1994. In 2000, Energiekontor had a track record of around 200 MW and went public. In 2005, the first wind farm in UK was taken into operation. Beginning in the late 1990s, Energiekontor also developed two offshore wind farms in the German North Sea. Borkum Riffgrund West was approved in 2004, Nordergr√ºnde in 2007. The rights for these projects were sold between 2011 and 2014 to Dong Energy and . Thereby, the company carried out its pull back from all offshore activities. In 2010, Energiekontor started to develop solar parks with photovoltaic panels. In 2016, the company entered the Dutch market. In 2017, further market entries followed in France and in the US.

Asher served as the Mayor of Daytona Beach, Florida, for eight years from 1995 until 2003. Before becoming mayor, Asher was elected as a Daytona Beach City Commissioner in 1983, a position he held for twelve years from 1983 to 1995. Biography =Early life= Asher was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 27, 1925, to Baron Hirsch Asher and Erna Fromme. He graduated from the new defunct Tech High in Atlanta. He enlisted with the U.S. Navy in 1943 during World War II, serving on board the USS Bunker Hill and USS Bennington, which were part of a larger torpedo squadron in the Pacific Theater. He saw action at campaigns and battles in the Philippines, Iwo Jima, Guam, Palau, Formosa (Taiwan) and Okinawa. Asher received two Air Medals, as well as theater ribbons and unit citations, for his service in the Navy during the war. He initially attended the University of Tennessee after the war, but transferred to the University of Georgia, where he earned both his bachelor's degree and law degrees. (He later served as the secretary of the Georgia Bulldog Club, the university's Athletic Association fundraising arm). Career Asher practiced law in Atlanta until 1954, when he moved to Florida to accept a position as the assistant football coach for Stetson University. He would later become a hotelier and business owner in Daytona Beach. Asher owned and operated a string of nightclubs, businesses and hotels in the city, including the Safari Beach Motel. During the early 1960s, the city of Fort Lauderdale, located more than 200 miles south of Daytona Beach, became a popular Spring Break destination with American college students. However, due to the large number of students, relations between the thousands of college students and Fort Lauderdale became strained. Asher, along with other Daytona Beach business and political leaders, began a campaign to attract some of Fort Lauderdale's spring breakers to Daytona. in 1962, Asher and other area businessmen began driving to colleges, where they distributed postcards, brochures and other materials promoting Daytona Beach as a Spring Break destination. They also hired airplanes, which dropped ping-pong balls advertising Daytona Beach onto college campuses, a tradition which is still practiced by spring breakers in the city today. Each of the ping-pong balls were inscribed with \\"Get on the Ball and Come to Daytona Beach.\\" The campaign succeeded in transforming Daytona Beach into a major Spring Break destination. Asher did have detractors and critics, who accused him of promoting Daytona Beach as a \\"\\"beer-can mentality\\" destination for college students, rather than promoting the city as a place for family friendly vacationers. However, Asher's efforts earned him the nickname, \\"Father of Spring Break,\\" within Daytona Beach. =Political career= Asher served as a district judge in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, for two years. In 1983, he was elected a city commissioner representing District 2, an office he held for the next twelve years, from 1983 to 1995. Bud Asher was first elected Mayor of Daytona Beach in 1995. Asher's predecessor, incumbent Paul Carpenella, who served as mayor from 1993 to 1995, failed to gain enough votes in the primary to advance to the mayoral general election. Asher raised more than $60,000 for his first mayoral campaign. Asher defeated his 1995 general election challenger, former city Public Works Director Tom McClelland, by approximately 600 votes in the municipal election. He was sworn into office on November 7, 1995. He was re-elected in 1997, 1999, and 2001, before retiring from office in 2003. Football Asher continued to work in football for more than sixty years, while simultaneously remaining in business and politics. He coached football for high schools in Volusia County, including New Smyrna Beach High School, Spruce Creek High School and Father Lopez Catholic High School, as well as the Daytona Beach Bulldogs for the midget league. He was also involved with Bethune-Cookman University for more than 40 years as the university's football coach, as well as a consultant adviser to several of BCU's presidents. He also coached the Jacksonville Sharks of the defunct World Football League and the Daytona Beach ThunderBirds, a semi-pro team. He scouted potential players for both the NFL and college football programs for more than 30 years. He specifically worked as an NFL talent scout for the San Diego Chargers, Cincinnati Bengals and the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Florida Athletic Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2000. He called games as a commentator and sports announcer on WNDB 1150 for the last two years of his life. Bud Asher died from prostate cancer at his home on the Halifax River in Daytona Beach at 9 PM on July 5, 2013, at the age of 88. He was survived by his wife of 27 years, Dawn Ioviero Asher; his children from his previous marriage, Marybeth Asher-Lawson and Baron \\"Ron\\" Asher; his stepdaughter, Wendy Fiore Bentley; and five grandchildren.

Built in 1933 in the Art Deco style for a local entertainment magnate who opened one of Brighton's first cinemas many years earlier, it was the first and most important expansion of the Astoria brand outside London. It initially struggled against the town's other \\"super- cinemas\\", but enjoyed a period of success in the 1950s and 1960s before rapid decline set in, culminating in its closure in 1977. About 20 years of use as a bingo hall followed, but the building‚Äîwhose clean lines give \\"a sense of spacious grandeur\\" in a prominent city-centre site‚Äîstood empty from the late 20th century and passed through several owners. Permission was granted in 2012 for its demolition and replacement with an energy-efficient business centre designed by Conran and Partners, but several alternative plans were submitted subsequently and the building still stood until April 2018, when demolition work started. English Heritage listed the building at Grade II in 2000 for its architectural and historical importance. History =1933‚Äì1977: Cinema= Brighton and neighbouring Hove hold an important place in the early history of British cinema. Pioneering cinematographers who lived and worked in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included William Friese-Greene, George Albert Smith (who founded one of the world's first film studios at St Ann's Well Gardens in Hove) and Esm√© Collings. Public performances of films were given at Hove Town Hall from 1895 and at a hall in Brighton from the following year. By 1910, two purpose-built cinemas existed; one, the Duke of York's Picture House, is still in use and is the oldest operational cinema in England. During the 1920s and 1930s, larger and larger cinemas were built as demand increased; an early \\"super cinema\\" was the Regent Cinema (1921), and the 2,500-seat Savoy followed in 1930. The Astoria chain was well established in London by the early 1930s. Cinemas and theatres of that name were built in Brixton (now the Brixton Academy), Finsbury Park, Charing Cross Road, Old Kent Road and Streatham. All were designed by Edward Albert Stone. The brand was soon extended to seaside resorts across southeast England at the initiative of a group of businessmen led by E.E. Lyons. (\\"Teddy\\" Lyons had opened one of Brighton's earliest cinemas, the Academy, in 1911 and was well known in the town's entertainment scene.) The group, which also included Sussex Daily News proprietor J.H. Infield (who served as chairman of the Academy Cinema until 1926), had identified a site in 1932 when they planned to open a cinema under the Plaza brand. This did not happen, but in 1933 the consortium commissioned Edward Stone to build a \\"super cinema\\" under the Astoria name there. The site was on Gloucester Place, north of Old Steine, and a number of houses from the Georgian and Victorian eras were knocked down to make way. Work began on 17 July 1933 on the 1,823-seat building, which was designed as a combined theatre and cinema with a full stage and dressing rooms. Thursday 21 December 1933 was the opening night; Cooper Rawson and Margaret Hardy, respectively Brighton's Member of Parliament and Mayor, made the inaugural speeches. These were followed by a Movietone News newsreel, features by Path√© and Disney (Santa's Workshop) and the main film‚ÄîThe Private Life of Henry VIII starring Charles Laughton. Lyons died in August 1934, having overseen the openings of new Astorias at Cliftonville and Purley and an ultimately abortive scheme in Worthing, another seaside resort near Brighton. In February 1935 the Brighton Astoria passed from independent ownership into the portfolio of ABC Cinemas, who had operated the Savoy in East Street since 1930. Initially it was one of Brighton's three main cinemas: along with the Savoy and the Regent, it had access to the best films. In 1937, though, the Odeon opened on West Street and took the Astoria's place among the elite; thereafter it was relegated to \\"B-circuit\\" status in ABC's portfolio, meaning it missed out on the most attractive films and could only book those which were not popular enough for the \\"A-circuit\\". It began to struggle: by 1939, schemes such as large price cuts and appearances by film stars were used to try to boost attendances. In August of that year, for example, Gene Autry was brought down to Brighton on a train and made a personal appearance, and Tod Slaughter visited for every showing of The Face at the Window, in which he starred. The following year, though, it secured the rights to Gone with the Wind, \\"the most eagerly awaited film in a decade\\", and was able to charge higher prices. Because of conditions imposed by the film's distributor, the Astoria was one of the few cinemas outside London to show it on its first run. Cinemas in Brighton and elsewhere faced various difficulties in the 1950s. Television became popular, many cinema managers faced pay cuts, greater restrictions were placed on children visiting cinemas, and government regulations forced cinema buildings to be adapted to incorporate separate film-rewinding rooms if they wanted to show films recorded on older nitrocellulose film stock, which was flammable. Specific local problems included a smallpox epidemic which forced public buildings to close for several months, and the opening in 1953 of a popular \\"public television theatre\\" near the West Pier, which opened daily and showed television broadcasts on a large screen. Many cinemas in Brighton were forced to close. The Astoria initially carved out a niche by becoming the local centre for 3D films during the \\"golden era\\" of that technology. A special screen was fitted, and films such as House of Wax, Sangaree, The Maze and Kiss Me Kate had successful runs. Then in 1958 a major renovation took place with the aim of establishing the cinema as \\"a roadshow house for [showing] extended runs outside London's West End\\". The little used theatre facility was removed completely and the building became a dedicated cinema. A new, larger screen was erected in front of the proscenium, the Compton organ was taken out, the balconies were altered and some space was used to house a new projector, and the auditorium was hidden behind curtains. The changes, which cost ¬£20,000 (¬£ as of )) and reduced the capacity to 1,200, were completed during the summer, and on 2 August 1958 the Astoria reopened with a five-month run of South Pacific. No film had ever had such a long run in Brighton, and the cinema had further success with Gigi (1959), The Nun's Story (1959‚Äì60), Ben-Hur (1961) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Also, for several years until 1962, no other cinema in Sussex was able to show films recorded on 70 mm stock, so the Astoria dominated this market locally. The 1960s was \\"the Astoria's finest decade\\". The succession of long runs of popular films continued with an eight- month showing of The Sound of Music (1965), an 11-month run of Doctor Zhivago (this opened on 23 June 1966, making it the first cinema outside London's West End to show the film) and a very early screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). During this period the Astoria was the main rival to the Regent in terms of prestige and popularity. Decline quickly set in during the 1970s, though. ABC focused its attention on the larger Savoy, which it rebranded with the ABC name in 1961. It received all the best films at the expense of the Astoria, and also supported longer runs. Nevertheless, its 2,500 capacity was excessive at a time when audiences were falling rapidly, and in 1975 it was closed for a year to be converted into four separate cinemas. During this time, the Astoria briefly regained its position of importance, and ABC's \\"A-circuit\\" films were shown. Another innovation was the use of Sensurround for the three-month screening of Earthquake in summer 1975. When the former Savoy reopened in 1976, though, the Astoria \\"was relegated to a small afterthought in joint press advertising\\". The last film, A Star is Born, ran from 31 March to 7 May 1977. =1977‚Äì2007: Bingo, closure and dereliction= Seen in March 2o13, the fa√ßade was boarded up and decorated with murals. Entertainment company EMI bought the Astoria in 1976 and were granted a bingo licence. They carried out extensive works at a cost of ¬£150,000 (¬£ as of )) to convert the building into a 1,000-capacity bingo hall: the stepped interior was flattened, the screen and projection equipment were removed and new furniture was put in. Less than two months after it closed as a cinema, the Astoria reopened in its new guise. By the 1980s it operated under the Coral Bingo brand, which changed to Gala Bingo in the 1990s. In 1997, Gala Coral Group built a new bingo hall at Eastern Road in the Kemptown area of Brighton, and the Astoria closed again. In 1998, Bass Leisure Group submitted a plan to convert the building into a horror-themed nightclub; although planning permission was granted, the proposal foundered because a drinks licence was refused. Three years later, three members of Stomp, a Brighton-based percussion group, bought the Astoria for ¬£1.1 million. They planned to spend up to ¬£6 million renovating it and turning it into a concert and cabaret venue, but no work was carried out. Local businessman Mike Holland then bought the building for ¬£2.2m in 2007. He owns several heritage buildings in the city, such as the Grade II*-listed British Engineerium in Hove‚Äîan 1860s water pumping station which had been turned into an industrial museum but which was threatened with demolition until he bought it for ¬£1.25m in 2006 and restored it. The Astoria has remained disused since he purchased it; it was put back on sale in March 2008 and is still empty as of . As part of a council-sponsored scheme to improve the visual appeal of empty buildings in the city, a local artist was commissioned in June 2010 to paint Art Deco-style murals on the Astoria's fa√ßade. Sussex landmarks such as Embassy Court, Shoreham Airport and the Seven Sisters cliffs, as well as the Astoria itself, were painted on the walls in a \\"1930s poster\\" style. The building was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 22 November 2000. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". , it was one of 1,124 Grade II- listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. =Demolition and planned redevelopment= Seen from the northeast in March 2013, the fa√ßade retains its and signage. Demolition work was underway in May 2018. An initial threat to demolish the Astoria and redevelop the site for housing was averted when the building was listed in 2000, prior to its purchase by members of Stomp. New proposals to demolish the building first came to light in August 2010, when developers Conran and Partners (acting as agents for Holland) organised a meeting with Brighton and Hove City Council to discuss a planning application they intended to submit. They proposed to replace the Astoria with a six-storey business centre. The planning application was lodged in December 2010. To justify the demolition of the Grade II-listed building (a status defined by English Heritage as having \\"national importance\\" and \\"special interest\\"), H3O Media Ltd‚Äîthe company who would occupy and run the business centre‚Äîcommissioned a surveyor to prepare a heritage report. This stated that the granting of listed status by English Heritage was \\"questionable\\" because the building was not unique to the area, and noted that many 1930s features had deteriorated or been removed‚Äîespecially since 2000, when Grade II status was granted. Holland stated that the building had \\"had its day\\" and had declined to an irreparable state. Although a decision on the planning application was originally expected in March 2011, it was not until September that year that the city council's planning committee authorised the Astoria's demolition. Furthermore, approval had to be given by Eric Pickles : as the Government's Communities Secretary, he made the final decision on all requests to demolish listed buildings. He gave consent in January 2012. The report considered by the council committee stated that at least ¬£3.5 million would have to be spent on refurbishment, no suitable plans or schemes had been submitted by any person or organisation, and the building was \\"genuinely redundant\\". The proposed development was described as a business centre and \\"media hub\\" with offices, community meeting facilities, a caf√©, roof terrace and gardens. The developers stated that it would support about 170 jobs, encourage regeneration of the London Road/Valley Gardens area and provide the focus for a \\"creative caf√© culture\\". Units aimed at startup companies would be included. Conran and Partners incorporated energy-saving schemes such as passive solar heating and rainwater harvesting into their design. English Heritage agreed with the surveyor that the building's historic interest had been reduced and that its dilapidated condition had made renovation unviable; restoration would have cost ¬£3.5m according to the developer's estimates. Local community groups agreed with the proposal because of concerns that squatters would occupy the building if it continued to stand empty. A revised planning application was submitted in December 2013. Although several elements remained the same, such as office accommodation, community facilities and a caf√©/restaurant, the developers now included six flats in their proposal. These would be built at the top of the complex, which would rise to six storeys at the front and three storeys to the rear. No car parking would be provided, but bicycle parking was included in the new design. The city council was expected to decide on the application in March 2014, and in that month granted approval which remained valid ; but in December 2014 Holland sold the building to Unicity, part of Knightsbridge Student Housing. This company submitted a new planning application in May 2015 in respect of a building consisting of 73 privately rented flats, offices and community space. The proposed housing density was significantly greater than that for which permission was granted in 2014. This scheme was permitted on appeal; but the building was subsequently sold on again to a company called Ktesius. Their plan for 70 luxury flats called Brighton Rox was granted approval in January 2017. The new development will cover about and will include shop and office units at ground-floor level and six storeys of flats above, with between one and four bedrooms. Cove Burgess Architects were commissioned to design Brighton Rox; it was stated in October 2017 that the building would be completed at the end of 2019. Demolition of the Astoria began in April 2018. Location and assessment Although Gloucester Place was laid out in the early 1800s, all of its buildings are now 20th-century. A 1980s office block (Trustcard House) adjoins the site of the Astoria on the south side; a flint and brick Baptist church of 1903 by George Baines stands to the north; and other nearby buildings include the elaborate Tudor Revival King and Queen pub and the Neo-Georgian Allied Irish Bank branch, both built in the 1930s and Grade II-listed. St Peter's Church, the landmark former parish church of Brighton, is also nearby. With its 1,800-capacity auditorium, the Astoria was the largest cinema on the south coast of England and was classed as a \\"super-cinema\\". The Astoria chain, previously associated with London, expanded across several English seaside resorts; Brighton's was planned as the flagship. In assessing its importance, English Heritage also noted it was \\"the principal survivor\\" of the Astorias outside London. The Astoria stood within the Valley Gardens Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. This was designated by Brighton Council in 1973 and covers . The council's Conservation Area Study, published in September 1995, noted that it was the only remaining 1930s building in the immediate area. In contrast to more modern buildings such as Trustcard House, Lombard House and (on the opposite side of Valley Gardens) new houses and the University of Brighton's Art, Design and Humanities premises on Grand Parade, the Astoria \\"[was] much more appropriate in scale and respects the traditional vertical plot emphasis\\" of the older surrounding buildings. Architecture and fittings This original Art Deco-style sign (pictured in August 2013) survived on the exterior. A souvenir brochure produced for the opening night contained details of all companies and contractors involved in building and fitting out the Astoria. Edward Albert Stone was the architect, Griggs & Son Ltd of Westminster were the main building contractors, Major C.H. Bell acted as consultant engineer and local firm H. Lasenby Bros. were contracted to demolish and clear the site. The main concrete structure of the building was supplied by British Reinforced Concrete Engineering Co. Ltd of Stafford. The cast stone fa√ßade was produced by the Patent Impervious Stone and Construction Co Ltd of Leyton. Another London firm, Dawnay & Sons Ltd, provided the steelwork, but the brickwork was produced locally by the Sussex Brick Co. Ltd of Horsham. Tiling company Ramsdens of Westminster were responsible for the terrazzo floors and wall decoration, and the plasterwork was by H.E. Gaze Ltd of London. Two other London firms, the Carrier Engineering Co. Ltd and Berkeley Electrical Engineering Co. Ltd, respectively supplied ventilation and heating equipment and installed the electric systems and lighting. Furnishings were by W.W. Turner & Co. Ltd of Birmingham, and Henri & Laverdet Ltd (the firm of Marc- Henri Levy and Gaston Laverdet) were the interior designers. The John Compton Organ Co. of Acton installed the organ. Several other national and local firms supplied other products and services, from projectors to ticket machines. Edward Stone was regarded as \\"a specialist theatre and cinema architect\\". He designed the Astoria in a French Art Deco style‚Äîsimilar to, but a \\"larger and more elaborate example\\" of, his Grade II-listed Whitehall Theatre in London. The walls were of brick with faience decoration and a fa√ßade of pale stone blocks, hiding a steel frame and topped by a flat roof. The \\"handsome\\" fa√ßade was wide and was simply detailed, \\"avoiding gratuitous decoration\\" and instead \\"[relying] mainly on proportion to achieve a sense of spacious grandeur\\". It was in two parts: to the left (south), a slightly recessed ten-bay section with a strong horizontal emphasis, consisting of shop units (latterly boarded up) at ground-floor level, a tea-room above and offices on the top floor. Straight-headed casement windows with metal grilles lit this section. To the right (north) was the projecting entrance section which in contrast has a vertical emphasis: above the entrance canopy and modern double entrance door, three tall straight-headed windows at first-floor level were joined to tall arched windows above by fluted pilasters. The second-floor windows were set into moulded recesses with keystones. Above these, a slightly recessed panel bore the name in projecting letters. The \\"spectacular Art Deco interior\\" was luxurious but simple, again avoiding extravagant decoration. The original stage, dressing rooms, balconies and fly tower were behind the shops and offices of the south range; the auditorium was behind the entrance to the north. Moulded plasterwork, friezes and reliefs featured extensively. Gold and rose were the main colours used, and some textured Marb-l-Cote material survived until demolition. Cultural references The fa√ßade of the derelict Astoria theatre features on the front cover of Brighton Darkness, a book of short stories by Brighton-based writer John Roman Baker. One of the stories, \\"Place of Dreams\\", takes place in the theatre in 1958 when it was a cinema. It features two adolescent boys, Nick and Gregg, who attend a screening of Invasion of the Saucer Men (also known as Invasion of the Hell Creatures). An epilogue at the end of the story laments the theatre's dereliction and anticipates the arrival of the real Hell Creatures: the property developers who will arrive to demolish the place of dreams.

Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the Allied side, administered by the Belgian government in exile. Economically, the Congo provided much- needed raw materials such as copper and rubber to the United Kingdom and the United States. Uranium from the colony was used to produce the first atomic bombs. At the same time, a large supply of the territory's industrial diamonds were smuggled to Nazi Germany with the complicity of Belgian business executives. The Congo also financially supported the Belgian government in exile. Militarily, Congolese troops of the Force Publique fought alongside British forces in the East African Campaign, and a Congolese medical unit served in Madagascar and in the Burma Campaign. Congolese formations also acted as garrisons in Egypt, Nigeria and Palestine. The increasing demands placed on the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots and other forms of resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to be of interest to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Background Pierre Ryckmans, in L√©opoldville in 1938. Following World War I, Belgium possessed two colonies in Africa: the Belgian Congo, which it had controlled since its annexation of the Congo Free State in 1908, and Ruanda-Urundi, a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations. The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time. The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The Great Depression led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment. The only industry that expanded during the time period was centered around cotton production. The Belgian government followed a policy of neutrality during the interwar years. Nazi Germany invaded Belgium on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, the Belgian Army surrendered and the country was occupied by German forces. King Leopold III, who had surrendered to the Germans, was kept a prisoner for the rest of the war. Just before the fall of Belgium, its government, including the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, fled to Bordeaux in France.  Entry of the Congo into the war  On 10 May 1940 Belgian officials formally requested that the United Kingdom and France declare their respect for the Congo's neutrality and support for its territorial integrity in a future peace settlement. The British government refused, wanting to ensure that the Congo would not fall under German control, and France followed suit. The French government briefly considered sending troops to occupy L√©opoldville, the Congolese capital. On the day of the Belgian Army's surrender, the British government, uncertain about what would happen to the territory, held a crisis meeting in London. The Admiralty proposed sending troops to occupy strategic locations in the Congo, but this was quickly ruled unfeasible due to other military commitments. The British government then resolved that if the Belgian government collapsed, it would support an \\"independent\\" Congo. Within the Congo itself, opinion was divided on whether or not to continue to support the war. Belgian corporate officials hoped that the colony would take a neutral stance, and the staff of the Force Publique, the colonial army, recommended a declaration of neutrality or even independence under the authority of the Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans. Ryckmans refused to take this advice, and declared on the day of the Belgian Army's surrender that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies. Despite this assurance, disruption broke out in the city of Stanleyville (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future of the colony and the threat of an Italian invasion. On 17 June France declared an armistice with Germany. Though Ryckmans had declared that he would continue to support the Allied cause, the Belgian government in Bordeaux was deeply disheartened by the French surrender. Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot believed that it lacked the resources to continue to fight and thus it would be better to negotiate a peace with Germany instead of going into exile in the United Kingdom. Most of the ministers agreed, though de Vleeschauwer dissented. While the government prepared to negotiate with Germany, representatives of various Belgo-Congolese companies in Bordeaux informed the ministers of rumours that should Belgium surrender, the United Kingdom would seize control of the Congo. Meanwhile, some circles in occupied Belgium feared that if the Congo aligned itself with the Allies it would be permanently lost as a colony to Belgium. In Brussels, the Germans established a \\"Kolonial Politisches B√ºro\\" that attempted to forge connections with what remained of the Ministry of Colonies. The British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which the Congo could produce in abundance. On 20 June the British Foreign Secretary told the Belgian ambassador in London that the United Kingdom would not accept German dominance over the colony. Meanwhile, the Belgo-Congolese businessmen proposed that de Vleeschauwer go to London to ensure that Belgian sovereignty over the Congo would be respected. Pierlot suggested that de Vleeschauwer should be granted the new title of Administrator-general of the Congo, allowing him to pursue this cause even if the government later collapsed and his ministerial mandate became void. The government agreed to the idea, and on 18 June it passed a law-decree, granting de Vleeschauwer the title and conferring on him full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo. The decree also stipulated that in the event the administrator-general was unable to exercise his duties, the responsibility would be passed on to the governor-general. De Vleeschauwer departed for London, arriving on 4 July. He spoke with members of the British government and assured them that he would place all of the Congo's raw materials at the disposal of the United Kingdom's war effort. Over the following months Pierlot and two other ministers managed to reach London while the rest declared their intention to remain in France and resign. In October Pierlot, de Vleeschauwer, and the two other ministers officially established the Belgian government in exile, recognised by the United Kingdom. Despite his presence, de Vleeschauwer was politically marginalised by Finance Minister Camille Gutt and played little role thereafter in the government. There was also conflict between de Vleeschauwer, who wanted to assure his own authority over the Congo, and Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak who sought to be more conciliatory with regard to Allied influence in the colony. The Germans were upset by the Congo's support for the Allies, and threatened to apply sanctions to Belgian colonial enterprises. Leopold III expressed his discontent with Ryckman's decisions, believing that the colony should remain neutral. Royalist politicians sent messages to the Belgian authorities in London, attempting to dissuade them from allowing the Congo to support the British war effort. In October 1940 Leopold III requested permission from Nazi German leader Adolf Hitler to dispatch an emissary to L√©opoldville to persuade the colonial administration to assume neutrality, but the trip was never authorised. Economic contribution = Allied support = A Belgian pilot in the British Royal Air Force, 1942. His Spitfire aircraft was funded by contributions from the Congo, and took its name, \\"Luvungi\\", from the Congolese town of that name. Soon after the establishment of the Belgian government in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which the Congo would play in the Allied war effort. The two parties came to an arrangement on 21 January 1941, in which all the British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent devaluation of the Congolese franc and the entrance of the Congo into the sterling area. With the official agreement and the Congolese declaration of support for the Allies, the economy of the Congo‚Äîin particular its production of important raw materials‚Äîwas placed at the disposal of the Allies. Though Ryckmans and leaders of the Banque du Congo Belge (the Congo's central bank) were pleased at the entry into the sterling area, which guaranteed an export market for the territory, they strongly disliked the fixed prices the agreement entailed which were favourable to the United Kingdom and worried that only trading with sterling could negatively impact the Congo's foreign exchange reserves. Business leaders in the colony were disgruntled as well, and boosted production of goods not mentioned in the agreement to sell to the neutral United States at their standard market value. In 1942, after the United States joined the Allies, the Belgian government negotiated a new economic agreement with the United States and United Kingdom. Belgian officials never signed it, but it was de facto applied for the rest of the war, and Congolese trade remained directed at the two countries. The Congo's economic output became an even more valuable asset to the Allies after Japan occupied large swathes of South East Asia in 1942, halting those areas' exports of key tropical commodities such as rubber. Sheets of copper from the Katanga Province's mines The Congo had become increasingly centralised economically during the Great Depression of the 1930s, as the Belgian government encouraged the production there of cotton, which had value on the international market. The greatest economic demands on the Congo during the war were related to raw materials. Between 1938 and 1944, the number of workers employed in the mines of the Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga (UMHK) rose from 25,000 to 49,000 to cope with the increased demand. The colonial administration enacted ultimately successful policies aimed at increasing the size of the Congo's labour force; the number of wage labourers in the colony grew from 480,000 in 1938 to 800,000 in 1945. In order to increase production for the war effort, the colonial authorities increased the hours and the speed at which workers, both European and African, were expected to work. This led to increasing labour unrest across the colony. Forced labour, which had been banned in the 1930s, was reintroduced to keep up with demand; by 1944, the maximum number of days of forced labour per year was raised to 120 for rural Congolese. Discontent among the white population was also increased by the raising of heavy war taxes, which sometimes reached as high as 40 percent. High taxes and price controls were enforced from 1941, limiting the amount of profit that could be made and curbing profiteering. While the price controls aided exports to the Allies, it adversely affected Congolese peasants, who earned less despite their increased amount of labour. The vast majority of the Congolese-produced raw resources were exported to other Allied countries. According to the Belgian government, by 1942 the entire colony's output of copper and palm oil were being exported to the United Kingdom, while almost all the colony's lumber was sent to South Africa. Exports to the United States also rose from $600,000 in early 1940 to $2,700,000 by 1942. Despite the Allied cooperation, many officials of the colonial administration treated American and British diplomats with suspicion, fearing the potential economic rivalry posed by their countries to Belgian enterprises. The United Kingdom and United States maintained large networks of spies throughout the Congo during the war. As per a deal reached on 21 March 1941, loans from the Banque du Congo Belge enabled the Belgian government in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. It also meant that the Belgian gold reserves, which had been moved to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were still available at the end of the war. =Uranium= Uranium-235 was mined in the Congo at Shinkolobwe in Katanga before the war by the UMHK for export to Belgium. It was originally used by the medical industry‚Äîfor radium production‚Äîand for colouring ceramics. Scientists in Europe later discovered that enriched uranium could be used in the production of a supposed atomic bomb. When physicist Albert Einstein wrote U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to warn him of the possibility of a German atomic bomb program, he advised him that the Congo was a main source of the mineral. Uranium extracted from the disused Shinkolobwe mine ultimately proved instrumental in the development of an atomic bomb during the Allied Manhattan Project. The director of UMHK, Edgar Sengier, secretly dispatched half of its uranium stock to New York in 1940; in September 1942, he sold it to the United States Army. Sengier himself moved to New York, from where he directed the UMHK's operations for the rest of the war. The U.S. government sent soldiers from the Army Corps of Engineers to Shinkolobwe in 1942 to restore the mine and improve its transport links by renovating the local aerodromes and port facilities. In September 1944 the Belgian government reached an agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States, whereby it would sell only those two countries the Congolese uranium at a fixed price. That year the Americans acquired a further of Uranium ore from the newly reopened mine. The mine was mostly staffed by Congolese, who laboured in unhealthy conditions. = German diamond trafficking = During the war there were frequent rumors that some Belgian industrialists involved in colonial enterprises were covertly aiding Germany. American officials found working with Belgo-Congolese mining companies to secure industrial diamonds to be difficult. According to the Belgian government, by 1942 the colony's entire output of industrial diamonds was being shipped to the United Kingdom. In reality, many industrial diamonds were smuggled to Nazi Germany for use in the German war effort. Most Congolese diamonds were mined by Formini√®re, a subsidiary of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique, which was in turn a member of the De Beers Diamond Syndicate. In 1940, the Syndicate reported that the Congo annually produced 10.9 million carats of diamonds. Immediately after the outbreak of war reported production sharply declined, and by 1942 production had officially fallen to 5 million carats‚Äìroughly the original production number minus the amount exported to Germany before the war. Believing that a large volume of diamonds were being smuggled out of the colony, American intelligence officials convinced British agents to inspect the security of the mines. The officer tasked with overseeing the inspection teams concluded that proper security measures were lacking and that Formini√®re and Soci√©t√© mini√®re de Beceka personnel fostered a \\"sinister atmosphere\\" during the tours. Firmin van Bree, the director of Formini√®re, was widely suspected of maintaining German sympathies. The German government conducted secret negotiations with leaders of Formini√®re and the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and reached deals that allowed them to purchase large quantities of diamonds until 1944. In 1943 Germany paid the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale $10.5 million for diamonds. American and British agents ultimately uncovered a wide smuggling network that brought diamonds out of the Congo and to German-occupied Europe by air and sea. According to one American report, Belgian diplomatic bags were sometimes used for transporting the gemstones. Proposals by the Americans to stifle the illicit trade were dissuaded by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare, whose Diamond Committee was dominated by members of the De Beers Diamond Syndicate. After the end of the war the Belgian government demanded that Germany pay $25 million owed to the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale for 576,676 carats of diamonds. Military involvement = Force Publique = Congolese enlisting in the Force Publique following the outbreak of war The Force Publique (or \\"Public Force\\") was the combined police and military force of both the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. During World War II, it constituted the bulk of the Free Belgian Forces, numbering over 40,000 men at its peak in 1943. Like other colonial armies of the time, the Force Publique was racially segregated; it was led by 280 white officers and NCOs, but otherwise comprised indigenous black Africans. The Force Publique had never received the more modern equipment supplied to the Belgian Armed Forces before the war, and so had to use outdated weapons and equipment like the Stokes mortar and the Saint Chamond 70 mm howitzer. During the war the force was expanded through recruitment and the calling up of reserves. De Vleeschauwer authorised the creation of an air service for the Force Publique, and the Belgian government secured an agreement with South Africa in March 1941 to provide training. The first recruits were drawn in by an appeal over Radio L√©opoldville by Captain Frans Burniaux, a Belgian pilot who had fled from the Belgian Flying School in North Africa. Many of the pilots ultimately served with the South African Air Force during the war, but their salaries were paid for by the Belgian Congo's treasury. =East African Campaign= While willing to mobilise the Congo's economic resources for the Allied war effort, the Belgian government in exile was initially much more hesitant to deploy Congolese troops in combat. The government also refused to declare war on Germany's ally, Italy, which had colonies in Africa and was fighting to secure British possessions in the continent, because the Belgian royal family had dynastic links with the Italian royal family. This attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A Belgian declaration of war was eventually delivered against Italy on 23 November 1940. Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo. left Three brigades of the Force Publique were sent to Italian East Africa alongside British forces to fight the Italians. The Belgian 1st Colonial Brigade operated in the Galla-Sidamo area in the South-West sector. In May 1941, around 8,000 men of the Force Publique, under Major-General Auguste-√âdouard Gilliaert, successfully cut off the retreat of General Pietro Gazzera's Italians at Sa√Øo, in the Ethiopian Highlands after marching over from their bases in western Congo. The troops suffered from malaria and other tropical diseases, but successfully defeated the Italians in a number of engagements. Gilliaert subsequently accepted the surrender of Gazzera and 7,000 Italian troops. Over the course of the campaign in Ethiopia, the Force Publique received the surrender of nine Italian generals, 370 high-ranking officers and 15,000 Italian colonial troops before the end of 1941. The Congolese forces in Ethiopia suffered about 500 fatalities. After the Allied victory in Ethiopia, the Force Publique moved to the British colony of Nigeria, which was being used as a staging ground for a planned invasion of Vichy-controlled Dahomey which did not occur, was also garrisoned by 13,000 Congolese troops. Then a part of the Force Publique went to Egypt and British Mandatory Palestine and was redesignated the 1st Belgian Congo Brigade Group during 1943 and 1944. =Medical support= A medical unit from the Congo, the 10th (Belgian Congo) Casualty Clearing Station, was formed in 1943, and served alongside British forces during the invasion of Madagascar and in the Far East during the Burma Campaign. The unit (which had a small body of Force Publique troops for local defense of the station) included 350 black and 20 white personnel, and continued to serve with the British until 1945. Life in the Belgian Congo At the start of the war, the population of the Congo numbered approximately 12 million black people and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated the population along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly urbanized and, in L√©opoldville, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the black majority. All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew. The colonial authorities arrested enemy aliens in the Congo and confiscated their property in 1940. The State Security Service maintained a large presence in the colony and closely monitored the foreign population. The colonial administration tried to conceal the war from the African population by censoring the media, but the Congolese noticed the internal tensions among the white population and the detention of German and Italian nationals. To better counter external influences in the colony, the administration established a Bureau of Information and Propaganda. Congolese worker housing, c. 1943 The demands of the colonial administration fell hardest on rural residents, which were conscripted for road construction projects and rubber harvesting. Conditions were harsh for the labourers, and in some cases were conflated in the Congolese collective memory with the earlier atrocities committed by the Congo Free State in relation to its rubber collection system. The urbanised Congolese generally experienced more financial gain during the war than their rural counterparts, though several workers who had collected large amounts of rubber earned even more money. During the war the Belgian government in exile directed propaganda at the Allied states that created a positive image of its colony in an attempt to legitimise its rule. In New York City, the Belgian Information Center released numerous publications which asserted that the Belgians had rescued the Congolese from \\"terrible conditions\\" and improved life in the territory. Wider Allied propaganda also downplayed internal political tensions within the Congo and in its relations with the Belgian government so as to portray the coordination of its war effort in a harmonious fashion. The Belgian colonial administration maintained a paternalistic attitude towards the indigenous Congolese. Education was overwhelmingly controlled by Protestant and Catholic missions, which were also responsible for providing limited welfare support to the rural Congolese. The occupation of Belgium severed Belgian missionaries from their parent organisations, causing the colonial administration to subsidise their activities to make up for budget deficits. The war did not adversely impact their evangelising, and the number of reported baptisms conducted increased from 1,824,000 in 1939 to a cumulative total of 2,214,000 in 1942. Healthcare was provided by a mix of government and corporate physicians, private practitioners, and missionaries. At the outbreak of the war there were 302 doctors working in the Congo. Some medical personnel accompanied the Force Publique on its foreign deployments, but the vast majority remained in the colony for the conflict's duration. Unlike the neighboring French possessions, the war did not adversely affect the resources of healthcare providers in the Congo. Medical research continued and a new journal was created so that findings could be published while the territory was separated from Belgium. Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government. Nevertheless, the war did lead to a shortage of consumer goods. The devaluation of the Congolese franc also made foreign imports more expensive. One of the consequences of the Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant urbanisation. Just 9% of the indigenous population lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%. The colonial government also greatly improved transport and production facilities during the war. Unrest =Strikes= Katangese miner The demands made by the colonial government on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites in the colony were allowed to form trade unions for the first time during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers. A lack of European skilled labor forced the colonial government to train and give native Congolese skilled labor positions for the first time, but they were paid less than their white colleagues, generating discontent. In October 1941, white workers in the colony unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across the colony. In December 1941, black mine workers at various sites in Katanga Province, including Jadotville and √âlisabethville, went on strike, demanding that their pay be increased from 1.50 francs to 2 francs to compensate for rising living costs. The strike started on 3 December, and by the next day 1,400 workers had downed tools. All UMHK sites were affected by 9 December. The strike was also fueled by other grievances against the colonial order and segregation. A painting of the √âlisabethville massacre by Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu, a Congolese artist, depicting the church and colonial state (personified at the right) as the instigators From the start, the colonial authorities attempted to persuade the strikers to disperse and go back to work. When they refused, they were fired on. In Jadotville, 15 strikers were shot dead by the military. In √âlisabethville, the strikers, including their leader L√©onard Mpoyi, were invited to negotiations at the town's stadium, where they were offered various concessions, including a 30% pay rise. When the workers refused, the Governor of Katanga, Amour Maron, shot Mpoyi, killing him. The Governor then ordered his soldiers to fire on the other strikers in the stadium. Between 60 and 70 strikers were killed during the protest, although the official estimate was around 30.Transcription of the proceedings of the Council of Ministers of the government in exile, 18 December 1941, reproduced in The miners returned to work on 10 December. Numerous smaller strikes occurred in the Congo later in the war, though not on the same scale as in 1941. In 1944 strikes broke out in Katanga and Kasa√Ø, provoked by the conscription of workers for the mines and deteriorating working conditions. That year the Belgians conducted a few \\"police operations\\" in the province of √âquateur to ensure disgruntled labourers would collect rubber. In 1945, riots and strikes occurred among the black dockworkers in the port city of Matadi. =Luluabourg mutiny= The colonial government in the Congo depended on its military to maintain civil order and, above all, it depended on the loyalty of the native troops who made up the bulk of the Force Publique. Black non- commissioned officers led by First Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, a veteran of the East African Campaign, mutinied at Luluabourg in the central Congolese province of Kasa√Ø in February 1944; the trigger for this was a plan to vaccinate troops who had served at the front, though the soldiers were also unhappy about the demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers. The mutineers broke into the base's armoury on the morning of 20 February and pillaged the white quarter of the town. The town's inhabitants fled, and a Belgian officer and two white civilians were killed. The mutineers attacked visible signs of the colonial authorities and proclaimed their desire for independence. The mutineers then dispersed to their home villages, pillaging on the way; they failed to spread the insurrection to neighbouring garrisons. Two mutineers, including Mukalabushi, were executed for their part in the insurrection. Legacy Official postwar Belgian rhetoric portrayed the Congo's attitude towards the mother country as one of \\"unfailing solidarity.\\" As a result of the Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict, the post-war period saw a wave of immigration to the country from Belgium. By 1950, 100,000 whites were living in the Congo. Nevertheless, the war highlighted the precarious nature of the colonial administration, leading Governor Ryckmans to remark that \\"the days of colonialism are over\\" in 1946. A feeling by the Belgian government prevailed that it had incurred a \\"war debt\\" to the Congo, and thus more attention was given to the concerns of the indigenous population. In the years after the war, the colonial government underwent extensive reform. Black people were granted significantly more rights and freedoms, leading to the growth of a so-called √âvolu√© (\\"evolved\\") class. Despite this, the Belgian policy of conscripted labour of 60 days a year from each native Congolese remained in effect until Congolese independence, whereas similar labour levies were abolished in British and French possessions after the war. Several black members of the Force Publique who were veterans of the war served in prominent roles in the army after Congolese independence, including Louis Bobozo, Eugene Ebeya and Norbert Muk√©. Following the industrial unrest, trade unions for black workers were instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were common in the colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly in the years after the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960. The 1941 √âlisabethville massacre is a recurrent theme in Congolese art and folklore, and was later incorporated into the popular Congolese anti-colonial narrative. Historiographic discussion of the Congo's role in World War II is generally limited to mentions of the uranium extracted from Shinkolobwe. The importance of Congolese uranium during the war caused the Soviet Union to become interested in the territory; it was subsequently an area of Soviet interest during the Cold War. The war also led to a re-orientation of the Congo's trade away from Belgium and towards the United States, the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom's colonies. = Commemoration = In 1943, a three-sided pyramid was erected in Faradje, Belgian Congo to commemorate the actions of the Congolese in Ethiopia. Each face of the pyramid was inscribed with the name of each major location of fighting: Asosa, Gambela, and Sa√Øo. Many locations throughout the country‚Äîpresently the Democratic Republic of the Congo‚Äîare named for the battles. In 1970 the Belgian government dedicated a monument in Schaerbeek, Belgium, to the military successes of Belgian colonial forces, including those during World War II.

He was instrumental with getting MTV to showcase Spring Break in Daytona Beach in 1986-1993, though later lamented it was a mistake because locals experienced many problems during Spring Break every year. He spent his last few years as mayor trying to control Spring Break partiers. Soon after he lost his election bid in 1993, Daytona cut ties with MTV.  Biography  Larry Kelly Sr., who was born in 1935, is a native of Carbondale, Pennsylvania. Kelly served in the U.S. Air Force. Kelly was a logistics engineer by profession. In 1963, he and his new wife Joan moved to Daytona Beach while Kelly was employed by General Electric. He retired from General Electric in 1991. Larry Kelly Field was named for him at Daytona Beach Municipal Stadium in 1994. In 200o, he was elected to the board of directors of the Stewart-Marchman Foundation. Kelly was married to Joan Kelly who died on July 31, 2015. He has five children including Volusia County Judge Christopher Kelly. In 2017, he joined with retired Yonkers, New York police commissioner Albert ‚ÄúAl‚Äù McEvoy to solve Daytona Beach cold cases. Kelly's wife, Jane Kelly, a registered nurse, died on July 31, 2015, at the age of 78. The couple had five children - Larry Kelly Jr., Ann, Patrick, Christopher, and Mathew. Kelly's son, Chris Kelly, was elected a Volusia County court judge in 2012 with 63% of the vote. = Politics = Kelly was on the Daytona Beach planning board for four years before being elected to the Daytona Beach city commission in 1971. Kelly was the Daytona Beach city commissioner until he was elected mayor in 1974 in a special election to fill the vacancy in that office. Kelly served as the Mayor of Daytona Beach, Florida for twelve consecutive, two-year terms from 1974 to 1993. After Fort Lauderdale started discouraging college students from vacationing there for Spring Break in the mid-1980s, Kelly appeared on national television to encourage college vacationers to come to Daytona Beach for Spring Break instead. Soon after, beer and cigarette brands started advertising in Daytona Beach for Spring Break. MTV's Spring Break showcase moved their Spring Break coverage to Daytona Beach in 1986. He later called that decision a mistake as locals experienced many problems during Spring Break every year. Kelly's efforts to rein in the revelry included promoting athletic competitions called \\"Spring Games\\" to channel youthful energy in a wholesome direction, and proposing that hotels be billed for the cost of sending police to respond to calls during spring break. In 1993, Kelly was lost his bid for re-election to a potential 13th term in a major upset. Kelly was defeated by restaurateur Paul Carpenella by only 210 votes. Carpenella received 3,689 votes (50.3%), to win the mayoral election, while Kelly placed second, garnering 3,479 votes (47.4%). Turnout in the 1993 municipal election was just 25%. That year, Daytona Beach officials cut their Spring Break marketing budget and ties with MTV.

In 1243 Thomas took an active part in the dispute which arose between Grosseteste and the abbot of Bardney. Matthew Paris ascribes the origin of the suit against the abbot to the archdeacon. He was elected to the impoverished bishopric of St. David's on 16 July 1247, accepted it at Grosseteste's urging. He was consecrated on 26 July 1248 at Canterbury. He was present at the parliament in London, Easter 1253, and joined in excommunicating violators of Magna Carta. He died on 11 July 1255.

Eleven teams, effectively every team that does not qualify for the respective provincial deciders, participate in the qualifiers. The qualifiers can be traced to the introduction of the \\"back door system\\" which was first introduced in 1997, though in the early years, qualification was open only to the beaten provincial finalists in Leinster and Munster. The first true series of All-Ireland qualifiers began in 2002, when the defeated provincial quarter and semi-finalists as well as the defeated Ulster finalists were given a second opportunity of competing for the All- Ireland title. A round robin system was subsequently introduced for a brief period, however, the single-elimination series returned in 2008. While the qualifiers were introduced as a way of helping the so-called \\"weaker\\" teams, the system has occasionally come in for criticism for giving the more successful teams a greater chance of winning the All-Ireland title. Format In 2013 a record eleven teams participated in the qualifiers. The seven teams eliminated prior to the provincial semi-finals entered the qualifiers at the preliminary and phase one stages. Six of the seven teams played in the preliminary round while the seventh team received a bye to phase one. An open draw was made to determine the pairings. The three winners of the preliminary round joined the seventh team in phase one. Once again another draw was made to determine the pairings. The two winners of these games advanced to phase three. Phase two saw the defeated Leinster and Munster semi-finalists face each other. The two winners advanced to phase three. The phase one and phase two winners played against each other in phase three. The two winners advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-finals. History =Early years= Since its inception in 1887 the championship had been played on a straight knock-out basis. If any team was defeated at any stage of the provincial or All-Ireland competitions it meant automatic elimination. This system was deemed the fairest as the All-Ireland champions would usually be the only undefeated team in that years Championship. There were some problems with this system. Over the years Galway had become the only credible hurling team in Connacht, thus giving them an automatic pass into the All-Ireland semi-finals every year. Similarly in Ulster there were many problems as hurling was much weaker and confined to a small few counties in the north-east of the province. =Back door system= In 1995 the Hurling Development Committee began investigating a way of improving hurling in general and revamping the championship. Their proposals involved allowing the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists to re- enter the All-Ireland championship. While the two provincial final winners would automatically qualify for the All-Ireland semi-finals, the two defeated provincial teams would join Galway and the Ulster champions in two play-off games or ‚Äúquarter-finals‚Äù. The two winners from these two games would then qualify for the semi-finals where they would be drawn against the Leinster and Munster champions. Repeat games would be avoided in the All-Ireland semi-final stage. At the start of 1996 these proposals looked unlikely of being introduced, however, a whistle-stop tour undertaken by the committee's secretary Frank Murphy and Pat Daly, the GAA's Games Development Officer, had changed the position. In April 1996 the committee's proposals were accepted at the GAA's annual congress. Most counties supported the new proposals and motion 15 (a) was passed with more than a two-thirds majority. Tipperary and Kilkenny were the first two teams to benefit from the back door system as defeated provincial finalists in 1997. Tipperary went all the way to the All- Ireland final to set up an all Munster decider with Clare. Tradition prevailed on that occasion as Munster champions Clare triumphed by 0-20 to 2-13. The following year the All-Ireland final was an all Leinster affair, with Kilkenny facing Offaly in a repeat of the provincial decider. It was an historic occasion as Offaly overturned their provincial defeat to secure a 2-16 to 1-13 victory. =Qualifiers: 2002-2004= In 2002 the back-door system was expanded to involve teams beaten in the early stages of the provincial series of games. The newly expanded system featured two rounds of games. Round one involved Galway, who entered the championship at this stage, the Ulster runners-up and the defeated teams from the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the Leinster and Munster campaigns. An open draw was made to determine the pairings, however, repeat games were not permitted. Four teams were eliminated at this stage while the four winners advanced to round two. Here they joined the defeated Leinster and Munster finalists. An open draw was made to determine the three pairings, however, once again repeat games were not permitted. Three teams were eliminated at this stage while the three winners advanced to the All- Ireland quarter-finals. In the first season of the new format, Clare reached the All-Ireland final having been defeated by Tipperary in the Munster quarter-final. In 2004 two teams, neither of which were their respective provincial champions, contested the All-Ireland final. Both Cork and Kilkenny had been beaten in their provincial campaigns, however, they used the qualifiers to good effect in reaching the All-Ireland decider. =Round robin: 2005-2007= A round robin league system was introduced to the qualifiers in 2005. The Leinster and Munster champions and runners-up advanced directly to the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The three remaining teams in Leinster and Munster joined Galway and the Ulster champions in the eight-county All-Ireland qualifier series. The eight qualifier teams were divided into two groups of four teams each. Each team played three games with the top two teams in groups A and B advancing to the All-Ireland quarter-finals. This round robin system created a series of championship anomalies. In the first year of the system both Limerick and Waterford were beaten in the Munster series of games as well as in the qualifiers. In spite of this both teams reached the All-Ireland quarter-finals and had the chance to claim the title after being beaten twice. This anomaly continued for the remainder of this system, with Galway and Cork also facing two defeats but remaining in the championship nonetheless.

The railway line, built as a route between Inverness and Perth, opened in 1863 and closed in 1965. The route was reopened as a long distance path in 2005. It is listed as one of Scotland's Great Trails by NatureScot, and links directly to two further Great Trails: the Moray Coast Trail and the Speyside Way. It is currently the shortest of the Great Trails, but can be combined with sections of the Moray Coast Trail and Speyside Way to form a circular route known as the Moray Way. About 3,000 people use the path every year, of whom about 400 complete the entire route. History Although in 1860 Inverness had a rail link to the south via Aberdeen, this was circuitous and involved a change between two railway stations in the town. A more direct route south bypassing Aberdeen was planned leaving the Inverness to Aberdeen Line at Forres and heading south to Grantown and then via the Pass of Drumochter to Perth. Work started in 1861, with the line between Forres and opening on 3 August before the complete line opened on 9 September 1863. The line was built and initially operated by Inverness & Perth Junction Railway, which became part of the Highland Railway in 1865. The line north of Aviemore was bypassed by the current more direct route via the Nairn Viaduct in 1898. In his 1963 report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" Dr Beeching recommending closing the network's least used stations and lines, which included the line between Aviemore and Forres and this subsequently closed in 1965. The Dava Way Association was formed in 1997 to create a walking and cycling path along the former railway. Negotiations and purchase of the former alignment were necessary before the clearing could start in 2003. The way was opened in 2005, although this at the time included a diversion along a minor road. Route The long route from Grantown-on-Spey in the Cairngorms National Park to Forres in Moray mainly follows the old railway line. Starting from Grantown and heading north, the path crosses Dava Moor where it reaches its summit of . Continuing to Dunphail, the River Divie is crossed by the old railway viaduct, used today as the symbol of the Dava Way.

Early life  Hamilton was born in Brandon, Vermont, and the fourth generation of physicians. He attended local public schools. He entered the University of Vermont and earned his A. B. degree in 1898. His medical education was at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and earned his M.D. in 1903. He spent a year in training at the Children's Hospital of New York followed by a year at the Lying-in Hospital of the City of New York.  Career  From 1905 to 1909, he served as an assistant physician at the Manhattan State Mental Hospital, and then transferred to the Utica State Hospital (New York State Lunatic Asylum), where he served as a psychiatrist from 1910 to 1916. Between 1911 and 1912, he studied at the University of Breslau, Germany, and worked in the mental and nervous clinics. In 1917, he became director of the New York Police's new Police Psychopathic Laboratory. However, with the start of World War I, Hamilton entered the U.S. Army. He spent two years as a psychiatrist with the 42nd Division and the Third Army. Upon his return from Europe, he became the Medical Director at the Philadelphia Hospital for Mental Disorder and served in this position from 1920 to 1922. Then, he took the position of Assistant Medical Director at the private hospital, Bloomingdale Insane Asylum which was affiliated with the Cornell Medical School and the New York Hospital. He remained at Bloomingdale from 1923 to 1936. During those years, he also served as director of Hospital Service for the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, a voluntary lay organization. This period began a career of surveys of public mental hospitals under the auspices of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene and later, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Neurological Association, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Hamilton's experience in state mental hospitals came to the fore in the 1930s. The public mental hospitals in the various states had become overcrowded, understaffed, and received inadequate funding. Public interest had been aroused by publications of hospitals conditions. In 1935, the American Medical Association (AMA) began an investigation at the instigation of its Mental Health committee. The AMA surveys were discontinued and only a statistical report of the findings was published, with no known further action. Later, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) took up the effort and joined the national and state mental health associations in the effort to improve conditions in the mental hospitals. In 1928, the State Society for Mental Health of Connecticut obtained funds to conduct a survey of mental hospitals, under the direction of Hamilton. The survey was published in 1936 with numerous recommendations. The survey reports met wide acceptance as numerous states began obtaining funds for similar surveys, which often resulted in increased funding by state legislatures to improve conditions in the state mental hospitals. Following his U.S. Army service during World War II, Hamilton accepted the position as Superintendent of the Essex Overbrook Hospital in New Jersey. He stayed there until 1950. He returned to Burlington, Vermont to continue his consultant activities. In 1951, the Governor of Vermont requested Hamilton's expertise with the Women's State Reformatory in Rutland, Vermont.  Other activities  Hamilton taught during his various posts: the Canandaigua Academy in New York (1898-1899), the Allen School in New York (1900-1901), the Women's Medical College of New York (1920-1922), Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the Post Graduate School of Medicine (1920-1925). He was a member of numerous professional organizations: the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Psychopathological Association (President in 1938), and the American Psychiatric Association (APA, president in 1946-1947). He served as an advisor to the U.S. Public Health Service from 1939 to 1947, and was an active participant in the founding of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.  Death  He died of a heart attack in 1951.

Early life and education  Kirpal Singh, the son of Partap Singh and Laj Wanti, was born on 5 September 1925 in Beawar, in the district of Ajmer, Rajasthan. His father was a junior level Police Officer in the Opium Contraband Control Department during the British Raj. Singh grew up in very modest circumstances. In 1930, when Partap Singh retired prematurely at the age of 42, the family moved to Rawalpindi in North-West Punjab (now in Pakistan). Singh received his early education at Khalsa High School in Rawalpindi. In 1939, he was selected for a scholarship to join the Indian Mercantile Marine Training Ship Dufferin at Bombay. Singh initially trained as a cadet for the Merchant Navy from 1940 to 1942, the first of many occasions when he was awarded an Extra First Class or First Class Certificate. Naval career Japan's entry in the Second World War and its swift occupation of the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands abruptly changed Singh's career path. =Service in World War II= Singh served as a midshipman during World War II on board the battleship, HMS Anson from January 1944 to June 1944, escorting Allied convoys from the Atlantic across the Arctic Ocean to Murmansk, Russia. Thereafter he was transferred to on board which he participated in military operations in the Mediterranean and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Later, as part of British Pacific Fleet, his ship survived the constant threat of the Japanese Kamikaze pilots in Okinawa.During his tenure on these battleships, Singh came into contact with his mentor, Admiral Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape. He also benefited from programs for overseas officers organised by the Victoria League. =Completion of initial training= From September 1945 to March 1946, Singh attended technical courses as a Sub Lieutenant with the Royal Navy. A year later, he was sent to the UK to specialize in Gunnery at the Royal Navy's Gunnery School at HMS Excellent.  India's independence  In 1949, Singh served as Aide de Camp to India's first Governor General, Mr C. Rajagopalachari at Rashtrapati Bhawan, the President's official address. During this formative time of India's Independence, he came in close contact with several of the nation's leaders like Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru.  The Indian Navy  Kirpal Singh held many positions during his naval career. He commanded various ships and establishments, including the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and the Western Fleet. A comprehensive listing of his various appointments is given below.  Offshore Energy  Singh's post-naval career began with the establishment of a small ship repair firm with three other partners. He also represented Balfour Beatty Engineering Ltd in India. In early 1978, he met a senior general manager in the state owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which had discovered oil and gas at Bombay High. At the ONGC executive's suggestion, that India urgently needed to develop its underwater technology capabilities, Singh attended the Offshore Technology Conference (Houston) in May 1978. There he persuaded the business leadership of Taylor Diving and Salvage Co., a subsidiary of Brown and Root and the Halliburton group, to jointly bid for work on ONGC contracts. On 17 May 1979, Singh, along with Shavax Lal, with whom he had become acquainted during his tenure as C. Rajagopalachari's aide-de-camp, launched Dolphin Offshore Enterprises with the objective of providing supply vessels, diving and marine engineering services to India's nascent offshore oil and gas industry. In 1994, Dolphin Offshore Enterprises made its initial public offering. The company is listed on the Bombay and National Stock Exchange of India. Singh currently serves as Chairman of Dolphin Offshore Enterprises.  Philanthropy  Singh provided a grant for the launch of the Maritime Museum in Kochi. Through the Dolphin Foundation, he provides grants for individuals in the offshore and maritime industry in India. In 2006, he launched a scholarship program for the children of sailors in the Indian Navy. He and his wife Manjit Kirpal Singh are Trustees and Advisory board members of the Anad Foundation, dedicated to advancing the values of humanism through spiritual music. He is now dedicating his time to launching a technical institute to train young Indians for the offshore energy and maritime industry.

His research is focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent, long- lasting changes in neuronal function and the role these mechanisms play in complex behaviors, including cognition. As a postdoctoral fellow in David Sweatt's laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine, Klann was the first to demonstrate that persistent protein kinase activity was associated with long- lasting synaptic plasticity. After becoming an independent investigator, his laboratory was the first to show that at low concentrations, reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are typically considered to be neurotoxic, are in fact signaling molecules that are required for synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. By contrast, Klann's laboratory has also shown that removal of ROS can prevent age- and Alzheimer's disease-related impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory. Klann's laboratory made additional breakthroughs in the mid-2000s. It has been known since the 1960s that new protein synthesis (translation) was necessary for the formation of long-term memory. However, the mechanisms that regulate this process were not understood until Klann's laboratory published a number of seminal studies describing the translational control mechanisms that are required for proper long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. In addition, Klann's laboratory subsequently demonstrated that dysregulated translational control mechanisms are involved in several brain disorders, including fragile X syndromeand autism. His laboratory uses a number of experimental approaches to dissect the molecular mechanisms necessary for maintaining long-lasting changes in synaptic strength and memory. Detailed biochemical and sophisticated imaging experiments are employed to delineate the molecular signaling cascades that are activated and required for long-lasting synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, and striatum, and whether these signaling events are required for memory formation, social behaviors, and behavioral flexibility. Klann's laboratory also conducts electrophysiological, biochemical, imaging, and behavioral studies with various knockout and transgenic mice to determine how precise genetic manipulations that either activate or abolish signaling cascades alter synaptic function and behavior. Klann serves as a reviewing editor for The Journal of Neuroscience and as an associate editor for Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, and serves on the editorial boards of several other journals. He is a former member and chair of both the Neural Oxidative Metabolism & Death and the Molecular & Cellular Substrates of Complex Disorders Study Sections of the National Institutes of Health. Klann serves on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics and Pitt Hopkins Syndrome International Network. He also served on the Fragile X Outcomes Measures Group and the Fragile X Syndrome Research Plan Working Group of the National Institutes of Health. Klann also was the treasurer (2010-2012) and is a past president of the Molecular and Cellular Cognition Society. Klann received his Ph.D. from the Medical College of Virginia, did postdoctoral training at Baylor College of Medicine, and held faculty positions at the University of Pittsburgh (1994-2001) and Baylor College of Medicine (2001-2006) before joining the faculty of New York University in 2006.

Land for the park was acquired in 1959 for an estimated cost of $161,800. Since its acquisition of the land, the park district exchanged of Centennial Park to Champaign Unit 4 School District in return for the land of Morrisey Park. Currently, Champaign Centennial High School and Jefferson Middle School sit within the park. The campus was designed by Professor Karl Lohmann. Facilities The park features eight lighted tennis courts, one lighted baseball field, five additional unlit baseball fields, one soccer field, and one basketball court. Additionally, the park contains a playground and Centennial Hill, which is used as a sledding hill during the winter months. Leonhard Recreation Center In 1976, the center was dedicated as the Bicentennial Center in honor of the United States' Bicentennial anniversary. However, the center was rededicated as its current namesake in 1984 to honor former park district commissioner Patricia H. Leonhard. The Rec Center includes a full-size gymnasium, an air-conditioned activity space, locker rooms, and offices. The park district announced in 2012 that the 35-year-old building will be replaced with a $5 million complex in the spring of 2014. Ground was broken on the project on July 3, 2013. The new complex will feature a geothermal heating and cooling system, a key feature that the current recreation center is lacking. Furthermore, the new rec center will feature the following: * Indoor playground * Walking track * Basketball courts * Volleyball courts * Activity rooms The new building will also host special interest classes, and sport and fitness programs. It will also continue to host the park district's summer programs for children. Bresnan Meeting Center Originally dedicated as \\"The Meeting Center\\" when the facility opened on May 2, 1968, the Besnan Center houses the administrative offices for the Champaign Park District. The center was rededicated on May 9, 1984 after park commissioner Donald F. Bresnan for its current namesake. Additionally the Board of Directors' meetings are held at 7pm on the second Wednesday of every month. Sholem Aquatic Center Opening in 2006, the family water park serves the Champaign-Urbana metropolitan area each year from Memorial Day until Labor Day. Operating hours are typically reduced when Unit 4 schools are still in session. Staffed by award-winning Lifeguards, the Sholem Aquatic Center contains many different water features, pools a concession stand, and grassy areas for shade. Each feature is divided among the park in different areas: * The Beach (8000sq-ft pool and waterplay area) * The Puddle (a wading area for small children) * The Sea (an 8-lane, 25 yard lap pool) * The Falls (170 ft tube slide) * The Plunge, and Blue Rush (both are 197 ft water slides enclosed in darkness) * The Rapids (660 ft inner-tube river) * The Oasis (concession stand with seating) The aquatic center also offers swimming lessons, teen swim hours, and adult swim hours. Additionally, the complex is available for private rental after hours. Prairie Farm Centennial Park also features Prairie Farm, which serves as a full-size, replica farm. Dedicated in 1966, the farm features barns, farmhouse, pond, pasture, & flower garden. The farm is open Memorial Day weekend through the middle of August and also hosts several children activities and programs throughout the season. Additionally, the farm houses traditional farm animals like sheep, pigs, goats, horses, cows, chickens, and geese. Admission is free, but donations are encouraged to help sustain the facility.

The team's head coach was Cuonzo Martin, who was in his third season at Tennessee. The team played their home games at the Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee as a member of the Southeastern Conference. Previous season The Vols posted a record of 20‚Äì13 (11‚Äì7 SEC) in the 2012‚Äì13 season and finished sixth in the SEC standings in Cuonzo Martin's second season as head coach. The season was highlighted by a 30-point victory over rival Kentucky and a victory over a team that competed in the Final Four, Wichita State. The Volunteers lost in the first round of the 2013 NIT to Mercer. Season Summary Going into the season, Cuonzo Martin faced pressure and unrest from the Tennessee fanbase, restless after having missed the NCAA Tournament two consecutive seasons. During the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 seasons, promising finishes to the regular season were undermined by early season losses to inferior out of conference opponents; bewildering losses to College of Charleston, Oakland and Austin Peay scuttled any hopes of a tournament appearance each of those seasons, respectively. Frustrations grew shortly after Tennessee inexplicably dropped a game to a sub-100 RPI UTEP squad during the Battle for Atlantis tournament in November. A bubble team throughout the season, Tennessee ultimately nabbed a bid to the NCAA Tournament (despite the earlier loss to UTEP and suffering a sweep at the hands of a sub-100 RPI Texas A&M;). In any case, Martin rallied the team to a 4-0 finish to end the regular season at 20-11. A victory over a moribund South Carolina outfit and a third straight loss to #1 Florida put Tennessee at 21-12. This was enough to earn Tennessee an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, Martin's first and only appearance with Tennessee. The Vols were placed in the First Four as an 11 seed, where Tennessee beat Iowa in overtime to move on to the field of 64. Tennessee routed Umass in the second round and Mercer in the round of 32. As a result, Tennessss earned a trip to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2010. The Vols faced Michigan and came within one basket of making what would have been only their second Elite 8 appearance but fell to the Wolverines, 73-71. Despite the late season surge and performance in the tourney (the latter accomplishment arguably the fruit of a favorable tournament draw and a Mercer upset of Duke), Cuonzo Martin would leave Tennessee at season's end to take the head coaching job at the University of California-Berkeley.

The name Twinbrook or Twin-Brook came from the four developers, Joseph L.

The name was a reference to the two streams that traversed the original 200 acres of the development, both eventually feeding into Rock Creek, which is the namesake feature of Rock Creek Park, a unit of the National Park Service. The older south section of Twinbrook is roughly bounded by First Street on the west, Veirs Mill Road on the north, Halpine Road and Twinbrook Parkway on the east and the B&O; railroad and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority tracks to the southwest.https://rockmail.rockvillemd.gov/clerk/egenda.nsf/d5c6a20307650f4a852572f9004d38b8/f88cd2dd3bd4b61985257528006ccf82/$FILE/Attachment%20J%20TNP%20Appendix%201.pdf And, with some exceptions, the smaller north section is bound by Veirs Mill Road to the south, Old Broadwood to the west, Old Baltimore Road to the North and Twinbrook Parkway to the east.  History  = Pre-Subdivision = Though originally home to Native American tribes, by the early 18th century the land that now makes up Twinbrook was being provided as land grants to individuals who performed services respective to the Great Britain or through early purchases and donations. Including Caleb Litton who settled the Autrey Park area and later local tavern owner Adam Robb, who would acquire most of the current Twinbrook area. In 1873 John Hillaery Bogley purchased around 200 acres of the land that Adam Robb had acquired and subsequently in 1925 Washington, DC native Lillian M. Small purchased the land from Bogley's heirs, which was described as having come from Litton's original grant from Lord Baltimore around 1720. While Small never permanently lived at the farm, she did frequently visit and spend time there before selling it to the Twinbrook developers for $94,000. = Creation = In the years following World War II it became obvious that affordable homes were needed to meet the needs of the influx of young families the peace years had created. This need was especially noteworthy in the suburbs of Washington, DC, a city that had rapidly expanded during the war years. To meet this need, Twinbrook developers Geeraert and Gingery looked to the planned communities of Levittown, New York and Oak Ridge, Tennessee for guidance and incorporated the ideas of Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian homes, which were simple and affordable but comfortable and technologically advanced homes. Additionally, the lots and streets were designed to respect that natural topography of the area, resulting in irregular lot sizes and curving streets. The first section of Twinbrook to be developed was the area south of Veirs Mill Road, with construction starting shortly after the original 1946 purchase of the property and the first owners taking possession of their home in September 1948. In a nod to the World War II veterans who would largely occupy the homes, the names of the streets of the southern section were largely taken from World War II engagements and related locations. There were multiple styles of homes in the development, though the most readily identified were the Cape Cod style homes identified as the \\"Famous Five\\" in the initial marketing and all featured large picture windows and finished first floors and unfinished second stories, which lowered the price for buyers and allowed them to finish the upstairs space to their own specifications. The homes were initially offered at prices ranging from $9,250 to $11,500 and the government backed the mortgages 100 percent. White, male veterans were able to purchase a home with only a $50 down payment. By 1952 more than 300 houses had been built and in 1949 Rockville officially annexed Twinbrook into the city. = Twinbrook Forest = By 1952 Joseph Geeraert saw that build out of the initial south section of Twinbrook was about to be reached, so he introduced his Twinbrook Forest addition in the section on the north side of Veirs Mill.http://www.peerlessrockville.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/03/Greater-Twinbrook-Tour.pdf Using similar designs and layouts, the second Twinbrook development proved to be an equally successful venture.  Amenities  = Schools = Filling one of the most urgent needs of the new community, an eight-room Twinbrook Elementary School opened in 1952, with an additional 12 classrooms added the following year and more than doubling the capacity to 550 students. And Meadow Hall Elementary School, which serves the Twinbrook Forest area opened in 1956. Additionally, Edwin W. Broome Junior High School (later Broome Middle School) was constructed in the Twinbrook Forest area to serve the larger subdivision. High school students attended Richard Montgomery High School, Robert E. Peary High School, and, starting in 1968, Rockville High School. = Shopping = Twinbrook Mart was the first retail center built to directly serve the residents of the subdivision. Built on the south side of Veirs Mill Road near the intersection of Atlantic Avenue in 1956, it originally included an A&P; grocery store, Peoples Drug Store and other retail establishments. The Twinbrook Library, a branch of Montgomery County Public Libraries, was initially housed in the basement of the drugstore starting in 1959, it would be 1976 before the community library would move across Veirs Mill Road into its current stand- alone building. In 1958 the Twinbrook Shopping Center, located on the opposite side of Veirs Mill Road from the Twinbrook Mart would open. This second center more than doubled the retail space for the community and its opening even featured future United States Vice President Hubert Humphrey. = Recreation = Shortly after residents began settling into the Twinbrook subdivision, the need for recreational amenities developed. The Twinbrook Swimming Pool was among the first and most popular of these amenities. Opened in 1955, the pool was literally dug by volunteers who actually lived in the community on formerly church-owned land that Catholic Archbishop Patrick A. O‚ÄôBoyle had generously sold to the Twinbrook Swimming Pool Corporation for $10. At its peak, membership at the pool was around 700 families. Today it is about half that, but it remains a popular place. Twinbrook Park, now Twinbrook Community Recreation Center, was originally established as a green space with limited amenities in 1953,http://www.peerlessrockville.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/03/Twinbrook-Tour.pdf but in the decades since it has greatly expanded, adding basketball courts, tennis courts and a children's playground. And in 1999 the city built a new building to house the recreation center, a space large enough to hold a community room, gym, exercise room, and computer lab.  Transportation  Though the subdivision came to life at the dawn of the golden age of the automobile, public transit was still an important to help the influx of families get around and to work, which often included commuting into Washington, DC. Though street car service between Rockville and Georgetown ended in 1935, bus service to the Twinbrook neighborhood was established in the early 1950s and the 1980s saw a major advancement for public transit as the Metro system was extended out into the Maryland suburbs. On December 15, 1984, the Twinbrook Station Metro stop opened for general use. It was part of a seven-mile expansion of Metro's Redline north of the Grosvenor-Strathmore stop, which had opened on July 25, 1984. This new metro stop, located near the southwestern edge of the subdivision, greatly improved the accessibility of living in Twinbrook.  Today  Following several years of flux, with home values not keeping pace with the majority of Rockville's neighborhoods, the last decade has seen improvement in the subdivision, as more families are turning to the neighborhood for relatively affordable single-family homes. The owner to renter ratio has shifted back in favor of owner-occupied homes and the development around the Twinbrook Metro stop is also spurring increased interest in the 60+ year old subdivision. The major redevelopment taking place at the Twinbrook Metro station will include replacing the large, underutilized parking lots attached to the station and replacing them with Metro parking structures and high-density retail and residential development in the essence a town square. Some development has already taken place, for additional slated for the near future. Additionally, the revitalization of the dated and somewhat degraded Twinbrook Mart and Twinbrook Shopping Center retail developments on Veirs Mill Road has also been planned.

Design and development The wood and fabric D.VII was a development of the Sch√ºtte-Lanz D.III fighter which had participated without distinction in the first D type (single seat biplane fighter) competition held in late January 1918. Changes included longer span wings, more effective ailerons and a more powerful version of the Mercedes D.III engine, the Mercedes D.IIIav√º. It first flew in May 1918 and was ready for the second D type competition, held from late May through June. The wings of the two fighters had much in common: both were single bay biplanes with N-form interplane struts, dihedral only on the upper plane and slight stagger. Though the span of the D.VII was greater, both fighters had upper and lower wings of equal span but narrower lower chords. Over most of the span the wings were straight and parallel edged but the ailerons increased in chord outwards, widening the outer wing. The D.VII differed in having ailerons on both upper and lower planes. In contrast to the D.III's airfoil section upper wing radiator the D.VII had a car-type rectangular cross-section one mounted in the nose immediately in front of the Mercedes engine. The fuselage behind was flat sided and plywood covered, though with a rounded decking; the single open cockpit was at the wing trailing edges, both of which had cut-outs to aid the pilot's vision. In side view the fuselage of the shorter D.VII was less slender than its predecessor. Its tailplane, placed on top of the fuselage, had a higher aspect ratio and carried a single piece elevator; its vertical tail was taller and narrower, the balanced rudder ending above the elevator. The fixed conventional undercarriage had a single axle mounted on a pair of V-struts, aided by a tailskid mounted at the extreme tail. Despite its disappointing competition performance, the three prototypes continued developmental testing up to the Armistice in November.

It was adopted after a period of conflict which included the Bear River Massacre on January 29, 1863. The treaty had little effect until 1968, when the United States compensated the Northwestern band for their land claim at a rate of about 50¬¢ per acre. Background Of the large and disparate Shoshone nation, about ten villages of people lived in the \\"Northwest\\" area and followed Chief Bear Hunter. They understood how to live in the desert and followed a pattern of seasonal migrations.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 40. Incursions by the California Trail, the Oregon Trail and the Mormon pioneers created conflict between the Shoshone and the white settlers. The Shoshone attacked and killed a relatively small proportion of white immigrants‚Äîusually people who encroached far into Shoshone lands.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), pp. 41‚Äì42. \\"Careful research into the peak years of overland emigration, 1840 through 1860, shows that of more than 300,000 white travelers, only 362 were killed by Indians. Very few were killed by the celebrated tribes of the Great Plains. [...] the vast majority of clashes and killings between natives tribes and westbound settlers occurred in the heart of the Shoshoni homelands. The 3rd California Volunteers, led by Patrick Edward Connor, initiated military contact with the Shoshone around October 31, 1860, when they executed \\"about 14 or 15 Indians\\" in retaliation for a reported attack on a wagon train.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 52.Madsen, \\"Encounter\\" (1984), p. 10. More were taken hostage and then killed when they did not produce Indians culpable for the wagon attack.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 53. Violent conflict between the two groups continued.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 59. Although the Mormon settlers generally disapproved of these actions by the U.S. military, they also became fearful of violent Indians, and executed an Indian resident of Brigham City after a dispute over payment.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 77. Conditions for the Shoshone deteriorated quickly.Madsen, \\"Encounter\\" (1984), p. 11. The U.S. military launched an attack of unprecedented size on the Indian groups.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 87. On January 29, 1863, they encountered a number of Indians at Bear River. The exact intensity of the battle that followed is not fully known. The U.S. troops used howitzers, rifles, and pistols to kill several hundred Indians (including women and children), in an incident now called the Bear River Massacre.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), pp. 102‚Äì105. After the Indians were militarily defeated, the U.S. soldiers raped and violently attacked the survivors.Madsen, \\"Encounter\\" (1984), p. 22. According to Shoshone oral histories, Chief Bear Hunters was captured and tortured before he was killed.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 106. This killing had a devastating effect on the indigenous people of the Great Basin, and compelled many groups to accept treaties in 1863.Fleisher, The Bear River Massacre (2004), p. 66. White settlers in the Great Basin accused the Shoshone band led by Chief Pocatello of ongoing hostility. According to one story, Pocatello had been hostile to White people since around 1860, when his father was hanged by settlers in wagon train.King, \\"Do Not Execute Chief Pocatello\\" (1985), pp. 240‚Äì241. James Duane Doty and General Patrick Edward Connor were the lead negotiators for the United States. Pocatello was the lead negotiator for the Indian groups.Wilkins, Masking of Justice (1997), pp. 141‚Äì142. Some of the bands who agreed to the treaty had been reduced to just a few members after the events of January.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), pp. 124‚Äì125. Terms The treaty calls for peaceable relations between the two groups. It contains a promise by the U.S. to pay the Shoshone $5,000 yearly as compensation for the \\"utter destitution\\" inflicted by war. It also recognizes the claim of Chief Pocatello and his people to the land \\"bounded on the west by the Raft River and on the east by the Porteneuf Mountains\\".  Ratification  The U.S. Congress ratified the treaty, amending an additional article: > Article V: Nothing herein contained shall be construed or taken to admit any > other or greater title or interest in the lands embraced within the > territories described in said treaty in said tribes or bands of Indians than > existed in them upon the acquisition of said territories from Mexico by the > laws thereof. This amendment counteracted the Shoshone's land claim, which had never been incorporated into Spanish or Mexican law. Lincoln announced the treaty publicly on January 17, 1865.  Outcome  After the treaty was signed, most of the Northwestern Shoshone gathered in the Cache Valley and Box Elder County. The U.S. successfully moved many of them to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho after establishing it in 1868. Others converted to Mormonism and assimilated into Utah settler culture.William B. Fawcett & Walter Robert Lewelling, \\"Lemuel's Garden: Confronting Issues of Race, Class, and Power Through the Preferential Preservation of Archaeological Sites in Northern Utah\\"; in Lines That Divide: Historical Archaeologies of Race, Class, and Gender, ed. James A. Delle, Stephen A. Mrozowski, & Robert Paynter; Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000; pp. 43‚Äì44.Crawford, \\"The People of Bear Hunter\\" (2007), p. 30. Indians were forcefully ejected from areas they attempted to settle within their supposed territory. Continuing white immigration destroyed the ecosystems upon which they relied and made their nomadic life impossible.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 130. They were resettled on a 500-acre tract in Box Elder County, which was owned and administered by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).Crawford, \\"The People of Bear Hunter\\" (2007), pp. 30‚Äì32. Later, they were encouraged to move to the Fort Hall Reservation.Miller, Massacre at Bear River (2008), p. 131. Outside humanitarian assistance to the Shoshone came not from the U.S. government but eventually from the LDS Church headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Chief Pabawena wrote Utah Senator Arthur V. Watkins in 1949 to report:Grattan-Aiello, \\"Watkins and the Termination of Utah's Southern Paiute Indians\\", pp. 279‚Äì280. > We are the northwestern band of the Shoshone pretty poor conditions and > their childrens starving there fathers no work everything pretty hard for us > no money. And later in 1949: > We are have received no anything from the Government since the treaty was > made in Box Elder treaty on July 30, 1863.  Action in U.S. legal system  In 1927‚Äì1929, the U.S. Congress passed a law allowing the United States Court of Claims to hear arguments from the Northwestern Shoshone. The Northwestern Shoshone brought a lawsuit in 1930 alleging that the U.S. had reneged on promises made in the Treaty. In 1942, the Court of Claims denied their claim. The U.S. at first told the Shoshone that they were owed $10,800.17; this decision was reversed after the U.S. invoked previous monies it had spent on Indian affairs.Wilkins, Masking of Justice (1997), pp. 143‚Äì144. \\"The Court of Claims ruled in 1942 that the Shoshone were not entitled to any recovery under the treaty of July 3, 1863, or any other treaty for a taking of any portion of their lands described in the agreements. The Shoshone were initially informed that they were entitled to recover $10,800.17 for unfulfilled treaty annuities. But, upon a further hearing, even this amount was dismissed on the grounds that the United States‚Äô gratuitous expenditures offset this amount.\\" =Northwestern Shoshone v. United States= The Supreme Court took the case and ruled in Northwestern Shoshone v. United States that the Box Elder Treaty was a non-binding \\"treaty of friendship\\".Parry, \\"The Northwestern Shoshone\\" (2000), pp. 70‚Äì71. The Court split 5‚Äì4 on its decision. Stanley F. Reed wrote in the majority opinion that the signatories of the treaty \\"did not intend\\" to respect the Shoshone's right to the land in question. The majority opinion says that, as the original signatories were dead and the situation of their descendants was hopeless, white people had a \\"moral obligation\\" to address the \\"sociological\\" problem, but not a legal obligation under a treaty.Wilcomb E. Washburn, ‚Äò‚ÄôRed Man‚Äôs Land, White Man‚Äôs Law: The Past and Present Status of the American Indian‚Äô‚Äô, 1971; second edition, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1995; p 102. Robert H.

The Commission found on 13 February 1968 that 38,319,000 acres had been wrongfully taken from the northwestern Shoshone. Subtracting acres awarded by the Fort Hall Reservation and Wind River Reservation, it awarded $15,700,000‚Äîa price of slightly less than $0.50 per acre. =Attempted termination= Watkins and other members of Congress sought to \\"terminate\\" the special relationship with the Northwestern Shoshone in 1957.

He also performed positional drills and met with team representatives and scouts from 29 NFL teams.

He was ranked the eighth best defensive end prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. =Washington Redskins= The Washington Redskins selected Murphy in the second round (47th overall) of the 2014 NFL Draft. Murphy was seen as a long-term solution for the possible departure of Brian Orakpo, who was franchise tagged and was designated to be a free agent after 2014. 2014 On May 23, 2014, the Washington Redskins signed Murphy to a four-year, $4.47 million contract that includes $2.61 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $1.57 million.

Murphy gained over 30 lbs in order to be better suited to play the role. On August 8, 2016, it was reported that the move to defensive end was cancelled after Junior Galette, who was taking over the starting strongside linebacker role, suffered an achilles injury. Head coach Jay Gruden named Murphy the backup strongside linebacker behind Preston Smith to start the regular season. On September 18, 2016, Murphy returned to defensive end after the line had multiple injuries and was had underwhelming performances. He had six combined tackles and made two sacks on Dak Prescott in their 27-23 loss. This marked his first multi-sack game of his career.

On August 11, 2017, Murphy underwent an MRI and it was discovered he had suffered a torn ACL. He was placed in injured reserve and missed the entire 2017 season. =Buffalo Bills= Washington Redskins On March 14, 2018, Murphy signed a three-year $22.5 million contract with the Buffalo Bills.

Solomon (1889‚Äì1982), an American neurologist, psychiatrist, researcher, administrator, and clinician, was among the first to advocate for major changes in public psychiatry. He called for the closure of large, public mental hospitals and replaced with community-based facilities. Early life Solomon was born in Hastings, Nebraska. His family moved to Los Angeles, California where he received his early education. He earned his B.S. degree at the University of California, Berkeley in 1910, and his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1914. His entered the field of neurology and psychiatry during his second year at Harvard while studying at the State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers, Massachusetts. The Boston Psychopathic Hospital opened in 1912 as a division of the Boston State Hospital. Solomon took his internship and his residency there, then hired as a staff physician. Dr. Elmer E. Southard, the Bullard professor of Neuropathology at Harvard University was then the Superintendent of the Boston Psychopathic Hospital and Solomon studied under him. On June 27, 1916, Solomon married Maida Herman. Maida joined him at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, where she soon became prominent figure in the developing field of psychiatric social work. Neurosyphilis frequently occurrence then, and in 1917, Solomon and Southard co-authored a book on its diagnosis and treatment. Solomon served at a U.S. Army base hospital in France during World War I. Solomon remained at Boston Psychopathic Hospital and was its superintendent from 1943 to 1958.

Plot Ellen (Sayburn) Jessman returns from a skiing vacation and Steve Keiver is at the airport to pick her up in his pal Harry's taxi. Keiver wants to marry Ellen, but as an insurance company's investigator, he doesn't make much money and knows that concerns her. Keiver's boss, Manston, can't give him a raise, but mentions in passing how the recovery of some stolen furs would be worth $10,000, the company being off the hook for the insurance. Keiver bravely but recklessly approaches known mobsters, explaining the proposal. After being roughed up, he eventually cuts a deal and gets a $2,500 bonus from his boss. But when he brings Ellen a diamond ring, he learns she's left town, having married a wealthy man while on vacation. A bitter Keiver decides to keep making deals with criminals for returned stolen merchandise, no questions asked. He makes a lot of money and begins dating colleague Joan Brenson, who has always been attracted to him. But he carries a torch for Ellen, and when she's back in town, Keiver tries to win her back, now that he's rich. The police resent Keiver's activities. What he is doing is legal, but barely. Inspector Duggan puts his man O'Bannion on the case. Ellen and Joan end up together in a large women's lounge at intermission of a Broadway show. Two women rob all the ladies there of their jewelry and flee. Outside the theater, they remove their wigs and turn out to be men. Joan, broken-hearted that Keiver has gone back to Ellen, brings him a message from Harry where he can retrieve the stolen gems. Franko, a mobster who swims in a pool for exercise, has them, but Keiver is double-crossed. Knocked out, the jewels taken from him, Keiver suspects either Joan or Harry of betraying him, but it turns out Ellen has. She's got the jewels and is after the money herself, along with husband Gordon, but is shocked when Franko decides to torture her to find out where they are hidden. Franko then murders both Ellen and Gordon and ends up underwater with Keiver in a fight to the death. A stronger swimmer, Franko wins, but when he surfaces, Duggan and other armed cops are waiting for him. Keiver is pulled from the pool and survives. Joan is still in love with him.

Jean Hagen is quite attractive and credible as the girl he finally comes to love, while Arlene Dahl is merely attractive as the double-crossing charmer he yearns for before he sees the light.

Critic Craig Butler liked the film and wrote, \\"A tasty little 'B' level noir thriller, No Questions Asked is the kind of neat little film that, despite its flaws, exerts a hold on the viewer. Sidney Sheldon's screenplay starts out with a slam-bang opening, leading into a flashback that captivates for a good while before losing its way a bit in the middle and then getting back on track in time for a good, solid climax.\\"Butler, Craig. Allmovie by Rovi, film review, no date. Accessed: July 30, 2013. Dennis Schwartz called the film, \\"An efficiently done film noir about an insurance fraud resulting in a double- cross...\\" And added, \\"It was strictly a B movie with an ordinary and predictable story, and with below average acting. If you ask no questions about it, it is mildly enjoyable. Otherwise the film never quite faces up to the moral implications of Sullivan and his cabbie friend, as they do business with criminals while thinking they are not doing anything wrong. When Sullivan gets his comeuppance, it's done in a breezy style that is not all that convincing. The screenwriter was Sidney Sheldon, who by the 1970s was to go on to bigger and better things in the mystery genre.\\"Schwartz, Dennis . Ozus' World Movie Reviews, October 30, 2001.

In 1452 Walton was made Abbot of Osney, and in 1472 was elected as Archbishop of Dublin, and consecrated in England. In 1478 he managed through the Irish Parliament to obtain the restitution of some manors alienated by his predecessors. During his tenure Pope Sixtus IV authorized the re-establishment of the unsuccessful University of Dublin, but the plan was not carried out. Walton kept out of politics, and was overshadowed by his suffragan, William Sherwood, Bishop of Meath. He was completely unable to control Sir James Keating, the violent and turbulent Prior of the Order of Knights Hospitallers of Kilmainham. When he was replaced as Prior by Marmaduke Lumley in 1482, Keating had Lumley seized and imprisoned. Despite repeated orders from both Walton and the Archbishop of Armagh, Keating refused to release Lumley, who died in prison. In 1484, blind and in bad health, he resigned the archbishopric. He retired to his manor of Swords, Dublin. On 17 March 1489 he emerged to preach a sermon for the Feast day of St. Patrick before the Lord Deputy at his former cathedral. He died soon afterwards, leaving bequests to Osney Abbey, where he had hoped to be buried, were his death to have occurred in England.

The boy supplements his immense knowledge of nature with book learning of society and polite customs. A party of ultra-rich people led by James Heatherton (Sherry) arrive and camp on the land, building a tent city for their luxurious convenience.

Description The genus includes evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees. The leaves are glandular and aromatic, containing essential oils. They are alternately arranged. They are usually pinnate, divided into up to 23 leaflets, except for M. diversifolium, which sometimes has undivided leaf blades. The leaflet edges are smooth or toothed. There are sometimes glandular stipules. The inflorescence is a large panicle, sometimes flat-topped like a corymb, growing from the leaf axils or at the ends of branches. The flowers have five narrow petals in shades of green, white, or yellow, borne in a hairy, cup-like calyx with five lobes or five separate sepals. The odor of the flowers has been described as \\"malodorous\\" and \\"foetid\\". There are 10 stamens and 1 to 5 styles. The genus is noted for the unusual curving or twisting of the chambers in the ovary. The fruit is a berry up to a centimeter long. It is yellow, orange, or red, and sometimes fleshy, but it lacks the pulp present in some related fruits, notably citrus. The peel is gland-dotted. Each fruit has 1 to 3 seeds. The plants vary in form, with M. hirsutum being a low shrub sometimes less than a tallKey to the species of Micromelum. Chapter 3: The Botany of Citrus and its Wild Relatives. and M. integerrimum being a tree which can exceed in height. Taxonomy The genus Micromelum was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume in Bijdragen tot de Flora van Nederlandsch Indie and the first species described was Micromelum pubescens, now regarded as a synonym of Micromelum minutum. There are several subfamilies in the citrus family, with genus Citrus classified in the Aurantioideae. Micromelum belongs to the other tribe in this subfamily, Clauseneae. It is the only genus of the subtribe Micromelinae that are known technically as the \\"very remote citroid fruit trees\\".Swingle, W. T., rev. P. C. Reece.

Over the last three decades, his music has moved from post-punk and classically bent post-minimal styles, through Balinese-inspired gamelan and microtonality, to ambient, electronic soundscapes involving many layers of acoustic and electronically amplified instruments. Throughout its evolution, his music has consistently contained a \\"...a driving and rather harsh energy redolent of rock, as well as a clean sense of melodicism...intricate cross-rhythms rarely let up...\\" Known as a producer and co-producer of live musical events, he has presented many concerts of his own and other composers, including a 2013 Guinness World Record-breaking performance of 175 electronic keyboards in NYC. He is the creator of International Strange Music Day (August 24) and the pioneer of the electric guitar procession Tilted Axes.

In the early 1960s Davis had two clinics in the Potts Point and Arncliffe suburbs of Sydney where he carried out discreet terminations up until 1971, when abortion was legalised in New South Wales. Though Davis was originally an anaesthetist, he is known for his work with late term abortions. Davis had worked with Population Services International, the International Fertility Research Program, and International Planned Parenthood Federation in the 1960s. Davis also did research on prior induced abortion. Davis is best known for his work in performing late-term abortions following the mass rapes during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Davis worked in a victim relief programme in Dhaka in the year following the liberation war at the request of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation. In conjunction with Leonard Laufe, Davis set up \\"industrial scale procedures\\" of abortion in the year following the war. Between them they carried out 95 percent of terminations which had resulted from the mass rapes. Davis also travelled for months in remote areas to carry out terminations. Davis has estimated that up to 400,000 women and children had been raped by the Pakistani armed forces and their collaborators, the Al-Badr (\\"the moon\\") the Al-Shams (\\"the sun\\") and the Razakars. In addition to carrying out terminations Davis also worked with international adoption agencies in trying to find families for the children who were unwanted due to cultural beliefs. Davis died on 3 October 2008 in Australia.

The site is located on what was once a shoreline of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan and is best known for the cupules, which are small pits dug out of the rock surface and found on hundreds of boulders in the area. This site was the primary locality used by archaeologists Robert Heizer and Martin Baumhoff to define the \\"Pit and Groove Style\\" of rock art, which is thought by many to be the oldest type of rock art found in Nevada. It does share certain characteristics with other Great Basin rock art known to be of great antiquity called Great Basin Carved Abstract. Specifically, the depth of engraving and the width of the engraved lines are much greater than other rock art types that appear to be of more recent manufacture, a characteristic also noted elsewhere. Archaeologist Karen Nissen included Grimes Point in her analyses of rock art sites in western Nevada and concluded that rock art was generally associated with hunting locales, an idea popular at that time but somewhat less so today. The site is located off U.S. 50 east of Fallon and open to the public year-round.

Few other museum quality dollhouses meet such criteria. The Astolat Dollhouse Castle was once on display at the Tee Ridder division of the Nassau County Museum of Art in New York City.  History and description  North tower; towards wizard's lair Inspired by Alfred Tennyson's poetry about the Lady of Astolat, Astolat Dollhouse Castle was created between 1974 and 1987 primarily by master miniaturist Elaine Diehl with support and assistance from artisans throughout the world. In addition to its 9-foot height, it has 29 rooms, hallways, corridors, sitting areas, and windows. The Colleen Moore fairy Castle Dollhouse and the Astolat Dollhouse Castle were designed with fixed contiguous exterior walls to create a three-dimensional viewing effect. Astolat was built over a thirteen-year period. The exterior took a year to sculpt to the final finish. The interiors and adjoining areas were each constructed to the highest standards of that time. When Astolat was first installed, the museum's curator stated \\"each room is decorated with furniture, tables, chairs, artwork and lighting made by artisans from around the world, and the materials are unique and expensive.\\"Kaliski, Mary. \\"Astolat.\\" Miniature Collector Aug. 2008: 40-43. It weighs approximately 800 pounds. The interior consists of 29 rooms and adjacent areas that contain approximately 10,000 separate interior pieces. Astolat Dollhouse Castle was initially displayed in Diehl's museum shop in Sedona, Arizona until her retirement in 1996. It was a popular tourist attraction which drew people from around the world. On May 10, 1982, dollhouse creator Colleen Moore took a trip to view the Astolat Dollhouse and met with Diehl.Treasures in Miniature Authors- Editors Jeanne Delgado, Mary Durland Fields, and Anne Day Smith.

The furnishings include seven periods and styles, including Spanish, Oriental, Tudor, 18th-century English, and Victorian. The West Balcony The Dollhouse Castle's namesake was inspired by the fantasy castle \\"Astolat\\" in Alfred Tennyson‚Äôs poem Lady of Shalott. Astolat Castle has a copper roof and structural wood walls that are finished on the exterior with papier-m√¢ch√© and then sculpted to a rough faux stone finish. Some of these exterior wall panels are fixed to create a three-dimensional effect when viewers peer into the castle. Other walls can be opened or removed for group viewing. The structure was built to a 25.4 mm to 304.8 mm scale (one inch to one foot) (1:12) scale. Ownership The Astolat Dollhouse Castle was acquired by collector L. Freeman in 1996 and moved it to the Nassau County Museum of Art. Freeman is an avid collector of dollhouses and since her acquisition of the Astolat Dollhouse Castle she has continually upgraded its interiors with additional one-of-a-kind antique miniatures, tiny antique furniture, and paintings in addition to those that already existed within the structure.Toy Buildings 1880 to 1980 Authors Patty Cooper and Dian Zillner.

The chief activity of the group is the promotion of this document. Kairos is the Greek word for \\"an opportune or decisive moment\\". The document was issued at an international conference in the International Center of Bethlehem (Dar Annadwa). Among the authors of the document were Archbishop Attalah Hanna, Rev. Mitri Raheb, Rev. Naim Ateek and father Jamal Khader. The coordinator and the spokesperson of the Kairos group is Rifat Odeh Kassis the President of the International Executive Council of Defense for Children International and the General Director of its section in Palestine. In discussing the Kairos Palestine document, the drafting of which he oversaw, Kairos Palestine coordinator Kassis explained that its production took about a year and a half because of a difference of opinions. He further said that \\"more than 3,000 Palestinian Christian figures have signed and adopted it.\\" The document is available in Arabic and several European languages at the website www.kairospalestine.ps. The Kairos Palestine document The document contains the following explanation of its objectives: \\"As Palestinian Christians we hope that this document will provide the turning point to focus the efforts of all peace-loving peoples in the world, especially our Christian sisters and brothers. We hope also that it will be welcomed positively and will receive strong support. ... We believe that liberation from occupation is in the interest of all peoples in the region because the problem is not just a political one, but one in which human beings are destroyed.\\" The document's drafters describe it as \\"the Christian Palestinians‚Äô word to the world about what is happening in Palestine.\\" They express a desire \\"to see the Glory of the grace of God in this land and in the sufferings of its people,\\" and add that in this spirit they are calling on \\"the international community to stand by the Palestinian people who have faced oppression, displacement, suffering and clear apartheid for more than six decades.\\" They call the document \\"a cry of hope, with love, prayer and faith in God,\\" and say that it is addressed \\"first of all to ourselves and then to all the churches and Christians in the world, asking them to stand against injustice and apartheid, urging them to work for a just peace in our region, calling on them to revisit theologies that justify crimes perpetrated against our people and the dispossession of the land.\\" The document declares that the Occupation is a \\"sin against God\\" and that any theology that tolerates it cannot be Christian \\"because true Christian theology is a theology of love and solidarity with the oppressed, a call to justice and equality among peoples.\\" It calls on all peoples to put pressure on Israel to put an end to its oppression and disregard for international law. It also describes non-violent resistance as a \\"duty\\" for all Palestinians, including Christians. And it charges against Israel with having launched a \\"cruel war\\" against Gaza in December 2008 and January 2009; with ravaging Palestinian land \\"in the name of God and in the name of force\\"; with separating family members, thus \\"making family life impossible for thousands of Palestinians, especially where one of the spouses does not have an Israeli identity card\\"; with restricting religious liberty for Christians and Muslims; with lack of consideration for refugees and prisoners; with turning \\"Jerusalem, city of reconciliation,\\" into \\"a city of discrimination and exclusion, a source of struggle rather than peace\\"; and with holding \\"international law and international resolutions\\" in \\"contempt.\\" The document argues that an end to occupation is a precondition for an end to Palestinian resistance, not the other way around: \\"if there were no occupation, there would be no resistance, no fear and no insecurity.\\" If Israelis end the occupation, \\"they will see a new world in which there is no fear, no threat but rather security, justice and peace.\\" The document further rejects biblical arguments for Zionism as a perversion of \\"the love of God and His providence in the life of both peoples and individuals.\\" It calls Palestinians' \\"connectedness to this land ... a natural right,\\" not just \\"an ideological or a theological question\\" but \\"a matter of life and death.\\" It describes \\"the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land\\" as \\"a sin against God and humanity\\" that \\"distorts the image of God.\\" And it declares \\"that any theology, seemingly based on the Bible or on faith or on history, that legitimizes the occupation, is far from Christian teachings, because it calls for violence and holy war in the name of God Almighty, subordinating God to temporary human interests, and distorting the divine image in the human beings living under both political and theological injustice.\\" The document goes on to declare that \\"Love is the commandment of Christ our Lord to us\\" and that it means \\"seeing the face of God in every human being.\\" Yet this \\"does not mean accepting evil or aggression on their part.\\" Love, rather, \\"seeks to correct the evil and stop the aggression.\\" Therefore, Christian love compels that the Israeli occupation of Palestine be resisted. While calling for \\"civil disobedience\\" and \\"respect of life,\\" the document also \\"high esteem for all those who have given their life for our nation\\" and affirms the importance of citizens defending their \\"life, freedom and land.\\" It endorses the BDS movement and rejects the idea of \\"a religious state\\" in the Holy Land. Reaction to the document The document has been used in many Christian groups and denominations to encourage Christian opposition to Israel. It has never been officially adopted by the World Council of Churches. It has also drawn criticism from both Jewish and Christian groups. In 2010, a gathering of church leaders in South Africa endorsed the document. A report on this endorsement noted that \\"support for Palestinians in Christian circles is gaining moral traction and theological legitimacy\\" and described this as \\"a very important trend, especially considering the fact that Christian Zionists have been among the most vocal and influential in support of the state of Israel.\\" The Presbyterian Church of the United States (PCUSA), in addition to endorsing the basic principles of the Kairos Palestine document, issued a study guide for its members to use while examining the full document. The study guide was prepared by the Middle East Monitoring Group. In a statement released on June 24, 2011, the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) expressed its disapproval, claiming that the \\"study guide does not accurately portray the Kairos Palestine Document (KPD) for what it is: a revisionist document of hatred for Israel and contempt of Jews.\\" The Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) described the Kairos Palestine document as casting \\"a political agenda in theological garb, re-writing history, ignoring Jewish roots and presence in the Holy Land for thousands of years,\\" and placing \\"all blame for the tragic circumstances of Palestinians on Israel, and none on the actions of Palestinians who blew up innocent Israelis in restaurants and launched rockets at school buses.\\" The SWC also criticized the document for employing \\"the replacement theology that denied legitimacy of Judaism and Jews.\\" The SWC, in addition, criticized the PCUSA's study guide for failing to \\"instruct readers on both sides of the conflict.\\" Instead, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of SWC, the PCUSA's study guide \\"reads like an endorsement of the Kairos document by the leadership of the Church. Where the guide does offer suggestions for reading, it chooses almost exclusively from documents long criticized as hostile to Israel.\\" Another guide to the Kairos Palestine document was prepared by the Israel/Palestine Mission Network (IPMN), a group of activists within the PCUSA. The IPMN denounced the SWC's criticism of PCUSA's study guide, saying that the SWC's \\"tactics are shameless.\\" Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League criticized the PCUSA on July 15, 2010, for its endorsement of the document, calling the document \\"a prime example of an effort to undercut the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish State.\\" Foxman charged the document with calling \\"terror a form of legal resistance,\\" with endorsing \\"boycotts and divestment against Israel,\\" and with denying \\"any connection between biblical covenants and the Jewish people.\\" Malcolm Lowe, Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute and a critic of the document, has complained that while the document implicitly accuses Israelis of legitimizing their Zionism on biblical grounds, the document's authors \\"know ... that most Israelis do not subscribe to such a theology, but that the political theology of Hamas indeed 'calls for violence and holy war in the name of God Almighty' (or at any rate in the name of Allah).\\" Lowe has also noted that the World Council of Churches (WCC) was \\"heavily involved in the gestation of this document as part of its long-term program to promote Palestinian political aims\\" and has argued that the document \\"is meant to mobilize churches worldwide in a program of boycotts, divestment and delegitimization directed at the State of Israel.\\" Lowe has further suggested that the document's own reference to the 1985 South Africa document represents an implicit comparison of Israel with the South African apartheid regime. The heads of the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) praised the Kairos Palestine document as ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù in an April 2010 joint statement that encouraged members of both denominations to read the document, support Palestinians, and boycott Israeli West Bank products. ‚ÄúPalestinian Christian leadership,‚Äù said the joint church statement, ‚Äúhave taken the bold step of declaring this a Kairos moment, a designation not of chronological time, but of opportunity ripe for momentous action, and a moment that can be lost if the opportunity is not seized.‚Äù The Episcopal Peace Fellowship also supported the document, although the Episcocal Church overall rejected anti-Israel divestment. Episcopal Bishop John Bryson Chanel found EPF's call for divestment too ‚Äúflawed and dangerously unhelpful at this particular time in history,‚Äù telling Episcopal News Service that the sanctions called for by Palestine Kairos would ‚Äúfurther hurt the critical development of the economy of Palestine and increase the marginalization of the Palestinian people.‚Äù In its own April 15, 2010, rebuttal to the Kairos Palestine document, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) criticized it for arguing ‚Äúthat leading Israel into isolation is the only way there can be a peaceful solution in the Holy Land.‚Äù While the document professed to condemn both sides of the Israel- Palestinian struggle, it contained ‚Äúpronouncements which vindicate one side while demonizing the other,‚Äù applying one ‚Äúmoral yardstick‚Äù to Israel and another to Palestinians, and calling for action only against Israel. Noting that the document ‚Äúconsistently objects to ‚Äòthe Occupation,‚Äô without making clear that it is referring exclusively to lands occupied by Israel and in dispute since the Six-Day War of 1967,‚Äù the rabbis said that the document implicitly rejects ‚Äúthe very notion of a Jewish State.‚Äù The rabbis were additionally concerned that the document, while professing to reject violence, expressed ‚Äúrespect‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh esteem for those who have given their life for our nation,‚Äù which they interpreted as praise of suicide bombers. CCAR further said that the document ‚Äúrejects or ignores more than a half a century of Jewish-Christian rapprochement,‚Äù seeking like previous such documents ‚Äúto delegitimize the Jewish people‚Äôs continuing Covenant with God, particularly by arguing that our Covenant has been superseded by Jesus and Christianity.‚Äù Noting that ‚Äúsuch Church documents have been utilized as pretexts for our persecution, our expulsion, and even our attempted annihilation,‚Äù CCAR said that ‚Äú[s]ince the Shoah and World War II, and particularly beginning with Vatican II, the Jewish people has come to expect better from our Christian brothers and sisters. The rabbis warned that ‚ÄúCCAR would require serious reflection before continuing our common cause with any Church body or organization that endorses or continues to endorse Kairos.‚Äù =Removal of list of signatories = In response to a report of the inclusion of the widow of George Habash's signature on the report, the published list of signatories was removed from the Document's website. =Withdrawal of signature= The most prominent acting clergyman among the signatories, Evangelical Lutheran Church Bishop of Palestine and Jordan Munib Younan, has withdrawn his signature from the declaration. Controversy about prefatory statement In an extensive examination of the Kairos Palestine document and prefatory statement, Malcolm Lowe rejected the claim that the document is the work of ‚ÄúPalestinian Christian leaders‚Äù and that it enjoys the ‚Äúendorsement‚Äù of the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem. He noted that the only ‚ÄúHead of Church‚Äù involved in drafting the document was ‚ÄúArab Lutheran Bishop Munib Younan.‚Äù Lowe also claimed that some of the Heads of Churches were actually ‚Äútaken by surprise‚Äù when the document was issued, but that they were ‚Äúput under political pressure to toe the line propounded by the document‚Äù and thus ‚Äúissued a brief statement of their own‚Äù four days later. Lowe argued that this text, which is now generally treated as an official prefatory statement to the document, does not in fact constitute ‚Äúan endorsement of worldwide campaigns against the State of Israel‚Äù and ‚Äúcontains nothing that would offend people of goodwill anywhere.‚Äù Lowe suggested that the statement can even ‚Äúbe read as a mild rebuke to the authors of the document: Palestinian Christians should put their main effort into strengthening their own community rather than engaging in worldwide political agitation.‚Äù Lowe thus accused Kairos Palestine of deliberately misleading the public about the clerics‚Äô involvement, combining the document and the Heads of Churches' statement into a single PDF file on the website. ‚ÄúThe unwary reader,‚Äù complained Lowe, ‚Äúdoes not realize that the statement is no endorsement, but rather a wary reaction that seeks to divert the energies of the faithful into constructive activity within the community rather than wasting them on vain political posturing.‚Äù Lowe also noted that the name of Bishop Younan, the only recognized church leader on the document drafting team, was silently removed from the list of authors on the kairospalestine website. According to Lowe, Younan ‚Äúasked to have it removed, so as not to be compromised by it.‚Äù Younan did not want to endanger his relationships ‚Äúwith Jewish religious figures and Israeli officials,‚Äù according to Lowe. ‚ÄúReportedly,‚Äù Lowe added, ‚Äúhe now assures anyone who asks that he does not agree with everything in the document and that he is committed only to the statement of the Heads of Churches, where his name occurs near the bottom of the list.‚Äù Lowe additionally observed that Michel Sabbah, another signatory, had ‚Äúretired as Latin Patriarch early in 2008, so he spoke only for himself and not for the Latin Patriarchate.‚Äù Lowe further pointed out that in 2007 Greek Orthodox Archbishop Atallah Hanna had been suspended after publicly calling \\"for withdrawal of the official recognition of Greek Patriarch Theophilos III\\", making him not a church leader but ‚Äúan opponent of the Christian leadership.‚Äù As for the other signatories of the document, Lowe argued that they were \\"parish priests, low level officials and laypeople\\", some of whom were \\"fairly well known as long-term agitators on behalf of Palestinian political aims.\\" In short, the document did \\"not have any bona fide Christian leader among its authors.\\" Related groups Kairos Palestine is closely connected to the Palestinian Christian Initiative, with which it shares key members. This suggests that the two groups are intimately related, if not identical. Rifat Kassis, the coordinator of Kairos Palestine, is also the general director of Defence for Children International ‚Äì Palestine Section. =Kairos USA= Two years after the release of the Kairos Palestine document, a group called Kairos USA released an ‚Äúofficial response‚Äù to the document called ‚ÄúCall to Action: U.S. Response to the Kairos Palestine Document: A word of confession and faith from the churches in the United States.‚Äù https://kairosusa.org/ The document argues against American aid to Israel. Describing the original Palestinian Kairos document as ‚Äúa heartfelt, sober, prayerful, urgent cry for help to end the U.S.-backed Israeli occupation,‚Äù the Kairos USA ‚Äúresponse‚Äù began ‚Äúwith a confession of sin to Palestinians in the State of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the diaspora and in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.‚Äù The authors of the ‚Äúresponse‚Äù said that ‚ÄúAs U.S. Christians we bear responsibility for failing to say 'Enough!' when our nation's ally, the State of Israel, violates international law.‚Äù Saying that ‚Äúthe 'peace process' has continued to be no more than a means for the ongoing colonization of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the imprisonment of Gaza and the continuation of the structures of oppression,‚Äù the authors expressed remorse for the history of Christian anti-Semitism and pledged to ‚Äúwork and even suffer for peace, filled with a heart of love for both Israelis and Palestinians.‚Äù They then proceeded to describe Israel as ‚Äúpursuing a course that is fruitless and corrupting, both morally and politically.‚Äù Citing the gospels of Matthew and Luke, the authors call for BDS and nonviolent direct action against Israel. Kairos USA directly links its own document to the 1985 anti-apartheid document \\"Challenge to the Church\\", issued by Christians in South Africa. The organization lists its objects as follows: #Provide a home for American Christians in their work for a just peace in Israel/Palestine, bridging the denominational, racial, and evangelical-mainline divides. #Call for pilgrimages to the Holy Land that witness the suffering and connect with those working for peace. #Disseminate the ‚ÄúCall to Action: a U.S. Christian response to the Palestine Kairos document.‚Äù This document will be accompanied by study materials for churches, schools and local groups and serve as a catalyst for conversation, learning, connection, and action. #Develop a contemporary theology of land, peoplehood and promise that will enable clergy, scholars and laypersons to better pursue open conversation, study, and positive action. #Connect denominations, congregations, and peace organizations here in the U.S., and link to Kairos movements across the globe. #Connect with congregations in Palestine and Israel, and with civil society organizations in the region working for peace and human dignity. Kairos USA's founding document, ‚ÄúCall to Action: U.S. Response to the Kairos Palestine Document,‚Äù states that the organization's mission is ‚Äúto mobilize the churches in the United States to respond faithfully and boldly to the situation in Israel and Palestine.‚Äù The organization calls for an end to ‚ÄúIsraeli violations of international law and of American support for Israel.‚Äù The document offers ‚Äúa confession of sin to Palestinians in the State of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the diaspora and in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria,‚Äù saying that American Christians ‚Äúbear responsibility for failing to say 'Enough!' when our nation‚Äôs ally, the State of Israel, violates international law.‚Äù The organization also acknowledges with ‚Äúdeep remorse‚Äù the role of Christians in ‚Äúthe historic persecution of the Jewish people,‚Äù which ‚Äúbetrayed the teaching and example of the one we claim to follow,‚Äù and promises to act with greater ‚Äúfaithfulness, compassion and justice‚Äù in the future. It is because of Christians' past sins against Palestinians and Jews, the document continues, that Kairos USA has an obligation to ‚Äúwork and even suffer for peace, filled with a heart of love for both Israelis and Palestinians.‚Äù It acknowledges that by opposing Israeli policy, the members of Kairos USA expose themselves ‚Äúto the charge of anti-Semitism‚Äù and risk losing Jewish friends. But they are willing, they say, to take this risk in order to ‚Äúfollow Jesus‚Äô path of love and forgiveness as the way to justice and peace.‚Äù The document goes on to declare Kairos USA's support for BDS activity against Israel and for the withdrawal of U.S. support for Israel. Kairos USA argues that ‚Äúthe political process has failed to bring about the changes that will result in a just and lasting peace in Israel and Palestine,‚Äù and that it is up to ‚Äúthe churches‚Äù to lead the peace movement. Kairos USA urges ‚Äúcongregations, clergy and church leaders to become educated about the BDS movement,‚Äù insisting that ‚ÄúBDS is directed at Israeli policy, not the state itself or its citizens, and certainly not against the Jewish people.‚Äù Rather, it is ‚Äúabout promoting our own values and stated commitments by noncooperation with evil.‚Äù In January 2016, as a result of a campaign by United Methodists Kairos Respose - a group of United Methodist Church members, the Church announced it had sold its holdings in all of Israel's banks as well as an Israeli real-estate company. Israel-Palestinian Territories is on the UMC list of fourteen countries, including Eritrea, Somalia and Syria, that they believe consistently abuse Human Rights. Times of Israel 13/1/2016 =‚ÄúBethlehem Call‚Äù= A text entitled the ‚ÄúBethlehem Call‚Äù was introduced in January 2012 as an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù to the Kairos Palestine document. Posted at the WCC website, it defined Israel as an ‚Äúillegal regime,‚Äù called for ‚Äúinternational boycott, divestment and sanctions campaigns‚Äù against the Jewish state, defined Israel- friendly churches as ‚Äúaccomplices in crimes against humanity,‚Äù and rejected Christian Zionism as ‚Äúa crime and sin as defying the core of the gospel.‚Äù =‚ÄúCome and See‚Äù= Under the program ‚ÄúCome and See,‚Äù run in conjunction with tourism groups and the WCC, Kairos Palestine promotes what it calls ‚Äújustice tourism,‚Äù encouraging ‚ÄúChristian pilgrims to live their faith as they visit the holy land, going beyond homage of ancient sites to show concern for the Palestinian people living there whose lives are severely constricted by the Israeli occupation of their lands.‚Äù Such pilgrims are invited to take ‚Äúa journey of truth and transformation that will reveal the love of God to you through the eyes of the Palestinian people who, despite having suffered decades of occupation and dispossession-- maintain their dignity, faith, and capacity for hope.‚Äù Rifat Kassis, in a January 2012 article, said that Palestine Kairos seeks ‚Äúan end to unjust tourism to the Holy Land,‚Äù characterizing it as ‚Äúhistorically monopolized by Israel and its hegemonic religious and cultural discourse...in such a way that tourism itself becomes an exclusionary political tool.‚Äù Conferences The 2012 World Social Forum (WSF)-Free Palestine event, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in November and December of that year, focused considerably on the Kairos Palestine document. Kassis was present at the event, and Kairos Palestine held several presentations. Also, South African Muslim scholars issued a response document called ‚ÄúAn Islamic Response to Kairos Palestine.‚Äù The Muslim text stated, among other things: ‚ÄúWe reject the notion that the Eternally Transcendent and Almighty God is like a tribal chief or a dishonest realtor who parcels out land to his favorites, and we reject the idea our sacred texts can be abused as if they were title deeds of ownership.‚Äù International Women's Peace Service (IWPS), which also took part in the World Social Forum-Free Palestine, described Kairos Palestine as ‚Äúa movement addressing the injustice of the Occupation from a theological perspective.‚Äù Comparing Kairos Palestine to ‚Äúliberation theology, born in the darkest night of injustice and repression in Latin America,‚Äù IWPS described the group as emphasizing ‚Äúthe Biblical call for justice to denounce the injustices of Zionism.‚Äù Al-Awda co-founder Mazin Qumsiyeh represented Kairos Palestine at a Cape Town, South Africa, conference organized by Oikotree, an ecumenical group tied to the WCC. While in Cape Town, Qumsiyeh delivered a sermon at Saint George's Cathedral on March 11, 2013. Other activities In 2012, Rifat Kassis accused right-wing Israelis of attacking Christian holy sites. ‚ÄúToday, they attack holy sites in the night,‚Äù Kassis said. ‚ÄúTomorrow, they will attack the holy sites while they are filled with people, and then [it] will end [with them] bombarding churches and mosques while people are praying.‚Äù Rifat Kassis criticized the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in February 2013 for highlighting a Christian IDF officer's army service. Kassis spoke out against the conscription of Christians into the IDF and urged Christians in Israel not to allow the IDF to ‚Äúuse them as tools to violate the rights of the Palestinian people.‚Äù Kairos Palestine publicly denounced Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren after he wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed, published on March 9, 2012, implying that Palestinian Muslims were at fault for much Palestinian Christian suffering. Calling the op-ed ‚Äúinaccurate and manipulative text,‚Äù the group insisted that the suffering Palestinian Christians ‚Äúis caused mainly by the occupation that systematically degrades all Palestinians, restricts our movement, confiscates our land, devastates our economy, and violates our rights.‚Äù The group also insisted that Palestinian Christians ‚Äúrefuse to be pitted against our Palestinian Muslim neighbours and friends‚Äù and ‚Äúrefuse to let our collective oppression be manipulated in a way that fragments us, obscures us, or masks the oppression‚Äôs true cause.‚Äù Rifat Kassis, in a January 2012 article, said that Kairos Palestine was ‚Äúin the process of formulating a national Kairos movement, composed of young people; adults, both men and women; ecumenical and community-based organizations; and clergy.‚Äù The group was also ‚Äúestablishing an international ‚ÄúKairos for Global Justice‚Äù movement in the wake of a Bethlehem conference at which ‚Äú60 representatives from over 15 countries‚Äù decided to ‚Äúmobilize churches and Christian organizations‚Äù around the world to work ‚Äúfor a just peace in the region.‚Äù An April 2013 article in The Electronic Intifada described the West Bank firm SodaStream as having ‚Äúlooked to its Palestinian workers for help in cleaning up its tarnished image,‚Äù partly by means of a YouTube video ‚Äúpresenting Sodastream‚Äôs settlement factory as a happy island in the occupied West Bank.‚Äù The Electronic Intifada quoted Kairos Palestine as calling the video ‚Äúcynical at best‚Äù and ‚Äúat worst...criminally misleading,‚Äù and as describing the video's ‚Äúemphasis on SodaStream‚Äôs economic benefits for its workers... absurd and offensive: what Palestinians need is freedom, not fancier oppression. It doesn‚Äôt matter if our cage is made of iron or gold: it is a cage.‚Äù See also * Kairos Document * Palestinian Christians * Political theology in the Middle East References External links * Kairos Palestine * https://kairosusa.org/ * https://www.palestineportal.org/ Category:Christian advocacy groups Category:Christianity in the State of Palestine ","title":"Kairos Palestine"},{"id":"40114816","text":"Andamion Murataj is a film director, screenwriter and producer living in New York, NY.

(ECRI) is a crime analysis software company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company develops tools for police, military and security use. ECRI pioneered the use of geographic profiling software for serial crime analysis.  Rigel Software  ECRI‚Äôs Rigel software was first introduced in 1997 and is based on the doctoral dissertation of Dr. Kim Rossmo, who co-founded ECRI. Rossmo‚Äôs criminal geographic targeting (CGT) model, which produces a ‚Äúprobability surface‚Äù that shows the relative likelihood of the offender‚Äôs base of operations, is patented.Rossmo, D. K. (1996). U.S. Patent No. 5,781,704. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Users of the Rigel software include the national police agencies of Canada, the United States, and several European nations, as well as many smaller regional and local police forces. The software utilizes data such as crime locations, suspect information, case details and investigator details to analyze a series of linked crimes and determine the most probable locations of the offender's residence. This allows investigators to prioritize suspects and focus on areas they may have otherwise overlooked. This process has proven successful in helping to solve many crime series around the globe. = Notable Uses = Rigel was used as a tool during the Beltway sniper attacks case that took place in October 2002 in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. Rigel was also directly involved in helping the Irvine Police Department apprehend Raymond Lopez, who is known as the \\"Chair Burglar\\". In hundreds of burglaries, Lopez had the same routine of placing a chair or potted plant next to a home's fence for a quick, easy escape. Rigel identified Lopez as a suspect of interest and he was put on surveillance eventually leading to his arrest. For their work on this case the Irvine Police Department won The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) Choicepoint Award for Excellence in Criminal Investigation.

Users can sort and filter hotel rooms based on a suite score (how a room measures-up to its peers based on the size, amenities, view and hotel quality) and deal grade (how the price of the room compares with its statistical fair value). Users can also opt to incorporate common fees into prices, including in-room WiFi, parking, and resort fees. When the website launched, it covered the 30 most popular tourist cities in the United States of America.

In 2013 he was appointed Ambassador of Ecuador to the United Kingdom (12). In 2015 he was appointed to represent Ecuador as Permanent Ambassador to the World Trade Organization, headquartered in Geneva Switzerland. Throughout his career, Falconi has served his country from several high offices of government and high profile appointments, such as minister of industry and commerce in January 1991; and years later as Minister State Secretary for Production. In October 1999, after the 1998-99 crisis, in April 2000 he served as Bank Superintendent and as such he led important decisions and conducted and investigated into the Filanbanco case, the most important one at the center of said crisis. Filanbanco was owned by the Isaias Dassum brothers and was transferred to the Government in December 1998 in order to avoid the bankruptcy. Up until that time, everything pertaining to said case had remained hidden. Biography He is the son of Ricardo Falconi Ledesma, lawyer, and the writer and poet, Mar√≠a Eugenia Puig Lince. Falconi graduated from the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Guayaquil in December 19756 and three years later he obtained his Doctorate in Jurisprudence at said university. Early career =Academic activities= Early in 1975, he starter as a professor in Civil Procedural Law at the Catholic University of Guayaquil, and the following year he was appointed as Director of Studies for that area. In June 1982 he was elected as faculty representative to the Board of Directors of the College of Law at said university and was elected Dean in 1984. In August 1986 he presided over the Faculty Discipline Tribunal at said university. =Attorney at Law= In March of 1979 Juan Falconi was elected fellow of the legal section of the Guayaquil Bar Association for Civil Procedure matters. In 1985 he was appointed Chief Arbitrator of the Court of Arbitration of the Chamber of Commerce of Guayaquil and Permanent Associate Magistrate of the Superior Court of Justice of Guayaquil. In 1988, he became a member of the Advisory Commission of the Court of Constitutional Guarantees and Permanent Justice of the Supreme Court of Justice in June 1999. =Political activities= In December 1976 he became secretary of the municipality of Guayaquil. In March 1981, he became Vice President of the International Chamber of Commerce of Ecuador. He was named Minister of Industry, Trade, Integration, and Fisheries in January 1991, President of the Cartagena Agreement Commission in December 1991, President of Ecuadorian National Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce in October 1992, Secretary of State Minister for Production in October 1999, and President of the Board of Foreign Trade and Investment (COMEXI) in January 2000. Ecuadorian financial crisis and afterwards =Filanbanco Case= During the administration of President Jamil Mahuad, Ecuador eliminated its national currency, the Sucre, and adopted the United States Dollar.14 Filanbanco, for many years one of the main banking institutions of Ecuador, was considered solid enough to survive the economic crisis of 1998-99. However, due to its insolvency and lack of liquidity, Filanbanco was transferred under the management of the AGD - the Deposit Guarantee Agency, and owing to its lack of financial health, Filanbanco collapsed in 2001. The owners of Filanbanco, the Isaias Dassum brothers, did not repay the loans they had granted to themselves and taken out from the bank. In 2000, as Bank Superintendent, Dr. Juan Falconi Puig, filed a complaint against Roberto Isa√≠as, his brothers and others involved, which ended in an enforceable sentence by the Supreme Court having found Roberto Isaias, his brothers and other officers guilty as charged. Before that, Dr. Hernan Ulloa, Judge of the Supreme Court of Justice, publicly denounced, by TV and the press, having been the subject of a bribery attempt for the Isaias brothers to be exonerated along with their collaborators in said case. Then the Criminal Court, today National Court of Justice, on 10 April 2012, found Roberto Isaias, William Isaias, Juan Franco, and others guilty of embezzlement as perpetrators responsible for embezzlement. They were sentenced to 8 years of special imprisonment; and, the same court dismissed an appeal in 2013. Falconi flatly denied any responsibility for the confiscation of the Isaias family assets in 2008, however, he did say he was in favor of the measure. Almost two years after the brothers Roberto and William Isaias were sentenced, the National Court of Justice (CNJ, in Spanish) ratified, on 13 March 2014, the ruling that had sentenced the former owners of the Filanbanco to 8 years in prison for embezzlement. Given that Filanbanco had collapsed in 2001, the government filed a suit against the owners of Filanbanco, the brothers Isaias-Dassum, for embezzlement. The Criminal Court of the National Court of Justice, found Roberto Isaias, William Isaias, Juan Franco and others guilty on 10 April 2012, sentencing them to 8 years in prison; and the Cassation Court dismissed said appeal in the year 2013. 15 Falconi flatly denied being responsible for the confiscation of the Isaias family assets in 2008, however, he did say he was in favor of the measure, which was legal and belated.16 17 18 19 Almost two years after the brothers Roberto and William Isaias, the National Court of Justice (CNJ) ratified on 13 March 2014 the ruling that sentenced the former owners of Filanbanco to 8 years in prison for embezzlement.

The range was called the DL in most countries, but was called the GP (standing for Grand Prix) in Britain and some other countries. This was to associate the scooters with Formula One which was extremely popular and successful in the late 1960s.\\"Lambretta Series 3 GP Range\\", Lambretta Club of Great Britain. Retrieved 31 July 2013. History The GP/DL range was designed by Nuccio Bertone who was also acclaimed for designing several vehicles for Alfa Romeo, Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Fiat. The GP/DL range was offered with three different engine sizes: 125, 150, and 200. The three versions were visually very similar in appearance, and were much more sporty looking in comparison to the Series 3 range which they replaced. The 200cc version was fitted with an internal disc brake and had improved front suspension due to additional front dampers being fitted. In April 1971, Italian production of GP/DL Lambrettas ended with the closure of the Innocenti factory in Milan. The Indian Government purchased the production rights and the tooling from Innocenti and continued production of GP/DL scooters under the Scooters India Ltd (SIL) brand until 1996, with only minor cosmetic changes, eg addition of indicators, made. However, the quality of these SIL produced Lambrettas never matched that of the Innocenti produced machines principally due to the lack of quality control procedures at the SIL factory and the degradation over time of the original press and form tools. As of 2017, limited spares for the GP/DL range are still manufactured by SIL; SIL makes complete engines/engine cases for the GP/DL 150/200. The production of body panels and frames has been discontinued by SIL. However, third party/non- OE body panels, cosmetic items, electrical items are still available in large quantities and qualities throughout India. As of 2017, there is a wide and increasing range of spares and performance upgrades available from various Italian and U.K. aftermarket providers, including more robust engine cases, larger capacity cylinder kits, a twin-cylinder 275cc engine, carburettors, exhaust systems, 5-speed gearboxes and hydraulic disc brakes and suspension systems.  Design  The range was designed by Nuccio Bertone and was made shorter with a rectangular headset and slimmer leg shields. It also had black trim and a new shaped mudguard to make the GP/DL look more sporting. Despite the revised styling, the new model still shared many inter-changeable parts with the earlier series III scooters. An ink splat was used as the logo for the DL, because it was reported that Bertone once threw down his ink pen in frustration of his designs not being appreciated ‚Äì the resultant ink pattern being used as the logo, but in the United Kingdom the GP used a checkered flag. The GP Electronic was designed between Innocenti and Ducati and came with an electronic ignition. However, only approximately 200 were produced before production ceased. The GP came in Turquoise, White, Orange, Red & Yellow Orche paint colours with panel colours Red or Blue.

Built in 1891, it was Milwaukee's first skyscraper, and was the tallest building in Milwaukee until the Milwaukee City Hall was finished four years later. The Pabst Building was demolished in 1981 and the 100 East Wisconsin Building now occupies its site. Having stood at tall, the Pabst Building is the 2nd tallest building ever demolished in Wisconsin. History and description Pabst Building ca 1900 The property at the northwest corner of Water and Wisconsin Street was prime central location of historic significance. Solomon Juneau's original cabin and trading post had stood at this spot on the Milwaukee River, considered the \\"starting point\\" of the city. In 1851 the Ludington Block building was built here. Around 1890 the property was purchased by brewer Frederick Pabst, who demolished the Ludington building and hired architect Solon Spencer Beman to design his headquarters, a magnificent symbol of his brewery empire, in its place. The Pabst Building measured fourteen stories, about 235 feet tall from the sidewalk to the top of the copper tower. It was constructed of brown brick ornamented with terra cotta with a magnificent granite arch at its entrance. The main tower was topped with copper, featuring four large clock faces. The style has been described as \\"a masterpiece of Romanesque Revival\\" and as a \\"neo-gothic high- rise, with Flemish detailing.\\" It quickly became an iconic building of Milwaukee and a popular subject for postcards. The Pabst was Milwaukee‚Äôs first skyscraper, and held the title of tallest building in Milwaukee for four years, until the Milwaukee City Hall was completed. The Pabst building saw many alterations to its roofline over the years. In the late 1940s the copper towers were removed due to deterioration and the rooflines were squared off. In 1981 it was demolished to make way for 100 East Wisconsin. The crown of the new building was inspired by the Pabst Building's design.

Despite having broken with the Muslim Brotherhood, Uqla was only officially dismissed from his position as leader of the Fighting Vanguard in April 1982, following the Hama Massacre. Many leaders of the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood fled to Iraq, and although the Iraqi government welcomed the political leaders, it refused to provide refuge to leaders of the Fighting Vanguard. According to some reports Uqla was arrested when trying to sneak back into Syria in 1983 or 1984, after being refused refuge in Iraq.

Bookless libraries are public, academic and school libraries that do not have any printed books. Instead they offer all-digital collections of literary works, reading material and scientific and academic research material. A bookless library typically uses the space that would have once been used for books to offer public computers, e-readers and other technology used to consume and produce digital media. Over the last decade, driven by changes in scholarly communication, several major research libraries have successfully become bookless. Outlook Bookless libraries are often considered a potential model for future libraries, with modernization, increased availability of space and lower costs cited as potential benefits. However, bookless libraries face many challenges, including the public's strong attachment to print media in libraries. In 2002 the Santa Rosa Branch Library offered a digital-only library to patrons, only to bring books back into the library after a surge in public demand. Problems with access and copyright also limit the utility of bookless libraries, since a majority of digital content is still not available for borrowing online and much more has never been digitized. Library patrons are also resistant to the idea. In a 2013 Pew survey, only 20% of Americans said libraries should \\"definitely move some print books and stacks out of public locations to free up more space for things such as tech centers, reading rooms, meetings rooms, and cultural events.\\" Examples A digital bookmobile In 2012, the William H. Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University closed its physical building and moved completely online. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve looked at the trends and seen that use of the building has gone down, the circulation of paper material has gone down, at the same time we‚Äôve seen very large increases in the use of online materials,\\" said the library's director, Nancy Roderer, in a 2012 interview with Library Journal. \\"That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the right thing for other libraries but it is the right thing for us.\\" In transitioning to a learning commons model, William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, replaced its print media with online resources in its reimagined library. The new Florida Polytechnic University library is also free of print media. The Director of Libraries, Kathryn Miller, notes the importance of access to information, regardless of form. \\"We want our students to recognize when they have an information need,\\" she said, \\"and be able to locate the relevant information to apply it in a scholarly and, ultimately, professional way.\\" Public libraries are also exploring bookless buildings. The BiblioTech library is one of the first bookless public libraries. Benilde-St. Margaret's, a Catholic preparatory school, removed nearly all printed books from its collection in 2011.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Orillia, Ontario. Background Flower-class corvettes like Orillia serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction and career Ordered 1 February 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program, Orillia was laid down by Collingwood Shipyards on 4 March 1940. Launched 1 September she was commissioned later that year on 25 November at Collingwood, Ontario. She was sent to Halifax to join the convoys. HMCS Orillia, in right background, with C4 Escort Group off the coast of Northern Ireland Orillia was first assigned to Halifax Local Defence Force upon arrival. She served with them until 23 May 1941 when she was assigned as an original member of Newfoundland Escort Force operating out of St. John's, Newfoundland. During this time she was assigned to convoy SC 42, a slow convoy. Orillia was part of an escort group that included the destroyer HMCS Skeena, and corvettes HMCS Alberni and Kenogami. The convoy sailed directly into the path of a U-boat wolfpack of 14 u-boats. During the running battle the Orillia dropped back to pick up survivors and eventually stood by the damaged tanker Tahchee and towed her to Iceland. However the commander, Lieutenant Commander Ted Briggs, RNCR, failed to notify his senior officer that he was doing so for some time, depriving the convoy of one of her few escorts. Though a great humanitarian gesture this added to the mayhem within the convoy. Sixteen ships were sunk during the battle. On 24 December 1941 she was sent for a refit at Halifax. Upon completion of the refit she joined Escort Group (EG) C-1 and was sent to work up at Tobermory for three weeks. Orillia spent until January 1944 escorting convoys on the Newfy-Derry run. She joined Escort Group C-2 in November 1942 and worked with them until her next refit in March 1944. Orillia was sent to Liverpool for a lengthy refit, where they lengthened her fo'c'sle. After completing the refit she spent the rest of the war as part of EG W-2. She was paid off on 2 July 1945 at Sorel. The ship was sold for scrapping in January 1951 and broken up in Hamilton, Ontario.

Details and aftermath  The shock killed one person and injured several others. Because it was a deep-focus earthquake, shaking occurred over an extensive area, including San Juan, Bogot√°, Caracas, Buenos Aires, and S√£o Paulo; it was felt as far north as Mexico City. Its depth forestalled more serious casualties, and there were no aftershocks. The depth of the earthquake prompted scientists in South America to install seismometer networks focused on long-period earthquakes. Until the 1994 Bolivia earthquake, the 1970 Colombia earthquake was famous among seismologists as the largest deep earthquake.Russakoff, Ekstrom, and Tromp, pg. 20423.  Analysis  A study completed by Dziewonski and Gilbert (1974) determined that the earthquake had featured isotropic compression, or an increase in density near the rupture point similar to an implosion; this was released to great controversy. They also claimed that the compression had been initiated 80 seconds before the actual earthquake's short-period shaking. Many studies have reached differing conclusions including a dearth of isotropic movement, and many scientists feel that resolution created errors in Dziewonski and Gilbert's findings.Russakoff, Ekstrom, and Tromp, pg. 20424. In 1997, Russakoff, Ekstrom, and Tromp reassessed their findings utilizing more advanced equipment that factored in shear wave splitting and coupling (the measure of how tightly locked two sides of a fault or plate are) and confirmed that there was very little isotropic compression.

He also advised Jan van Eijk in his work on Lillooet and Hank Nater in his work on Nuxalk and did import work on comparative Salishan. After obtaining his PhD at Columbia University in 1951 with the study A contribution to the analysis of the Qabardian language, Kuipers was on the faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1951 to 1954. During those years, as well as in the course of a 1956 field trip, he collected extensive material on the Squamish language.

She has also held visiting appointments at New York University, Tufts University, and Princeton University. Brison's work has succeeded in increasing the amount of attention that philosophy, as a field, pays to issues of rape and domestic violence. Education and career Brison graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and went on to receive both a master's degree and a PhD from the University of Toronto. She has also previously been a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies, an independent postgraduate institution in New Jersey. Research areas Brison's work has covered a wide variety of areas including mental representation, free speech theory, sexual violence, and other issues in social, feminist, political, and legal philosophy. Most of her work is tied together by the common theme of anti-individualism. Brison is a politically engaged philosopher, and focuses on connecting her theory work with people's lived experiences, and looks for topics where she can use her analytic philosophic training to advance social justice. Brison also holds a much more limited view of the bounds of free speech than many of her contemporaries do, arguing that free speech can justifiably be limited. Publications Brison has written a number of articles in peer-reviewed journals and in anthologies, including pieces in Ethics, Nomos, and Legal Theory. Brison has written one book, Aftermath, and co-edited a volume, Contemporary Perspectives On Constitutional Interpretation. She is also co-authoring a forthcoming book called Debating Pornography, which talks about internal divisions in feminism that appeared in the 1970s and continue to this day about how best to approach the subject of pornography.

The book uses the personal lens of her own experience of being violently raped to examine the effects of sexual violence on identity, discussing the initial disintegration of identity that occurs with severe personal trauma and its subsequent reconstruction. While speaking of her lived experience, Brison argues that narratively understanding one's experience of rape can significantly help a survivor recover from harm. Aftermath has been described as Brison's attempt to rejoin two major parts of her life: she is a woman who has been sexually assaulted and also an analytic philosopher. = Anthology chapters = * References Category:Living people Category:20th- century American philosophers Category:American women philosophers Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Susan Brison"},{"id":"40115935","text":"KF Zajazi (, ) is a football club based in the village of Zajaz, K√´r√ßov√´, North Macedonia. They are currently competing in the Macedonian Third League (West Division). KF Zajazi was founded in 1979. The club's major success was achieved in the season 2012‚Äì13 when they won the Macedonian Third League ‚Äì West. Then in the play off game they faced FK Babi Stip which they won 1‚Äì0 and got promoted to the Macedonian Second League for the first time in their history. History =Early years 1977‚Äì2000= KF Zajazi's first ever squad in 1977 KF Zajazi was founded in 1977, but they didn't play a competitive match until 1979, so their official foundation by the Macedonian Football Federation is recognized as 1979 instead of 1977. Before entering a competitive league, KF Zajazi mainly played friendly matches against other local teams. Since the breakup of the Republic of Macedonia from Yugoslavia and the declaration of independence, KF Zajazi have mainly played their trade in the 4th and 3rd Macedonian Football Leagues. =First success 2001‚Äì2011= KF Zajazi's 2011‚Äì2012 Squad It was the 2001‚Äì02 season when KF Zajazi for the first time was considered for being as one of the favorites for a promotion in the Second Macedonian Football League, with the city rivals FK Vlazrimi being the other one. And as it was expected both teams lived up to their expectations. In a very intense season, both teams managed to beat their respective city rivals at their home games, with the KF Zajazi's win being the most dramatic one, as they won against FK Vlazrimi 1‚Äì0 in the penultimate fixture of the season, thus tying them in the top of the table with equal points. Both teams managed to win their last season games away from homes and they both finished on the top of the table with equal points. The Football Federation of Macedonia decided that a play off match has to be played between the two teams in order to be decided which team will get promoted to the Second Macedonian Football League. The two rivals locked horns again, this time, for the safety of the fans the Football Federation of Macedonia decided that the game will not be played in Kiƒçevo, the hometown of both teams. But the story was a sad ending story for KF Zajazi as they lost the playoff game and FK Vlazrimi instead gained promotion to the Second Macedonian Football League. For more than a decade KF Zajazi fought a hard battle against financial difficulties and was unable to replicate the success they had in the 2001‚Äì02 season. Although they managed to sit in the middle of the table of the Macedonian Third League ‚Äì West for the most of the seasons, but nothing more than that. They were never considered as a strong favorite for a promotion to the Second Macedonian Football League. =New era 2011‚Äì= KF Zajazi's title celebrations 2012‚Äì2013 Chairman Mr. Bujar Ahmedi giving a Gratitude to the Mayor of K√´r√ßova, Mr.Fatmir Dehari Mayor: Fatmir Dehari (middle), Chairman: Bujar Ahmedi (right) It was the 2011‚Äì12 season when they showed a positive spark again, when a number of the club's youth products, such as: Buletin Xheladini, Kastriot Jonuzi, Osman Ismaili, Dardan Xheladini, Shqiprim Asani, Flamur Osmani etc. managed to win most of their home games, but their lack of experience showed in important away games, which gave them no chance for putting a serious bid for a promotion to the Second Macedonian Football League. But it was a huge success for a team with an average age of below 20 years and with serious financial problems. It was the 2012‚Äì13 season which put KF Zajazi on the football map again. With the reconstruction of the club board and with the appointment of Bujar Ahmedi as the new chairman of the club, KF Zajazi had bright times ahead of them. The appointment of Bujar Ahmedi as the new chairman of the club soon proved to have been as the right decision for the club. As the young chairman had a clear idea where he wanted the club to be, and that was the Second Macedonian Football League. He wasted no time in pursuing his goal. He soon began the reconstruction of the team, although he truly recognized and appreciated all the youth potential the team had, he also strongly believed that they lacked experience. So his search for experienced and talented players began. Bujar Ahmedi's first signing was Jetmir Kadriu, a very talented and experienced midfielder, who had previously paid his trade in the First Macedonian Football League and Second Macedonian Football League, with city rivals FK Vlazrimi. With Jetmir Kadriu being considered as a local football hero to both KF Vlazrimi's and Kf Zajazi fans, the chairman had made a very important signing, by acquiring a player with great technical awareness, experience and leader abilities. The other two most notable acquirement were Oliver Askov, an experienced and talented defender brought from the other city rival FK Napredok; and he also brought back to the team former KF Zajazi youth product Vullnet Mustafa. He also brought to the team: Lulzim Tairi and Mergim Dani, two very talented youngsters, who very soon emerged as a key players for the team. With the youth potential of Buletin Xheladini, Osman Ismaili, Dardan Xheladini, Lulzim Tairi and Mergim Dani under the guidance and the leadership of Jetmir Kadriu, Oliver Askov and Vullnet Mustafa, KF Zajazi had found a winning combination on the football field. But there were still a lot of financial difficulties which the new appointed chairman, Bujar Ahmedi, managed to settle in a very short period of time. With all these new changes, now, KF Zajazi from an outsider managed to being named by experts as the main favorite for winning the Macedonian Third League ‚Äì West and gaining promotion to the Second Macedonian Football League. Their biggest rivals were thought to be, again, their city rivals FK Vlazrimi. But this time it was a different story from the one 11 years ago, as KF Zajazi beat their rivals in an away match in the 4th round, thus gaining a clear 6 points advantage. This advantage soon increased, as KF Zajazi emerged absolute favorites of winning the league. Kf Zajazi created a big advantage towards the other teams and managed to lift the Trophy very early in the season, with a lot of games remaining. =Promotion 2012‚Äì2013= Chairman Bujar Ahmedi drawing the opponent for the 2012‚Äì13 playoff The club's major success was achieved in the season 2012‚Äì13 when they won the Macedonian Third League ‚Äì West. Finishing first in the Macedonian Third League ‚Äì West; gave them the right to compete in the play-offs for a promotion to the Second Macedonian Football League. In the play off game they were drawn against FK Babi Stip (). A match which they won 1‚Äì0 and got promoted to the Second Macedonian Football League for the first time in their history. The game against FK Babi Stip was a very intense one, with KF Zajazi clearly being the better team during all the match, but they failed to capitalize the changes they created. It needed an 84th-minute header from Mergim Dani, following a cross from Lulzim Tairi to put the match to sleep and send KF Zajazi to the Second Macedonian Football League. The 2013‚Äì14 season began in the same fashion as one year ago. New players were brought to the team the most notable one being the signing of Ismail Ismaili, a former international for the Macedonian National Team. They also brought the young star of city rivals, FK Vlazrimi, Florian Kadriu. Ismail Ismaili and Florian Kadriu, along with a couple of other signings were great additions, who added quality and depth in the team. But the season didn't began as everybody expected, after a disappointing preseason, followed a tough draw in the opening games of the season, KF Zajazi was scheduled to play their first to matches away which they both lost. KF Zajazi managed only to take one point in a home match against FK Drita, which was followed by a defeat in the hands of FK Skopje. But KF Zajazi bounced back, with a well deserved home victory against FK Lokomotiva Skopje. KF Zajazi continued their terrible away record with a defeat against FK Miravci. After that they recorded the second win in a row at home against FK 11 Oktomvri. Currently KF Zajazi sit on the 12th position of the Second Macedonian Football League.

However, the biggest rivalry is with FK Napredok. KF Zajazi has a very intense rivalry with the other Albanian football club in Kicevo FK Vlazrimi. The intense rivalry with FK Vlazrimi began since the time the clubs were founded in 1977. The rivalry got more fierce in the season 2001‚Äì02 when both teams were fighting for becoming champions of the Third Macedonian Football League -West and for a promotion to the Second Macedonian Football League. The season was so close that both teams ended on the top of the table with equal number of points and it was required an extra match between them in order to decide which team will get promoted. The rivalry was revived again in the 2012‚Äì13 season, when FK Vlazrimi emerged as the main opponent to KF Zajazi for winning the league and securing promotion. But this time the race wasn't by far as close as the one eleven years before, as KF Zajazi finished top of the table, leading by double figure number of points ahead of the second placed team and FK Vlazrimi had a disappointing season and finished in the mid table.

KF Zajazi stadium and training facilities are located in Kiƒçevo which is a town in the west part of the Republic of Macedonia. KF Zajazi training facilities, for both the professional and the Junior Team, are located near at the City Stadium of Kicevo. There are two grass pitches. These pitches are also used by the Youth academy of KF Zajazi which trains young talents of different age from the town of K√´r√ßova and the villages near. City Stadium Kicevo is a multi-purpose stadium in Kicevo, Republic of Macedonia.

Born in Rio Claro, he played at the point guard position, and he is considered one of the last classical point guards of Brazilian basketball. Recognized for being a player who had responsibility in defining moments, he knew how to control the dynamics of the game, always controlling the pace of his team on the court.  Professional career  Valtinho was the great conductor of Uberl√¢ndia, and beside the legendary had coach Helio Rubens Garcia, and his son, Helio Rubens Filho, won the 2004 Brazilian national league title, beating Flamengo in the finals series 3-0. After the 2007 Pan American Games, Valtinho moved to Vasco da Gama, to compete for the state championship in Rio de Janeiro, where he was defeated by his greatest team rival, Flamengo. His short spell at Gigante da Colina ended, when the point guard signed with the then Brazilian League champions, Brasilia. In three seasons with Brasilia, Valtinho became one of the greatest club idols of the fans of Brasilia. Along with Alex Garcia and Arthur Belchior, da Silva was defeated in two consecutive finals of the Brazilian national league championship by Flamengo, which initiated the largest Brazilian basketball rivalry of recent times. But the following season, Brasilia hit back at the team led by Marcelinho Machado winning the FIBA South American League and the Brazilian national championship, in 2010. After the 2010 FIBA World Championship, Valtinho returned to the city where he was an idol, Uberl√¢ndia. In his first two seasons with Uberl√¢ndia in the NBB, the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals - by Bras√≠lia in 2011, and by Flamengo in 2012. But the team's third appearance in the NBB in 2013, included the return of two of the club's idols, Helio Rubens Garcia and his son. The return of the two, added to Valtinho and Americans Robert Day and Robby Collum, led to an Uberl√¢ndia final against Flamengo, repeating the Brazilian League final from nine years earlier. But the ending was different. With the help of their fanatical fans, Flamengo annulled Robert Day, and led by the center Caio Torres, won their third Brazilian national league title. National team career A great season with Uberl√¢ndia, led to Valtinho being selected by head coach Lula Ferreira, to compete at the 2007 Pan American Games, in Rio de Janeiro. It was Valtinho's return to the Brazilian national team, after four years. The team, which had players like Leandro Barbosa, Marcelinho Machado, Marquinhos, and Marcelinho Huertas, received unconditional support of Brazilian fans, and won the title, after winning the final against Puerto Rico. Valtinho was called by head coach Rub√©n Magnano to play with Brazil at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, but he was eventually cut from the team, before the tournament began.

When the dimension of H is infinite, the ideal of weak trace-class operators is strictly larger than the ideal of trace class operators, and has fundamentally different properties. The usual operator trace on the trace- class operators does not extend to the weak trace class. Instead the ideal of weak trace-class operators admits an infinite number of linearly independent quasi-continuous traces, and it is the smallest two-sided ideal for which all traces on it are singular traces.

The dates of Zhu Faya's life are unknown, but he was a student of the Indian monk Fotudeng or Zhu Fotudeng Á´∫‰ΩõÂúñÊæÑ (c. 231-349), and a contemporary of the translators Dao'an ÈÅìÂÆâ (312-385) and Zhu Fatai Á´∫Ê≥ïÊ±∞ (320-387). Names The Chinese name Zhu Faya combines two Buddhist terms. The Chinese surname Zhu Á´∫, which originally meant \\"a kind of bamboo\\" and was later used for \\"India (abbreviating Tianzhu Â§©Á´∫)\\" and \\"Buddhism\\", was adopted by many early Buddhist monks, such as the polyglot translator Zhu Fahu Á´∫Ê≥ïË≠∑ or Dharmarak·π£a (c. 230-316). Zhu Faya took this surname in honor of his teacher Zhu Fotudeng, as did several other disciples such as Zhu Fatai (above) and Zhu Senglang Á´∫ÂÉßÈÉé , who in 351 founded the first Buddhist monastery in Shandong. The Buddhist Dharma name (rather than Chinese given name) of Faya means \\"Dharmic Elegance\\", with the Fa \\"law; Dharma\\" seen in Fatai and Fahu. The toponymic name Zhu Faya of Zhongshan ‰∏≠Â±± (100 km west of Hejian) occurs in the (6th century) Memoirs of Eminent Monks biography of Fotudeng (tr. Wright 1948:367), which describes famous monks who travelled great distances to hear Fotudeng's discourses. Life The primary source for information about Zhu Faya is his Memoirs of Eminent Monks biography. > (Zhu) Faya was a man of Hejian. He was of a staid, tolerant disposition. As > a youth, he excelled at non-Buddhist studies, and when he grew up he became > proficient in Buddhist doctrine. The sons of gentry families all attached > themselves to him and requested that he teach them. At that time, the > adherents who followed him were uniformly well-versed in secular works, but > did not yet excel in Buddhist principles. Consequently, (Zhu Fa)ya, with > Kang Falang and others, correlated the numerations of items (shishu ‰∫ãÊï∏) in > the sutras with non-Buddhist writings as instances of lively explication; > this was called \\"categorizing concepts\\" (geyi). Thereupon, Vibhu (?), > Tanxiang, and others also debated over the categorised concepts in order to > instruct their disciples. (Zhu Fa)ya's manner was unrestrained and he > excelled (in getting at) the crux (of the matter). He alternately lectured > on secular works and Buddhist sutras. With Dao‚Äôan and Fatai, he often > explained the doubtful points they had assembled, and together they > exhausted the essentials of the sutras. Later, he established a monastery at > Gaoyi, where he tirelessly taught a sa·πÖgha-fellowship of more than a > hundred. One of (Zhu Fa)ya‚Äôs disciples, Tanxi, emulated his master in > excelling at discourse, and was honoured by Shi Xuan, heir apparent to the > throne of the Latter Zhao [319‚Äì351]. (tr.

(Wright 1948:327-328) Tsukamoto Zenry≈´ Â°öÊú¨ÂñÑÈöÜ's Japanese-language history of early Chinese Buddhism used Zhu Faya to typify the \\"homilist-exegete\\" (tr.

After he was fired from TU Berlin in April 1933 because of his Jewish background, Stammreich emigrated to Paris, where he stayed until 1940, working in the labs of Paul Langevin and Charles Fabry at the Sorbonne, with a brief interruption in 1935/36, when he first made aliyah with his wife and briefly lived in Palestine (with a written recommendation letter by Einstein), and subsequently briefly worked in Teheran. In 1940, Stammreich and his wife obtained a visa for Brazil and emigrated via Casablanca. Whereas Stammreich's wife Charlotte could directly travel to Brazil without problems, Hans was briefly arrested and put in a POW camp by the French Vichy government, but was subsequently released and deported to Portugal, whence he left for Brazil. In Brazil Stammreich became professor for Physical Chemistry at the University of S√£o Paulo, where he soon resumed his work in Raman spectroscopy. Stammreich was an excellent experimenter, amongst many other innovations in 1956 he was the first to obtain Raman spectra with a Helium lamp. A detailed list of his scientific innovations can be found in the web article by Andre Trombetta cited below.  Sources  * Bernhard Schrader and Andreas Otto, Hans Stammreich, Bunsen- Magazin, 2.

Desensitization can lead to longer response times or missing important alarms. Alarm fatigue occurs in many industries, including construction and mining (where backup alarms sound so frequently that they often become senseless background noise), healthcare (where electronic monitors tracking clinical information such as vital signs and blood glucose sound alarms so frequently, and often for such minor reasons, that they lose the urgency and attention- grabbing power which they are intended to have), and the nuclear power industry. Like crying wolf, such false alarms rob the critical alarms of the importance they deserve. Alarm management and policy is critical to prevent alarm fatigue.  Healthcare  The constant sounds of alarms and noises from blood pressure machines, ventilators and heart monitors causes a \\"tuning out\\" of the sounds due to the brain adjusting to stimulation. This issue is present in hospitals, in home care providers, nursing homes and other medical facilities alike. The Joint Commission's sentinel event reports 80 alarm- related deaths and 13 alarm-related serious injuries over the course of a few years. On April 18, 2013, the Joint Commission issued a sentinel event alert that highlighted the widespread problem of alarm fatigue in hospitals. Their recommendations included establishing guidelines to tailor alarm settings, training all members of the clinical team on safe use of alarms, and sharing information about alarm-related incidents. This alert resulted in designation in 2014 of clinical alarm system safety as a National Patient Safety Goal and it remains a goal in 2017.PDF This Goal will force hospitals to establish alarm safety as a priority, identify the most important alarms, and establish policies to manage alarms by January 2016.Monegain, Bernie. \\"'Alarm Fatigue' Endangers Patients.\\" Healthcare IT News. HIMSS Media, 9 April 2013. Web. 24 January 2014 ECRI Institute has listed alarms on its \\"Top Ten Hazards List\\" since 2007; in 2014 alarms was listed as the number one hazard. =Unintended outcomes of alarms= The large number of alarms, especially of false alarms, has led to several unintended outcomes. Some consequences are disruption in patient care, desensitization to alarms, anxiety in hospital staff and patients, sleep deprivation and depressed immune systems, misuse of monitor equipment, and missed critical events. Some additional outcomes include workload increase, interference with communication, wasted time, patient dissatisfaction, and unnecessary investigations, referrals, or treatments. =Solutions= There are many solutions proposed to reduce alarm fatigue in healthcare settings. Changing alarm sounds and parameters One recommendation is to change alarm sounds to be softer and friendlier in order to improve identification of alarms by sound alone. Another recommendation is for clinicians to adjust the parameters and delays to alarms to match the patient‚Äôs traits and status. However, this directly trades sensitivity for specificity. Centralized alarms Another solution that has been proposed is to use centralized alarms. In this approach, alarms don't fire at the bedside, but fire at a central monitoring station where a trained healthcare provider evaluates each alarm and alerts the bedside clinician if they should intervene or evaluate the patient. Changing alarm algorithms Biomedical engineers may improve monitors by adjusting alarm algorithms. Currently, the alarm systems are very sensitive but not specific. This leads to a large amount of false alarms. The algorithms used can be adjusted to balance between sensitivity and specificity to limit the number of false alarms and still detect true deterioration. Child abduction The amber alert system used in countries such as the United States and Canada to notify the public of a child abduction has been theorized as being susceptible to alarm fatigue. A 2018 abduction in Thunder Bay resulted in an amber alert being sent to cell phones as far away as Ottawa, some 15 hours' drive from Thunder Bay, followed one hour later by a second alert which notified individuals that the first alert had been resolved. A similar double alert occurred on a single night in February 2019, leading to concerns over alert fatigue. Public transport In the New York City Subway, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority installed sirens in 2006 to discourage the improper use of emergency exits; the sirens had little effect other than irritating passengers and were removed in 2015.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/nyregion/exit-alarms-in-the-subways- are-silenced-by-the-mta.html Alarm fatigue has sometimes contributed to public transport disasters such as the 2009 train collision in Washington, DC, caused by a faulty track circuit which failed to detect the presence of a stopped train. Though the automatic train control system generated alerts notifying train dispatchers to the presence of such faulty circuits, an investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board concluded that \\"the extremely high incidence of track-circuit alarms [about 8,000 per week] would have thoroughly desensitized\\" the dispatchers.

A hendecahedron (or undecahedron) is a polyhedron with 11 faces. There are numerous topologically distinct forms of a hendecahedron, for example the decagonal pyramid, and enneagonal prism. Three forms are Johnson solids: augmented hexagonal prism, biaugmented triangular prism, and elongated pentagonal pyramid. Two classes, the bisymmetric and the sphenoid hendecahedra, are space-filling.Inchbald (1996)  Name of hendecahedron  The name of hendecahedron is based on its meaning. Hen- represents one. Deca represents ten, and when combined with the polyhedron suffix -hedron, the name becomes Hendecahedron.  Common Hendecahedron  In all the convex hendecahedrons, there are a total of 440,564 convex ones with distinct differences in topology. There are significant differences in the structure of topology, which means two types of polyhedrons cannot be transformed by moving vertex positions, twisting, or scaling, such as a pentagonal pyramid and a nine diagonal column. They can't change with each other, so their topology structure is different. But the pentagonal prism and enneagonal prism can interchange by stretching out or drawing back one of the nine sides of the scale, so the triangulum prism and the triangulum pyramid have no obvious difference in topology. The common hendecahedrons are cones, cylinders, some Jason polyhedrons, and the semi-regular polyhedron. The semi-regular polyhedron here is not the Archimedean solid, but the enneagonal prism. Other hendecahedrons include enneagonal prism, Spherical octagonal pyramid, two side taper triangular prism of the duality of six, side cone Angle and bisymmetric hendecahedron, which can close shop space.  Bisymmetric Hendecahedron  The Bisymmetric Hendecahedron is a space-filling polyhedron which can be assembled into layers of interpenetrating \\"boat-shaped\\" tetramers, which in turn are then stacked to fill space; it is hence a three-dimensional analogue of the Cairo pentagon. Net of Bisymmetric Hendecahedron  Sphenoid Hendecahedron  The Sphenoid Hendecahedron is a space-filling polyhedron which can be assembled into layers of the Floret tiling, which in turn are stacked to fill space.  Hendecahedron in Chemistry  In the chemistry, after removing all 18 sides in borane hydrogen ions ([B11H11]), it is an Octadecahedron. If making a perpendicular to the center of gravity to the surface of a boron atom, a new polyhedron is constructed, which is 18 surface structures of the dual polyhedron, also one of hendecahedrons. Convex There are 440,564 topologically distinct convex hendecahedra, excluding mirror images, having at least 8 vertices.Counting polyhedra (Two polyhedra are \\"topologically distinct\\" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)

As a result of growing population De Villiersdale was divided into De Villiersdale 1 and De Villiersdale 2. It has one traditional leader with two traditional communities. The area has ancient rock arts that form part of the Makgabeng plateau. What is mostly depicted is giraffes indicating the totem of the royal family that resides over the area. De Villiersdale defended its territory during the Mfecane wars, Maleboch war, Apartheid, and even today for its traditional community and recognition of its tribe in the democratic South Africa. Apart from the rock arts, De Villiersdale has large caves that were used as hiding places for women, children and livestock during the ancient battles. The name De Villiersdale was named by the apartheid regime and forced the royal family to buy the land from it. This allowed other tribes to infiltrate the land - as they also bought the land. De Villiersdale has had many traditional leaders imposed on it by former Republic of South Africa governments. Seanego has always ruled the area from time immemorial. The population is largely Christian. The traditional way of life is the only thing remaining - this largely because of the constant community gatherings discussing issues from land development to land disputes among families. The traditional court is still practiced here; and its ruling are binding and highly regarded by the communities. Only cases that threatens life or involve loss of property are referred to the police. It is not surprising that the community has had so many developments initiated by the community and maintained for so many years. To name a few: one primary school, one secondary school, one combined school- grade 1 to 9; boreholes and their pumps. It supplies all the villages with water, electricity from Eskom, burial societies, community budget etc. The communities generally live in peace. One thing also very important about the villages is that they have very closely knit-intercommunity marriages. The communities also have annual seniors' soccer matches inviting other nearby villages during December vacations. Throughout the year school children engage in soccer and netball activities, traditional dance competitions, poetry competitions, drama competitions. Life in this area is sure remote from all the glam, lights, buzzing of urban areas but is a good place for social cohesion. The area is surrounded by mountains and is very sandy; this have kept the area out of interest from intruders for many years. When one walks on most if not all the mountains surrounding it; one can't help but notice the ruins of thriving homesteads build deep in the forests. When asking senior citizens of the village the answer you get is always similar: \\"to see enemies from far, the low lying areas were used for cattle breeding and farming\\". This land is sure sacred.

His main focus was reporting out of Washington, D.C., covering presidential campaigns and those who were elected.  Early years  Kaplow was born in 1927 in Manhattan to Jewish immigrants from Europe. He was raised in Queens and attended Queens College, before being drafted into the United States Army. He was later assigned to the Armed Forces Radio Service, where he read scripts covering the Nuremberg Trials as well as covered a Wimbledon tennis championship. After his military discharge, he returned to get a degree in history at Queens College. He went on to earn a master's degree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, after a two-year radio announcer job at WCTC in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  National news career  After obtaining his degree, he moved to Washington, D.C., to work for NBC's radio affiliate WRC, before taking an editing job on the network's News of the World program. A few years later, he became an NBC news correspondent for radio and television. In 1968, he became a White House correspondent. In 1972, he switched to ABC News, where he remained until his retirement in 1994. = Notable news stories = During his four decades of covering news stories, which included 10 presidential campaigns and 19 nominating conventions, Kaplow also reported on major events of the civil rights movement from the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling to desegregate schools to the Freedom Riders's struggle to integrate buses in the early 1960s. Kaplow also covered NASA's Project Mercury. He covered the Cuban Revolution that culminated in the victory of communists led by Fidel Castro in 1959. After the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba by American-backed Cuban exiles, Kaplow was the first American reporter to interview Castro. Kaplow also covered Richard Nixon from 1958 to 1968. This kept Nixon in the public eye, which historian Erik Barnouw believed helped Nixon win the 1968 presidential nomination.  Personal life  After retiring in 1994, Kaplow lived in Falls Church, Virginia, with his wife, Betty. They had three sons: Steven, Bobby and Larry. Herb spent an undisclosed amount of time in an assisted living facility, battling dementia, which affected his ability to speak. He died on July 27, 2013, from a stroke in Arlington, Virginia, at the age of 86.

The correspondence is implemented by mapping an operator to its singular value sequence. It originated from John von Neumann's study of symmetric norms on matrix algebras. It provides a fundamental classification and tool for the study of two-sided ideals of compact operators and their traces, by reducing problems about operator spaces to (more resolvable) problems on sequence spaces.  Definitions  A two-sided ideal J of the bounded linear operators B(H) on a separable Hilbert space H is a linear subspace such that AB and BA belong to J for all operators A from J and B from B(H). A sequence space j within l‚àû can be embedded in B(H) using an arbitrary orthonormal basis {en }n=0‚àû. Associate to a sequence a from j the bounded operator :::: {\\\\rm diag}(a) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n  e_n \\\\rangle \\\\langle e_n , where bra‚Äìket notation has been used for the one-dimensional projections onto the subspaces spanned by individual basis vectors. The sequence of absolute values of the entries of a in decreasing order is called the decreasing rearrangement of a. The decreasing rearrangement can be denoted Œº(n,a), n = 0, 1, 2, ... Note that it is identical to the singular values of the operator diag(a). Another notation for the decreasing rearrangement is a*. A Calkin (or rearrangement invariant) sequence space is a linear subspace j of the bounded sequences l‚àû such that if a is a bounded sequence and Œº(n,a) ‚â§ Œº(n,b), n 0, 1, 2, ..., for some b in j, then a belongs to j.  Correspondence  Associate to a two- sided ideal J the sequence space j given by :::: j = \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\in l_\\\\infty : {\\\\rm diag}(\\\\mu(a)) \\\\in J \\\\\\\\} . Associate to a sequence space j the two-sided ideal J given by :::: J = \\\\\\\\{ A \\\\in B(H) : \\\\mu(A) \\\\in j \\\\\\\\} . Here Œº(A) and Œº(a) are the singular values of the operators A and diag(a), respectively. Calkin's Theorem states that the two maps are inverse to each other. We obtain, :Calkin correspondence: The two-sided ideals of bounded operators on an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space and the Calkin sequence spaces are in bijective correspondence. It is sufficient to know the association only between positive operators and positive sequences, hence the map Œº: J+ ‚Üí j+ from a positive operator to its singular values implements the Calkin correspondence. Another way of interpreting the Calkin correspondence, since the sequence space j is equivalent as a Banach space to the operators in the operator ideal J that are diagonal with respect to an arbitrary orthonormal basis, is that two-sided ideals are completely determined by their diagonal operators.  Examples  Suppose H is a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. *Bounded operators. The improper two-sided ideal B(H) corresponds to l‚àû. *Compact operators. The proper and norm closed two-sided ideal K(H) corresponds to c0, the space of sequences converging to zero. *Finite rank operators. The smallest two-sided ideal F(H) of finite rank operators corresponds to c00, the space of sequences with finite non-zero terms. *Schatten p-ideals. The Schatten p-ideals Lp, p ‚â• 1, correspond to the lp sequence spaces. In particular, the trace class operators correspond to l1 and the Hilbert-Schmidt operators correspond to l2 . * Weak-Lp ideals. The weak-Lp ideals Lp,‚àû, p ‚â• 1, correspond to the weak-lp sequence spaces. * Lorentz œà-ideals. The Lorentz œà-ideals for an increasing concave function œà : [0,‚àû) ‚Üí [0,‚àû) correspond to the Lorentz sequence spaces.

It was located in present Rimouski-Neigette Regional County Municipality in Bas-Saint-Laurent. History Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye, second seignor of Bic The maritime site of Bic became a ships mooring location as soon as first French explorers came to North America. The seignory was granted on May 6, 1675 to Charles Denys de Vitr√© who belonged to an important French family and who was a member of the Sovereign Council of New France since 1673. According to the historian Jos D. Michaud, Jean Gaignon was the first inhabitant of European descent to establish himself in the territory of the seignory around 1680 as a fisherman. A census conducted in 1688 reported one family of 12 members living in Bic. In 1688 Charles Denys de Vitr√© sold the seignory to Charles Aubert de La Chesnaye, reimbursing a debt of 2050 livres. Gaignon died in 1699 and his family left the seignory. After that the seignory remained uninhabited until 1750. Territory At the time of its first granting in 1675 the seignory covered two by two leagues along the Saint Lawrence River. Its territory also included the Bic Island.

History The department was first known as the South China Biodiversity Team (SCBT), which was set up in 1998 in response to the urgent threats faced by China's biodiversity particularly in the south. In 2003, it expanded its focus from biodiversity conservation to include promotion of sustainable agriculture and sustainable living, and was restructured to form the China Programme (CP). In 2011, it was again renamed to become Kadoorie Conservation China. The first ten years of the programme were engaged primarily in channelling reliable information about biodiversity and its threats; providing communication and cohesion within the regional conservation community; boosting the ecological capacity of conservation scientists and managers; and initiating conservation interventions, including those that brought benefits to communities around nature reserves. Projects =Yinggeling Nature Reserve, Hainan= Yinggeling National Nature Reserve (YGL) sits deep in the interior mountains of Hainan Island, and was never properly studied by scientists before KCC conducted a pilot survey of the area in 2003, when team members were amazed by the extent of primary rainforest and rich biodiversity. In 2005, the Provincial Forestry Department and KCC led a 3-month expedition to study the area's biodiversity value. The team of over 60 specialists discovered a wealth of exciting biodiversity, including species new to science such as the Yinggeling tree frog (Rhacophorus yinggelingensis), new records for China such as the tree Trigonobalanus verticillata, and over 160 new records for Hainan such as the tree Bretschneidera sinensis and pygmy wren-babbler (Pnoepyga pusilla). These findings underlined the irreplaceable conservation importance of YGL. However, like many other forested areas, the biodiversity value of YGL was slowly being degraded, by illegal activities such as poaching and logging. To preserve this unique biodiversity asset, KCC has supported the Hainan Provincial Forestry Department to develop YGL into a world-class nature reserve, even assigning a conservation biologist to assist in reserve management since 2006. In a span of few years YGL has accomplished some achievements in reserve management, research & monitoring, and community-based conservation. =Hainan Exianling Limestone Ecosystem= Since 2004, KCC has been working with partners to study Hainan's limestone forest and its conservation value; researchers supported by KCC found pristine rainforest and uncovered a lot of new species and new China records in this specialised ecosystem. In 2006, KCC and Hainan Provincial Forestry Department coorganized the workshop 'Hainan Limestone Habitats and their Biodiversity' and since 2009 KCC has sponsored the construction of a reserve station, provided capacity building to the local wardens, improved their patrolling effectiveness and provided field equipment. =Hainan gibbon= In 2003, KCC was invited by the local authorities to take an active role in saving the Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus). The first comprehensive population survey, as well as a conservation workshop for the Hainan gibbon were launched. During the survey and workshop, the existence of only 13 individuals in two groups was confirmed. In a hope to save the species from extinction, together with Bawangling National Nature Reserve, KCC implemented a series of in-situ conservation actions, including improvement of patrolling efficiency, establishment of the gibbon monitoring team, habitat enhancement of lowland habitat, in-depth scientific research, and educational activities. The gibbon population has increased to 3 groups of at least 24 individuals in less than a decade. =Eastern black crested gibbon= In 2006, the eastern black crested gibbon (Nomascus nasutus) was rediscovered in China by members of KCC after it was thought to be extinct in the country for years. =Oriental pied hornbill of Guangxi= KCC collaborated with Xidamingshan Nature Reserve and other partners to protect the Oriental pied hornbill (Anthracoceros albirostris) since July 2009. All-round conservation actions have been carried out, including scientific study, education and staff capacity building. Publications =Living Forests= Living Forests was a magazine published by KFBG/KCC from 2000 to 2010, to serve the community of conservationists active in South China. From the sixth issue onwards each issue had a particular theme, namely: (6) Community Power in Southwest China; (7) Holding On to Hainan‚Äôs Forests; (8) Keeping South China‚Äôs Ecosystems Intact; (9) Benign Harvests: Bringing Agriculture in Line with Biodiversity Conservation; (10) What is Environmental Education?

Background In 1971, Lee received his bachelor's degree in Bible studies from Mississippi College in Clinton, Mississippi, where he was already working as an admissions counselor while still studying for his degree. In 1973, he obtained his master's degree in counseling from MC. Thereafter, he became the dean of men and from 1976 to 1994 the bi-vocational pastor of Antioch Baptist Church in Hazlehurst in Copiah County south of the capital city of Jackson. During his tenure at Antioch, the church grew in membership, missions, stewardship, and Bible studies. In the meantime, Lee in 1984 earned his doctorate from the University of Mississippi at Oxford. Lee and his wife, Janet, have two children, Lauren and Lacey. College administration At Mississippi College, Lee was successively dean of admissions, director of development, vice president for development, and from 1989 to 1997 the vice president for institutional advancement. In 1993, Lee was named for eleven months the MC interim president after president Lewis Nobles was removed for the embezzlement of college funds. Lee resigned from the pastorate at Antioch to devote full-time to the interim college presidency. Lee remained as vice president for institutional advancement for two years after a new president was selected, but in 1996, he left MC to begin a one-year stint as president of Baptist-affiliated William Carey College in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. There, Lee coordinated the strategic planning process of the institution and formulated telecommunications and faculty development plans. In 1997, Lee was named the seventh president of Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana. Pastor Thomas James \\"Jim\\" Spencer (1938-2006) of Kingsville Baptist Church in Ball, chairman at the time of the LC trustees, said that the unanimous selection of Lee to replace the retiring Robert L. Lynn had been \\"a unifying effort for the board. Dr. Lee is an outstanding young man who is both a professional college administrator and a dedicated Christian servant. ... that all Louisiana Baptists can rally around and support.\\" At LC, Lee worked for the construction of new facilities on campus, the addition of two new sports to the athletic program, and an increase in the number of faculty members with terminal degrees in their field. He described his view of academic freedom as \\"absolutely critical to academic excellence in a college. Teachers must have the freedom to teach their disciplines. But at a Christian college, academic freedom is bordered by the mission statement of the college.\\" Controversy preceded Lee's decision to resign as president effective in June 2004. In December 2003, LC trustees revised the college policy on academic freedom, a decision made after Lee had removed two books used in a class from the campus bookstore. Lee took that action after a student complained about a love scene and profanity in both books. The revised policy requires that faculty submit their textbooks for approval by the department chairperson and the vice president for academic affairs. Baptist Children's Village After seven years, Lee left LC to assume his current position in Ridgeland in Madison County in the Jackson metropolitan area as the executive director of the Baptist Children's Village, which provides short-term and long-term care for abandoned, neglected, or abused children. Lee said that his duties can make one \\"very sad and very angry. But we‚Äôve learned not to dwell on those negative feelings. Instead, we focus on showing Christ's love not only to the children, but also to their families. This is a healing ministry.\\" Lee said that his life goal is to have \\"no repeat customers\\" and to eliminate the need for a facility like Baptist Children's Village. Lee said that his preparation for his ministerial and administrative duties came through his longstanding ties to Mississippi College, which in 2011 named him \\"Alumnus of the Year\\".

The protocol is used by mobile devices, personal computers, and smart speakers to play content on a digital media player connected to a high-definition television or home audio system. The protocol was first launched on July 24, 2013, to support Google's first-generation Chromecast player. The Google Cast SDK was released on February 3, 2014, allowing third parties to modify their software to support the protocol. According to Google, over 20,000 Google Cast-ready apps were available as of May 2015. Google Cast would later be built into the Nexus Player and other Android TV devices (such as televisions), as well as soundbars, speakers, and subsequent Chromecast players. As of October 2017, over 55 million Chromecasts and Chromecast built- in devices have been sold. Operation Google Cast receivers can stream content via two methods: the first employs mobile and web apps that support the Google Cast technology; the second allows mirroring of content from the web browser Google Chrome running on a personal computer, as well as content displayed on some Android devices. In both cases, playback is initiated through the \\"cast\\" button on the sender device. * The primary method of playing media on the device is through Google Cast‚Äìenabled mobile and web apps, which control program selection, playback, and volume. Google Cast receiver devices stream the media from the web within a local version of the Chrome browser, thus freeing the sender device up for other tasks, such as answering a call or using another application, without disrupting playback. Mobile apps enabled for Google Cast are available for both Android 4.1+ and iOS 7.0+; web apps enabled for Google Cast are available on computers running Google Chrome (on Microsoft Windows 7+, macOS 10.7+, and Chrome OS for Chromebooks running Chrome 28+) through the installation of the \\"Cast extension\\" in the browser. Streamed content can be Internet-based, as provided by specific apps, or reside on the sender device's local storage. Apps that provide access to the latter include AllCast, Avia, Plex, and Google Photos. * Content can also be mirrored from a tab of the Chrome browser (with the Cast extension) on a personal computer or from the screen of some Android 4.4+ devices. In the case of \\"tab casting\\", the quality of the image depends on the processing power of the device, and minimum system requirements apply to video streaming. Content that uses plug-ins, such as Silverlight and QuickTime, does not fully work, as the stream may lack sound or image. Similarly, screen images mirrored from Android devices are typically degraded, reflecting the fact that video displayed on the smaller screens of tablets and smartphones is usually downscaled. Sender devices previously needed to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as a Google Cast receiver device to cast content, until the addition of a \\"guest mode\\" feature on December 10, 2014. When enabled, the feature allows sender devices to discover a nearby player by detecting ultrasonic audio emitted by the television or speaker system to which the player is connected; alternatively, the sender device can be paired with the receiver device using a four-digit PIN code. Guest mode is only available for Chromecasts; the Nexus Player and Android TV devices do not support the feature. SDK and compatible apps Icon for the \\"cast button\\", which is used to connect, control and disconnect from Google Cast receivers. The button can also represent compatible non-Cast receivers, such as Bluetooth audio players. =Release and distribution= At the time of Chromecast's launch, four Google Cast-compatible apps were available: YouTube and Netflix were supported as Android, iOS, and Chrome web apps; Google Play Music and Google Play Movies & TV were also supported, but originally only as Android apps. Additional apps supporting casting would require access to the Google Cast software development kit (SDK). The SDK was first released as a preview version on July 24, 2013. Google advised interested developers to use the SDK to create and test apps, but not distribute them. While that admonition remained in force, Google Cast-enabled applications for Hulu Plus and Pandora Radio were released in October 2013, and HBO GO in November. Google invited developers to a two- day hackathon on December 7 at Googleplex, its Mountain View headquarters, offering the opportunity to test drive the SDK's \\"upcoming release\\". The session attracted 40 developers from 30 companies and was followed by 10 additional apps, including Plex, Avia, and Realplayer Cloud. Google opened the SDK to all developers on February 3, 2014. In its introductory documentation and video presentation, Google said the SDK worked with both Chromecast devices and other unnamed \\"cast receiver devices\\". Chromecast product manager Rish Chandra said that Google used the intervening time to improve the SDK's reliability and accommodate those developers who sought a quick and easy way to cast a photo to a television without a lot of coding. Google also made the SDK a part of the Google Play Services framework, thereby giving users access to new apps without having to update Android itself. Over time, many more applications have been updated to support Google Cast. At Google I/O 2014, the company announced that 6,000 registered developers were working on 10,000 Google Cast‚Äìready apps; by the following year's conference, the number of compatible apps had doubled. Google's official list of compatible apps and platforms is available on the Chromecast website. Google has published case studies documenting Google Cast integration by Comedy Central, Just Dance Now, Haystack TV and Fitnet. =Framework= The development framework has two components: a sender app and a receiver app, both of which make use of APIs provided by the SDK. * The sender app is based on a vendor's existing Android or iOS mobile app, or desktop web app, and provides users with content discovery and media controls, including the ability to select to which device content is streamed. Under the hood, sender apps can detect receiver devices on the same local network, establish a secure channel, and exchange messages. * The receiver app is a web app executing in a Chrome browser-like environment resident on the cast receiver device. Receiver apps of varying complexities can be developed depending on the variety of content formats the app can play. For example, a simple receiver app might just play HTML5 content, whereas custom receiver apps, which require more programming effort, can take a variety of streaming protocols, including MPEG-DASH, HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), and the Microsoft Smooth Streaming Protocol. =Supported media= Chromecast supports the image formats BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and WEBP, with a display size limitation of 720p (1280 √ó 720 pixels). Supported audio codecs are HE-AAC, LC-AAC, MP3, Vorbis, WAV (LPCM), FLAC (up to 96kHz/24-bit) and Opus; AC-3 (Dolby Digital) and E-AC-3 (EC-3, Dolby Digital Plus) are available for audio pass-through. Supported video codecs for the first and second generation Chromecast are H.264 High Profile Level 4.1 (decoding up to 720p/60 frames per second (fps) or 1080p/30fps) and VP8. Supported video codecs for the third generation Chromecast are H.264 High Profile Level 4.2 (decoding up to 720p/60 (fps) or 1080p/60fps) and VP8. The supported video codecs for the Chromecast Ultra are HEVC / H.265 Main and Main 10 Profiles up to level 5.1 (2160p/60fps) and VP9 Profile 0 and Profile 2 up to level 5.1 (2160p/60fps). =Additional functionality and APIs= At International CES 2015, Google announced an expansion to Google Cast called \\"Google Cast for audio\\", which allows apps that support the Google Cast SDK to play audio through compatible Wi-Fi‚Äìconnected speakers, soundbars, and receivers. Manufacturers supporting Google Cast as a built-in function in their speakers include LG and Sony. In May 2015, Google introduced new sets of APIs to Google Cast. The Cast Remote Display APIs allow developers to create second-screen experiences for apps such as games without needing to mirror displays. The Game Manager APIs offer developers more options for creating multiplayer games. Lastly, additional APIs were provided to control autoplaying and queuing of content. In September 2015, Google announced \\"Fast Play\\" and accompanying developer tools, which are aimed at reducing the delays between loading content. In a typical scenario, if a user viewed the first three episodes of a television series, the fourth episode might load in the background. The feature's release has since been delayed.

According to one significant hypothesis, he may have been the first voivode of Moldavia under this regnal name, and should be referred as Petru I of Moldavia. After 2000, Romanian historian Constantin Rezachevici proposed a novel timeline of Moldavian rulers, according to which Petru Mu»ôat would be referred as Petru II. During his reign, he maintained good relationships with his neighbours, especially Poland. On 27 September 1387 at Lw√≥w, he paid homage to the Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, making Moldavia a Polish fief (which it remained until 1497). In 1388, he received Pokuttya as a pawn for 3,000 silver rubles he lent to the Polish king. Petru also acted as an intermediary in the negotiations between the Wallachia voivode Mircea cel BƒÉtr√¢n and the Polish king that resulted in the treaties signed by the two parties in 1389 and 1390. The first Russian-Moldavian diplomatic contacts also date from his reign. He was married twice. From his first wife he had a son, Roman. In 1388 he remarried to Olga, daughter of Janusz I, Prince of Masovia. From his second wife he had another son, Iva»ôcu. Petru founded the Neam»õ Citadel and Neam»õ Monastery, and built the Holy Trinity Church in Siret. He also fixed the princely seat of Moldova at Suceava in 1388, effectively dooming the Latin Diocese of Siret in the old capital, and maintained Orthodox Bishop Iosif at Cetatea AlbƒÉ, contrary to the wishes expressed by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, resulting in his excommunication. During his reign, a number of important coins were minted; the ones attributed to him, known so far, are: groschen and far more rare half-groschen made of silver. Their design became the standard for coins minted by later Moldavian rulers. Obverse: Aurochs head, frontal view, a star between the horns, a rose on the right, a crescent on the left. In some cases, the rose is at left and the crescent at right. Sometimes, the aurochs holds a fleur de lys in its mouth. The legend is in Latin: SIMPETRI WOIWOD. Reverse: Coat of arms, a shield with three or four bars in the right half, and in the left half a variable number of fleurs de lys (seven to one). The legend is SIMOLDAVIENSIS.

His compositions have won awards, including \\"Belle De Louisville,\\" which won the John Lennon Songwriting Contest award for Song of the Year for 2012. Friddle says he composed the song on the banjo which helps give it its rolling feel, appropriate for a song about a steamboat. Then in 2014, his song \\"Man Was Made To Fly\\" from the 2013 album, Use Your Voice, won the \\"Folk\\" category in the Great American Song Contest. (Listing 2013 winners.) That album was also nominated as Album of the Year for the Independent Music Awards. His original songs have been described as \\"a mixture of rock and old-time, New Orleans trad and bluegrass, country and blues.\\" His music is included in three episodes of Roadtrip Nation. The songs used are: \\"Tired Chicken Blues,\\" \\"Black-Eyed Suzie,\\" \\"Shake It Down,\\" and \\"Rabbit.\\" Friddle's interest in songwriting and music has been lifelong. Originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, he is a graduate of Berea College with degrees in English and theater. While there he played bass in the college bluegrass ensemble. After graduating he received a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to travel to several countries to study community-building through music. He moved to Chicago in 2007, and in 2008 became an instructor at the Old Town School of Folk Music. There he teaches guitar, fiddle, and banjo and specializes in Old Time music, Americana, jug band blues, modern folk, and songwriting. Shortly after moving to Chicago he formed a banjo and fiddle duo, \\"Sleepy Lou,\\" with Maria McCullogh. They specialized in traditional music from the United States and Mexico. He also formed \\"The Barehand Jugband,\\" focused on jug band blues. The Barehand Jugband gained a following around Chicago and was the winner of the Minneapolis Battle of the Jug Bands in February 2010 (Pancake League, the first year that contest was took place) and in February 2011 (Waffle League). In late 2011 to early 2012, Friddle changed his performing and recording focus to his original compositions. He recruited musicians from other projects he was involved in, primarily colleagues at the Old Town School of Folk Music, to play on two albums of his original songs, Synco Pony and Belle De Louisville which were released at the same time in 2012. In 2012, Friddle and the musicians from Belle De Louisville began to perform as Jonas Friddle and the Majority. Their instrumentation includes a string section, horns, organ, banjo and drums. Jonas Friddle notes that their combination of instruments is unusual: \\"old-time banjo is seldom found in the company of a French horn or full string section,\\" and others have observed that they take a \\"non- traditional approach to the traditional string band layout and repertoire.\\" Their sound has been described as \\"at once huge and intimate, in the way only old-timey, bluegrassy folk music can be.\\" (Quoting Erica Elam.) Friddle recorded two more albums with \\"The Majority\\": Use Your Voice in 2013 and Jonas Friddle & The Majority in 2016. He continues to perform his original compositions with that band, but also performs jug band music, blues, swing and old-time as a trio with Majority members Anna and Evan Jacobson, as well as performing traditional old-time music solo or with others. He also performs his original songs solo or with a four-piece band. In 2019, Friddle released The Last Place to Go, an album entirely of his original songs, recorded with a smaller group of musicians. Friddle felt that a smaller band than he had used for the previous recordings fit the songs better. The album was described as a \\"dazzlingly rich lode of tonal and especially textual delights,\\" and as having a \\"widely textured sound that remains intimate with the words in focus.\\" The recording, also described as having a more intimate sound focused on storytelling, was recorded live directly to analog tape. Instrumentation includes guitar, fiddle, trumpet, dobro, electric guitar, upright and electric bass, piano, and drums. However, there is no banjo, a lack the liner notes apologize for. Some of the songs have been described as having a stripped-down modern folk/country feel, and Friddle himself says that the album is more \\"country\\" than some of his earlier work.

Modern characterisation of the commutator subspace is through the Calkin correspondence and it involves the invariance of the Calkin sequence space of an operator ideal to taking Ces√†ro means. This explicit spectral characterisation reduces problems and questions about commutators and traces on two-sided ideals to (more resolvable) problems and conditions on sequence spaces.  History  Commutators of linear operators on Hilbert spaces came to prominence in the 1930s as they featured in the matrix mechanics, or Heisenberg, formulation of quantum mechanics. Commutator subspaces, though, received sparse attention until the 1970s. American mathematician Paul Halmos in 1954 showed that every bounded operator on a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space is the sum of two commutators of bounded operators. In 1971 Carl Pearcy and David Topping revisited the topic and studied commutator subspaces for Schatten ideals. As a student American mathematician Gary Weiss began to investigate spectral conditions for commutators of Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators. British mathematician Nigel Kalton, noticing the spectral condition of Weiss, characterised all trace class commutators. Kalton's result forms the basis for the modern characterisation of the commutator subspace. In 2004 Ken Dykema, Tadeusz Figiel, Gary Weiss and Mariusz Wodzicki published the spectral characterisation of normal operators in the commutator subspace for every two- sided ideal of compact operators.  Definition  The commutator subspace of a two-sided ideal J of the bounded linear operators B(H) on a separable Hilbert space H is the linear span of operators in J of the form [A,B] = AB ‚àí BA for all operators A from J and B from B(H). The commutator subspace of J is a linear subspace of J denoted by Com(J) or [B(H),J].  Spectral characterisation  The Calkin correspondence states that a compact operator A belongs to a two-sided ideal J if and only if the singular values Œº(A) of A belongs to the Calkin sequence space j associated to J. Normal operators that belong to the commutator subspace Com(J) can characterised as those A such that Œº(A) belongs to j and the Ces√†ro mean of the sequence Œº(A) belongs to j. The following theorem is a slight extension to differences of normal operators (setting B 0 in the following gives the statement of the previous sentence). : Theorem. Suppose A,B are compact normal operators that belong to a two-sided ideal J. Then A ‚àí B belongs to the commutator subspace Com(J) if and only if :::: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{1+n} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left( \\\\mu(k,A) - \\\\mu(k,B) \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\in j :where j is the Calkin sequence space corresponding to J and Œº(A), Œº(B) are the singular values of A and B, respectively. Provided that the eigenvalue sequences of all operators in J belong to the Calkin sequence space j there is a spectral characterisation for arbitrary (non-normal) operators. It is not valid for every two-sided ideal but necessary and sufficient conditions are known. Nigel Kalton and American mathematician Ken Dykema introduced the condition first for countably generated ideals. Uzbek and Australian mathematicians Fedor Sukochev and Dmitriy Zanin completed the eigenvalue characterisation. : Theorem. Suppose J is a two-sided ideal such that a bounded operator A belongs to J whenever there is a bounded operator B in J such that :If the bounded operator A and B belong to J then A ‚àí B belongs to the commutator subspace Com(J) if and only if :::: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{1+n} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left( \\\\lambda(k,A) - \\\\lambda(k,B) \\\\right) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\in j :where j is the Calkin sequence space corresponding to J and Œª(A), Œª(B) are the sequence of eigenvalues of the operators A and B, respectively, rearranged so that the absolute value of the eigenvalues is decreasing. Most two-sided ideals satisfy the condition in the Theorem, included all Banach ideals and quasi-Banach ideals.  Consequences of the characterisation  * Every operator in J is a sum of commutators if and only if the corresponding Calkin sequence space j is invariant under taking Ces√†ro means. In symbols, Com(J) J is equivalent to C(j) j, where C denotes the Ces√†ro operator on sequences. * In any two-sided ideal the difference between a positive operator and its diagonalisation is a sum of commutators. That is, A ‚àí diag(Œº(A)) belongs to Com(J) for every positive operator A in J where diag(Œº(A)) is the diagonalisation of A in an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the separable Hilbert space H. * In any two-sided ideal satisfying () the difference between an arbitrary operator and its diagonalisation is a sum of commutators. That is, A ‚àí diag(Œª(A)) belongs to Com(J) for every operator A in J where diag(Œª(A)) is the diagonalisation of A in an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the separable Hilbert space H and Œª(A) is an eigenvalue sequence. * Every quasi-nilpotent operator in a two-sided ideal satisfying () is a sum of commutators.  Application to traces  A trace œÜ on a two-sided ideal J of B(H) is a linear functional œÜ:J ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ that vanishes on Com(J). The consequences above imply * The two-sided ideal J has a non-zero trace if and only if C(j) ‚â† j. * œÜ(A) = œÜ‚àòdiag(Œº(A)) for every positive operator A in J where diag(Œº(A)) is the diagonalisation of A in an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the separable Hilbert space H. That is, traces on J are in direct correspondence with symmetric functionals on j. * In any two-sided ideal satisfying (), œÜ(A) = œÜ‚àòdiag(Œª(A)) for every operator A in J where diag(Œª(A)) is the diagonalisation of A in an arbitrary orthonormal basis of the separable Hilbert space H and Œª(A) is an eigenvalue sequence. * In any two-sided ideal satisfying (), œÜ(Q)=0 for every quasi-nilpotent operator Q from J and every trace œÜ on J.  Examples  Suppose H is a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space. * Compact operators. The compact linear operators K(H) correspond to the space of converging to zero sequences, c0. For a converging to zero sequence the Ces√†ro means converge to zero. Therefore, C(c0) = c0 and Com(K(H)) K(H). * Finite rank operators. The finite rank operators F(H) correspond to the space of sequences with finite non-zero terms, c00. The condition :::: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_n}{n} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\in c_{00} :occurs if and only if :::: a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_N = 0 :for the sequence (a1, a2, ... , aN, 0, 0 , ...) in c00. The kernel of the operator trace Tr on F(H) and the commutator subspace of the finite rank operators are equal, ker Tr Com(F(H)) ‚ää F(H). * Trace class operators. The trace class operators L1 correspond to the summable sequences. The condition :::: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_n}{n} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\in \\\\ell_{1} :is stronger than the condition that a1 \\\\+ a2 ... = 0. An example is the sequence with :::: a_n = \\\\frac{1}{n \\\\log^2(n)} , \\\\quad n \\\\geq 2 . :and :::: a_1 = - \\\\sum_{n=2}^\\\\infty a_n. which has sum zero but does not have a summable sequence of Ces√†ro means. Hence Com(L1) ‚ää ker Tr ‚ää L1. * Weak trace class operators. The weak trace class operators L1,‚àû correspond to the weak-l1 sequence space. From the condition :::: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_n}{n} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\in \\\\ell_{1,\\\\infty} :or equivalently :::: \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ a_1 + a_2 + \\\\cdots + a_n \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^\\\\infty = O(1) it is immediate that Com(L1,‚àû)+ (L1)+. The commutator subspace of the weak trace class operators contains the trace class operators. The harmonic sequence 1,1/2,1/3,...,1/n,... belongs to l1,‚àû and it has a divergent series, and therefore the Ces√†ro means of the harmonic sequence do not belong to l1,‚àû. In summary, L1 ‚ää Com(L1,‚àû) ‚ää L1,‚àû.

History It is believed that Macau Mosque was built by Muslims who arrived with the Portuguese army. Originally, these Muslims were recruited from South Asia by the army. Within the complex area, there are also Muslim cemetery with some of the tombs dated back for hundreds of years, indicating that Islam had arrived in Macau since hundreds of years ago. In 1996, the IAM submitted a redevelopment plan of the mosque to Portuguese Macau government but was not approved. To accommodate the increasing number of Muslims in Macau, in 2006 the IAM applied for government permission to build a new larger mosque in area adjacent to the current mosque building. In the late months of 2007, Macau Mosque underwent renovation. In the future, the new mosque is planned to be double in size to be a more modern mosque for Macau with a total area of 1,881 m2, 50 meters high and can accommodate up to 600 worshipers. An Islamic center, cheap Halal restaurant, 30-room hostel and classroom and 127-meter high 38-story residential building will also be constructed.http://yearbook.gcs.gov.mo/files/yearbook/2003/myb2003pPA02CH14.pdf Architecture The Macau Mosque and Cemetery area consists of Macau Mosque, extended area of the mosque, Macau Muslim cemetery, headquarters of the Islamic Association of Macau, ablution place, badminton court and playground. The size of Macau Mosque is around 6.5 meter x 12 meter which can accommodate around 100 worshipers.

The association was founded in 1935 in Portuguese Macau. More people visit the mosque on Sunday during their off days due to their tight working schedule in the weekdays or for wedding and during big Islamic festivities, such as Eid al-Adha.http://macaudailytimes.com.mo/muslims-gather-to-celebrate- eid-al-adha-in-macau.html Most of them do the Quran reading activities.

The screenplay is based on the novel The Amboy Dukes by Irving Shulman.. The film is notable as the credited screen debut of Tony Curtis (billed onscreen as \\"Anthony Curtis\\"). Plot Two members of a tough Brooklyn street gang accidentally kill one of their teachers. Frank Cusack is a leading member of the Amboy Dukes teenage gang based in a slum-ridden area of Brooklyn. His activities with the gang ultimately lead from vandalism and hooliganism to complicity in the murder of a school teacher. His hopes--and those of his parents--for an escape from the bleakness of slum life are dashed by circumstance and by his willingness to accept the gang code of not informing to the police. Summary The film possibly makes a more convincing impact due to its lack of big stars. The roles are filled mainly by unrecognizable or relatively new actors. Most importantly, the film emphasizes the terrible consequences for the parents and sister of the son - sixteen year old Frank - who engages in acts which are initially thoughtless and finally criminal. The parents, especially the mother (Thelma Ritter), are shown as decent, thoughtful working-class people. They devote their efforts, giving up personal dreams in the process, to provide for their children as best they can. They emphasize ideals and behavior that will enable Frank and his sister to rise out of the tenements. It is tragic irony that these efforts mean that neither parent is able to be home very often, so Frank is largely unsupervised and lacks consistent guidance. Although the film does suggest that lack of parental supervision is a reason for juvenile delinquency, it squarely pins the blame on living conditions as the chief cause: squalid and unhygienic surroundings, run-down tenements, cramped living space, overcrowding. The moods of frustration and hopelessness created by such an environment, the movie insists, are also prime contributors to juvenile delinquency. City Across the River highlights Frank's parents' contention that a good education for their children is the best way to lift the next generation from a sordid and dangerous environment.

Pryor, film critic for the New York Times, gave the film a positive review: \\"Despite its limited view, City Across the River is nevertheless an honest and tempered reflection of life. It is rich in character delineation, especially in minor roles, and there is a coarse, natural tang to much of the writing by Director-Producer Maxwell Shane and his co-scenarist, Dennis Cooper. Most of the players are comparatively unfamiliar, with the exception of Stephen McNally, who plays the role of a community center director in the neighborhood, and this gives the film an added degree of realism.\\"Pryor, Thomas M. The New York Times, film review, April 8, 1949. Accessed: July 31, 2013. Variety magazine praised the film: \\"Out of Irving Shulman‚Äôs grim novel, The Amboy Dukes, Maxwell Shane has whipped together a hardhitting and honest film on juvenile delinquency ... The plot threads are smoothly woven into the social fabric ... The performances by all members of the cast are marked by Shane's accent on naturalness.\\" Film critic Dennis Schwartz questioned the honesty of the screenplay: \\"This is a much softened version of Irving Schulman's The Amboy Dukes, a book about a rough gang of teenagers in the postwar [sic] period of Brooklyn ... This is a tired and clich√©d film with its main selling point all the good location shots of the city. Tony Curtis made his film debut, taking a small part as one of the Amboy Dukes. All the gang members are stock characters and the predictable story sheds little insight about juvenile delinquency, offering only an outsider's look into the grimness of street life ... This film missed what teenage life was like in the city slums by a country mile and instead threw together a clich√©-ridden story. The book was a popular hard-hitting novel. This film lost everything about the novel that was essential, and the robotic acting didn't help.\\"Schwartz, Dennis . Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, July 8, 2000. Accessed: July 31, 2013.

Modern Canbury comprises two electoral wards in the constituency of Richmond Park; Canbury Ward to the south and Tudor Ward to the north. History Canbury ward of Kingston upon Thames Municipal Borough in 1868. There is evidence of prehistoric occupation from at least the Mesolithic along the river margins at Kingston, although most of the evidence tends to consist of scattered residual artefacts. Despite numerous archaeological investigations in the area of Kingston since the 1960s there have been few in-situ archaeological finds and features dating to the Roman period. The few finds that there have been come from Canbury; a burial ground excavated in the 19th century, not far from the river and railway line, excavations at Skerne Road in 2005, and the Sopwith Way and Skerne Road areas in 2007. These have revealed evidence of small-scale and agricultural Roman settlements. =Manor= Despite Kingston's Saxon heritage, Canbury does not feature as part of the settlement of that period. Canbury, or Canonbury, is not mentioned in Domesday Book of 1086, but was held by Merton Priory at an early period, probably dating from the grant of Kingston Church by High Sheriff of Surrey Gilbert the Norman (or \\"Gilbert the Knight\\"), in about 1114. The possessions of the Merton monastery in Kingston and Hache, (Hatch), exclusive of Berwell, were valued, in Cardinal Beaufort's time, (‚Äì1447) at 52s. The manorial holdings included parts of open fields and buildings in the neighbouring manor of Ham with Hatch, probably the result of gifts to the church and priory as Ham had no church of its own until 1832 and lay within the parish of Kingston. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the manor, with the rectory and advowson of Kingston, was the subject of various Crown leases. The manor was bought for ¬£4,000 by Sir John Ramsay in 1618. Ramsay also held land in Petersham and Ham to the north, living at Ham House. Ramsay was created Baron of Kingston upon Thames and Earl of Holderness in 1620, and obtained a grant of the advowson in 1622. He married Martha, daughter of Sir William Cockayne, and died without issue in 1626. The rectory, manor, and advowson then passed, under a settlement, to his widow, who married as her second husband Montague, Lord Willoughby. On the death of the Countess of Holderness without heirs in 1640, the advowson, rectory, and manor reverted to the Crown estate of King James I. The Court-rolls show that in 1635 it became the property of William Murray, Esq. afterwards 1st Earl of Dysart, who had also acquired the lease of Ham House in 1626 following Ramsay's death. In 1641 Murray conveyed the manor to Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin, a relative of his wife. In 1652 it appears to have belonged to Arabella, Countess of Kent, and others. In 1664, it was the property of another John Ramsey, Esq. who alienated it to Nicholas Hardinge, Esq. in 1671. It continued in the Hardinge family for a century, becoming the property of George Hardinge Esq. M.P.. The manor included part of the town of Kingston. John Rocque's map of 1746 shows the area comprising a patchwork of large fields transected by a few roads, the principle north‚Äìsouth route being Canbury Lane, the precursor to a section of the modern A307 road. Until this time it probably represented the early endowment of the church, and the manor had followed the descent of the advowson until 1786, when George Hardinge sold the right of patronage, but retained the manor. The manor-house, which was close to the town, was sold to John Eddington, Esq. The manor house, Down Hall or Downhall, stood south of the railway line and bridge. It was described in 1911 as being a grey stuccoed house with jalousies and older kitchens behind. It had been held in the 13th century of the manor of Canbury (q.v.) by Lewin and Alan le Mariner, and was afterwards leased to Ralf Wakelin and Beatrice his wife. In 1485‚Äì6 it was styled a 'capital messuage' or 'manor,' and was held of Merton by Robert Skerne, on whose death in that year it passed to Swithin his son. Robert Skerne was son of William Skerne, who founded the chantry in Kingston Church. William was nephew to Robert Skerne, who died in 1437, and has a brass in the church. Bray says, in his History of the County of Surrey that this Robert was also of Downhall, but others have been unable to corroborate this. It was conveyed in 1617 by Mildred Bond, widow, and Thomas Bond to Anthony Browne and Matilda his wife. Not far away stood the ancient tithe barn, large enough for twelve teams to unload and with four threshing floors. It was sold in 1850 and pulled down. The manor seems to have disappeared by the beginning of the 19th century following its sale on 4 September 1800 to Wilbraham Tollemache, 6th Earl of Dysart, whose family had retained the manors of Ham and Petersham to the north since their forebear, William Murray, had last held Canbury. =Urbanisation= The Dysarts' acquisition of Canbury was well timed as Kingston expanded northwards during the 19th century. The expansion was driven by the coming of the railway to the area with the extension of the line from Twickenham to Kingston completed in 1863, then extended to Norbiton in 1869 to its terminus at Ludgate Hill. Developers bought of Lord Liverpool's Farm to the north and east of the railway as well as next to Kingston Station, and of pasture and arable land of the Dysart estate. The mixed Victorian housing stock that characterises the area today reflects the piecemeal development that occurred during this period. =Industrial development= The arrival of the railway also drove industrial growth. The poor sanitation of the expanding town was addressed, in part, by 1877 with the construction of sewage works near the river to the north of the railway line, operated on behalf of Kingston Corporation by the Native Guano Company. Raw sewage was treated using the ABC Process, toasted in huge ovens to produce a garden fertiliser sold as ‚ÄòNative Guano‚Äô. King's Passage, at the end of the adjacent Canbury Gardens, was known at the time as ‚ÄòPerfume Parade‚Äô. The public nuisance contributed to the decommissioning of the works in 1909. A large part of the adjacent area was used for Kingston Gasworks, from the 1850s onwards. Although much of the site has since been redeveloped for retail, leisure, parking and residential use, the gasometers, the last remaining feature of the area, have now been demolished for the Queenshurst development. The coal-fired Kingston Power Station was built in 1894 with coal arriving by barge and rail and ash departing by barge. The station was closed in 1980, demolished, and the area, controversially, redeveloped for high-rise riverside apartments. The felling of a line of trees that had previously helped screen the power station from the river also aroused much local protest. Sopwith Camel The Sopwith Aviation Company expanded from its early beginnings at Brooklands to a former Roller Skating Rink in Canbury Park Road in 1912, drawing on the availability of boatbuilding and coachbuilding skills in the area to scale up aircraft production. By 1915 they were successful enough to build a site further along Canbury Park Road. The company rose to prominence during World War I producing many famous fighter aircraft including the Sopwith Camel and leasing National Aircraft Factory No 2 at Ham. After the war the Ham lease was sold and the company wound up but almost immediately reformed as H.G. Hawker Engineering at the Canbury Park Road site. The company and its successors remained there, going on to design and build the Hawker Hurricane fighter of World War II amongst many others. Hawker Aircraft bought the Ham factory in 1948 and, after redevelopment, moved from Canbury Park Road in 1958. Both sites have since been redeveloped for residential use. =Open spaces= Latchmere Recreation Ground, Kingston upon Thames Some areas of open space were retained within the urban development. The riverside walk developed into Canbury Gardens. The nearby Richmond Road ground was an athletics and rugby ground before becoming the home of Kingstonian F.C. between 1919 and 1988. The Latchmere Recreation Ground was conveyed by William John Manners Tollemache, 9th Earl of Dysart and the Dysart Trustees on 23 February 1904 to the Municipal Borough of Kingston- upon-Thames, \\"Kingston Corporation\\", as part of the settlement of the Richmond, Petersham and Ham Open Spaces Act 1902. The land itself, though, remained within and defined part of the southern boundary of Ham Urban District. This, and the southern half of Ham, was absorbed into Kingston, becoming part of the present day Tudor Ward when the Urban District was abolished in 1933. Geography Canbury district extends westwards from the River Thames at Kingston Railway Bridge following the railway line through Kingston station eastwards towards Norbiton railway station and thence north to Richmond Park. It then extends northwards along the park wall to the border with the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames at Ham. The Canbury electoral ward comprises four polling areas in the southern part of the district with a further four in Tudor Ward to the north. Canbury lies on alluvial flood plains extending from the river to the foot of Kingston Hill between 5.5m and 9.5m AOD and comprising river gravels overlain by holocene brickearth clays and silts. The Latchmere Stream, a small watercourse now mostly culverted, that flows south‚Äìnorth along the foot of the hill towards Ham, once marked part of the boundary. There is evidence that the area close to present day Kingston town centre was once crossed by many watercourses linking with the Thames and the Hogsmill forming a series of islands upon which Kingston was built, and the Latchmere linked with these.

Sears was inspired to sing and play guitar after receiving a copy of Phil Thornalley's Swamp album at age four. He asked for a guitar at age five and the following Christmas he received one but his interest soon shifted to drums and he began playing drums after his parents bought him a drum set when he was eight. Inspired by blues artists, notably Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Lightnin' Hopkins as well as the soul, rock and funk music his parents would play, he got started after his father purchased for him a Lonnie Mack CD and he began taking guitar seriously at age 11 after a cousin turned him onto Jimi Hendrix. At age 12, Sears asked his father to take him to an open-mic at a local club and Sears began gaining recognition as a young blues guitarist. Sears began sitting in with local bands and soon began appearing with Hubert Sumlin, Ronnie Baker Brooks (once referring to Sears as a \\"young Rico Suave\\"), Guitar Shorty, Bob Margolin, Chris Beard, Ana Popovic, Michael Burks, G. Love and Special Sauce, Fruteland Jackson, Lil' Ed Williams, Charlie Musselwhite, Bobby Rush, Inner Circle, Henry Gray, John Primer, Jimmy \\"Bo\\" Horne, Pinetop Perkins, backed up The Temptations, and even appeared with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Solomon Burke who dubbed Sears \\"the future [of Soul and Blues]\\" and referred to him as \\"godson\\". Within a few months he was playing professionally. In early 2004 Sears assembled a band of veteran musicians and he began booking shows at local clubs and festivals on the weekends and developed a loyal fan base and attracted the attention of several independent labels. Career =Debut album: Transitions= Sears national debut album Transitions, a jazz-rock influenced collection of classic and obscure blues covers was released in September 2005. Sears enrolled in virtual school so that he could play music full-time. He began touring in support of Transitions, which led to appearances at notable venues such as Sarasota Blues Fest in Sarasota, Florida; Skippers Smokehouse in Tampa, Florida, and slowly built his way to headlining or co-headlining appearances at House of Blues in Orlando, Florida, on The Waterfront in Rockford, Illinois, and Cultural Fest in Las Vegas. His second CD, Blues Power, was released in fall of 2006. Looking to expand his musical horizons, Sears taught himself how to play over 20 instruments and learned the technical side of music production. =Southern Soul, Florida Style= Reggie Sears performing live in 2016 In late 2006, Sears moved to the Southern soul genre with the release of his third album, Southern Soul, Florida Style, a collection of blues and Southern soul songs that gained little exposure or radio play despite the lead single \\"Back That Thang Up\\" finding its way on some radio playlists and club reports. Sears slowly built a strong fan base in the Southern soul market by tirelessly touring the south's Chitlin circuit of rural juke joints, ghetto bars, and blues festivals. Despite his often suggestive lyrics and racy concert performances which was deemed too explicit for commercial audiences, he became an underground success across the South and audiences, especially female ones, flocked to see Sears in concert. His fourth album was released in mid-2007 with the lead single \\"Dip My Dipper\\" faring well. In 2007, he served as musical director and lead guitarist for Miami soul singer David Hudson as well as guitarist/bassist and musical director for The Soul Generals while recording his fifth CD, his would-be major label debut Sweet Thang, which was ultimately shelved in 2009 and remains unreleased. By the end of the year Sears went on hiatus from music at age 16 after personal problems arose. After a bout of depression and an attempted suicide, he turned his life over to God and began to do shows again, editing the lyrics to many of his songs and considerably cleaning up his stage show. The next few years went by with a few singles and some sporadic tour dates on the Chittlin' circuit. In 2010, Sears won a Soul Patrol \\"best of\\" in the Slow Jam category for his digital-single \\"You Betrayed Me\\". In November of that year he released his most successful single to date \\"Dirty Dancer\\" which fared well on the Southern soul charts, hitting number one in several markets. Sears was nominated for Soul Blues Music Award for \\"Best New Artist\\". =So Many Roads= Sears began to embrace the neo-soul and urban Adult Contemporary Rhythm and Blues (R&B;) sound with the release of the low-profile single \\"Can't Get You Out of My System\\" in early 2011. By this time Sears had devoted much of his time to church. Nothing else was heard from him until early 2012 when he released \\"With Every Beat of My Heart.\\" Sears continued writing and recording new songs and performing locally but dedicated most of his time to preaching while also doing session work, appearing as the featured guitarist on Anakarenn's debut album as well as production work on Black Zack's Southern Soul Radio album, and producing and mentoring local artists. In 2015 he toured as a bassist for Blowfly and played keyboards and guitar on his final album 77 Rusty Trombones. Later that year he began working with Timmy Thomas as a multi-instrumentalist and opening act. Sears is currently in production on a new album titled \\"So Many Roads\\". =Gear= In the studio Sears uses a plethora of guitars, amps and effects. He plays a Gibson B.B. King Lucille Signature ES-335, an assortment of Squier Stratocasters, an Epiphone Les Paul, Epiphone SG, and a few Harmony electric guitars however, he most notably is known for playing the Fender Buddy Guy Stratocaster, a guitar he has owned since he was 12 years old. He plays through an amp chain of a Fender Hot Rod Deville, Marshall JCM 2000 and a Dean Markley K-20 amp to get his signature sound.
