It is located from Earth, orbiting the unclassified star Kepler-124 in the constellation Cygnus. Within The Kepler-124 system (KOI-241) there are three known planets, Kepler-124b being both the smallest and closest to its parent star.  Characteristics  Kepler-124b is located from Earth orbiting the star Kepler-124. Both Kepler-124b and its host star are smaller than our own planet and star, respectively; Kepler-124b is estimated to be 0.729¬±0.045 Earth radii (0.065¬±0.004 Jupiter radii), and its parent star Kepler-124 is estimated to be 68.7% of the mass the Sun, approximately 0.636¬±0.030 solar radii. It is the smallest discovered planet in the Kepler-124 system, and has the closest orbit of the three known planets. Kepler-124b orbits 96% closer to its star than Earth (approximately 3 Earth days), which in the Kepler-124 system is inside the inner limit of the star's habitable zone.  Discovery  Like many Exoplanets discovered by the Kepler telescope, Kepler-124b was found using the transit method. The transit method utilizes the high magnification and numerous instruments on the Kepler telescope to detect slight fluctuations in brightness of a star being observed. These dips can indicate the presence planet and determine certain parameters of it as well. Kepler-124b was initially only a planet candidate but was later confirmed as an exoplanet; a statistical analysis by a team at NASA Ames Research Center validated the existence of Kepler-124b with 99% assurance, along with Kepler-124c and Kepler-124d. Although scientists are very confident about some of Kepler-124b's parameters, many are still unknown.

It is a government body that has most influence in national security and intelligence issues and the minister in charge has been the de facto national security advisor to the Sultan. The Palace Office also acts as a foreign liaison focus on all international intelligence and security matters. The minister holding the post has the full title Minister of the Royal Office and Head of the Office of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The Royal Office Minister currently serves as the chair of the Defence Council (on behalf of the Sultan). The Defence Council is an extra-parliamentary body tasked with coordinating the actions of the country's various security and armed forces. The current Minister of the Royal Office is General Sultan bin Mohammed al Nua'mani (appointed in 2011); he had been Secretary General of the Royal Court Affairs. Nasser bin Hamoud al Kindi took over the latter post. The Royal Office is located in Qurum. Its nearest government agency neighbor being the Internal Security Service (ISS), also based in Qurum (Post Code 112). History Although the Palace Office as is may not have been established until the 1980s there is evidence that British advisors had begun the work of setting the office up as early as 1972. Certainly influential characters such as Brigadier Sir Timothy Landon and Sheilagh Bailey were critical in developing the early functionality of what would become the Palace Office. It was particularly important that the small nucleus of trusted advisors made arrangements to secure the ruler of Oman in the 1970s and establish contacts with neighboring states to ensure their cooperation. Office functions The functions of the Minister of the Palace Office are: #To head the office of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. #Be a lead member of the Sultanate's Defense Committee. #Oversee the functions of special security capabilities within the Sultanate (e.g. the ISS and Sultan's Special Forces)Ibid., p.91 #Act as external liaison to international intelligence and security agencies. #Act with the Royal Oman Police and ISS to form and implement anti-corruption policy in the Sultanate. National security challenges It seems certain that the main National Security Challenges affecting Oman are internal rather than external and an attempted coup d'etat in 2005, which was easily quashed and street unrest in the spring of 2011 and later in 2012, all point to a simmering unrest with the status quo. In early March 2011 HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said decided to replace two key ministers who were seen by many as not keeping in touch with young Omanis not benefiting from Oman's national advances. The long-standing favorite advisor of the Sultan General Ali bin Majid al Maamari was replaced by the relatively unknown and younger General Sultan bin Mohammed al Nua'mani. The current Minister's remit appears unchanged. The Sultanate has also experienced challenges in maintaining its neutrality in the conflict in neighboring Yemen. It has been accused by its GCC partners of not being genuinely neutral and favoring the Houthi rebels.

The protagonists in their Kamen Rider forms. is a 2017 Japanese tokusatsu drama and the 28th entry in the Kamen Rider series. It is primarily set in Touto, an eastern region of Japan separated by the Skywall Disaster. Nascita Several characters gather at Nascita, a caf√© owned by S≈çichi Isurugi where he lives with his daughter Misora. They shelter Sento and later Ryuga. However, the revelation that S≈çichi Isurugi is Blood Stalk, and had been possessed by the evil alien Evolto, compromises the caf√©'s status as a safehouse until he leaves Touto. =Sento Kiryu= is a 26-year-old genius who is trustful and puts the safety of others above himself. Though level-headed and compassionate, Sento is egotistical with a dangerous temper when provoked. Prior to the start of the series, he was found by S≈çichi Isurugi with total amnesia except for being experimented upon by Night Rogue. S≈çichi gave Sento his name and convinced him to help fight the Faust organization and its Smash creations in hope of regaining his memories. While helping Ryuga clear his name, Sento learns that an Evolto-possessed S≈çichi masterminded the events that ruined both his and Ryuga's lives, and a defeated Gentoku reveals Sento's true identity. During the events of Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider, Sento and Ryuga encounter some Bugsters in their world, fighting despite seeing their attacks don't work, Sento decides to use Ex-Aid's powers, seeing which have an effect, Kaiser is suddenly attacked and steals the bottles Sento recovers while Ryuga is thrown into a machine which sends him to a parallel world where the Skywall does not exist. Afterward, Sento meets Parad, who demands the Ex-Aid Fullbottles, where S≈çichi appears and explains about Kaiser's, Sento and Parad decide to learn more about their plans. In the end, Sento, along with Emu and the other main Kamen Riders, decides to end the Kaiser duo's plan. Sento was actually Faust's founder, Takumi Katsuragi, whose memories were lost after a failed assassination attempt on Evolto. After being knocked unconscious by Evolto, his face was swapped with the recently murdered musician , to be experimented upon by Gentoku as part of Evolto's plan to complete Takumi's Rider Systems for the civil war Evolto causes. However, Sento joins forces with Kazumi and Gentoku to fight against Evolto. After a failed suicide attack on Evolto, Katsuragi's personality re-emerges and tries to take matters into his own hands. Eventually, Sento and Katsuragi came to terms with each other, allowing the former to regain control of his body while the latter acted as his spiritual adviser. Following Evolto's destruction and apparent erasure from Earth, Sento learned their world was assimilated into the \\"Prime\\" Kamen Rider universe with the Skywall Disaster and subsequent deaths averted. This left Sento misplaced, seen as a complete stranger or mistaken for Tar≈ç Sat≈ç. He later finds his own reality's Ryuga, who was in the same situation, and the two decide to start their lives anew. It is later revealed that many of the previous episodes' opening recaps are actually memoirs written by Sento which he intends to use as the basis of a television series he and Ryuga are collaborating on, subtly breaking the fourth wall. During the Build New World films, Sento is convinced that Kamen Riders are no longer needed before changing his mind after Killbus appears on Earth. He later enlists Takumi's help to develop a serum that would restore the memories and abilities of himself and his fellow Kamen Riders from their universe. Sento is able to transform into Kamen Rider Build by using the to combine two . Depending on the combination of Fullbottles, one of which corresponds to a person or animal and one which corresponds to an object, he can access various forms. Certain combinations work better than others, with strong forms called a , which can perform the finisher. Weaker forms called a can perform the finisher. The Best Match forms are inspired by Misora Isurugi's childhood drawings, according to S≈çichi's past memories. By himself, Sento's initial Hazard Level is 3 (see Smash, below). The continuous use of the Hazard Trigger and Pandora Panel (later Genius Fullbottle) allows it to rise rapidly towards 7, allowing him to transform the Rabbit Fullbottle into a golden state. Best Matches: *His \\"True Best Match\\" and default Best Match is , a.k.a. . This form is achieved by using the Fullbottle, which equips the spring-like spring on his left leg for superhuman reflexes, and the Fullbottle, which equips the tread-like tread on his right leg for enhanced kicking.

Sento Kiryu is portrayed by , who also portrays Tar≈ç Sat≈ç. =Ryuga Banjo= is a 23-year-old former professional fighter who was born in Yokohama. Prior to his birth, a portion of Evolto's essence, which had come to Earth via a Martian probe, fused with the unborn Ryuga in a failed attempt to possess his mother at the probe exhibit. As a result, Ryuga was born after only two months of gestation, and spent much of his childhood being tested by Namba Industries. Ryuga was orphaned at age 13 when his parents died in a traffic accident, and it was revealed in Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z that Evolto actually murdered them to raise their son's Hazard Level. Takumi Katsuragi, the founder of Faust, learned of Ryuga's nature and hired him under false pretenses, intending to kill both S≈çichi Isurugi into Ryuga while they were possessed by Evolto. Takumi's plan backfires, and Ryuga is framed for Takumi's apparent death. Ryuga was kidnapped from prison by Faust's agent Nabeshima for experimentation. Due to his half-alien physiology, Ryuga manages to escape and is found by Sento who hopes to learn of his past. Shortly after, Ryuga is forced to watch his girlfriend Kasumi Ogura be turned into a Smash, dying due to her low Hazard Level. Sento gave him the Dragon Fullbottle containing her Smash essence as a keepsake, and later a small robotic dragon- like companion known as the . Ryuga is given a copy of the Build Driver from Sento, and adopted the mantle of . During the events of Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider, Ryuga and Sento encounter some Bugsters in their world, after that Sento is attacked and Ryuga continues to be transported by him in parallel world where the Skywall does not exist, where he meets Emu and his friends, along with Emu decides to find out the plans of Reverse Kaiser, and thus put an end to the plans of the Kaisers. Ryuga learned of his true origins from Vernage while manipulated by Evolto's machinations to strengthen his alien genes to make him a more-suitable host. During the events of the film Be the One, manipulated by Kengo In≈ç to attack Sento, Ryuga played a role in Sento's ability to assume Cross-Z Build Form when they absorbed him to defeat Kamen Rider Blood. In the final clash against Evolto, Ryuga sacrifices himself to restrain a weakened Evolto as they are sucked into a wormhole created by the complete Pandora Box, with Evolto absorbing him in a final attempt to survive. Sento frees Ryuga as the alien is permanently destroyed. Due to Sento's actions, the Pandora Box transports Ryuga into the \\"Prime\\" Kamen Rider universe after it absorbed his reality. Sento finds him after running into the prime universe's Ryuga, an active sports fighter in a relationship with his reality's Kasumi. Ryuga then joins Sento in making a new life for themselves. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z, Ryuga lives with Sento and makes a living selling Sento's experiments, until he meets Yui Mabuchi and joins forces with Evolto to defeat Killbus, starting a new relationship with Yui in the process. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease, he is in charge of delivering the Perfect Kingdom to Kazumi once Sento finishes creating it, so that he can defeat Keiji once and for all, in addition to saving Misora. Due to Ryuga's alien origins and the experiments done on him by Faust, he has extraordinary abilities such as increased strength, being able to raise his Hazard Level faster than usual and manipulating the Pandora Box. Once reaching Hazard Level 7, Ryuga transformed the Dragon Fullbottle into the Silver Dragon Fullbottle. Although a strong fighter, Ryuga is easily provoked and not too intelligent. However, he was kind-hearted and generally puts others before himself. During Evolto's awakening of Phase 4, Cross-Z suffers from uncontrollable rage of his past life as Evolto, which also granted him the power of manipulating black holes at a smaller rate before they were ultimately neutralized when Vernage's essence was transferred into him during Misora's rescue. The original Kamen Rider Cross-Z transforms by inserting the Dragon Fullbottle into the Cross-Z Dragon, which is then inserted into the Build Driver. Aside from gaining symmetrical Halfbodies, Cross-Z obtains the torso armor that allows him to channel energy flames as attacks and empower his finisher. Unlike Build, Cross-Z can use the Dragon Fullbottle's powers due to the Cross-Z Dragon negating its side-effects. His main weapon is the sword-like , which like the Drill Crusher can hold a Fullbottle for Cross-Z to perform one of three finishers: , , or . Said weapon is usually empowered by his Lock Fullbottle. Additional forms: * is Cross-Z's super form and a silver-colored upgrade that was accessed via the finalized and a Dragon .

Cross-Z Charge's main weapon is the , which has a gun-like and a jackhammer-like . Unlike the Drill Crusher and Beat Closer, the Twin Breaker can hold up to two Fullbottles and Sclashjellies, and either the Rabbit Tank Sparkling or the Cross-Z Dragon, for him to perform its finisher. Inserting an organic Fullbottle into the Sclash Driver allows Cross-Z Charge to perform the , having once used the Taka Fullbottle for flight purposes. However, usage of the Sclash Driver exposes Ry≈´ga to unfiltered Nebula Gas which causes him to become aggressive until he is later able to overcome this effect. This form was lost when Ry≈´ga shielded Vernage at the cost of his Dragon Sclashjelly. Although another Dragon Sclashjelly was created, he lent it to Grease as Cross-Z favors his later upgrades instead. Ryuga uses this form again in Kamen Rider Heisei Generations FOREVER and in Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z. *, a.k.a. the , is Cross-Z's initial final form, accessed by inserting the loaded with the Fullbottle into the Build Driver. Although its purpose as an upgraded form was envisioned, further developments were put on hold as the three Riders tried to storm the Pandora Tower until Ry≈´ga's own resolve completed the Dragon Magma Fullbottle as the final component. By himself, Cross-Z Magma can channel as empowerment for attacks, creating snake-dragon constructs and manifesting a pair of wings for flight. His finisher in this form is the . With the Cross-Z Magma Knuckle as a handheld weapon, he can perform the finisher by channeling the power of any Fullbottles it used. Before relinquishing it to Grease, Cross-Z Magma was briefly in possession of the incomplete , having aided in its creation. With the Silver Dragon Fullbottle, he can perform finisher and weaken Evolto's DNA. In the final battle on Pandora Tower, use the Hazard Trigger, which allows him to fight on par with Evol Black Hole Form before the latter's transition into his monster form. * is an upgraded variant of the original Cross-Z, accessed by inserting the loaded with the Evol-Bottle into the Build Driver. Having lost Evolto's genes on his body after his liberation from possession, Ry≈´ga regains it by stealing the Dragon Evol-Bottle as it upgraded into its current form. His finisher in this form is the . *, a.k.a. , is Cross-Z's true final form accessed by using the Fullbottle in the Build Driver. It combines the power of Cross-Z and Evol, in addition, Ryuga absorbs Evol by using this form, invoking Evol's Black Hole Form, unlike Cross-Z Build, Ryuga is the one who takes control in this form for as long as Evolto gives him power. This form has three finishers: , , . This form is exclusive to Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z. Ryuga Banjo is portrayed by . =Misora Isurugi= is S≈çichi's 19-year-old daughter who works as Sento's assistant. She gained supernatural power after being exposed to the Pandora Box and spending seven years in a coma. She played a role in Project Build, as Evolto used S≈çichi's memories of her drawings of organic and inorganic-based objects to influence Shinobu in developing the Best Match aspect of the technology. She was kidnapped by Faust for experimentation, but S≈çichi rescued her a year ago. Fearing that Faust is still hunting her, she remained in Nascita while using her online idol identity to gather Smash intel and occasionally money from her fanbase. Misora was unaware that her father is actually a high-ranking Faust agent who used her, Sento and Ryuga as tools to create a Kamen Rider army within Touto, though she may have learned of this while being driven to despair. She later uses her powers to cure Taizan Himuro of S≈çichi's poison so he can resume his duties as Touto's prime minister and thereafter discovers that her father is possessed by Evolto, the true villain committing the crimes. During the events of Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider, Misora is in charge of purifying the Ex-Aid bottle in two, she also helps Sento find out Kaiser's hiding place. Misora possesses the ability to purify and enhance Nebula Gas which made her a target of Faust. Initially, using the ability put her to sleep for a week; Sento later developed a machine to mitigate this. After she is nearly killed by a berserk Build Hazard Form, her ability increases so she can purify the higher Nebula Gas concentrations like those from the Hazard Trigger. Sento used her power to create the Fully Shook Rabbit Tank Bottle and Fullbottle Buster to negate the Hazard Trigger's side-effects. During the invasion by Seito, the western part of Japan, Misora's Martian bracelet is revealed to house the spirit of the Martian Vernage and the source of Misora's power. Misora was later kidnapped by Evolto and turned into the that can throw discs. Sento saves her by extracting Vernage to render Misora completely human and transfers the alien into Ryuga. After the universes are merged at the conclusion of the series, an alternate Misora is shown to be a waitress at her father's caf√©. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z she recovers the memories of her alternate self after Killbus began the process of destruction with the Pandora Box. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease she runs Piccolo Nascita, a mobile caf√©. After Downfall is defeated, she dates Kazumi. Misora Isurugi is portrayed by . As a child, Misora is portrayed by . =Sawa Takigawa= is a 27-year-old freelance journalist dedicated to learning about Build and the Smash. Build saved her from the Needle Smash, and she assists Sento after learning his true identity. While she is a spy for Namba Heavy Industries, Sawa is actually using her position to investigate the cover-up of an industrial accident she believes killed her father. When Misora exposed her duplicity, Sawa is punished by being turned into the octopus-themed before she is defeated by Ryuga with Sento extracting the Nebula Gas from her system. She then decides to atone for her actions and join forces with Sento's group to fight against Namba and Faust. Sawa becomes protective of Misora, especially after learning of the younger woman's past. During the events of Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider, Sawa helps Sento find out about Kaiser's past. Sawa is later revealed to be a brainwashed Namba agent, her motivating drive about her father being a fabrication. She was supposed to let herself die after failing Namba's mission but the familial bonds she made with Sento and the others gave her a reason to live and influenced her decision to cut ties with Namba. Sawa accomplishes this by aiding Sento in the ploy to trick Namba by giving him a fragment of Sento's research on the Fully Shook Rabbit Tank Bottle; Kazumi rescues the Nabeshima family whom Namba held hostage as leverage against Sawa, freeing her from Namba's control. She later helps take care of S≈çichi, who had entered a coma after Evolto releases him from his control. After Sento merged his world with that of the \\"Prime\\" Kamen Rider universe, an alternate Sawa is shown to also be working as a journalist. She nervously passed a business card to this new world's version of Gentoku for an interview. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z she recovers the memories of her alternate self after Killbus began the process of destruction with the Pandora Box. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease she reveals to Sento and Ry≈´ga that she is dating Gentoku. Sawa Takigawa is portrayed by . =S≈çichi Isurugi= is the enigmatic 48-year-old owner of Nascita and Misora's father who is actually Faust's high-ranking member . He is a kind-hearted man and a good friend to Takumi's father Shinobu Katsuragi. Ten years prior to the series, he was the astronaut who discovered the abandoned Evol-Driver and the Pandora Box on Mars. This resulted in his possession by the alien entity Evolto who used him to commit numerous atrocities including the Skywall Disaster, framing Shinobu, and manipulating Takumi and Misora for his own ends. S≈çichi's personality occasionally resurfaces to briefly fight Evolto before being suppressed. S≈çichi was tricked into thinking that Evolto would leave his body upon retrieving the Evol- Driver, ending up in a coma; in the meantime Evolto possessed Ry≈´ga then Sento before creating his own body in S≈çichi's image. After Sento merged his world with that of the \\"Prime\\" Kamen Rider universe, an alternate S≈çichi is shown as an ordinary caf√©-owner of Nascita, when Killbus restored the Pandora Box because S≈çichi was never experienced with Nebula Gas, he was unable to recover his memories due to being possessed by Evolto. Due to being possessed by Evolto, S≈çichi gains several inhuman abilities. He can transmute matter, as shown when he transformed his tablet computer into pieces of paper. He can reshape a person's face and manipulate their memories. He can quickly leap into the air to escape. When Evolto possessed him, S≈çichi uses the Fullbottle to transform into Blood Stalk. As Blood Stalk, he can poison his opponents by stabbing them with an appendage, and hack Touto's Guardians with a simple flick. Through his animal motif, he can summon a projection of a large cobra for various applications. With the Devil Steam, he is able to either release Nebula Gas to change regular people into Smash via the Steam Blade or inject a Smash with a Nebula Gas-filled bullet to enlarge them into giants via the Steam Rifle. Via Rocket Fullbottle, Stalk can launch guided energy missiles. S≈çichi Isurugi is portrayed by . Sawatari Farm is the Sawatari family's potato farm in Hokuto, the northern region of Japan isolated by the Skywall Disaster. As the disaster made the region's soil infertile, Kazumi used his life's savings to support his workers. To continue doing so, he enlisted in the military, followed by a group of his farm workers who formed a unit called the Hokuto Three Crows. The remaining workers were all loyal to him, to the point of refusing his arrival when Namba Heavy Industries used them as hostages. =Kazumi Sawatari= is a 29-year-old soldier from Hokuto and the current owner of his farm. In hopes of obtaining more financial support, Kazumi volunteered for Hokuto's military and underwent Faust's human experimentation. Lying about his memory loss, Kazumi continued to use the Sclash Driver, which turned him into a bloodthirsty fighter, though he was able to control this effect. However, he despises cruelty; he threatened Hokuto's prime minister for ordering troops to target civilians during their invasion of Touto. He cares for his co-workers' welfare and was visibly upset when the Hokuto Three Crows underwent additional Nebula Gas infusion, knowing that their next defeat would guarantee their deaths. He is a fan of Misora, having watched her performances alongside his co-workers. Having first infiltrated Touto during the events of Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider to reclaim the Phoenix and Robot Fullbottles for Hokuto, Kazumi is deployed to lead the Hokuto army to invade Touto. His alter-ego, , was created based on the Robot Fullbottle. The invasion ends with Grease defeated by Build Hawk Gatling Hazard, and Cross-Z Charge saving Grease when Sento's Hazard Trigger goes berserk. During Seito's attack on Hokuto and Touto, he joins forces with those from Nascita in hopes of reclaiming his country. The Three Crows are killed and he gradually comes to terms with the loss, making peace with Sento and Gentoku. In hopes of catching up with Build and Cross-Z's growth in power, Kazumi and Gentoku allowed themselves to be kidnapped to forcefully raise their Hazard Levels at the risk of their lives. Kazumi fought alongside the Touto Riders to stop Evolto's genocidal plans. During that time, Sento created the Blizzard Knuckle for Grease, but made it incompatible with Sclash Driver, which might have been fatal. When facing powerful replicas of the Three Crows which Evolto created as his enforcers, Kazumi uses the Blizzard Knuckle in Shinobu's Build Driver to destroy the copies at the cost of his life, dissipating in Misora's arms. After Sento merged the worlds at the end of the series, an alternate Hokuto Three Crows try to set Kazumi on a blind date with Misora at Nascita. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z he recovers the memories of his alternate self along with the power to transform into Grease after Killbus began the process of destruction with the Pandora Box, helping Ryuga in his fight against Killbus. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease, he and the Hokuto Three Crows are the only ones who did not lose their powers because they bathed in a special water that was left of the old world, which is why only Kazumi could defeat Keiji and Downfall and thus save Misora, which he accomplishes after becoming Grease Perfect Kingdom. By himself, the injection of Nebula Gas allows Kazumi to utilize a Fullbottle's power at a smaller rate, which was enough to incinerate a Hazard Smash. He has the following forms: *The original Kamen Rider Grease is transformed through the use of the Sclash Driver and Robot Sclashjelly, with his finisher being the . His main weapon is the Twin Breaker, which channels the power of either two Fullbottles or one mixed with his Robot Sclashjelly. By inserting an inorganic Fullbottle into the Sclash Driver, Grease can perform the , manifesting per various attacks or means of transportation.

Initially, it was believed that the Crows had sacrificed their lives to ensure the completion of this form, but it is later revealed that Sento completed the power-up item in time, preventing the Crows from dying when they sacrificed their powers. This form is exclusive to Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease. Kazumi Sawatari is portrayed by . The numbers on his character's dog tags are a play on the name of a character he previously portrayed in Kamen Rider Kiva, Otoya Kurenai. =Hokuto Three Crows= The are a group of Hokuto soldiers who were originally workers of the Sawatari farm who enlisted to repay a debt to their former employer. Using Shinobu Katsuragi's Lost Fullbottles, they are each able to transform into enhanced form of the Smash known as and later the stronger , which gave increased strength but kills the user if they are knocked out of a transformation. Following their deaths, Grease kept their Bottles as memorabilia and had once combined their energies to perform a stronger attack. Evolto later creates corrupted copies of them to serve as his enforcers, but Kamen Rider Grease gave his life to destroy them. When Sento fuses the two worlds, an alternate Hokuto Three Crows are seen entering the cafeteria Nascita together with Kazumi. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z, they recover the memories of their alternate selves along with the power to transform into Smash after Killbus began the process of destruction with the Pandora Box. During the events of Kamen Rider Build NEW WORLD: Kamen Rider Grease, they sacrificed their powers and seemingly their lives to ensure Grease can transform into his Perfect Kingdom Form, but are later revealed to have survived, pretending to have died in order to give Kazumi the push he needed to defeat Keiji Uraga. Akaba , real name , uses the Fullbottle to transform into the that has the on his head and the two shields on his shoulder pads. He seems to possess a violent streak when he attacks civilians without hesitation, but is ultimately loyal to Kazumi, following his decisions even when he questions them. When Seito invaded Touto to steal the Pandora Box, Akaba sacrificed his life to protect it from Gentoku, but ultimately failed to prevent the theft. Akaba is portrayed by . Aoba , real name , uses the Fullbottle to transform into the stag beetle-themed that is armed with two sword-like . Despite his looks and mannerisms, Aoba is one of the kinder members of the Three Crows. He is unexpectedly killed during battle when Build goes on a rampage and uses the Hazard Finish against him. Aoba's death shocked both his own comrades and the Touto Riders, especially Sento who became depressed for taking a life. Kazumi later forgives Sento. Aoba is portrayed by . Kiba , real name , uses the Fullbottle to transform into the that has the two drones on his gauntlets. He behaves childishly, even acting literally like a child throwing a fit when defeated by Build in one battle. After Aoba's death, he becomes bitter and increasingly violent in combat. While trying to defend his homeland from Seito's invasion, Kiba becomes the Washio Brothers' hostage to force Kazumi into serving Seito. Despite Kazumi's effort to save him, Kiba is killed protecting Kazumi. His bottle is then used by a brainwashed Prime Minister Tajimi, until Build freed her from Nebula Gas exposure. Kiba is portrayed by . Faust is a mysterious terrorist organization that experiment on humans to create the Smash creatures. It was founded by Touto scientists Takumi Katsuragi and Gentoku Himuro. They are in possession of one of the Pandora Box's panels that was split during the Skywall Disaster, along with Nebula Gas they extracted from the Skywall and liquefied for the development of Fullbottles. According to Gentoku, Faust's objectives are to achieve Takumi's goals of evolving humanity into the \\"ultimate lifeform\\". The organization was compromised by Evolto and Namba who sought to reassemble the Pandora Box and repeat the calamity that destroyed the ancient Martian civilization. Since forming in Touto, Faust members infiltrated the , which had been studying the Pandora Box and protecting it from neighboring countries. Despite their pacifist ideals and public image as peacekeepers, Touto Institute was influenced by Faust to mass-produce weapons and use lethal force when pursuing convicts. During Gentoku's temporary takeover as the prime minister, Faust relocated from Touto and manipulated the two other nations into a war to acquire all of the Pandora Box panels and reassemble it to take over the Earth, when Evolto revealed his true plans. The organization then reorganized under Evolto's control. Faust's leaders use the , which Takumi Katsuragi reverse-engineered from Kaisei Mogami's Kaiser System. It requires organic Fullbottles to transform, with their identities concealed by built-in voice changers in their armor. Their main weapons are the which allows them to perform the and finishers, and the which allows them to execute the , and attacks. Each of the leaders can also combine their weapons into the to perform one of two finishers: or Steam Attack. =Gentoku Himuro= is the 35-year-old special advisor to his father, Prime Minister Taizan Himuro, and head of the Touto Institute. Initially a kind, friendly and laid-back eccentric, radiation from the Skywall Disaster transformed him into a sadistic and paranoid power-hungry maniac, who performed questionable acts for Touto's safety after deeming his father's pacifism a liability. Gentoku orchestrated Takumi's expulsion from Touto Institute to cover for the Devil's Scientist while unknowingly being manipulated by S≈çichi Isurugi (and by extension, Evolto and Namba). After taking his late friend's position as the prime minister's advisor, Gentoku took the mantle of Night Rogue and declared his leadership over Faust. During the events of Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider, Gentoku helps Sento find out about Kaiser's past. Gentoku took advantage of Sento and Ryuga to gather more Fullbottles, perfecting most of Takumi's Rider Systems and reclaiming the Pandora Box. Gentoku was elevated to prime minister after Stalk incapacitated his father and forced the two Kamen Riders to be inducted into Touto's military. After sending Cross-Z Charge to invade Hokuto, he was dismissed by Taizan and sentenced to exile. This forced him to seek refuge at Namba Heavy Industries and served Seito's military as Kamen Rider Rogue. The experiment Gentoku received to raise his Hazard Level rendered him a near-emotionless nihilist with a restraining chip to ensure obedience, while reversing the negative effects from the Skywall radiation. Although working under Namba, Gentoku secretly assisted the Riders. During an operation to rescue Taizan, Sento deactivated the restraining chip, allowing Gentoku to return at the cost of Evolto regaining his power as Kamen Rider Evol. After Taizan sacrifices himself to save Gentoku, Gentoku begins to seek redemption by allying himself with the Riders against Evolto and Namba, and begins to atone his past actions while reverting to his true personality. Gentoku's initial Hazard Level is 3, raised to 4 by Namba Heavy Industries experimentation so that he can use the Sclash Driver. In hopes of matching the growth of Build and Cross-Z, both Kazumi and Gentoku allowed themselves to be captured and heavily dosed with Nebula Gas to further raise their Hazard Levels. As the battle against Evolto reaches the climax, Gentoku is distraught when Utsumi sacrifices himself and Kazumi falls in battle. He ultimately dies protecting the others during a clash with Evolto, successfully landing a critical blow on the alien. When the universes are merged at the conclusion of the series, an alternate Gentoku is working as a personal aide to his father, with a shy but polite attitude towards his world's version of Sawa. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z he recovers the memories of his alternate self and the power to transform into Rogue after Killbus began the process of destruction with the Pandora Box, helping Ryuga in his fight against Killbus. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease he tries to stop Downfall, but because his powers are stolen, he fails and is kidnapped but is later released thanks to Sawa after that Downfall is defeated, he tells Sento and Ryuga that he is dating Sawa. Gentoku's forms are accessed through the Transteam system and/or Sclash Driver: * is Gentoku's first transformation as the leader of Faust, accessed through the use of the Transteam Gun loaded with the Lost Fullbottle counterpart of the Bat Fullbottle. Aside from being a skilled combatant, he can manipulate steams from his body for quick travel and an electrical energy punch. Through his animal motif, he is capable of clinging to ceilings and creating a pair of bat wings, allowing him to swoop about at high speeds while performing powerful dive-bomb attacks. These items were relinquished to Utsumi once Gentoku became Kamen Rider Rogue. * is Gentoku's later alter-ego, accessed through the use of the Sclash Driver in conjunction with the Fullbottle. Having strength that rivals even Build's Hazard forms, he is armed with the Nebula Steam Gun. Using the Sclash Driver, Rogue can perform the finisher. Using the Nebula Steam Gun, he can perform one of two finishers; the in its Gun Mode or the in its Rifle Mode. As with the general function of both Sclash Drivers and Nebula Steam Gun, Gentoku can use the power of a single Fullbottle and auxiliary attacks. * is an upgraded form of Kamen Rider Rogue, accessed by using the Prime Rogue Fullbottle in the Build Driver. This form's finisher is the and the Fullbottle breaks after its usage due to Gentoku's reckless usage, requiring a month be fixed. This form only appears in Kamen Rider Prime Rogue and Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease. Gentoku Himuro is portrayed by . =Faust agents= Masahiro Nabeshima is a prison guard who frames Ryuga Banjo for the death of Touto Institute researcher Takumi Katsuragi, then delivers Ry≈´ga to Faust for experimentation. After luring Sento and Ryuga to Seito, he was converted into Mirage Smash as a \\"reward\\" and later into Square Smash as part of Blood Stalk's experiment. Although rescued by Build and Ryuga, the experiments erased almost all of his memories. Sometime later, he regained his memories and revealed information about Faust to Sento, including Blood Stalk's identity. He and his family later are captured by Namba and used to force Sawa to betray her friends. *: Nabeshima's swordsman/ninja-themed first transformation. He is armed with two sword-like and can create illusions of himself from the two lantern-like on his shoulder pads. His Smash essence was collected and purified to make the Ninjya Fullbottle. *: Nabeshima's cube/comic panel-themed second transformation upon his kidnapping by Blood Stalk. He is armed with a pen-like blade on his right arm called the , which can create portals to attack from behind, slice through large buildings with a single cut and create blocks from various materials. He was used by Blood Stalk to lure Build and was enlarged before being defeated. His Smash essence was collected and purified to make the Comic Fullbottle. Masahiro Nabeshima is portrayed by . Eita Kawai is a researcher in the Touto Institute and one of Katsuragi's sympathizers. He uploaded data of Pandora Box before the Faust army stole it. Blood Stalk transformed him into the to fight Ryuga Banjo, but he was easily defeated. A weakened Kawai was reverted to his human form by Stalk, who erased his memories and altered his face to look like Kuwata. Eita Kawai is portrayed by . Shingo Kuwata is a Touto Institute researcher and a Katsuragi sympathizer. He uses his Fullbottle to become a version of the Flying Smash. After being defeated by Build, he reveals that he was meant to lure Build away from Faust's raid to steal the Pandora Box. Before committing suicide, he reveals that Takumi had been faking his death. Shingo Kuwata is portrayed by . =Guardians= The are enforcement androids mass-produced by Namba Industries as peacekeepers of each country, though it is not initially known that they are supporting governments outside Touto. They also act as Faust sleeper agents awaiting activation by Blood Stalk. They are armed with the and ride motorcycles called . A large number of them can combine together to form a single gigantic robot equipped with multiple guns. Under Faust's servitude, the reprogrammed Guardians can act as suicide bombers. Namba Heavy Industries is a company established by J≈´zabur≈ç Namba which provides financial support to Faust. Because of its pervasive influence, all three countries attempted to distance themselves from Namba, although the company has agents placed within the governments' infrastructures. After Evolto murdered and assumed the identity of Seito Prime Minister Mid≈ç, Namba Heavy Industries uses Seito's resources to launch an invasion of Touto and construct the to create an empire with the Pandora Box. However, Evolto uses them as pawns and destroys the company. =J≈´zabur≈ç Namba= is the corrupt and war-mongering chairman of Namba. He initially collaborates with Faust and Evolto to acquire the Build system for military applications, but has a secret agenda to use the Pandora Box's energy to create weapons of mass destruction. He also brainwashed children to act as his agents, including Sawa Takigawa. A power-hungry man with a god complex, he will do anything to attain his goals. However, he is not completely cruel as he was shown to be close to Nariaki Utsumi in flashbacks. His ultimate goal is to use the power of the Pandora Box to reform Japan, and eventually the entire world, under his rule and in his image. However, Evolto exploited him for its own agenda. Namba then requests aid from the Kamen Riders against Evolto, but they fail and Namba is killed by Evolto while begging for his life. In the merged universe at the end of the series, an alternate Namba owns a metalworking factory known as , rather than a huge weapons manufacturer. J≈´zabur≈ç Namba is portrayed by , while Norimasa Fuke portrays Namba's disguise as Masakuni Mid≈ç. =Namba Children= The are scientists, soldiers and spies who were brainwashed by J≈´zabur≈ç Namba from an early age. They are positioned as sleeper agents within Touto, Hokuto and Seito to inform for Namba while acquiring whatever Namba needs. Nariaki Utsumi is the 28-year-old secretary of Himuro who was formally a Touto Institute scientist. Despite his commitment to Faust, Gentoku and Namba Heavy Industries, Utsumi expresses regret over his life choices, even commenting to Sento about their similar predicaments. To conceal Faust's activities, Utsumi became a scapegoat by masquerading as Night Rogue. His attempted suicide is stopped by Sento, but Utsumi is gravely injured and converted into a cyborg by Evolto. Utsumi then returned to Namba as his spokesperson and developed the Rider Systems for Hokuto and Seito, gathering data on the Hazard Trigger while perfecting the Kaiser System. Although he seemed to become more open-minded, Utsumi was actually a callous sadist and completely loyal to Namba. After Evolto turns on Namba and killed him, Utsumi faked losing his sanity and was recruited as Evolto's enforcer, Kamen Rider Mad Rogue, briefly serving as a host to a fragment of the alien's body. But as Evolto neared his end goal, Utsumi reveals his deception and allies himself with Gentoku to avenge Namba while destroying Evolto's replicas of the Washio Brothers. Though his cybernetics burn out as Evolto defeats him, Utsumi sacrifices himself to shield Gentoku and Sawa from the alien's attack. After the worlds are merged at the end of the series, an alternate Utsumi is shown working in Namba's metalwork factory. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z, when Killbus restored the Pandora Box, Utsumi's lack of Nebula Gas administration prevented him from regaining the memories of his alternate self. But despite that, in Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease he recovers the memories of his alternate self along with his powers of Kamen Rider through the injection of Nebula Gas, assisting the other Riders in their battle against Down Fall. Utsumi twice became Night Rogue as a decoy. His modification on Night Rogue grants him the ability to analyze his opponent through his visor. As the creator of the perfected Kaiser System, Utsumi is able to transform into Hell Bros using the Nebula Steam Gun. As Hell Bros, his main weapon is the Nebula Steam Gun and the Steam Blade. With the Evol-Driver Utsumi can become by using the and Fullbottles the Evol- Driver's scrambles both elements of Fullbottles into a symmetrical form and his is specially tuned for human use. As Utsumi was planning to betray Evolto from the beginning, his Evol-Driver was modified to imitate Evolto's Phase evolution but the full power was too much for his cybernetics to handle. His finisher is the , which can be performed by channeling either his main Fullbottles or a different Fullbottle without changing his form. In a similar vein to Evolto, Mad Rogue is also possesses a Rider Evol-Bottle, allowing him to use Creation and manifest the power of a single Fullbottle. *: By inserting the Kaizoku Fullbottle, Mad Rogue can summon the Kaizoku Hassyar which allows him to perform the finisher. Nariaki Utsumi is portrayed by . As a child, Utsumi is portrayed by . Masuzawa is a spy who works as secretary to the Touto prime minister. When he is exposed by Sento, he kills himself using a Fullbottle to avoid capture. He is responsible for slipping a listening device into the Dragon Fullbottle to spy on Sento. Masuzawa is portrayed by . Washio Brothers The are a pair of siblings from Seito who serve alongside Gentoku as Seito's main troopers. The indoctrination and training they received transform them into sadistic soldiers who use deception and dirty tricks to accomplish their tasks. They transform using the Kaiser System developed by Kaisei Mogami and Nariaki Utsumi, with a shared . Because of their limited supply in weaponry, the Nebula Steam Gun's Rifle Mode (combined with the Steam Blade) can only be held by one of them while the other engages in hand-to-hand combat. After Evolto declared war against Namba Heavy Industries, the Washio Brothers form an uneasy alliance with the Riders before losing their lives. Evolto created his own copy of the Washio Brothers' Kaiser forms as guardians at the Pandora Tower. Utsumi revealed that he had sabotaged the Kaiser Systems and programmed both Same and Bike Fullbottles as countermeasures, used by Rogue and Mad Rogue to destroy the copies. *: The older brother who uses the to transform into , a turquoise-colored version of Kaiser. He is the dominant user of Nebula Steam Gun. He can use his Gear Remocon with Rai's Gear Engine to transform into , an upgraded version of Bi- Kaiser. Despite being the more level-headed of the two, he occasionally shows annoyance and fury. F≈´ sacrificed himself to shield Cross-Z from a deathblow. F≈´ Washio is portrayed by . As a child, F≈´ is portrayed by . *: F≈´'s younger brother who uses the to transform into , a white-colored version of Kaiser Reverse. As Remocon is the primary user of Nebula Steam Gun, Engine uses the Steam Blade as his main weapon. Engine Bros is the most vulnerable of the pair and can be weakened with water-based attacks. Rai is short-tempered, careless and more violent in combat. During an alliance with the Riders against Evolto, Rai was the first to be killed and was caught in their former companion's black hole, giving his Gear Engine to F≈´ before his death. Rai Washio is portrayed by . As a child, Rai is portrayed by . Other versions of Hell Bros also existed in the series' spin-offs: * is an incomplete version of Hell Bros, lacking both Engine and Remocon components, leaving its only weapon the Nebula Steam Gun. He was an unnamed civilian forcefully experimented upon by Namba Heavy Industries. While leading an army of Faust's Guardians to steal Touto's Fullbottles, he was confronted and defeated by Build. * is a copy of the Hell Bros and the prototype for Clone Smash. Utsumi sent it to fight against Kamen Rider Build's SameBike Form to test its capabilities. Sometime after the Clone Smash were mass-produced, Utsumi programmed the SameBike Form's Fullbottles as the main weakness to the new Kaiser Systems. =Hard Guardians= The are enhanced versions of the Guardians which Namba Heavy Industries mass-produced following Seito's war declaration on Touto. When Namba Heavy was disbanded, the remaining units were under control of Evolto and served as the front line of Pandora Tower's defense. The Hard Guardians are equipped with a combat AI unit, right arm-mounted gatling-guns, left-arm- mounted clawed gauntlets, and shoulder-mounted missile pods. An improved drive module was placed on each joint to provide enhanced mobility. Their equipment can be replaced depending on the combat situation and can fight on equal terms against Rider Systems users. Katsuragi family =Takumi Katsuragi= is 26 years old and the past identity of Sento Kiryu, infamously known among his peers as . During the Sky Disaster, unaware of the full truth at the time, Takumi promised his father Shinobu that he would stop the Blood Race from destroying the Earth and restarted where he subjected himself to Nebula Gas to become Kamen Rider Build, only to be banned for conducting unethical human experimentations with the Nebula Gas to evolve humanity. During this period, Takumi assisted his former Touto colleague Kaisei Mogami in building the Enigma system to travel to another reality. While testing the performance of Kamen Rider Build in said world, he twice intervened in the confrontation between humans and Bugster. Having accidentally killed Kamen Rider Genm prior, Build went on to extract Ex-Aid's samples into a single Fullbottle before foiling Mogami's intent to cause a convergence between the two realities and stopped him. Sometime after developing both Rider and Transteam Systems, Takumi learned that Faust had been compromised by Evolto. He halted the development of the Sclash Driver system and attempted to kill Evolto but was outsmarted. His memories and appearance were changed to Sento, and he was manipulated into completing the Rider System. Takumi regained his memories when Evolto regained his perfect form, and becomes Build again but refuses to work with the others. When the Genius Fullbottle refused to cooperate, he was visited by Sento's consciousness and allowed this alter-ego to access Genius Form for the first time. From that point onward, Takumi served as a spiritual adviser to Sento despite his sense of pessimism. Following the worlds' convergence, as revealed in Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease, Takumi exists as a separate being from Sento in their new universe and works despite being plagued by unpleasant memories of the old world. Alongside Sento, he creates a special serum that enables the Rider System users to recover the ability to transform and to be immune to the Phantom Crushers' special ability. After Downfall is defeated, Takumi returns to the . As the true creator of Build's Rider System, Takumi can use the basic Best Match forms. As he was absent while Sento further developed Build, Takumi had to retool it to keep up with its performance. Takumi Katsuragi is portrayed by , whereas his cameo appearances as Build in Kamen Rider Ex-Aid were voiced by Atsuhiro Inukai, Sento's actor. =Shinobu Katsuragi= is the father of Takumi Katsuragi and a member of the Kiwami Project which saw S≈çichi Isurugi come into contact with the Pandora Box. Shinobu conducted illegal research on an infant Ryuga. Later, Shinobu led the conference of the Pandora Box's discovery when Evolto caused the Skywall Disaster, and his reputation was ruined as he was used as a scapegoat. Shinobu faked his suicide soon after cryptically informing Takumi that Ryuga is essential to stop Evolto and his kin, enlisting Reika Kine's aid in smuggling himself out of Touto. Shinobu secretly aided Evolto for ten years by using his research in an attempt to repair the Evol-Driver before Takumi found and hid it. Shinobu also developed a man-made variant of Fullbottles called , also referred to as for short, which allow the user to transform into a Lost Smash with side-effects of heightened aggression and suggestibility. Shinobu resurfaces while Sento and his allies are searching for the Lost Fullbottles, revealing his alliance with Evolto while alienating Sento. However, Shinobu's plan was to eliminate the alien, pretending to be Evolto's ally while creating a specialized Best Match combination that could defeat the alien. He reveals his intentions to Sento when he thought Evolto had been defeated, but Evolto recovered and fatally wounds Shinobu. Shinobu lives long enough to give Sento his data to finalize the Cross-Z Build Form and apologize for hurting him. He comes back to life and like his son, he works as a scientist in the Japan Institute of Advanced Matter Physics in the new world. In Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease he created a copy of the Build Driver, which was owned by the Japanese government before being stolen by Downfall. After Downfall is defeated, he apologizes to Takumi for using him in the old world. As the founder of Rider System, Shinobu possesses his own copy of the Build Driver and a set of Fullbottles to transform into another Kamen Rider Build. While having access to Best Match forms, Shinobu is capable of outmaneuvering the strongest of his opponents in one-on-one fights though he has difficulty fighting multiple opponents. He can also use another Fullbottle's power without transitioning, such as the use of Phoenix Fullbottle as an escape while still in Rabbit Tank form. Shinobu Katsuragi is portrayed by . =Ky≈çka Katsuragi= is Takumi's mother and Shinobu's wife who was abducted from Hokuto and transformed by Faust into the first . She was purified by Build, with the extracted element purified to create the Lock Fullbottle, before she entrusted the flash drive that contains the information of the Project Build to Sento. Ky≈çka Katsuragi is portrayed by . Prime ministers As a result of the in 2007, Japan has been divided into three different districts: Touto, Hokuto and Seito. It was suspected that everyone present at the event become much more aggressive after being exposed to the Skywall's Nebula Gas. As a result of the separation, several foreign powers have attempted to take advantage of the situation although none of the districts display interest in allying with external forces. After Sento merges the world into a new reality at the conclusion of the series, an alternate Taizan has been elected prime minister of an undivided Japan with the other two as his ministers of welfare and finance respectively. =Taizan Himuro= is the 67-year-old father of Gentoku and the prime minister of , a pacifist state with only enough military strength for self-defense. Despite the rivalries, Taizan wishes for Japan to reunite. Due to his poor health, he sent his son Gentoku to the unveiling of the Pandora Box, and retained his sanity as the only leader not affected by its radiation. Taizan suffered a heart attack during Faust's raid on Touto facility, and entrusted Gentoku as acting prime minister, unaware that Gentoku is high-ranking Faust-member Night Rogue. The Touto government was then compromised until Sento and Ryuga defeated Night Rogue, exposing his identity to Taizan who then orders his son to be taken into custody. S≈çichi later poisoned Taizan which once again gives Gentoku emergency power to rule Touto. Taizan eventually recovered through Misora's power and exiled Gentoku while looking for a way to end the war with the least bloodshed. Taizan believes there is still good in Gentoku and vows to return his son. As Namba and Stalk enact their plan to bring humanity into chaos, Taizan is kidnapped by Gentoku so Stalk can force Sento into reviving the original Project Build. Gentoku was already planning to save his father, working with the Kamen Riders against Evolto, but the plan backfires and Evolto transforms into Kamen Rider Evol. Taizan becomes the first victim of Evolto, sacrificing his life to save Gentoku from the alien. This act allows Gentoku to fully revert to his true self. Taizan Himuro is portrayed by . =Yoshiko Tajimi= is the 53-year-old prime minister of , a social welfare state which puts the needs of its people above all else. The Skywall Disaster rendered most of the farmland infertile with the resulting economic collapse forcing many citizens to take their children out of school. Tajimi's personality was affected by radiation from the Pandora Box, and she secretly directed government funds from social welfare to the military. The machinations of S≈çichi, Namba and Gentoku cause war between the other two countries to take the Pandora Box by force, and she declares war on Touto. Her ruthless behavior during the invasion disgusts Kazumi as he threatens her to stop targeting innocent civilians. During Touto's fight against Hokuto, Tajimi acts on S≈çichi's advice to station her entire military on Touto's border to invade if Grease was defeated. But Tajimi realized she had been manipulated into leaving her nation vulnerable to Seito, which invade and take her into custody. She is later brainwashed by Evolto, transforming her into the before being defeated and freed by Kamen Rider Build's Genius Form. This purified Tajimi's mind leaving her horrified and remorseful over everything she had done while being the only surviving prime minister. Yoshiko Tajimi is portrayed by . =Masakuni Mid≈ç= is the 61-year-old prime minister of , which seeks economic recovery through technical advancement, sending its young adults across the world to gather technical knowledge. Mid≈ç expressed an interest in Tajimi's offer for alliance, but stood by while Hokuto and Touto weakened each other in warfare. When Hokuto lost to Touto, Mid≈ç sends Seito's military to invade Hokuto, taking over the country and capturing Tajimi. However, Mid≈ç is also a nervous man as shown by his reaction during the Touto- Seito proximity match. After losing the fight against Touto, Mid≈ç keeps his agreement with Touto while falling out with Namba, resulting in his death by Evolto. The alien then had Namba assume Mid≈ç's identity to use the country for Namba Heavy Industries' operations and his future plots. Evolto later poses as Mid≈ç during his endgame plan and places his kinsmen into governor positions. Masakuni Mid≈ç is portrayed by . Vernage is the former queen of Mars who survived the destruction of her civilization at the cost of her physical form. She managed to seal Evolto along with his Evol-Trigger into the Pandora Box, while separating his Evol-Driver to prevent him from using it inside the box to free himself. When the artefacts were returned to Earth, her spirit was preserved in a bracelet which latched onto a young Misora. Ten years later, Vernage's consciousness slowly awakened and occasionally rescued the Kamen Riders from Namba's forces. As her spirit resided within Misora's bracelet, she provided the young girl with the ability to purify Nebula Gas. The process caused Vernage's memories of her civilization's destruction to play within Misora's mind. Although presented as a powerful entity, she pointed out that her life force is diminishing. Vernage left Misora's body to restore girl's humanity while she was transformed into CD Lost Smash, and transferred herself into Ryuga to counteract the psychological effects from the trace remnants of Evolto's genes. Vernage passed away after Evolto's death, having fulfilled her goals. Vernage is voiced by . Blood Tribe are a mysterious race of extraterrestrial origin who originated from before it was destroyed by their ruler Killbus. Led by Killbus's younger brother Evolto, the four surviving Blood members caused the downfall of the Martian civilization and many other planets before possessing the four astronauts sent to explore Mars. While Evolto is the antagonist of the series after possessing S≈çichi Isurugi, the other three Blood Tribesmen who possessed S≈çichi's fellow astronauts supported Evolto from behind the scenes before making their presence known in the events of Kamen Rider Build the Movie: Be the One. Evolto used his guise as Mid≈ç to arrange for his tribesmen to become governors in Japan's three regions, only for them to mutiny and attempt to destroy Earth on their own through the : Acquiring Sento's Hazard Trigger and use it with the Pandora Box to destroy Earth's core. But after his kin were destroyed and his defeat by the Kamen Riders, Evolto is the only remaining survivor in the new world. =Evolto= is the true antagonist of the series and leader of both the Blood Tribe and Faust. A genocidal sociopath, prior to the series, Evolto has taken the Pandora Box away and escaped from his brother, Killbus who was using Pandora Box to destroy his home planet. After the destruction of his planet, he used the power of the Pandora Box to destroy planets to absorb their energies as a means of gaining power and travelling. Until he destroyed the Martian civilization, he was rendered incorporeal and lost his true physical form before Vernage sealed him alongside his damaged Evol-Trigger within the Pandora Box. When a Mars rover arrived for observation, Evolto used it to send a piece of himself to Earth to acquire a host to restore himself. But it backfired when the fragment's attempt of possessing Namba Industries security guard Yuri Banjo resulted in it being assimilated into her unborn child Ryuga. 13 years later, Evolto possessed the astronaut S≈çichi Isurugi when he retrieved the Pandora Box from Mars and attempted to destroy Earth, only for Vernage's intervention to result in the Skywall Incident to scatter the Pandora Box across Japan. This forces Evolto to execute a decade-long plan of manipulating various individuals and events, such as the foundation of Faust, positioning himself within Namba Heavy Industries and grooming Ryuga as his next vessel. Evolto also used S≈çichi's connections to force Shinobu and his son into working for him, tricking a young Misora to purify Fullbottles, and framed Ry≈´ga for Tar≈ç's death while an unconscious Katsuragi was spirited away with his memory and face altered. With Katsuragi's new identity as \\"Sento Kiryu\\", Evolto further manipulated him into perfecting the Build System and created other Rider Systems that Katsuragi purposely scrapped. In the hopes of hiding his presence, he made his original voice the default setting of Blood Stalk's system during transformation. After all Fullbottles were purified, Evolto exposed his treachery to the crews of Nascita and his plans to use the Pandora Box to destroy Earth's civilizations, exploiting Namba as they engineered a series of schemes to take over Japan with only Touto and its Kamen Riders as their opposition. After regaining the Evol-Driver, Evolto abandoned his host to become as he transferred himself to Ry≈´ga's body to regain his full power and then into Sento to use his intelligence to repair the Evol-Trigger. Once the Evol-Trigger was repaired, Evolto left Sento's body and became a corporeal shapeshifter, assuming S≈çichi's appearance. Evolto then proceeded to kill Namba who refused to accept being a puppet ruler while winning the maddened Utsumi to his cause. Evolto decided to take over Earth instead of destroying it after finding amusement in Namba's final moments and Utsumi's descent into insanity. Initially limited to feeling either delight or irritation, Evolto developed human emotions as a result of his Hazard Level increasing. Evolto also assumed Mid≈ç's identity to place the Blood Tribe as governors to execute Build Annihilation Plan, but a mutiny by In≈ç forced him into an alliance with his own adversaries. When later defeated by the four Kamen Riders using a coordinated attack, Evolto imparts a fragment of himself within Utsumi to reconstitute himself. He then kills Shinobu while reclaiming his Evol-Driver and regaining his full strength, before splitting off a part of himself to possess Kazumi to steal back the CD Lost Fullbottle for the . He then absorbs the panel to assume his true monstrous form, but was forced back to his Rider Form by the four Kamen Riders and loses a Lost Fullbottle as well, though he escapes. Combined with his inability to emotionally compose himself, Evolto became very disappointed by the defeat and falls back to his original plan of destroying all life on Earth. As the final battle between Evolto and the Riders began, he succeeds in causing Kazumi's death and kills Utsumi after the latter reveals his true allegiance. Evolto becomes omnipotent but Gentoku wounds him enough for Ry≈´ga to sacrifice himself to trap Evolto in the vortex of a wormhole created by the complete Pandora Box. Evolto attempts to cheat death by absorbing Ryuga but Sento saves his friend, with Evolto seemingly erased as a side-effect of Pandora Box merging their universe with the prime Kamen Rider universe. However, Evolto reconstitutes himself through a fragment of himself that slipped into Ryuga. When Killbus reappears again in the new world and threatens to destroy the entire universe, Evolto gracefully joins forces with Ry≈´ga to defeat Killbus before leaving Earth to regain his full strength and body. A cruel, fierce, and ruthless character, Evolto committed several heinous acts using S≈çichi's body as a vessel, killing without hesitation and on one occasion turned a child into a Smash, with his plots and actions resulting in several deaths. Evolto is a very patient manipulator, having spent years establishing his plans while winning allies or placing enemies in situations that play to his advantage, but can be taken off guard by unexpected occurrences where he was forced to improvise. Due to the successful nature of his plots in the first half of the series, Evolto becomes arrogant and overconfident, but his reliance on luck backfired several times. It also extends to his tendency of toying with his opponents as he fails to expect a stronger counterattack, which proves costly when the Riders were able to force him out of his true form just moments after he had regained it. Another flaw Evolto suffered was his inability to handle human emotions as the result of having used multiple host bodies and his exposure to Build, making him prone to blind rage and later expressing fear when sucked into the wormhole and facing his impending doom. In the new world, while still resentful toward the Kamen Riders and humanity, Evolto admits to having developed a new-found respect for them as he mocked Killbus for underestimating humans right before the latter is finished off by Cross-Z Evol. As Kamen Rider Evol, Evolto uses the and , from which the Build System was reversed engineered. As a Rider, Evol has high-speed movements on par with any previous Kamen Riders, matched only by Build Genius Form. Evol's finisher is the . Each of his forms are treated as evolution of his : * is the primary form of Evol, , and accessed with the use of Cobra Evol-Bottle. Evol is capable of secreting enhanced poisons and is able to outmaneuver his opponents with blinding speed. *, a.k.a. , was accessed when Evol possessed Ryuga and created the corresponding Dragon Evol-Bottle from his body. Aside from adding Cross-Z's Beat Closer to his arsenal, Evol can also use pyrokinesis. This form was lost after Ryuga stole the Dragon Evol-Bottle and used it to transform into Great Cross-Z. *, a.k.a. , was accessed when Evol possessed Sento and created the corresponding Rabbit Evol-Bottle from his body. The result of both Sento's gambit in raising his Hazard Level to 6 and self-destruction with a Pandora Panel concluded in his possession and the change of his hair color to white. In addition to Build's Drill Crusher, Evol gains a sharp increase in acceleration and agility. * is Kamen Rider Evol's true form, a.k.a. , accessed through the use of Cobra Evol-Bottle and the . This form was previously sealed by Vernage during their battle on Mars, until the energies from the combined attack of Cross-Z Magma, Grease and Rogue were exploited to restore the Evol- Trigger which then restored his corporeal form. Incredibly powerful, Evol can manipulate black holes and destroy celestial bodies. Before his arrival on Earth, Evol had once brandished an energy blade in a fight against Vernage. As the Evol-Bottle invokes every transformation, it can also use when in conjunction with a normal Fullbottle. *: By inserting the Gatling Fullbottle, Evol can summon the Hawk Gatlinger, allowing him to perform the finisher. By activating the Evol-Trigger's mode while obtaining all ten Lost Fullbottles stacked in the black Lost Panel merged with himself, Evolto gains the ability to assume his true . His signature ability is the , which allows him to assimilate celestial bodies as he consumed the moon and part of Earth to assume his with access to the shoulder units and gauntlets. But while it is Evolto's strongest form, the Evol-Trigger also becomes his weak point as Gentoku dies removing it to give Build and Cross-Z their chance to destroy the alien. Evolto is voiced by . While possessing S≈çichi Isurugi and later assuming his likeness, he is played by Yasuyuki Maekawa. =Kengo In≈ç= is Evolto's second-in-command who served as advisor to Seito Prime Minister Mid≈ç and influenced Sento meeting Ryuga, later becoming governor of Touto by the events of Kamen Rider Build the Movie: Be the One, after the Japanese civil war had ended. He then leads a mutiny against Evolto to carry out the Blood Tribe's initial plan to destroy Earth, In≈ç using the Tokyo populace's anti- Kamen Rider sentiment to hypnotize them into hunting down Sento with an infected Ryuga made into his personal agent. Once acquiring the Hazard Trigger to enable his transformation into Kamen Rider Blood, In≈ç later acquires the Pandora Box to proceed to travel down to Earth's core and destroy the planet from the inside-out. But he is destroyed by Kamen Rider Cross-Z Build. Possessing the Cobra Lost Fullbottle, In≈ç uses it with Ryuga's Build Driver and Great Cross-Z Dragon, combined with Sento's Hazard Trigger to transform into . The form initially requires him to absorb nearby Blood Tribesmen, including Ryuga for possessing Evolto's essence, before Build extracted the absorbed targets from his body. Blood rivals the strength of Build's Genius Form and can summon energy cobras as reinforcements. Kengo In≈ç is portrayed by . =Mitsuomi G≈çbara= is a member of Blood Tribe and a former advisor to Hokuto Prime Minister Tajimi, having orchestrated Kasumi Ogura's conversion into a Smash, before becoming the new governor of Seito. He can transform into using the Lost Fullbottle. He was defeated by Kamen Rider Grease after initially defeating him in their first encounter. Mitsuomi G≈çbara is portrayed by . =Ry≈çka Saiga= is a female member of Blood Tribe and a former aide to Touto Prime Minister Himuro before becoming the new governor of Hokuto. She can transform into using the Lost Fullbottle. She is defeated by Kamen Rider Rogue after initially defeating him in their second encounter. Ry≈çka Saiga is portrayed by . =Killbus= is the older brother of Evolto and the Build New World: Kamen Rider Cross-Z, a suicidal hedonist who ruled Planet Blood before destroying it as part of his plan to use the Pandora Box to destroy the entire universe along with himself. Using the form of a famous dancer named Satoshi Kakizaki after appearing from the , Killbus hunts Evolto within Ry≈´ga to restore the Pandora Box and seeks to absorb Ryuga and Evolto into the white panel to obtain enough energy to destroy the universe. He is later defeated by Ry≈´ga in the Cross-Z Evol form. By inserting the (Sento's robotic spider-like pet converted into a transformation item by Killbus) loaded with the Fullbottle into Sento's Build Driver, Killbus transforms into . Killbus transformed into Build before adopting his personal Rider namesake. By himself, Killbus can use Drill Crusher and Kaizoku Hassyar as his weapons and summon Hazard Smash clones. Killbus is voiced by . While assuming the forms of Sento Kiryu and Satoshi Kakizaki, he is portrayed by Atsuhiro Inukai and Gaku Shindo, respectively. Smash The are monsters formed by humans injected with the liquefied as part of Faust's experiments. The experimental subject loses almost all of their memories. To revert a Smash back to a normal human, the Kamen Riders must defeat them and extract their element liquids into an Empty Bottle (which can later be purified into a Fullbottle for their transformation and equipment uses). Faust agents are given their own Fullbottles to transform into their Smash forms, which are equipped with a self-destruct function. Silver-colored Smash are stronger versions, achieved through exposure to Nebula Gas of higher Hazard Levels. The experiment's goal was to find a perfect candidate for the Build Driver, with the Smash transformations considered failures. Each victim is ranked by their tolerance of Nebula Gas called . *Hazard Level 1: Patients with frail body types, unable to survive any attempt to revert them to their human form. *Hazard Level 2: Patients with the ability to survive the gas and transform into Smash. Those who rank above 2 can retain their human forms and were given the chance to raise their Hazard Levels through fighting experience. *Hazard Level 3: Patients who completed their tolerance towards the gas. They are also considered suitable candidates for the Build Driver. *Hazard Level 4: Compatible users of the Sclash Drivers. Patients in Level 3 can also reach this level by using the Build Driver with the Hazard Trigger. *Hazard Level 5: Only Evolto's race can access this level, which is required to access the Evol-Driver. *Hazard Level 6: Achieved by Build when he taps into the power of a Pandora Box's panel. *Hazard Level 7: Humans in this level can strengthen certain Fullbottles with their own power.

Though traits of Kasumi's original personality resurface as she reveals what she knew of Faust, her illness made it impossible for her to regain her humanity with Build is forced to destroy her as a mercy kill. The Burn Smash's element is later purified into Dragon Fullbottle which Sento gives to Ryuga, with Sento giving Ryuga her will to provide him with the resolve to fight as Kamen Rider Cross-Z. Gentoku and G≈çbara would later reveal to Ryuga that Kasumi's sacrifice was arranged by the Blood Tribe as a means of incentive to stimulate Ryuga's alien DNA. Following their universe's absorption into the prime universe, an alternate Kasumi is the girlfriend of the alternate version of Ryuga.

The Clone Smash are later used as materials to power a Lost Fullbottle to enable its user's transformation into a Lost Smash. =Lost Smash= are Smash breeds created by Evolto and Katsuragi as the final Smash evolution. The experiment includes a human victim being heavily dosed with Nebula Gas and transformed into the Lost Smash by absorbing a pair of nearby Clone Smash. Aside from heightened aggression and being easy to manipulate, they are also bound to die should they be defeated. The Genius Fullbottle of Kamen Rider Build has the ability to save these victims and remove traces of Nebula Gas. The Lost Fullbottles created by Shinobu Katsuragi were used to invoke the target's transformation into Lost Smash. Their actual purpose is to complete the Lost Panel of Pandora Box to take control of humanity. The full set of Lost Fullbottles work differently depending on the Pandora Panels they slotted into: the Last Pandora Panel Black allows Evolto to regain his monstrous form by absorbing it, whereas its White counterpart can merge with five other Pandora Panels to fuse Earth with its alternate counterpart and avert the Skywall Disaster. Kaisei Mogami is the main antagonist of Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider. A cyborg, Mogami was a researcher in the Touto Institute of Advanced Matter Physics and an associate of Takumi Katsuragi. Ten years earlier, while researching parallel universes, he found the Bugster Virus at the Skywall and concluded that the virus is from a parallel universe. He wanted to create the interdimensional gateway , but couldn't get funding so he moved to Namba Heavy Industries to continue his research. With Takumi's help, he developed both the Kaiser system and the Enigma which allowed him to make contact with the prime universe version of himself who is a Foundation X scientist. However, he lost the left side of his body due to an Enigma accident, caused by Takumi who opposed his ultimate goal. He resurfaces to cause the fusion and destruction of the two universes with the Enigma, to fuse with his counterpart and form a single immortal entity to become the ruler of all the universes. The two Mogamis form an alliance as they employ Foundation X's version of the Guardians known as the while creating the Nebula Bugster strain. Both Mogamis eventually fuse, but their plans are foiled before being defeated by Ex-Aid and Build, the latter fulfilling their scheme to merge their dimensions months later while defeating Evolto. Mogami is able to transform into the blue-colored , while his counterpart transforms into the red-colored . They can also combine to form a single entity known as . Utsumi managed to acquire the Kaiser System blueprints after Mogami's death and perfected the technology, which he gave to Seito as the developed Hell Bros gear used by the Washio brothers. Kaisei Mogami is portrayed by . Satoshi Kakizaki is a famous dancer whose form was copied by Killbus. While Killbus in public, Killbus was heavily mistaken for the dancer himself, leading the media to think that \\"Satoshi Kakizaki\\" had gone crazy. After Killbus' death, the current status of Kakizaki's public image was restored to normal. Satoshi Kakizaki is portrayed by . Yui Mabuchi is a young elementary school teacher who is looking for Kamen Rider Cross-Z, because she has faint memories of what happened before Sento merged the two worlds, when she was captured by Faust and died as a result of their Lost Fullbottle experimentation. After Killbus began the process of destruction with the Pandora Box, she recovers all the memories of her alternate self and blames Ry≈´ga and the other Kamen Riders for not saving her together with her students, who are still in comas due to the events of the old world where they were attacked by Faust's Guardians. After Killbus is defeated and her students recover with the power of the Genius Fullbottle, she forgives Ry≈´ga and to others, helping him in the sale of Sento's experiments and starting a new relationship with him in the process. Yui Mabuchi is portrayed by . Downfall is an international radical terrorist organization that appear as the antagonists of Build New World: Kamen Rider Grease.

Using man-made , they can transform into olive green-colored battle forms known as ; are armed with missile launchers, aerial capabilities, and the ability to disable Rider Systems with their right hand, which can absorb the Rider System users' Nebula Gas to lead them to lose the ability to transform. Downfall is notable for being the first villain organization in the Kamen Rider series where the majority of its members are portrayed by foreigners. =Keiji Uraga= is the leader of Downfall known for his face who is a mad scientist captivated by technological advancement driven by war. Like Yui Mabuchi, he has burn marks and his memories of the old world because he was a Lost Fullbottle test subject. He was originally one of Faust's scientists who studied the Last Pandora Panel White alongside Shinobu Katsuragi and Evolto, but died as a result of their Lost Fullbottle experimentation. He determined to obtain the Last Pandora Panel White and dominate the new world as revenge for the old world that did not acknowledge his brilliance as a scientist, and he found , which is more powerful than Nebula Gas, before creating the Phantom Crushers using the liquid. He takes Shinobu's Build Driver and Sento's Hazard Trigger to become his own Build, which he calls , to confront the Sawatari farmers. He is later defeated by Kazumi in the Grease Perfect Kingdom form. As Metal Build, he resembles the original Build Hazard Form using a pair of Fullbottles; hence his black colored eyes. Aside from retaining Build Hazard's abilities, his use of a similar Fullbottle pair negates the Hazard Trigger's side-effects. After he is weakened by Grease Blizzard, Metal Build absorbed the Last Pandora Panel White and merged with a Phantom Crusher to become ; equipping him with the Phantom Crusher's armor, which allows him to use super speed, aerial combat, missile bombardments, and even a copy of the original Build's Drill Crusher. Keiji Uraga is portrayed by . =Simon Marcus= is a high-ranking official of the Alliance of Nations who seeks to dominate the world in collaboration with Downfall.

Personal life Ntsikana was born around 1780 to Gaba, a councillor to the western amaRharhabe king, Ngqika and his junior wife Nonabe in the Thyume valley, north of Alice. Ntsikana who belonged to his father's clan, the Cirha clan, was brought up around his mother's kinsmen until he was about five or six. His father sent for him having secured his rights by paying a beast for the child's maintenance since infancy. His father's great wife, Noyiki, who had a daughter but no sons, adopted Ntsikana who therefore became Gaba‚Äôs heir. From this time, Ntsikana made the Great Place in the Thyume valley, north of Alice his home. Ntsikana's first contact with Christianity coincided with his customary Xhosa initiation in 1800. In 1799, Johannes van der Kemp, a missionary of the London Missionary Society, arrived among the western amaXhosa and was permitted to set up his camp near to Ngqika‚Äôs Great Place. Van der Kemp soon became an attraction both for the king and his people, and in the year that he remained among them they had many opportunities to hear him preach and discuss with him his new teaching. When he left in 1800 van der Kemp could not claim any converts but he may have had an influence on Ntsikana. Ntsikana married two young women, Nontsonta and Nomanto, and settled between the Kat River district and the Peddie district in 1811. Later, he and his family moved to Gqore in the Kate River district. After converting to Christianity, Ntsikana divorced his wife Nomanto. Ntsikana died in Thwatwa in 1821.  Christian work From his first contact with Christianity through van der Kemp to 1815 Ntsikana led a normal life. His first spiritual experience was when he was at the kraal looking at his prized ox, Hulushe. As he watched, he saw a patch of light, brighter than ordinary sunlight, illuminating the hide of the animal. Ntsikana asked his companion, a young herdsman for corroboration but the young man denied seeing anything. Later that day, Ntsikana participated in Umdudo (traditional wedding dance). During his performance, a gale-force wind started and when he stopped, it ceased. When he stood up again to dance, the gale-force winds returned with lightning and thunder. Ntsikana did not fully commit to the Christian religion until he met James Read and Joseph Williams who were travelling with Dyani Tshatshu, son of Xhosa chief from the Buffalo River, near Fort Beaufort on April 1816. Read and Williams offered further scriptural teaching to Ntsikana, before inviting him to travel with them back to Bethelsdorp when they returned. But such a journey was impossible, neither his chiefs nor the British authorities would allow him to travel into the colony, so the missionaries advised him to remain where he was until Williams could return to establish the new mission station and offer him further instruction. When Williams returned he found Ntsikana had patiently waited for him and had moved his family from Thyume to establish his home in the Mankazana hills, close to where the new mission station was built. Each Saturday, with his complete household, he visited Williams to receive instruction and stayed until Sunday to join in worship. Now a fully converted Christian, Ntsikana divorced one of his wives Nomanto and denounced polygamy. In 1818, Williams died, and Ntsikane became the leader, establishing Christian communities in the Mankazana Valley and at Burnshill, Somerset East, Debe Nek, King William‚Äôs Town and Mgwali. Ntsikana‚Äôs Christian influence touched the lives of leaders such as King Ngqika, and his counsellor, Old Soga, the father of Tiyo Soga, and Tiyo‚Äôs older brother, Festiri. Conflict between traditional religion & Christianity Ntsikana experienced an internal conflict between indigenous belief system (Inkolo yakwaNtu) and the foreign belief system (Inkolo yaseMzini)- Christianity. As a child he did not agree to be baptised by missionaries but became a Christian leader in life. He also acknowledged that Christianity demanded exclusivity meaning that he had to do away with Xhosa traditional belief systems. Ntsikana also had a rivalry with Makhanda who is also known as Nxele, a prophet under chief Ndlambe who was based in the area now known as Grahamstown. Nxele rejected Christianity and western innovations, resisting the arrival of Europeans on the frontier during the Frontier Wars. Nxele called for the worshiping of Xhosa God, Mdalidiphu, while Ntsikana worshipped Thixo, the god of Christians. Referring to Nxele, Ntsikana once said \\"uNxele ubuquqekile, ubalahlekisilani abantu?\\" (Nxele has turned upside down, why does he mislead people?) Music Ntsikana also composed Christian hymns in isiXhosa which included ‚ÄúIntsimbi‚Äù (Ntsikana‚Äôs Bell),‚ÄúDalibom (Life-Creator), ‚ÄúIngoma engqukuva‚Äù (Round Hymn) and ‚ÄúUlo Thixomkulu‚Äù (‚ÄúThou Great God‚Äù - the Great Hymn).  Legacy Ntsikana is regarded as one of the first Christians who tried to adapt Christianity to African culture.

He published several works on Austria-Hungary, which had a complex mix of ethnic groups and languages in the period before World War I (1914‚Äì18). Life Bertrand Auerbach was born on 2 September 1856 in Paris, son of Sigismond Auerbach and Julie Borach. He attended the √âcole normale sup√©rieure at rue d'Ulm, Paris. His schoolmates included the future geographers Marcel Dubois and Paul Dupuy, and the future historians Georges Lacour-Gayet, Salomon Reinach and Gustave Lanson. As a student he was known for his gift in languages, with excellent German, good English and Greek, and a knowledge of Hebrew. He was interested in history at first, and his study of geography under Ernest Desjardins only concerned historical geography. He was taught by Paul Vidal de La Blache (1845‚Äì1918) who prepared the 3rd year students for their agr√©gation in history and geography. He does not seem to have been exposed to the teachings of Vidal de la Blache before then. He received his agr√©gation in history and geography in 1880. Auerbach taught in secondary schools in Bourges, Laval, Belfort, Toulouse and then Lyon. In 1881 he applied for a travel grant and in 1882 asked to be allowed to study for a doctorate. In 1883 he was appointed lecturer in Ancient History at Caen, and in 1885 was funded to travel in Germany, where he studied the archives of Dresden. Auerbach taught at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Nancy from 1885 to 1926. In 1885 he was granted his master's degree in history and geography. At Nancy he became increasingly interested in geography, and his last historical work appeared in 1889. In his 1887 thesis, La diplomatie fran√ßaise et la Cour de Saxe, 1648-1680, Auerbach described the conflicts between Prince Johann Georg's position as a key support of the \\"true religion\\" (Lutheranism) and his employment of Italians and Frenchmen, and construction of a theater and a \\"miniature Sistine chapel.\\" Auerbach married Ad√®le Alice Hirsch (1866‚Äì1946) on 21 March 1888 in Paris. From January 1893 Auerbach was one of the first professors of geography in France. The Annales de G√©ographie was founded by Vidal de La Blache in 1891. For three decades Auerbach was part of the group associated with the Annales de G√©ographie. He published an article in the second volume, and submitted an article each year until 1907 under the headings of Alsace-Lorraine and Germany. He wrote about 600 reports, including about 50 on Alsace-Lorraine, with his last contribution in 1922. In 1898 Auerbach published a lengthy study of the races and nationalities of Austria-Hungary. His book tried to define the \\"national spirit\\" of the peoples of Austria Hungary. He noted that Italian-speakers dominated the province of Trieste while the Slovenes were peasants who lived in the mountainous areas, but that did not show that the province should naturally belong to Italy. He stated that Austrian ethnographers had shown \\"everyday language did not match the mother language, and race did not match nationality.\\" He concluded that conventional definitions of race and nationality were imprecise, did not help disentangle the complex identities in the region, and were not useful in confirming the political claims of groups of nationalists. In the fall of 1910 Auerbachs's carefully prepared instructions to France's envoys to the imperial German diet at Ratisbon were the subject of heated discussions.

The bridge lies in the city's Karde≈üler ward, on the road from Sivas to Malatya and onward to Syria and Mesopotamia. Historian Thomas Alexander Sinclair says the bridge was originally built in medieval times, probably by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and extensively rebuilt in the late-Ottoman period. The Bent Bridge consists of 18 stone arches and is long and wide. Traveling from Sivas, the bridge rises from the northern bank of the river and runs almost easterly for across the first six arches. At that point the deck turns 45 degrees to descend southeast for across the remaining 12 arches, the gradient over the final three arches being much steeper. Sinclair relates that one reason to build a bridge with a convex angle towards the river flow may have been to resist the pressure of ice in winter. All the arches are pointed and most are the same width, except for three especially wide ones. The upstream piers all have stone cutwaters. The parapet has a thick moulding on the outside and is built with holes to allow water to flow off the roadway. Sinclair detects spolia (reused stonework) from the Classical and Anatolian Seljuk periods in the construction of the current bridge. He interprets this as likely to indicate that the original bridge was built by the Seljuks and included some material from an earlier building of the Classical era. The current bridge was then rebuilt using material from the Seljuk bridge. Assuming the bridge was constructed by the Seljuks, that would date it to a 69-year period between the conquest of Sivas by the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II in 1174, and the city's capture by the Ilkhanid Mongol commander Baiju, following the Battle of K√∂se Daƒü on 26 June 1243. The bridge is known to have been repaired in 1585 during the reign of Sultan Murad III. A construction inventory held in the Sivas Congress and Ethnography Museum also notes that the bridge was repaired in , and other records point to 19th-century repairs under the patronage of Sivas Governor Halil Rifat Pasha and at the direction of the agha of Kangal, Abdurrahman Pasha. Halil Rifat Pasha was vali of Sivas from 1882 to 1885. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism added the bridge to its national inventory of cultural heritage on 21 January 1983. It was restored by the 16th Region of the Highways Directorate in 2006, as a result of which the stone appears unusually pale and new. Since the construction of a modern road bridge about upstream, the Bent Bridge is open only to pedestrian traffic.

Its mission is to help people leave hate groups, particularly white supremacy groups.\\"About,\\" Life After Hate. Retrieved August 15, 2017 In January 2017, the Obama administration awarded the group $400,000 as part of a grant from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Countering Violent Extremism Task Force.Schulberg, Jessica (August 15, 2017), \\"Controversial Trump Aide Katharine Gorka Helped End Funding For Group That Fights White Supremacy,\\" Huffington Post. Retrieved August 15, 2017 However, DHS advisor Katharine Gorka and other aides of President Donald Trump decided to discontinue the grant in June 2017. A crowdfunding campaign established after the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally has raised $429,500 to go towards the organization. History Life After Hate was founded in 2010 by Christian Picciolini, Angela King, Arno Michaelis, Antony (Tony) McAleer, Frankie Meeink, and Sammy Rangel after a blog entitled, \\"Life After Hate\\" by Michaelis. From the age of 17, Arno Michaelis was deeply involved in the white power movement. He was a founding member of what became the largest racist skinhead organization in the world, a reverend of self-declared Racial Holy War, and lead singer of the race-metal band Centurion, selling over 20,000 CDs to racists round the world. In 2007 Arno began writing a reflective memoir and co-founded the online magazine Life After Hate. Angela King is a co-founder and the Programs Director of Life After Hate. King is an ex-white supremacist who struggled to forgive herself after living years as a neo-nazi. King was raised in Southern Florida by parents she describes as racist and homophobic. King joined hate groups in her early teens after being bullied throughout school and dealing with tensions at home. She found people welcomed her aggressive and violent tendencies. After eight years of being involved with extremist groups, she was imprisoned. In 1988, she was involved of a robbery of an adult video store. After fleeing to Chicago, IL, she was arrested in and brought back to Florida to the Federal Detention Center in Miami and sentenced in 1999 to five years. King was transferred from the detention center, to a county jail, on the terms she would give up information on her former gang members. During her sentence, King met a Jamaican woman who was also imprisoned, who changed her mind about white supremacy. King was released in 2001, determined to begin a new life. Today she is committed to help former neo-Nazis and extremists transition from a life of hate. Christian Picciolini was a co-founder of Life After Hate, and prominent member in the ex-extremist community. Originally a Chicago native, Picciolini grew up in Blue Island, Illinois. Picciolini was first introduced to Neo-nazi groups at the age of 14. The idea of being involved with a big movement appealed to him, and Picciolini later recalled how becoming a skinhead gave him an identity and purpose. Seven years later, at the age of 22, he began to question his beliefs and membership. After his wife and children left him and began interacting with people in the groups supremacists hated, he decided to change his life. In 2010, he co-founded Life After Hate, with the mission of helping former neo- Nazis like himself. Programs =ExitUSA= ExitUSA is an organization that specializes in disengagement of individuals who were previously involved in hate groups and reintegrating them back into society as full functioning individuals that are capable of obtaining jobs and building healthy relationships within their communities. ExitUSA continues to use social media to help the ex-radicals deny their previous beliefs. \\"Asked about \\"the Trump effect,\\" Picciolini said the president's election has emboldened the white supremacist movement. Calls to ExitUSA, a program through Life After Hate, have gone up from two or three per week before the election to 15-20 per week, he said.\\" =Formers Anonymous= Similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, this is a 12 step self-help program created by Sammy Rangel to help people deal with their violent, racist pasts and move on. =#WeCounterHate= In partnership with Possible, a company based in Seattle, Life After Hate created a social media business to spread messages of love to combat the hateful comments often displayed. The program uses computers that specialize in detecting hateful tweets. Once detected, #WeCounterHate sends a message to the author of the hateful tweet saying that a dollar will be donated to Life After Hate for every retweet that occurs. After the message is sent, many delete the original post and others will not share it. Notable events =Charlottesville= When Picciolini was asked for his opinion on the 2017 Charlottesville attack, he said it did not surprise him because he was aware that many extremist groups were actively growing underground. He went on say that most members of extremist groups join as an excuse to act out in anger, not because they believe in the group's ideology. =Grant repeal= During the Obama administration, Life After Hate was awarded a $400,000 grant to combat extremist groups. The grant was revoked by the Trump administration due to what Homeland Security explained as a normal review process. A former government official close to the Trump administration, however, reported that the grant was rescinded based on Twitter posts like on May 16, 2017 made by Christian Picciolini regarding President Trump.https://twitter.com/cpicciolini/status/864652436442673152 =Colin Kaepernick donation= In January 2018, Colin Kaepernick donated $50,000 to Life After Hate for Interventions, travel expenses, social media, analytics software and refurbished laptop computers. =Interviewing Picciolini= In 2017, Goldie Blumenstyk, writing for The Chronicle of Higher Education, interviewed Picciolini. He spoke of his past, living as a white supremacist. He continued by saying that young minds, especially college students, should examine unjust and uncommon situations. Picciolini continued that there is a fine line between seeing something and taking action on what they have seen. Picciolini asserted that it is essential to take everything into perspective before drawing a conclusion.

The couple moved to Palestine again in 1935, where they became active in the Labour Zionist movement, but became disillusioned with the rising nationalism and also Elchon's difficulties in finding suitable employment. In 1938, they finally settled in England, and gradually became agnostic, although they remained involved in a variety of Jewish organisations. Rita joined the Labour Party and the Fabian Society. She obtained her doctorate in 1939 and, on the advice of R. R. Kuczynski, she founded the Fabian Colonial Bureau to research and campaign on anti- colonialism. She became the bureau's first secretary, and worked closely with Arthur Creech Jones, its first chair. They produced numerous pamphlets, and Hinden's own book, Plan for Africa. Although she stood down as secretary in 1950, she continued to write for it, while also serving on a variety of government committees. She became the secretary of the Socialist Union , and editor of Socialist Commentary, bodies associated with the Labour Party and particularly with Hugh Gaitskell.

At Bell Telephone Laboratories, she made a major contribution to the success of the Internet. She invented, developed, and applied the X-ray scanning tool for quality control essential to manufacturing indium gallium arsenide phosphide- based multi-quantum well lasers. These are the lasers that amplify and modulate light that travels through optical fibers that are at the heart of today's Internet. Early life Joanna Vandenberg was born January 24, 1938 in Heemstede, a small town near Amsterdam, where she was the youngest of a family of five, and the first one to go to college. Her family was in the tulip business. In 1956 she graduated cum laude from gymnasium-Œ≤ and went to the State University of Leiden in the Netherlands where she received a B.S. in Physical Sciences and Mathematics, 1959 and a M.S. in Inorganic and Solid State Chemistry with A. E. van Arkel as well as Theoretical Chemistry, 1962. She studied with van Arkel in Leiden and Caroline H. MacGillavry in Amsterdam for a Ph.D. thesis on X-ray diffraction analysis of metal‚Äìmetal bonding in inorganic compounds, 1964. Career She worked for 4 years (1964‚Äì1968) at Royal Dutch Shell laboratory in Amsterdam, where she joined the research group on catalytic properties of transition metal-layered chalcogenides. In 1968 she moved to Bell Laboratories where she continued work on structural and magnetic properties of transition-metal chalcogenides. Her career was interrupted when she was laid off seven months into her first pregnancy. She was rehired in 1972 after the AT&T; operators won a historic class action lawsuit for being fired when pregnant. With Bernd Matthias of UCSD, she started to work on metal cluster formation in superconducting ternary transition metal compounds. Her extensive knowledge of structural inorganic chemistry enabled her to predict inorganic crystal structures and led to the discovery the superconducting rare earth ternary borides. In 1980 she changed direction and began research on contact metallization on InGaAsP/InP multi-quantum well layers used as high speed digital lasers in the internet. She designed a temperature-dependent in- situ annealing X-ray diffractometer. This technique made it possible to optimize the electrical behavior of the gold metallization contacts and became a standard reference in semiconductor industry. In 1986 Vandenberg turned her attention to the quality control of the crystal growth of InGaAsP multi- quantum well (MQW) layers, used as laser light sources and optical modulators designed to work in the 1.3 to 1.55 Œºm wavelength range. Advancing the design, performance and manufacturability of these devices had been the focus of all the leading optical component suppliers for decades. These devices are manufactured using organometallic vapor phase epitaxy, a complex process involving multiple sources subject to drift. Manufacture of early devices was based on unacceptably low (much less than 1%) end-to-end yields. Dramatic improvement was needed to produce the high performance components used to transport the massive amounts of data in today's Internet. In many cases mono- layer thickness control is required along with variations in bandgap less than 0.5%. This high level of quality control must be achieved using complex crystal growth machines which can fail in hundreds of ways. To insure that these multiple failure modes do not impact the final device, Vandenberg designed a one-room (later bench-top) non-destructive high-resolution X-ray diffractometer to provide immediate on-line feedback into the MQW growth process. She constructed robust algorithms linking X-ray features to layer thickness and strain information essential to crystal growth control and optoelectronic device performance. Her X-ray diffraction technique is used to scan every laser wafer many times during manufacture. All Internet lasers are now manufactured using her tool X-Ray Crystallography, and their operational lifetime exceeds 25 years. Awards Vandenberg received the 1995 and 1997 Optoelectronics Award in recognition of contributions to the development of characterization and process control routines for manufacture of Lucent's world class semiconductor lasers. She is a fellow of the American Physical SocietyAPS Fellow Archive, American Physical Society, retrieved 2017-08-17 and a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

She was a member of the Georgist Movement, serving as president of the Women's Henry George League in Manhattan and was one of the founders and first president of the radical Women's Peace Union. Early life Christine Ross was born on 2 January 1866 in Little Bras d'Or on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada to Christina Isabella (n√©e MacKay/McKay) and John Ross. Little is known of her early life, but she moved to New York City and married Wesley E. Barker on 23 December 1903 in Manhattan. Barker was the son of Hersey (n√©e Knowlton) and Wesley E. Barker, Sr. of Springfield, Massachusetts. Her husband, known as \\"Will\\" was a journalist and a member of the Manhattan Single Tax Club. In 1905 in Manhattan, the couple had a daughter, Mary Ross Barker, who would later become an educator and be honored with the Order of Canada. Career Barker became involved in the women's suffrage movement as well as the Women's Henry George League (WHGL) of Manhattan. By 1904, she was speaking on behalf of the league, making presentations with Carrie Chapman Catt and Maud Nathan. By 1905, she had become president of the WHGL, whose object was to replace all forms of taxation with a single tax on resources, i.e. a form of ground rent. She participated in the Progressive Women's Suffrage Union's Parade on Wall Street in Manhattan in 1908, and was one of the members of the organization's executive board. Around 1910, the family moved to North Cambridge, Massachusetts and the following year, they returned to Canada, moving to Toronto. As she had in the United States, Barker became involved in suffragist causes, joining the Canadian Woman Suffrage Association. During World War I, Barker broke ranks with the business women's club in Toronto, which she headed, because they favored war. Instead, she actively supported the women meeting at The Hague, who would form the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Though a member of WILPF, Barker felt that they lacked resolve to maintain the fight as pacifists and made compromises for the war by buying war bonds, knitting goods and wrapping bandages. When in 1921, Barker proposed that conference be held in Niagara, Ontario between American and Canadian women to discuss their pacifist aims, she approached the Women's Peace Society (WPS) rather than WILPF to help her organize it. The WPS had split from the WILPF over the same lack of commitment to the cause that troubled Barker. Out of the conference, held between 19 and 21 August, came the creation of the Women's Peace Union, to unite women from Canada, Latin America and the United States to work for peace. Barker served as the first chair, along with Margaret Long Thomas of New York City, who was appointed secretary, and Gertrude Franchot Tone of Niagara Falls, New York, who served as treasurer. The single-purpose of the organization was to pass a constitutional amendment in the United States to outlaw war. In September 1927, Barker was one of the featured speakers at the Henry George Congress, held in New York City. She not only participated in the Congresses of the society, attending 1934, 1936, and 1938 meetings, but was actively involved in the Henry George School in Toronto. Her husband died on 26 June 1936 two weeks after they had attended the 1936 School Dinner in New York City. Death and legacy Barker died on 25 June 1940 in London, Ontario, Canada and was buried in Brookside Cemetery, New Glasgow, Pictou County, Nova Scotia.

A slow maturing stayer who was gelded before he appeared on a racecourse, he passed through the hands of five different trainers in a track career which lasted from September 2008 until November 2014. He won several minor races as a three-year-old in 2009 but then lost his form and failed to win in the next two seasons, including and unsuccessful stint as a National Hunt horse. He finally emerged as a top-class performer at the age of six when he rebounded from an unlucky defeat in the Ebor Handicap to record an upset victory in the Irish St. Leger. He was at least as good in the following season when he won the Challenge Stakes, Irish St. Leger Trial Stakes and British Champions Long Distance Cup. He was retired from racing after failing to win in 2014. Background Royal Diamond is a bay gelding with two small white facial markings bred in Ireland by the Moyglare Stud. As a yearling he was consigned to the Goffs sale in October 2007 and was bought for ‚Ç¨70,000 by the trainer Mark Prescott. He entered the ownership of E B Rimmer-Osborne House and was taken into training by Prescott as his Heath House Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by King's Best who won the 2000 Guineas in 2000. His other progeny included Workforce, Creachadoir, Proclamation, Eishin Flash (Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho), Sajjhaa (Dubai Duty Free Stakes) and King's Apostle (Prix Maurice de Gheest). His dam Irresistible Jewel was a top-class racemare who won the Ribblesdale Stakes in 2002 and went on to become a very successful broodmare whose other foals have included Princess Highway (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Mad About You (Gladness Stakes). She was descended from the British broodmare Fictitious (foaled 1957) whose other descendants included Blushing John. Royal Diamond was gelded in February 2008, before the start of his racing career. Racing career =2008 - 2011: early career= Royal Diamond showed little promise as two- year-old. After finishing fourth in a maiden race at Yarmouth Racecourse on 17 September he ran unplaced in similar events at Warwick and Lingfield. After finishing last of nine on his three-year-old debut, the gelding was moved up in distance and produced a much better effort when finishing second in a handicap over fourteen furlongs at Haydock Park. On 29 July at Sandown Park Racecourse Royal Diamond was assigned a weight of 123 pounds in a handicap and recorded his first success as he won by two and a half lengths at odds of 6/1. The gelding remained unbeaten for the rest of the 2009 season, although his campaign was restricted to minor handicaps over extended distances: he won at Yarmouth in August, Ffos Las in September and Wolverhmpton in October. At the end of October Royal Diamond was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was sold for 400,000 guineas to the trainer Michael Dods. The horse passed into the ownership of Andrew Tinkler and joined Dods' stable at Denton, County Durham. Royal Diamond's time at Dods' stable in 2010 proved to be extremely disappointing as he finished unplaced in all four of his races. In 2011 the gelding was transferred to the stable of Jonjo O'Neill who prepared the horse for a National Hunt campaign. After recording one third place from three runs on the flat in the early part of 2011 Royal Diamond was switched to Hurdling but appeared to show little aptitude for the sport. He fell on his jumping debut at Huntingdon Racecourse and was well beaten in two subsequent appearances over obstacles. =2012: six-year-old season= For the 2012 Flat season, Royal Diamond was moved to Ireland and joined the stable of the former steeplechase jockey Tommy Carmody at the Curragh in County Kildare. After finishing third in a minor race at Dundalk he recorded his first win in two and a half years when he was ridden to victory by Johnny Murtagh in a handicap at Leopardstown on 15 April. He was then moved up in class, finishing second in a valuable handicap at the Curragh in May and third in the Ulster Derby in June. In August the gelding was sent to England for the Ebor Handicap at York Racecourse in which he carried a weight of 126 pounds and started at odds of 16/1. After disputing the lead for most of the way he was beaten a neck by the Godolphin representative Willing Foe after being badly hampered as the winner hung to the left in the closing stages. Royal Diamond made his first appearance in a Group race on 15 September when he started a 16/1 outsider for the Group One Irish St. Leger over fourteen furlongs on yielding ground at the Curragh. Fame and Glory started favourite ahead of Brown Panther while the other runners included Hartani (Curragh Cup), Aiken (Grand Prix de Chantilly), Massiyn (second in the Ballyroan Stakes) and Simenon (Queen Alexandra Stakes). Fame and Glory set a steady pace with Royal Diamond, partnered by Niall McCullagh, settled in fourth place in the early stages before moving into contention approaching the final turn. Fame and Glory went clear of the field in the straight but then began to struggle as Massiyn, Brown Panther, Aiken and Royal Diamond all stayed on strongly. In a \\"blanket finish\\" Royal Diamond gained the advantage in the final stride and won by a head, a short head and a neck from Massiyn, Brown Panther and Aiken. =2013: seven-year-old season= In early 2013, Royal Diamond was sent to the United Arab Emirates and ran twice at Meydan Racecourse in March, making little impact as he ran unplaced in the Nad Al Sheba Trophy and the Sheema Classic. On his returen to Europe in May he produced a slightly better effort as he came home third behind Glen's Diamond and Top Trip in the Yorkshire Cup. A week after his run at York, Royal Diamond changed trainers yet again, moving to the recently established stable of Johnny Murtagh at Coolaghknock Glebe, County Kildare. Murtagh both trained and rode the horse in his remaining six races that year. Royal Diamond was beaten five lengths into second by the Aidan O'Brien-trained Ernest Hemingway in the Curragh Cup in June and was then dropped in class for the Listed Challenge Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in July. Starting the 5/4 favourite he took the lead from the start, opened up a clear lead, and won by three and three quarter lengths from Sir Ector despite being eased down by Murtagh in the closing stages. On 8 August in the Ballyroan Stakes he was again beaten by Ernest Hemingway but on this occasion he finished only half a length behind the O'Brien colt. In the Irish St. Leger Trial Stakes sixteen days later he faced Ernest Hemingway yet again in a five-runner field which also included Sir Ector and the improving four-year-old filly Voleuse de Coeurs. Murtagh sent the gelding into the lead from the start and Royal Diamond held off a sustained challenge from Voleuse de Coeurs to win by half a length, with Ernest Hemingway finishing five and a half lengths back in third place. Johnny Murtagh commented \\"He's really come on from the last day. I tried to be a bit clever last time by going quick but not too quick in front. He comes good at this time of year. Hopefully in three weeks' time he'll come back here and defend his title. He's a wonderful horse for us to have\\". On 15 September Royal Diamond attempted to reproduce his 2012 success in the Irish St. Leger and started at odds of 9/2 in a ten-runner field. He led for most of the way but was outpaced in the straight and finished fifth behind Voleuse de Coeurs. The gelding ended his season with a run in the British Champions Long Distance Cup at Ascot Racecourse on 19 October in which he started a 20/1 outsider. The field was headed by the Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate and included several other top stayers including Saddler's Rock (Goodwood Cup, Doncaster Cup), Harris Tweed (John Porter Stakes) Ahzeemah (Lonsdale Cup) and Times Up (Doncaster Cup). In a tactical change, Murtagh restrained the horse in seventh place before making a forward move in the straight. He stayed on strongly in the closing stages, caught the leader Harris Tweed on the line and won by a nose. After the race Johnny Murtagh said \\"It's the best day of my life. I can't thank everyone enough for giving me the horses and trusting me. I don't know what to say ‚Äì I'm stuck for words. He's been a brilliant horse from day one.\\" =2014: eight-year-old season= Royal Diamond remained in training as an eight-year-old but failed to win in five races. He finished second to Leading Light in the Vintage Crop Stakes and then ran unplaced behind the same horse in the Ascot Gold Cup. He was then beaten by Leading Light yet again when finishing second in the Irish St. Leger Stakes. Royal Diamond made a third appearance in the Irish St. Leger, finishing sixth to Brown Panther and was then sent to Australia for a run in the Melbourne Cup. He was made a 100/1 outsider and finished tailed off at the rear of the field. Pedigree * Through his dam, Irresistible Jewel, Royal Diamond was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

History  Blessed Zefirino Agostini In 1856 Blessed Zefirino Agostini, a parish priest, opened with some girls of an oratory of Verona a school for poor girls of the parish of Saints Nazarius and Celsus after he had asked for his bishop's permission. His work was supported by women who lived with their families and formed the Pious Union of Devout Sisters of Saint Angela, but in 1860 some of them started to live in community. In 1869 Luigi di Canossa, the bishop of Verona, got Zefirino Agostini to refound in his diocese the defunct company of Saint Ursula of Verona, a community inspired by the teachings of Saint Angela Merici. The \\"external\\" and \\"internal\\" members worked together until 1901, when the former embraced the rule of Saint Angela Merici and the latter adopted a new rule, forming a congregation of diocesan right, which became a congregation of pontifical right in 1940.

It serves both the town of Blackstone and its western neighbor, Millville. History The first high school in Blackstone was built in 1868 on School Street. It was replaced in 1920 with a new high school on Main Street. The Main Street building was expanded in 1938. As population in the area grew, regionalization was discussed as a way to provide a new high school for Blackstone and Millville. The Blackstone-Millville Regional School District, which regionalized grades 7-12, was approved by voters in both towns in 1967 and charged with planning and establishing a regional junior-senior high school to be located on Lincoln Street in Blackstone. Following the sale of school district construction bonds, Blackstone-Millville Junior-Senior High School opened its doors in September 1970 serving students in grades 7 through 12 and the former high school building was retained by the district for use as an intermediate elementary school. Blackstone and Millville maintained separate K-6 school committees until 1982, when school budget cuts resulting from Massachusetts Proposition 2¬Ω going into effect pushed the towns to work out a plan to modify the regional district to establish a K-12 regional district, approved by voters at Special Town Meetings in April 1982. The Blackstone-Millville Regional School District began operating as a K-12 regional district on July 1, 1982. When Frederick W. Hartnett Middle School opened in 2003, the high school realigned to serve students in grades 9 through 12.

It was created to be the central ornament of a grand fountain in a courtyard of Diane de Poitier's Ch√¢teau d'Anet, but today is in the Louvre, Room 15b on the ground floor of the Richelieu Wing (Louvre inventory no. MR 1581 MR sup 123). Long believed to be the work of Jean Goujon, the identity of the sculptor is now considered uncertain, although Benvenuto Cellini, Germain Pilon, Pierre Bontemps, and have in turn been suggested. Description Diana, the goddess of hunting, is represented with two dogs (a greyhound named Phrocyon and a barbet dog named Cyrius) and a large stag. This striking ensemble has become one of the most famous works of the French Renaissance. Not a true portrait of Diane de Poitiers,\\"Fountain of Diana\\", Louvre website. it is but one of the many closely related images of moon goddesses, including the paintings Diana the Huntress by a member of the School of Fontainebleau and Le Bain de Diane by Fran√ßois Clouet. The sculpture was a part of the fountain in Diane de Poitiers's Ch√¢teau d'Anet built by Philibert de L'Orme. The ensemble, as engraved in its original location by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau and as shown in a 16th-century drawing at the Louvre, differs from its current form. The stag's head and the dog on the left are positioned quite differently.Blunt 1953, p. 249, note 125. Blunt mentions that the drawing is reproduced in Mayer 1939, p. 129. The sculpture was heavily restored in the 18th century and a second time in 1799-1800 by Pierre-Nicolas Beauvallet. Nevertheless, an early 17th-century unpublished drawing by Jacques Gentilh√¢tre in the Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects shows it much as seen today. In 1953, the British art historian Anthony Blunt argued that the engraving and the earlier drawing are not independent, and the differences are the result of \\"the sort of alteration that du Cerceau often made.\\" The traditional attribution to Jean Goujon, suggested by Alexandre Lenoir in 18th century, is not accepted today. Others have been suggested, including Benvenuto Cellini, Pierre Bontemps, Ponce Jacquiot and especially Germain Pilon.For Germain Pilon, see Blunt, Anthony; Beresford, Richard (1999).

Early life and education George Papadopoulos was born August 19, 1987, at Swedish Covenant Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, to Greek immigrants originally from Thessaloniki. His father, Antonis, was heavily involved in the local politics of the Greek-American community and is the former president of the Pan-Macedonian Union of the United States. His mother, Kate (Kiki), was born in Greece, but later moved to Worcester, Massachusetts. He grew up in Lincolnwood, Illinois. He attended Niles West High School in Skokie, Illinois, graduating in 2005. He then attended DePaul University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 2009. He earned a Master of Science in Security Studies in 2010 at University College London. He speaks Arabic, English, French and Greek. Career Papadopoulos was an unpaid intern at the Hudson Institute from 2011 to 2015 specializing in the eastern Mediterranean and later worked as a contract research assistant to a senior fellow at the institute. Richard Weitz, a Wikistrat Expert, managed George Papadopoulos while he was at the Hudson Institute. He described himself as an \\"oil, gas, and policy consultant\\" on his LinkedIn page. In 2014, Papadopoulos authored op-ed pieces in Israeli publications. In one, published in the Arutz Sheva, Papadopoulos argued that the U.S. should focus on its \\"stalwart allies\\" Israel, Greece, and Cyprus to \\"contain the newly emergent Russian fleet\\"; in another, published in Ha'aretz, he contended that Israel should exploit its natural gas resources in partnership with Cyprus and Greece rather than Turkey. Analysis conducted by Ha'aretz in 2017 showed that Papadopoulos also co-authored an expert opinion that was delivered to the Israeli Energy Ministry on June 20, 2015, on a proposed plan to develop the offshore gas fields, named Leviathan, found in Israel's territorial waters on behalf of the Hudson Institute. Money was donated to Hudson by the CEO of Noble Energy and other staffers of the company. Houston-based Noble Energy is heavily invested in Israeli gas together with the Israeli energy group Delek. Together they have a monopoly over Israeli gas. The opinion written by Hudson supported the interests of this gas monopoly. Noble Energy was given permission on December 17, 2015, to develop the Leviathan gas field worth up to $120 billion. He directed an international energy center at the London Centre of International Law Practice. In September 2015, Papadopoulos left the Hudson Institute and joined Energy Stream, a London energy consultancy, as an oil and gas consultant for four months before joining Ben Carson's presidential campaign. Beginning in December 2015, Papadopoulos served on the National Security and Foreign Policy Advisory Committee for Ben Carson's campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. He left the Carson campaign in mid- February 2016. Following his indictment, he was described by HuffPost as \\"a little-known, little-qualified 30-year-old.\\" In 2019, Papadopoulos announced he had joined the board of advisors for the medical cannabis company C3, which manufactures the marijuana pill Idrasil.  Involvement in Donald Trump's presidential campaign  In late 2015, Papadopoulos sent his r√©sum√© to the Ben Carson presidential campaign, which hired him as a foreign policy adviser for three months, December 2015 through February 2016. According to court records, Papadopoulos joined Trump's foreign policy adviser team as a volunteer adviser in early March 2016. Sam Clovis, who at the time was national co-chairman of Donald Trump's campaign team, approved him as an unpaid adviser. In his campaign job interview via Skype from London on March 6, Clovis allegedly told Papadopoulos that one of the campaign's foreign policy priorities was to improve U.S.‚ÄìRussia relations, though Clovis later denied saying that. Employed at that time with the London Centre of International Law Practice (LCILP), on March 12, 2016, Papadopoulos was part of an LCILP visiting delegation to the Link Campus University in Rome. There he met Joseph Mifsud,Smith, Lee. \\"The Maltese Phantom of Russiagate\\", Real Clear Investiagations, May 30, 2018. a Maltese academic who was at the time a teacher at the University of Stirling in Scotland. On March 21, 2016, in an interview with the editorial board of The Washington Post Donald Trump announced Papadopoulos as one of his campaign's foreign policy advisers. Trump, reading from a list, said: \\"He's an oil and energy consultant, excellent guy\\". On March 24, Papadopoulos met with Mifsud in London. Papadopoulos said that Mifsud brought along with him a Russian woman, Olga Polonskaya, whom Mifsud falsely identified as Putin's niece. In a later interview, Mifsud denied this. Papadopoulos joined candidate Trump as well as Senator Jeff Sessions and other campaign officials for a National Security Meeting at the Trump Hotel, on March 31, 2016. Papadopoulos averred that he could facilitate a foreign policy meeting between candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Richardson, Davis. George Papadopoulos Alleges Jeff Sessions Approved of a Trump-Putin Meeting in 2016, Obsever, September 1, 2018. At a breakfast meeting at the Andaz London Liverpool Street hotel on April 26, 2016, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that he had information that the Russians have \\"dirt\\" on Hillary Clinton, \\"the Russians had emails of Clinton\\", \\"they have thousands of emails.\\" From March to August 2016, Papadopoulos \\"was identified as having contacts with senior members of the Trump campaign on at least a dozen occasions.\\" Papadopoulos's wife, then his fianc√©e, said in 2017 that his job in the campaign was to set up meetings with foreign leaders and that he had been in regular contact with high-ranking campaign officials. Papadopoulos sent emails concerning meeting with Putin to at least seven campaign officials. Clovis, as Trump national campaign co-chairman, encouraged Papadopoulos to fly to Russia to meet with agents of the Russian Foreign Ministry, after Papadopoulos had been told that Russia had \\"dirt\\" on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails and wanted to share it with Trump's campaign. This occurred after public knowledge that Clinton had deleted thousands of her emails, but before there was public knowledge of the hack of Democratic National Committee and of John Podesta's emails, the latter two of which U.S. intelligence agencies believe were carried out by Russia. On or about May 10, 2016, at London's Kensington Wine Rooms, Papadopoulos allegedly told the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, that Russia was in possession of emails relating to Hillary Clinton. In July, after the DNC hacking had become known, the Australians told U.S. authorities about Papadopoulos's comment, leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Donald Trump presidential campaign on July 31, 2016. Papadopoulos later said that he had told the Greek Foreign Minister, Nikos Kotzias, during a meeting on May 26, 2016, that the Russians had Clinton-related emails. He said his \\"biggest regret\\" was not immediately reporting Mifsud's comment to U.S. intelligence, and the \\"stupidest thing I did was actually gossiping about it with foreign diplomats\\". Between March and September 2016, Papadopoulos made at least six requests for Trump or representatives of his campaign to meet in Russia with Russian politicians. In May, campaign chairman Paul Manafort forwarded one such request to his deputy Rick Gates, saying \\"We need someone to communicate that [Trump] is not doing these trips. It should be someone low-level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.\\" Gates delegated the task to the campaign's correspondence coordinator, referring to him as \\"the person responding to all mail of non-importance.\\" In an interview about Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations with Interfax in September 2016, Papadopoulos said that Barack Obama had failed to follow through on his promises to cooperate with Russia, and asserted that the U.S. had made insufficient joint efforts with Russia against terrorism. As foreign policy adviser during Trump's campaign, Papadopoulos helped set up a September 23, 2016 New York meeting between Trump and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian president. On January 20, 2017, just hours before Trump was going to be inaugurated, Papadopoulos and incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus met with Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos. Two days later, Papadopoulos met with the head of Israel's Shomron Regional Council, Yossi Dagan, in Washington D.C. Papadopoulos was reported to have communicated to Dagan the Trump administration's desire to work closely with Israel on the question of Israel's West Bank settlements. Senator Richard Burr, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which investigated Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, said in October 2017 that the panel was interested in Papadopoulos because he had sent e-mails attempting to set up meetings between Trump and Putin. The recipients of emails about outreach to the Russian government reportedly were Clovis, Corey Lewandowski, Manafort, Gates, representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ivan Timofeev, and others. In 2018 his wife predicted that Papadopoulos's role in the Russia investigation would be similar to that of John Dean of the Watergate scandal. Democrats on the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence later arranged for her to testify before the committee, but the plans fell through when the Republican majority refused to reimburse her for travel expenses from Chicago. Despite his communications with members of the Trump campaign regarding Russia, the Mueller Report found no evidence that Papadopoulos ever shared information with the Trump campaign regarding Russia having \\"dirt\\" on Hilary Clinton in the form of her emails or that Russia could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information about Clinton.  Arrest and guilty plea  The Statement of Facts of Guilt, filed October 5, 2017, and unsealed October 30, 2017, showing the facts admitted by Papadopoulos as part of his guilty plea Papadopoulos was interviewed by FBI agents on January 27, 2017, regarding any Trump campaign connections with Russia. After the interrogation, on the advice of his counsel, Papadopoulos deactivated his Facebook account, which contained correspondences with Russians, and created a new account. On July 27, 2017, Papadopoulos was arrested upon landing at Washington-Dulles International Airport, placed in handcuffs and leg shackles, and put in a prison cell overnight for his arraignment the following day. He was released without bail and subsequently cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation. On October 5, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to making false statements to FBI agents relating to contacts he had with agents of the Russian government while working for the Trump campaign. The guilty plea was part of a plea bargain reflecting his cooperation with the Mueller investigation. Papadopoulos's arrest and guilty plea became public on October 30, 2017, when court documents showing the guilty plea were unsealed. Following his guilty plea, Trump described Papadopoulos as a \\"young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar\\" and said few people in his campaign had heard about Papadopoulos. FactCheck.org and PolitiFact, among others, noted that during the campaign, Trump named Papadopoulos as one of his five foreign policy advisers‚Äîalongside Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, Walid Phares and Joseph Schmitz‚Äîand described Papadopoulos as an \\"excellent guy\\". In a sentencing memorandum released on August 17, 2018, prosecutors stated that a sentence of zero to six months was \\"appropriate and warranted,\\" noting that Papadopoulos had repeatedly lied to investigators and did not provide \\"substantial assistance\\" to the investigation, and that his lies had interfered with the investigators' ability to question and if necessary detain Joseph Mifsud, who left the United States two weeks after Papadopoulos's first interview with the FBI. On September 7, 2018, Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in prison, 12 months of supervised release, and 200 hours of community service; he was also fined $9,500. He began serving his 14-day sentence on November 26, 2018, at FCI Oxford in Oxford, Wisconsin, and was released 12 days later on December 7, 2018. Allegations of entrapment Papadopoulos has consistently stated his belief that he was entrapped by people in various government intelligence agencies in order to justify FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign. He fleshed out this belief in his 2019 book Deep State Target. According to Papadopoulos, the meetings with both Mifsud and Downer were arranged by others, and he had no knowledge of either person before he was told he should meet them. Papadopoulos's theory is that the plan was for Mifsud, whom he characterized as a Western intelligence operative, to give Papadopoulos information about Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton's emails, and then for Downer to get Papadopoulos to repeat those same allegations to Downer, in order to establish that the Trump campaign was secretly working with the Russians and begin surveillance. Papadopoulos believes that Downer was recording the conversation with his phone in an obvious manner. Downer has denied all of these charges. In an August 2017 interview, Mifsud denied telling Papadopoulos about his Russian connections, saying that he had \\"absolutely no contact with the Russian government.\\" Papadopoulos believes that this entrapment was indirectly coordinated via the London Centre for International Law Practice, an organization that hired him and were among the first to find out, in 2016, that he was planning to join the Trump campaign. A 2017 investigation by reporters for The Washington Post found that no one was there at the supposed address for the LCILP during regular business hours, and that some of the people listed on the LCILP website as being members of the organization had no knowledge of it. Papadopoulos has also pointed to another 2016 meeting, with Stefan Halper, a Cambridge University professor with ties to the FBI and CIA, that he believes was designed to elicit incriminating statements from him. Papadopoulos has noted that Halper brought with him an attractive, flirtatious woman, who introduced herself as \\"Azra Turk\\", who Papadopoulos believes was meant to serve as a honeypot to elicit information. A 2019 article in The New York Times seemed to confirm Papadopoulos's view of the meeting with Halper and Turk, describing Turk as an FBI informant. The FBI has refused to comment on the matter. Donald Trump initially dismissed Papadopoulos's statements, referring to him in October 2017 on Twitter as \\"the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar\\".https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/925335577217683456 However, by May 2018, Trump came to agree with Papadopoulos's assessment, and coined the term \\"Spygate\\" to refer to the entire alleged enterprise. =Status of Joseph Mifsud= Much of the discussion about the veracity of Papadopoulos's claims has centered around Joseph Mifsud, the Maltese professor who first met Papadopoulos about a week after Papadopoulos joined the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos has described him as working for Western intelligence, while others have called this a conspiracy theory and some have even called Mifsud an asset of Russian intelligence. Mifsud has not made any public statements since October 2017. In September 2018, a court filing said that Mifsud was missing, had not been heard from in months, and \\"may be deceased\\". He officially remains missing, although in April 2019 the Italian newspaper Il Foglio stated that he was still alive and hiding out in an apartment in Rome. Stephan Roh, Mifsud's lawyer, has repeatedly stated that Mifsud was working for Western intelligence, and that he is hiding out for his own protection as a result. Roh co-wrote, with Thierry Pastor, the book The Faking of Russia- Gate: The Papadopoulos Case: An Investigative Analysis, which argued this case; the book was self-published in June 2018. In a May 2019 opinion piece in The Washington Post, former FBI chief James Comey called Mifsud a \\"Russian agent\\". Some critics of the Russia investigation have embraced Papadopoulos's view of Mifsud. During Robert Mueller's testimony to two congressional committees on July 24, 2019, Republicans Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes sought to portray Mifsud as a central figure in what they asserted was an investigation based on false and politically motivated premises, while Democrats characterized their assertion as a diversion and conspiracy theory. Papadopoulos's view has been echoed by Trump allies Rudy Giuliani and Lindsey Graham. In October 2019, Senator Graham, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to the leaders of Britain, Australia and Italy, asserting as fact that both Mifsud and Downer had been directed to contact Papadopoulos, and asking for their help in continuing the investigation. Joe Hockey, the Australian ambassador to the United States, sharply rejected Graham's characterization of Downer. A former Italian government official told The Washington Post in October 2019 that during a meeting the previous month, Italian intelligence services told Barr they had \\"no connections, no activities, no interference\\" in the matter; Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte later affirmed this. A December 2019 report on the FBI's Russia investigation, headed by Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, found no evidence that Mifsud had ever worked for the FBI. In response, Papadopoulos wrote on Twitter that this finding \\"Leaves only one other option: CIA\\". Personal life As of October 2017, Papadopoulos had lived for the past few years with his mother and brother in the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. He married Simona Mangiante, an Italian lawyer who used to work for the European Parliament, in March 2018. He had met her through Mifsud. During the months between his guilty plea and his sentencing, she became his public spokeswoman. In a September 9 interview on This Week, she said she understands why the FBI was suspicious of her because her international background might have been considered a \\"red flag.\\" She commented, \\"I always said I respect Mueller's interest in my profile because clearly it's quite alarming, the fact that I marry George Papadopoulos in the middle of this storm.\\" George Papadopoulos said that even his family had been concerned that she might be \\"some sort of Russian spy,\\" a concern he dismissed. On March 9, 2020, Simona announced that she was divorcing Papadopoulos in a series of posts on Twitter; she called him \\"a monster\\", a \\"traitor\\" and a \\"grifter\\", and said that she regretted defending him. She deleted the posts soon thereafter. The next day, she wrote on Twitter that the two were not divorcing but would undergo marriage counseling instead. She wrote, \\"I love him deeply and dearly and I know he loves me too.\\" She also apologized for her earlier tweets.

The film is based on the novel One-Way Ticket by Ethel Turner (New York, 1934). It is a prison drama in which a man becomes a robber following the authorities' failure to convict a corrupt banker. It was the directorial debut of Biberman, a playwright and theatre director of Marxist political leanings; following some theatrical success in New York, he signed a two-picture deal with Columbia in 1934, and it was followed by Meet Nero Wolfe in 1936.

The game was developed by Teque Software Development and published by Grandslam Entertainments. The game was released in Europe in 1988, for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum. A version for the Sega Master System was released in 1991. Gameplay Each version of The Flintstones features identical gameplay. The game contains four levels. The story begins with Fred Flintstone finishing work at a rock quarry and exclaiming \\"Yabba dabba doo!\\" which is the game's only spoken line of dialogue, achieved through speech synthesis. For the remainder of the game, character interactions are done through speech balloons. Fred wants to bowl with Barney Rubble at a bowling alley, but Fred's wife, Wilma, tells him that he must paint their living room first for the arrival of her mother. Playing as Fred, the player must paint the room while also preventing his young daughter, Pebbles, from scribbling on the walls. The player's paintbrush is a squirrel. When stopping Pebbles, the squirrel sometimes runs away and must be captured. In the second level, Fred must race to the bowling alley while avoiding rocks on the road. Hitting a rock results in the vehicle losing a wheel, requiring the player to search for a replacement and get back on the road. The third level is played as a bowling game between Fred and Barney, with the two players taking turns. In the final level, Fred returns home and discovers that Pebbles is missing from the house. He finds her climbing a construction site and competes against Barney to rescue her, while avoiding nuts and bolts. A practice mode allows the player to explore each area. A rendition of the theme music from the television series was created by Ben Daglish, and is present throughout the game, except for the ZX Spectrum version. Reception The Games Machine criticized the bowling level for \\"the long-winded restacking of the pins after each bowl ‚Äì this is taking realism too far.\\" The magazine praised the music and noted that the graphics \\"could challenge the TV cartoon\\", and concluded, \\"If you have the patience, The Flintstones could provide an amusing, if generally tough challenge.\\" The magazine noted that the Atari ST version was identical to the Amiga version, except for slightly poorer sound. Reviewing the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions, The Games Machine wrote that each version retained the \\"impressive cartoon-like\\" graphics and difficult gameplay of the earlier versions. The magazine wrote, \\"The Commodore version moves at a fair rate, while the Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions are slow enough to cause frustration.\\" Chris Jenkins of Computer and Video Games praised the graphics and sound, but considered the bowling level to be the \\"poorest\\" portion of the game. Jenkins concluded that the game \\"is a polished and professional product which deserves to be seen.\\" John Butters of Atari ST User praised the music and sound, and called the graphics \\"immaculate,\\" but concluded that the game \\"soon became frustrating rather than addictive\\". Andy Richards, also of Atari ST User, praised the music, sound, gameplay, and graphics. One reviewer for ST Action wrote that the painting level \\"is clever, infuriating, and taxing, but the bowling scene could have been more thoughtfully designed.\\" Another reviewer for ST Action wrote, \\"Sluggish controls and the slow speed make the painting scene unbelievably tedious and, sadly the bowling scene is, if anything, worse. A lot of time is wasted as the player resets the pins, or whilst Barney bowls, and this means just sitting and waiting until it is your turn again. There is nothing about this program I can recommend.\\" Paul Glancey of Zzap!64 wrote about the Commodore 64 version, \\"Poor sprites and feeble backgrounds coupled with a grating rendition of the Flintstones theme tune create a bad impression, and frustrating controls in the painting section do not enthrall. The sub-games are dated ‚Äì a paint and collect game in '88?! ‚Äì and the basic Tenth Frame bowling doesn't encourage the player to reach the final section. TV licences work rarely, if at all; The Flintstones certainly doesn't.\\" Paul Sumner, also of Zzap!64, wrote that neither Fred or Barney resembled their television counterparts, but praised the sound and music. Sumner wrote that the gameplay \\"is a little difficult at first, due mainly to the slightly unresponsive control. But perseverance does reap some reward, though I personally found the game to be too difficult to warrant extensive play.\\" References External links * The Flintstones at MobyGames Category:Video games based on The Flintstones Category:1988 video games Category:1991 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Atari ST games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Master System games Category:MSX2 games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Europe-exclusive video games ","title":"The Flintstones (1988 video game)"},{"id":"54909345","text":"Senior Resources of Guilford, based in Greensboro and High Point, North Carolina, is a nonprofit organization providing home-based and community-based services that support and promote independent living for older adults.

Co-producer Vernon Chatman co-wrote the story with C.K.; it is C.K.'s first film as director since Pootie Tang, released sixteen years earlier. C.K. plays television writer and producer Glen Topher, who becomes disconcerted after his teenage daughter (Moretz) is seduced by a much older film director (Malkovich). The film premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017. Initially scheduled to be released in the United States on November 17, 2017 by The Orchard, the film was dropped following sexual misconduct accusations made against C.K. a week prior to the intended debut. On December 8, 2017, it was reported that C.K. was purchasing the film's global distribution rights back from The Orchard. Plot Glen Topher (Louis C.K.), a successful television writer and producer based in New York City, informs his ex-wife Aura (Helen Hunt) that their aimless teenage daughter, China (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz), wants to move in with him, probably because of his wealthy lifestyle. Ralph (Charlie Day), Glen's closest friend, insinuates that China, being an attractive 17-year-old girl, probably spent her spring break in Florida playing sexual games with her classmates. China asks Glen permission to go back to Florida to meet with the new friends she made there, and Glen is worried but can't say no to her. Maggie (Pamela Adlon), Glen's outspoken ex-girlfriend, thinks he's being a bad father for always giving his daughter whatever she wants. A new television series about nurses, created by Glen, is set to air in the fall, but there is no script yet and no cast has been hired, much to the chagrin of Glen's nervous production partner Paula (Edie Falco). Through the machinations of an agent, famous actress Grace Cullen (Rose Byrne) shows up unannounced at Glen and Paula's production office seeking the lead role in the new show. Grace claims that she has always wanted to work with Glen, who in turn is deeply charmed by the actress. A few days later, Grace invites Glen and his daughter China to a party, and veteran film director Leslie Goodwin (John Malkovich), whom Glen idolizes, is also in attendance. China is wary of Leslie due to media reports accusing him of being a pedophile. After talking with Leslie, however, China becomes fascinated by him. Glen soon enters into a romantic relationship with Grace, who informs him that Leslie has invited his daughter China on a trip to Paris with him and some friends. Glen is appalled, but when he confronts China about it, she is resolute about going. The situation leads Glen to a fight with Grace, and they break up. When China arrives home from Paris, Glen throws her a fancy celebration for her 18th birthday, but is haunted by the notion that she may have had sex with the much older Leslie. Glen confronts them both with his concerns, resulting in China getting upset with him and moving out of his house. Months later, Glen is attending the Emmy Awards, where Leslie has just received the Best Director award for a show featuring Ralph as its star. Leslie tells Glen that he felt inspired by him to finally accept doing television work. Leslie also casually reveals that China had rejected his sexual advances while in Paris. In the end, Maggie acts as intermediary and Glen meets China at her new job at a department store, where the father and daughter begin to reconcile.

Release The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017, where distribution rights were bought by company The Orchard for $5 million. It was scheduled to be released on November 17, 2017, in a limited release before opening wide on December 1. On November 9, The Orchard canceled the New York premiere of the film due to \\"unexpected circumstances\\". The Hollywood Reporter reported that a possibly damaging upcoming New York Times story on C.K. was the reason for the cancellation. The Times published the story later in the day, accusing C.K. of sexual misconduct against five women. On November 10, 2017, a week before it was set to be theatrically released, it was pulled from the schedule. Shortly after, international distributors dropped the film and scrapped all release plans. In December 2017, C.K. was reported to have purchased the film's global distribution rights back from The Orchard. Later that month, piracy group CM8 acquired one of 12,000 screener DVDs of the film and posted it to several torrent file hosting websites. Asked about C.K.'s move to purchase the rights, lead actress Chlo√´ Grace Moretz said in an August 2018 interview with The New York Times that she would prefer the movie \\"just kind of go away, honestly\\", adding that \\"it's devastating to put time into a project and have it disappear\\". She elaborated the following month that she does not \\"think that it's a perspective or a story that needs to be told in this day and age, especially in the wake of everything that‚Äôs come to light\\". Rose Byrne in an interview stated: \\"I stand with the women who came forward, I think it will be a while before that film can be seen, and I think that‚Äôs right.‚Äù =Critical reception= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film a four-star review, calling it a \\"very funny and recklessly provocative homage to Woody Allen, channelling his masterpiece Manhattan.\\" Variety critic Owen Gleiberman was less positive, writing that \\"the film meanders, and its second half is shapeless\\", although he praised the dialogue and cast.

Born in Tattershall in Lincolnshire, Toyn worked as a bird-scarer on a farm from the age of six. After a variety of other farm work, when he was fourteen, he began working on a canal barge, then three years later became an ironstone miner in Cleveland. After some time, he was promoted to become an overman, but soon resigned to work underground again.Joyce Bellamy, \\"Toyn, Joseph\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.II, pp.368-370 In 1872, Toyn was a founder of the Cleveland Miners' Association, serving as a delegate from his mine, then in 1875 he became the union's president. The following year, the union appointed him as its full-time agent. As agent, he was the leading figure in setting up a conciliation board to resolve disputes in the industry, which he credited with preventing any strikes during his time in office. Through his work for the union, Toyn regularly attended the Trades Union Congress, and also served on the board of the Miners' National Union (MNU). However, in 1892, he persuaded the union to leave the MNU and instead affiliated to the rival Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB). This federation was campaigning for an eight-hour maximum working day, an issue which Toyn strongly supported. Toyn was elected to the executive of the MFGB in 1896, but served only a single year. He also became active in the Labour Electoral Association, which proposed him as a Liberal-Labour candidate in the Cleveland by-election, 1902. However, by this time, the Cleveland Miners were affiliated to the Labour Representation Committee, forerunner of the Labour Party, and were hoping to sponsor a rival candidate. Ultimately, Toyn decided not to run. Toyn was appointed as a magistrate in 1906, and was also prominent in the local co-operative movement and as a Primitive Methodist lay preacher. He retired from his trade union posts in 1911.

Its sole purpose is to verify eligibility for the veterans online shopping benefit, a 2017 expansion of online military exchange shopping privileges to honorably discharged Veterans. History =Veterans online shopping benefit= On June 14, 2012, the Army & Air Force Exchange Service appointed its first civilian director/CEO, Tom Shull, a West Point graduate who previously served as CEO of Wise Foods, Hanover Direct, Barney's New York and Meridian Ventures. On May 8, 2014, Shull drafted a memorandum to the then-acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Jessica Wright proposing a plan to allow honorably discharged veterans to shop online at military exchanges. Shull presented a business case for the expanded benefit to the Department of Defense's Executive Resale Board in August 2014, emphasizing the plan's potential to generate more than $100 million for installation quality-of-life programs within three years. The Executive Resale Board voted unanimously to recommend the proposal in August 2016. On Jan. 13 2017, the Department of Defense announced that all honorably discharged veterans would be eligible to shop tax-free online military exchanges starting Nov. 11, 2017. The expanded benefit is expected to make online exchange privileges available to all honorably discharged veterans from a total of approximately 21 million veterans. =Website launch= The military exchanges announced the launch of VetVerify.org on June 5, 2017, adding that some veterans would be selected to shop ahead of the Nov. 11 launch as beta testers. By July 26, VetVerify.org had received 260,000 applications and verified 120,000 veterans. Military exchanges annually distribute more than $300 million in earnings back to the military community in the form of dividends to quality-of-life programs such as Morale, Welfare and Recreation. Allowing veterans to shop online could provide tens of millions in additional contributions to such programs. Verification Process To register, users must provide their first and last names, the last four digits of their social security number, date of birth, email address and branch of service. VetVerify.org then confirms the user's eligibility using Defense Manpower Data Center data, the most comprehensive collection of data on veterans. If an applicant cannot be immediately verified, they may submit a digital copy of their discharge paperwork to be reviewed for eligibility. Celebrity Endorsements In July 2017, former United States Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell appeared in a 30-second Facebook video alongside Mark Wahlberg, who played Luttrell in \\"Lone Survivor,\\" urging veterans to register at VetVerify.org. The video went viral, causing a spike in traffic to the site and driving a 60 percent increase in number of successful verifications on the weekend of the video's launch. The video has received more than 1.9 million views as of August 2017. Other celebrities have appeared in videos promoting VetVerify.org, including Richard Petty, Rob Gronkowski, Noah Galloway, Richard Rawlings, Montel Williams and Army Ranger Kris Paronto.

It was discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751-1752 from South Africa, and catalogued it as Lacaille I.7.Hartmut Frommert, Christine Kronberg NGC 5281 seds.org NGC 5281 is located three and a quarter degrees southwest of Beta Centauri. Under dark skies, it is bright enough to be spotted with naked eye, appearing as a 6th magnitude star.  Characteristics  The four bright stars of the cluster form a striking line as seen from Earth, however the cluster is sparsely populated. The brightest member of the cluster is of mag 6.61. The next two brighter stars have evolved away from main sequence. The turn-off mass of the cluster is estimated to be at 5.6 . Based on the colour magnitude diagram, the age of the cluster is estimated to be 45 myrs. The tidal radius of the cluster is 5.5 - 8.4 parsecs (18 - 27 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5281, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. The radius of the core of the cluster is about 4.3 light years, nearly the same as the distance between the Sun and the closest star system, Alpha Centauri. Within the angular radius of the cluster there are 371 probable members. One of the members of the cluster is HD 119682 (mag. 7.97, spectral type B0.5V), a Be star notable for its X-rays emission. It has been categorised by Moffat & Vogt (1973), Mermilliod (1982), and Safi-Harb (2007), as a blue straggler, and it has also been categorised as a gamma Cassiopeiae analog. HD 119682 has been identified as the visual counterpart of the X-ray source 1WGA J1346.5-6255, found within the radio lobes of the supernova remnant G309.2-00.6, located 4 ¬± 2 kpc away, with which it is unrelated. The light curve of the star in X-rays shows significant brightness variations within hours, however, the spectral distribution appears rather stable.

History Laurie Brokenshire was born on 20 October 1952 at 40 Amherst Road, Plymouth to Martin Brokenshire (1926‚Äì97) and his wife Pansy Jeanne (n√©e Hewitt; 1930-2007). He had a younger sister, Lynnette, and a younger brother, Adrian. His early hobby interests included chess, puzzles and magic. In 1964, he joined Devonport High School for Boys. In 1966, following the completion of his father's naval career, the family moved to Slough, where he joined Slough Grammar School, now called Upton Court Grammar School. He played for Buckinghamshire junior hockey. In later years, he managed the School chess club and, jointly, the School bridge club (which notably beat Eton College on one occasion). After school, he went to the University of Exeter (1971‚Äì74) where he took a BSc (Hons) degree in Mathematics, graduating in 1974. He played hockey and table tennis for University teams, and turned down the offer of a place in the bridge team. During this time, he beat his Head of Department, Professor David Rees, at both chess and, at Rees' insistence, Go. He took a PGCE at Exeter in 1975. =Royal Navy= In 1975, Brokenshire joined the Royal Navy as an Instructor - his father's career and service branch. After training at Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and subsequent postings to Dartmouth, Westminster, Plymouth, Portsmouth and Faslane, his career developed as a submariner and later as a senior Royal Navy officer. His success on the Greenwich course encouraged him to take a second degree, this time an Open University BA degree in Science. As 2007 Royal Navy chess champion and President of the Combined Services Chess Association, he represented the RN at the NATO Chess championship several years running, creating for himself an international standing in military chess. In later years, he commanded two shore establishments: firstly Northwood (1992‚Äì93) and later, as a Commodore, HMS Raleigh (2000‚Äì03) - the Navy's main Torpoint training centre - the family lived at nearby Trevol House. In 2003, on the occasion of his retirement, the family moved back to their house in Stubbington, Hampshire, and he was awarded a CBE for services rendered. =Sea Cadets= Following the end of his Royal Navy career, Brokenshire was appointed as Commodore of the UK Sea Cadet Corps. As such, he toured and inspected as many local associations as he could. On one such visit to Essex, he met his 6th cousin and fellow Exeter-graduate, the local MP James Brokenshire, and remained in regular contact. Magic Brokenshire was accepted into the Inner Magic Circle, and became an occasional professional / semi-professional magic performer. He was regularly used by his charities as a high-profile magic performer, in particular, performing table magic for members of the British Royal Family at various charitable occasions. He was always able to find a suitable magic trick for any occasion, particularly for young children, and carried his \\"magic\\" bag with him at all times. Puzzling In his spare time, Brokenshire became a world-class puzzling expert. Specialising in combinatorial and mechanical puzzles, he was in regular contact with puzzle researchers, designers, makers, enthusiasts and other specialists around the world. He introduced some novel solutions to existing problems, and was exceptionally quick to solve new problems. He was retained by a number of major puzzles companies as a consultant to offer an assessment on the viability of proposed puzzles. His personal puzzle collection was considered among the largest in the UK. He organised and held G4G Celebration of Mind meetings at his house. Historically, the famous puzzlist Henry Dudeney (1857-1930) announced a particularly-difficult chessboard (aka checkerboard) dissection puzzle in one of his first puzzle books and asserted that it had a \\"unique\\", or single, solution. Numerous people tried and failed to solve this puzzle, such that it became famously known as the \\"Dudeney Problem\\". Some years later, true to his word, Dudeney gave his \\"unique\\" solution in one of his last puzzle books. Later still, Sam Loyd (1841-1911) asserted his own abilities, and disproved Dudeney's assertion of uniqueness, by giving a second \\"unique\\" solution in one of his puzzle books. This same problem then became known as the \\"Dudeney-Loyd problem\\". Today, that same problem is classified as the \\"Dudeney-Loyd-Brokenshire problem\\" when Brokenshire found the third \\"unique\\" solution, after a gap of about 100 years. Substantial further analysis has shown that there were only ever three solutions, despite Dudeney's original claim. For this solution and others, Laurie Brokenshire is present in the puzzling record books, and is in illustrious company. =International Puzzle Parties= Brokenshire and his wife, Ethel, camped and bicycled the length of several continents to reach successive invitation-only annual International Puzzle Parties (IPP). \\\\- login required after menu Taking two bicycles, two panniers and a magic bag, they cycled and either wild-camped or stayed with friends along the Eastern coast of Australia, around the North Island of New Zealand, Japan, Europe and Scandinavia, and various routes across the US from Alaska to Washington, D.C.. On one trip, Ethel automatically swatted a bear, which was nuzzling the side of their tent in the early hours of the morning, without suffering any ill effects. On another, he contracted viral encephalitis from an infected tick bite. He organised and hosted the 2014 IPP34 puzzle party, based at a hotel near Heathrow. Fostering From 1994, Brokenshire and his wife, Ethel, undertook fostering in Hampshire. They successfully fostered over 70 children in 22 years. Religion Brokenshire was a member of the Navy Christian Fellowship and was a pillar of his local Church. Sea swimming In 1986, Brokenshire swam the English Channel. Subsequently, his son Matthew has also swum the Channel - making them one of the few father and son pairs who have achieved this feat. In later years, Brokenshire enjoyed sea swimming throughout the year with his local \\"Shack Sharks\\" club, and represented his locality at cold water swimming competitions up and down the country. Personal life Brokenshire married Ethel Isobel McMahon (born 1954) (WRNS) on 29 March 1980 at Clonallon Parish Church, with 4 children: * Sarah Isobel Brokenshire (1981-) * Matthew William Brokenshire (1983-) * Rachel Ellen Brokenshire (1985-) * Phillip Laurence Brokenshire (1987-) and several grandchildren. He was a member of Mensa. =Illness and death= In early 2016, Brokenshire was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, which had overtaken his father some 20 years earlier. His response was immediate and typically selfless - his family undertook a 30-mile crowd-sponsored sea swim off Plymouth in aid of various cancer charities, raising the targeted ¬£30,000 in under three weeks, and in excess of ¬£45,000 overall. He had a protracted 18-month fight against his cancer, enabling him to see and interact with his new grandchildren. On 4 August 2017, he died at home surrounded by all his family.

He became a lawyer, opened his own law practice, and later became an entrepreneur. He had an interest in the New Castle Manufacturing Company, which built a foundry to help manufacture locomotives for the New Castle and Frenchtown Turnpike and Railroad Company. He later became president of the railroad, counting among his partners Charles I. du Pont. Some of the right-of-way pioneered by the railroad is still in use by Norfolk Southern. In 1849, he became president of the New Castle branch of the Farmers' Bank of Delaware. In 1853, he became president of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company. Gray was a Whig delegate from New Castle County to the 1853 convention that sought and failed to enact a fourth constitution for the state of Delaware. He bought a house built for Gunning Bedford Jr., a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787. In this house was subsequently born a son, George Gray (1840‚Äì1925), who grew up to be a lawyer, Attorney General of Delaware, and U.S. Senator. George eventually gave his father's name to his own son; this second Andrew C. Gray would also serve as Attorney General of Delaware, from 1909 to 1913.

Main characters ; : :Sieg is the main male protagonist of Fate/Apocrypha. He is introduced as a nameless homunculus, one of many created by Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia to serve the unified clan. Possessing unexpected high-quality Magic Circuits, Sieg escapes his confinement and is rescued by Astolfo. When hunted by Gordes and Siegfried, Sieg is mortally wounded, and Siegfried gives him his heart to revive him. Though given an opportunity to live a new life by Jeanne, Sieg becomes compelled to grant freedom to his fellow homunculi, joining the Greater Grail War, and becoming Astolfo's master after Celenike Icecolle Yggdmillennia is killed. Through Siegfried's heart, Sieg can temporarily transform into the Germanic hero, acquiring his powers and Noble Phantasm. He further gains the ability to use the powers of Frankenstein's Monster. He develops a romantic bond with Jeanne. At the end of the story, Sieg and Astolfo win the Grail War, Sieg wishing to transform into the dragon Fafnir and carries the Greater Grail to the reverse side of the world, to prevent Shirou Amakusa's own wish from happening. He remains there for some time before reuniting with Jeanne. ; - : :Ruler is the main female protagonist of Fate/Apocrypha. She is the spirit of the historical figure Jeanne d'Arc, occupying the body of an ordinary French high school student called , whose appearance is very similar to Jeanne. Laeticia mostly remains within Jeanne's subconscious, but occasionally interacts with the other characters. At first, Jeanne is unaware why she was summoned as Ruler, beyond ensuring the Greater Grail War occurs fairly. But, she learns her true purpose is to stop Shirou Amakusa from hijacking the war to fulfil his own wish. Jeanne aids Sieg in starting a new life, but has visions that he will join the war, despite her attempts to prevent it. She falls in love with Sieg, but at first assumes said feelings belong to Laeticia. Jeanne is a courageous, compassionate, humble, but honest character, disbelieving that she is a holy maiden as she was canonized as. As Ruler-class, Jeanne can command the other Servants using Command Spells. Jeanne has two Noble Phantasms, \\"Luminosit√© Eternelle\\", her military flag, which can repel enemy attacks; and \\"La Pucelle\\", which manifests the flames that killed her. Jeanne is defeated in the final chapters of Fate/Apocrypha, whilst Laeticia is spared. Her spirit later reunites with Sieg in the reverse side of the world. Black faction =Servants= ; - : : Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia's Servant. Siegfried, known as the Dragon-Blooded Knight, appeared in the Nibelungenlied, as a selfless heroic figure who killed the dragon Fafnir, bathing in his blood and becoming immortal. But, a lone linden tree leaf cothered a part of his back, leaving a spot of vulnerability, leading to Siegfried's later death. Summoned by Gordes, Siegfried is forbidden from speaking his true name to others, and silently obeys Gordes' orders. When Sieg is mortally wounded by his master, Siegfried removes his own heart and gives it to the homunculus, becoming the first Servant to die in the Greater Grail War. But, Sieg is able to transform into Siegfried for a limited time. He has two Noble Phantasms, his sword \\"Balmung\\", which emits energy waves, and \\"Armor of Fafnir\\", making his skin invulnerable to most attacks. ; - : : Fiore Forvedge Yggdmillennia's Servant. The Greek hero and centaur, Chiron appears as a human to hide his identity. Calm, wise, and loyal, Chiron serves Fiore well, but convinces Caules that his sister does not have the fortitude to be a mage. Chiron's wish is to regain his lost immortality. Achilles, who is Rider of Red, was one of Chiron's pupils, and they share a combative rivalry throughout the story. Chiron and Astolfo remain the final Servants of Black to participate in the battle against the Red faction, Chiron defeated in a duel with Achilles, but uses his Noble Phantasm, \\"Antares Snipe\\", to remove Achilles' own immortality with a celestial arrow. ; - : : Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia's servant and leader of the Servants of Black. A Romanian warlord and hero, Vlad wishes to rebuild his kingdom, but to erase the stain that Count Dracula has made upon his family's reputation. He is portrayed as an intimidating, charismatic, yet modest leader, disliking Darnic's excessive flattery. Due to being in his old domain, Vlad's abilities are boosted, but he weakens once he moves the battle to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Vlad has two Noble Phantasms, \\"Kazikli Bay\\", which creates endless stakes to impale enemies, and \\"Legend of Dracula\\", which transforms him into the mythical vampire he despises. Vlad refuses to acknowledge or use his second Noble Phantasm, but is forced to by Darnic, who then imprints his soul onto Vlad, turning them into a vicious monster obsessed with acquiring the Greater Grail. Both are slain by Shirou Amakusa using holy lances. ; - : : Celenike Icecolle Yggdmillennia's Servant and one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne. An androgynous, eternally upbeat and optimistic character, Astolfo lacks any sense of caution, related to his mythical flight to the Moon. Carefree, merry, self-confident and courageous, Astolfo finds his initial master, Celenike, to be an unpleasant character, and soon befriends Sieg. He becomes Sieg's Servant after Celenike is decapitated by Mordred. Astolfo possesses four Noble Phantasms, including a hippogriff which serves as his mount, \\"La Black Luna\\", a large hunting horn that emits sound blasts, the golden lance \\"Trap of Argalia\\", and \\"Casseur de Logistille\\", a spellbook that allows Astolfo to overcome most forms of magecraft. Astolfo becomes the last surviving Servant in the war, tasked by Sieg to help out the world as he sees fit. ; - : : Caules Forvedge Yggdmillennia's Servant. Frankenstein's Monster is depicted as an actual person in Fate/Apocrypha, rather than as a fictional one. Appearing as a female creation of Victor Frankenstein, she was rejected by her maker, wishing for him to create a mate for her. As Caules' Servant, she rejects her true name, preferring to be addressed as \\"Berserker\\", often responds through grunts, but is capable of speech. She is a gentle soul, prone to picking flowers, but has an aggressive, dog-like side to her. Her wish for the Holy Grail is to grant her a mate. She has two Noble Phantasms, \\"Bridal Chest\\", her electrical war hammer, and \\"Blasted Tree\\", a powerful surge of lightning that will cause her to self-destruct. Berserker attempts to kill Mordred with Blasted Tree, but is destroyed, channelling part of her essence into Sieg, allowing him to use her abilities during his battle with Shirou Amakusa. ; - : : Roche Frain Yggdmillennia's Servant. A 12th century philosopher who, in the Fate universe, founded the thaumaturgical system Kabbalah, Avicebron is the second Servant summoned by Yggdmillennia. Due to his hatred for humanity, Avicebron sports a featureless mask, claiming he finds looking people in the eye painful. He, along with Roche, build large golems for Yggdmillennia. His Noble Phantasm, \\"Golem Keter Malkuth\\", is a gigantic sentient golem, that requires a terminal core to power. The terminal core is actually a human host with receptive Magical Circuits. Avicebron sides with Shirou Amakusa, sacrificing Roche to activate his Noble Phantasm. Chiron kills Avicebron, who further bonds with his Golem Keter Malkuth, using its power in an attempt to create Eden on Earth, but it is destroyed by Sieg and Mordred. ; - : : Reika Rikudou's Servant. Originally summoned by Hyouma Sagara, Jack kills him when he tries to sacrifice Reika during the summoning, Reika becoming her master. Jack appears as a young girl, created from an amalgamation of aborted children, abandoned by prostitutes from Whitechapel, London. She addresses Reika as her mother, and together, they murder mages across Romania, Jack eating their hearts to replenish her lifeforce. Due to the nature of her identity, those who encounter Jack forget what she looks like. She has two Noble Phantasms, one emitting an ominous, toxic fog, and the other, \\"Maria the Ripper\\", allowing her to replicate her infamous murders, and can materialise her knives within female victims. After Reika is shot dead by Atalante, Jack transports herself, Sieg, Jeanne, and Atalante to an illusion of Victorian London to gain sympathy from the other characters. Jeanne, knowing her true nature, instead convinces Jack's collective souls to pass on to the afterlife. =Masters= ; : : Lancer of Black's Master and the leader of the Yggdmillennia group. Due to the impurity of his family's bloodline, Darnic was ostracized by much of the mage community. He participated in the Third Holy Grail War, with Fionn mac Cumhaill as his Lancer-class Servant, working with Nazi Germany to seize the Holy Grail. But, he betrayed his allies and spirited the Greater Grail away to his fortress in Romania, waiting sixty years to participate in another Holy Grail War, and have his wish granted to ensure the survival of his clan. Darnic maintained his youth by researching eternal life, and is said to have devoured an infant soul. Darnic meets his end during the early stages of the war, fusing himself with Vlad, becoming a vampire, and is slain by Shirou Amakusa. ; : : Saber of Black's Master and a First-Class Alchemist. A pompous, proud, overweight, and easily offended man, Gordes created the many homunculi that serve Yggdmillennia. His high-handed command of Siegfried causes him to waste two of his Command Spells early on, and is left without a Servant when Siegfried kills himself to save Sieg. Gordes survives the war, encouraged to treat his homunculi as individuals, aided by his assistant Toole. ; : : Archer of Black's Master, Caules' older sister, and a magus with great talent, who is well versed in spiritual evocation and human engineering. She has been confined to a wheelchair since birth and wishes to have the Grail to heal her legs while keeping her magus abilities, something that would not be possible otherwise. Fiore uses Bronze Link Manipulators, appearing as four mechanical, weaponized limbs, allowing her to walk around and scale buildings. She is a sweet, kind, compassionate, but whilst putting up a hard exterior, lacks the often cold demeanour needed to be a mage. Caules and Chiron eventually convince her to retire as a mage, due to her inability to take a life. She transfers her Magic Circuits to Caules, making him head of Yggdmillennia. In the epilogue of the story, Fiore is seen undergoing physical therapy to learn how to walk. ; : : Berserker of Black's Master and a magus who can summon low-class spirits, insects and animals. He is Fiore's younger brother, being devoted to her. Though positioned as a \\"spare\\" to her, he possesses minimum magic abilities. Lacking a personal wish for the Holy Grail, he concludes that he would spend his wish on Fiore. He has a close partnership with Berserker, treating her with respect and trust, and is reluctant to allow her to use her destructive Noble Phantasm. He convinces Fiore to step down as both a mage and as head of Yggdmillennia, and has her Magic Circuits transferred to him. He, Fiore, and Gordes are the only survivors of Yggdmillennia. ; : : Rider of Black's Master and a dark arts practitioner who has sadistic and deviant sexual tastes. She summoned Astolfo purely to torture and violate him, though he is merely bored by her desires. Due to Astolfo's increasing concern towards Sieg, Celenike vows to kill Sieg, confronting them after they battle Mordred. Celenike uses her Command Spells to have Astolfo murder Sieg, but is decapitated by a disgusted Mordred. ; : : Caster of Black's Master and a prodigy magus who creates golems with his Servant, who he regards as his teacher. Obsessed with his practice, Roche prefers golems to people, regarding them with little concern. He idolises Avicebron, hoping they can create his own golems together. However, Aviceborn betrays Roche, using him as the terminal core for his Noble Phantasm. ; : : Assassin of Black's Master and a prostitute with no talent as a magus so she has Jack devour violent criminals to supply her with energy. Sagara Hyouma attempted to sacrifice her to summon Assassin of Black, but Jack instead killed him, and identified Reika as her master and parental figure. Reika is kind and motherly towards Jack, allowing her to kill criminals and mages to devour their hearts. She is shot in the chest by Atalante, using her Command Spells to make sure Jack is spared. Red faction =Servants= ; - : : Kairi Shishigou's Servant. Known as the Knight of Treachery, she is the homunculus daughter of Artoria Pendragon and her sister Morgan le Fay. Mordred appeared in Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero in flashbacks, but her face was not revealed til Apocrypha. She has a good relationship with her Master and wishes to use the grail to challenge her right to be King of Camelot and have her father's recognition as her heir. Mordred was slain by Artoria, but not before she mortally wounded her father, leading to Artoria's ascension as a Heroic Spirit. Mordred is prideful, haughty, confident, and dislikes being addressed as a woman. She has two Noble Phantasm, her armor \\"Secret of Pedigree\\", which hides her identity from detection, and her magic sword \\"Clarent Blood Arthur\\", which fires destructive energy blasts. Mordred and Shishigou side with the surviving Yggdmillennia Masters and Jeanne to defeat Shirou Amakusa, the duo fighting and defeating Semiramis, but Mordred fades away after Shishigou dies from his wounds. ; - : : Originally Rottweil Berzinsky's Servant. The Greek heroine and archer raised by Artemis, Atalanta sports animal ears and a tail in reference to her legends. Her wish for the Holy Grail is for all children in the world to be loved and protected. Atalanta and Achilles work together throughout the light novels, with Achilles addressing her as \\"Missy\\". When Jeanne kills Jack the Ripper, Atalanta angrily vows revenge upon her, convinced Jack could have been saved. Her attempt to murder Jeanne is interrupted by Achilles, and both defeat one another. Before dying, Atalanta admits her dream was unrealistic, but still wished to pursue it. She has two Noble Phantasms, \\"Phoebus Catastrophe\\", unleashing a volley of divine arrows blessed by Artemis and Apollo, and \\"Agrius Metamorphosis\\", the pelt of the Calydonian Boar, which gives Atalanta a monstrous appearance, but boosts her physical capabilities. ; - : : Originally Feend vor Sembren's Servant and later Shirou Kotomine's Servant. An Indian demigod appearing in the Mahabharata, famous for his indomitable will and archery, but here he was summoned as a Lancer. Karna appears as a white-haired, pale-skinned man wearing golden armour. Though portrayed as a cold and detached, Karna displays loyalty to his Master, Feend vor Sembren, who he never meets in the story, and obeys Shirou Amakusa's orders without question. He is first assigned to assassinate Jeanne, but is stopped by Siegfried, both promising to have a lengthier duel at another time. During the final battle, Karna asks Caules to remove the other Masters of Red from the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Karna and Sieg have a duel, Astolfo using Achilles' Noble Phantasm to assist in Karna's defeat. Upon defeat, Karna expresses no regrets or grudges towards Sieg, Astolfo praising him for keeping his pride as a Servant. Karna has three Noble Phantasms, \\"Kavacha and Kundala\\", his nigh invulnerable armour and earring, the explosive projectile \\"Brahmastra Kundala\\", and the holy spear \\"Vasavi Shakti\\", which draws its power from the Sun. ; - : : Originally Cabik Pentel's Servant and later Shirou Kotomine's Servant. The immortal Greek hero, Achilles was taught how to be a hero by Chiron, both reuniting on the battlefield as enemies. He is portrayed as a heroic, confident, and noble character. After defeating Chiron in a fist fight, Achilles loses his immortality when Chiron's Noble Phantasm strikes his infamous heel. After giving one of his Noble Phantasms to Astolfo, Achilles battles Atalanta, and both die of mortal wounds. Achilles has multiple Noble Phantasms, including his chariot \\"Troias Trag≈çidia\\", and the shield \\"Akhilleus Kosmos\\", summoning a miniature replica of a colosseum that blocks attacks. ; - : : Originally Jean Rum's servant and later Shirou Kotomine's Servant. An eccentric, theatrical, but manipulating Servant, William Shakespeare bamboozles his fellows Servants with his dramatic phrasing and habitually quotes his own plays. He takes on a supporting role in the Greater Grail War intentionally, so he can write a play about the other Servants and Masters, though Shirou Amakusa forbids him from writing a tragedy about Shirou's efforts. He becomes the last surviving Servant of Red, witnessing Sieg removing the Greater Grail, and expresses regret that he could not be the hero of his own tale. His Noble Phantasm, \\"First Folio\\", allows him to create elaborate illusions based on an individual's past. ; - : : Shirou Kotomine's Servant. She uses poison as her weapon but also can double as a Caster-class, due to her magical prowess. She is very loyal to Shirou, his co- conspirator in his plans, and is implied to be in love with him too. She is extravagantly dressed, commanding, dominating, but prone to anger if defied or questioned. Semiramis has two Noble Phantasms, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which serves as the Servants of Red's headquarters, and \\"Sikera U≈°um\\", allowing her to turn an environment poisonous. Though defeated by Mordred, Semiramis lives long enough to grant Shirou a painless death via a poisoned kiss. ; - : : Originally Diemlet Pentel's Servant and later Caster of Black's Servant when he is captured. He is known as the Spirit of Rebellion and takes great joy in battle, a giant of a man who rebels and fights against all forms of \\"oppression\\". Shakespeare sends Spartacus off to attack Yggdmillennia, but he is captured by the enemy, brainwashed into becoming Avicebron's Servant. His Noble Phantasm is \\"Crying Warmonger\\", which increases his power the more damage he receives. =Masters= ; : : Assassin of Red's Master, Shirou Kotomine represents the Holy Church in the war, and is meant to oversee the battles. In reality, he is actually ', a Japanese Christian who lead the Shimabara Rebellion in the Edo period. He was summoned by the Einzberns as a Ruler-class servant during the Third Holy Grail War. Shirou is a kind, polite, and virtuous character, plotting to use the Greater Grail's powers to turn humanity into beings of conscience, in perpetual states of eternal bliss, and free from both sin and death. He manipulates the other Masters of Red, save Shishigou, to surrender their Command Spells to him, allowing him to command their Servants. The Red faction use the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to steal the Greater Grail, Shirou using it to activate his wish. However, the actions of Sieg lead to Shirou's defeat, and he is granted a quick, painless death by Semiramis via a poisoned kiss. Sieg asks the Holy Grail to grant his own wish to become Fafnir and carry the Grail to the Reverse Side of the World, canceling out Shirou's wish. Still a Heroic Spirit, Shirou possesses Noble Phantasms, one being a replica of his katana, recreated by Shakespeare. His arms allow him to perform miracles and use all types of magic. ; : : Saber of Red's Master. A freelance necromancer hired by the Clock Tower to act as the seventh Master of Red, Shishigou is a confident, pragmatic man. At some point in the past, Shishigou's ancestor made a deal to acquire the family's necromancing trait, but his bloodline were marked with a curse, making it difficult to reproduce. Shishigou adopted a daughter, but his attempt to transfer his Magic Crest to her led to her death. He hopes to use the Holy Grail to undo her death. He gets on well with Mordred, the duo acting independently from the rest of the Red faction. They side with Ruler, Sieg, and the remaining Black Masters to defeat Shirou Amakusa after he is revealed to be manipulating the war for his own benefit. Shishigou and Mordred defeat Semiramis, but Shishigou succumbs to wounds he receives in the battle. ; : She is the original Master of Caster of Red and is highly skilled in wind element magic. ; : He is the original Master of Archer of Red and is a magus-for-hire. ; : He is the original Master of Lancer of Red and a professor at the clocktower. ; : He is the original Master of Rider of Red and is the younger Gum Brother. ; : He is the original Master of Berserker of Red and is the older Gum Brother.

Chicago Talking Machine Co. Catalog, ca. 1898 The company was founded in 1893 by Leon Douglass and Henry Babson, with financing from Charles Dickinson. It first sold phonographs and supplies manufactured by the Edison Phonograph Works, but soon began manufacturing their own cylinder records and marketing a spring motor designed by Edward H. Amet. After the collapse of the North American Phonograph Company in 1894, the company became a major independent distributor of phonograph records made by the Columbia Phonograph Company, the United States Phonograph Company, and Edison's National Phonograph Company, in addition to those of their own manufacture. Silas Leachman, a Chicago-based recording pioneer who specialized in coon songs, was their most popular artist. By the first issue of the trade magazine Phonoscope in November 1896, the company was in a prominent enough position in the industry to buy the first full-page advertisement of the issue. In 1898, Leon Douglass, who had previously invented a coin-operation mechanism and phonograph record duplication process, invented the \\"Polyphone\\", which added a second horn and reproducer to the phonograph or graphophone to increase its loudness (and, supposedly, its fidelity). He formed The Polyphone Company at the same address as The Talking Machine Company (having dropped the \\"Chicago\\" prefix) to market the device and would focus on this aspect of the business until joining Eldridge Johnson in 1900 to begin working on what would become the Victor Talking Machine Company. From 1903 until 1905, Henry Babson would manage the operation with his brothers Fred and Gus, and develop a mail- order operation and a national distribution network. In 1906, the company was purchased by Arthur D. Geissler, son of the general manager of the Victor Talking Machine Company and reconfigured to wholesale Victor products, while the Babson Brothers formed a new company to sell and distribute Edison products.

The Baroque-style main building and two buildings from the beginning of the 19th century have been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency. History =Valbyg√•rd= In the Middle Ages, Juellinge was called Valbygaard. The name indicates that it was then located in a village named Valby. It was a fairly insignificant manor that frequently changed hands and was rarely used as a residence by its owners. It is first mentioned in 1387 as part of the estate after Jakob Olufsen Lunge. He had been one of the most trusted advisors of Margrethe I. Jacobsen Lunge had no sons and Valbygaard was therefore passed on to his daughters Sophie and Regitze Lunge and later to their husbands Jens Andersen and Anders Nielsen Panter. Gunde Rosencrantz The next owner may have been Jep Knudsen, although his ownership is not confirmed until 1419. He was a member of the noble family Lille which resided on the neighbouring estate An√∏je (En√∏je). His son, Knud Jepsen, sold Valbygaard to Johan Bj√∏rnsen Bj√∏rn. Valbygaard was then passed on to his son-in-law, Christoffer Lindenov. After his death, Valbygaard was sold to Elsebe Svave. In 1606, he gave it to his daughter Ellen Juel. She brought it into possession of her later husband, Jens Bille. Admiral Herluf Daa acquired the estate sometime before 1723. He died in 1630 and his widow Karen Grubbe then married Jens Bille's son Vincens Bille om 1631. He sold Valbygaard to Gunde Rosenkrantz in 1653. Rosenkrantz lived at Valbygaard with his family until 1657 but finally had to sell it due to economic problems. He fell out of favour at the court and fled to Sweden in 1664. Jens Juel =The Juel family= The next owner was Ida Lunge. Her daughter Vibeke Lunge inherited Valbygaard in 1671 and married Jens Juel the following year. He was one of the most influential advisors of Christian V. He changed its name into Juellinge and turned it into a barony in 1782. This meant that it could no longer be sold or divided between heirs. He also embarked on a major renovation of the buildings which culminated with the construction of a new main building in 1675. Juel had no sons to succeed him as Baron of Juellinge and the estate was therefore passed on to his son-in-law Frederik Vind in 1700 but he died just two years later. His son, Jens Juel- Vind, was awarded the title of friherre (baron) under the name Juel-Vind in 1708. =Later history= Juellinge in c. 1840 In 1719, Juel-Vind ceded Juellinge to Frederick IV in exchange for Halsted Priory on Lolland. Holsted Priory was renamed Juellinge when the title Baron of Juellinge was restored for Juel-Vind in 1721. The old Juellinge estate on Stevns was initially included in the new Rryggev√¶lde Cacalry Fistrict. In 1735, Frederick IV ceded Juellinge to Frederik Danneskiold-Sams√∏e in exchange for another estate. In 1750, he sold it to Adam Gottlob Moltke who merged it into the countship of Bregentved. Juellinge was part of Bregentved until 1922 when the countship was dissolved as a result of lensafl√∏sningsloven. The next owner was Christian Moltke. Later owners include A/S Premier Is, an ice cream manufacturer. The company acquired the estate in 1848. Architecture The Baroque-style main building stands in two-stories towards the courtyard and three stories towards the garden and was originally surrounded by moats. It is built in granite ashlars with a few chalk ashlars. The side that faces the courtyard building stands in a blank wall with smooth finishing of the ashlars and has a strongly projecting median risalit with a portal flanked by pilasters. The three other sides of the building have a more rough finishing of the ashlars and are white-washed. The well-preserved red Mansard roof is topped by three chimneys. The symmetrical floor plan is centered on a large vestibule on the ground floor. The main entrance was adapted in 1901 and the building was refurbished in 1940. To the north of the main building is a complex of farm buildings (ladeg√•rden) which was originally centered on a rectangular courtyard but has seen many alterations over the years. The site also comprises two buildings from the beginning of the 19th century, one of them with exposed timber framing and two gateways, the other a brick building, and both with half- hipped red, tile roofs. The main building and the two buildings from the beginning of the 19th century have been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency.

Biographical details  Ingrid Felipe grew up in Rum and, from 1984 to 1988, went to the Volksschule there. From 1988 to 1992, she visited the Hauptschule Kettenbr√ºcke Innsbruck. In 1997, she graduated from the Handelsakademie in Innsbruck. Subsequently, Ingrid Felipe began to study business administration at the University of Innsbruck. Besides this, she was also involved in handball in Innsbruck, initially as an active player, later also as a functionary or project manager for various events. From 1994 onwards, she also worked as a waitress and catering employee, and from 2002 onwards, as an assistant to the management in restaurants, and continued this activity after gaining her degree in 2003. From 2006 to 2012, Ingrid Felipe worked as an office manager at the Parson architectural office.Tiroler LandtagsIngrid Felipe auf den Webseiten der Gr√ºnen Tirol  Political career  It was already evident during her school years that Felipe would pursue a political career. When she was in elementary school, she and her sister got the church to agree that in their parish of Rum, they were allowed to act as servers in the church, even though they were girls. In 1994 and 1995, she was elected as a school spokesperson for the Handelsakademie and Handelsschule Innsbruck. In 1995, she became a teacher of higher education in Tyrol. She began her partisan political career in 2005 as a financial representative of the Greens in Tyrol, which she held until January 2010. In addition, she was a substitute delegate of the Enlarged Federal Executive Committee (EBV) of the Greens from 2007 to 2009. From 2009 to 2013, Ingrid Felipe was Regional Spokesperson for the Green Alternative Tyrol and since March 13, 2010, also as a member of the city council of Rum. In February 2009, June 2010 and March 2012, among other things, she was the substitute of the provincial representatives Christine Baur and Maria Scheiber in meetings of the Tyrolean Landtag. Ingrid Felipe first attracted a wide public attention by protesting against the expulsion of the then 20-year-old, Lamin Jaithe, who had been living in Tyrol for years, in May 2011. On May 1, 2012, she was elected to the Landtag to replace the outgoing member of the Landtag Maria Scheiber. On 24 May 2013, she was elected Provincial Minister for the following departments by the Tyrolean Landtag: * Environmental and climate protection (without prejudice to the competence of the other members of the regional governments in the relevant areas); Environmental testing; * Nature Conservation; Mountain Rescue; * Waste management; All legal proceedings relating to waste disposal facilities; Chemicals legislation; * European transport policy; Legal and technical matters relating to motor vehicles and railways, aeronautics and shipping; Road Administration Law; Road Police; * Road services; Transport connections, including the shareholdings of the Land in Verkehrsverbund Tirol GmbH; * Sustainability coordination. In addition, she was elected as the second deputy of the Landeshauptmann, and is therefore the first member of the Tyrolean Greens and the second woman in this office. On 19 February 2016, she was elected deputy party chairman of the Austrian Greens. She is thus the successor of Maria Vassilakou, who previously resigned. At the extraordinary congress in Linz, she was officially elected on June 25, 2017, with 93.7% of the votes. However, she did not lead her party as the top candidate in the national elections. Ulrike Lunacek, who was also confirmed in Linz with 96.5%, was the leading candidate instead. After the National Council election, which ended in October 2017 with her party being voted out from the parliament, Felipe resigned from her function as chairwoman of the Greens two days later.

Discrete complementary JFETs come in separate P and N-channel packages. Dual discrete complementary JFETS house two N-channel JFETs in one monolithic unit and two P-channel units in another monolithic unit. Because they are built on the same die, dual N-Channel JFETs have nearly equivalent or matched electrical characteristics. The same can be said for the dual P-Channel JFETs. Although, complementary P and N-Channels are built with the same process technology, because of basic differences between the construction of P and N channel devices, electrical specifications such as mobility and transconductance are slightly different for the P and N-Channel JFETs.‚ÄúDifference between n-channel FET vs p-channel FET‚Äù RF Wireless World, 2012W. Alan Davis, Krishna Agarwal (2001) , ‚ÄúRadio Frequency Circuit Design‚Äù, Appendix F, Wiley The complementary and matched nature of the dual N-channel and dual P-channel JFETs is fundamental to the building of many analog circuits, most notably amplifiers. Specifically, complementary amplifier topologies are based on a number of complementary matched JFET pairs. As one example, a fully complementary amplifier will use matched N and P-channel JFETs for the differential amplifier front end. A dual complementary differential amplifier uses two complementary JFETs. This includes a matched N-Channel dual LKS489 JFET and a dual matched P-Channel LSJ689. JFET. The bias and offset network can be constructed from different arrangements of resistors and current sources. Other complementary and matched JFET blocks within complementary amplifiers include stacked and folded cascode blocks and level translators (level shifters).Borbely, Erno (October 7, 2015) \\"All-FET Line Amp\\"‚ÄúLSK489 Application Note‚Äù Linear Integrated Systems Source followers (buffers) Black, Gary; Smith Kenneth \\"A JFET Circuit for Instrumentation Applications are another complementary structure found in amplifiers. The complementary source follower, often used in the output stage of an amplifier, can be designed such that it can adjust the output offset voltage to zero, effectively, eliminating the need for an AC coupling capacitor. A complementary source follower can also be paralleled to create power amplifiers. Nelson Pass built such a design based on Toshiba‚Äôs 2SK170 and 2SJ74 single complementary JFETs with over 1000 parallel JFETs. Today though, since Toshiba discontinued these parts, you would have to build such an amplifier with LSK170 and LSJ74 single complementary pairs or with LSK489 and LSJ689 JFETs. Because the LSK489 and LSJ689 have lower input capacitance than Toshiba parts and are duals the same kind of amplifier design would have lower noise levels and a smaller footprint. A complementary source follower can be built with complementary N-Channel and P-Channel JFETs. Paralleling source followers is one way to easily build a power amplifier. Amplifier bias networks will also incorporate JFETs current sources, although not necessarily in matched arrangements. JFET current mirror designs, for use in amplifiers, have been patented using matched JFETs, such as the LSK389 Van Der Reijden, Christoph Stefan (Sep 30, 2010) \\"Hearing screening system for a subject or a patient, and a method for hearing screening US 20100249635\\" A1 Cordial Medical Europe B.V. and GaAs JFETs.Scheinberg, Norman R. (May 10, 1988) \\"JFET current mirror and voltage level shifting apparatus US 4743862 A ‚Äú Anadigics, Inc. Besides amplifiers, discrete JFET matched pairs are also used in the design of voltage controlled resistors, voltage controlled current sources, current to voltage converters, programmable gain circuits, voltmeters, phasers and a wide range of analog computational circuits like absolute value circuits These blocks often are designed with matched N-channel pairs, matched P-channel pairs, or complementary matched pairs.‚ÄúWhy match JFETs?‚Äù Rullywow Industries Popularity The long-term popularity of discrete complementary JFETs is a result of the ability of the designer to obtain better circuit performance at lower cost points than what can be obtained with more modern highly integrated devices.Pass, Nelson \\"DIY Op Amps\\" Pass Labs Well-known audio designers, like John Curl, Nelson Pass and Erno Borbely, also have proven to the marketplace, that discrete complementary JFETs are one of the better ways to achieve high- quality, low-noise audio designs.Curl, John (2006) \\"Condemnation without examination is prejudice\\" Complementary JFET duals are also noted for their low equivalent noise voltage, high operating voltage, thermal tracking characteristics, low offset voltage, low pinch-off voltages, low input bias currents, and very high input impedance. All of these characteristics make these devices ideal for use in high performance audio, sensor and measurement applications. Future Improved JFET process technologies, discrete JFET devices and JFET topologies will continue to challenge highly integrated monolithic designs for sockets in high quality electronic products. The primary reasons are cost and customization. Costs are too high for integrated circuit companies to integrate customized high-performance for niche markets. Costs performance trade-offs are met more easily with discrete devices. Discrete designs based on hybrid topology breakthroughs will also continue to challenge highly integrated, highly commercialized monolithic designs in terms of performance and cost. Hybrid topologies that combine complementary JFET, complementary MOS, complementary bipolar transistor, complementary SiC JFET and complementary GaAs JFETs, are easier and more cost-effectively built from discrete components than integrate into highly advanced monolithic chips.

As the first commercial brewer in Alexandria, Virginia, Wales also became the first commercial brewer in the District of Columbia after Alexandria's 1791 incorporation into the District. Wales served as brewmaster at John Mercer's Marlborough Brewery in Stafford County, Virginia before opening his own Alexandria brewery in 1770. George Washington frequently purchased beer and barley from Wales over the course of thirty years. Early professional life Andrew Wales was born in Scotland in about 1737. He arrived in the Colonies before 1765 and held a position in John Mercer's Marlborough Brewery from 1765 to 1769. He rose to the position of brewmaster after a previous brewmaster failed to produce quality beer. Washington purchased a cask of Wales' beer from the Marlborough Brewery in 1768 and would remain a customer of Wales' for thirty years. Mercer wrote in a 1767 letter that, ‚ÄúWales affirmed that he had some years the charge of a brewhouse at Edinburgh.‚Äù  Wales Brewery  Wales rented space in Alexandria's Town Warehouse on Duke Street and began brewing there commercially in 1770. Within two years, Wales purchased a building to house his brewery, but did not fully relocate brewery operations until 1773. After this second brewing site burned down in 1788, he moved it a block closer to the waterfront. Cornelius Coningham, the first brewer in the City of Washington, took control of the Wales Brewery in 1798, renaming it the Alexandria Brewery. Coningham held the brewery for Wales until a new owner was found. The brewery complex was purchased by John Fitzgerald in 1798, but was sold in 1802 to settle Fitzgerald's debts after his death in 1799. The brewery complex no longer exists.

It was released on September 1, 2017, by FilmRise. Plot After starting a fire in a nearby warehouse as a diversion, the five robbers‚ÄîLeah Dillon; her sister, Vee; their brother, Michael; Kramer, the safecracker; and Cyrus, the muscle‚Äîinitiate a bank robbery. An officer inside the bank tries to call for help on his police radio. Detective Tom Iger, who had just been in the bank, hears the call and decides to check it out. While walking back to check on the bank, he hears another anonymous call on his radio about the robbery. The robbers find only $70,000 in the vault. Leah wants to leave, but Vee and Cyrus demand more money. The assistant manager Ed Maas says he will tell them where $6 million is stored as long as they do not hurt anyone. He tells them the money is in the basement vault which is a part of the old bank and hands them the key to the access door. By now, police are stationed outside the bank and Leah is confused as to how they knew about the heist. The head teller, Susan, tries to connect with Michael, telling him he is a decent man. He tells her that he owes people a lot of money and his sisters are helping him rob the bank. When Kramer successfully breaks open the vault, the lights flicker. A man in a white mask and what appears to be a group of the hostages attack him. He is pulled inside the old vault. Leah and Vee watch from the security monitors upstairs, but only Kramer appears on the screen. Thinking there are more people in the bank, Leah asks Cyrus to count the hostages that are gathered inside the safety deposit vault. The lights start to flicker again and the vault door closes with Cyrus and the hostages inside. As Kramer is repeatedly stabbed in the basement vault, Cyrus is overcome by the same group of hostages that attacked Kramer. The man in the white mask appears and grabs his gun, forcing it into Cyrus's mouth. When the vault door opens again, Leah goes in but Cyrus is nowhere in sight. Michael sees Kramer commit suicide. Suspecting that Susan called the police, Leah interrogates her. Susan tells Leah about the robbery in 1982 where a robber in a white mask apparently \\"snapped\\" under the pressure and killed some hostages, forced some to kill each other and burned the rest alive in the old vault. The masked man was never caught or found. Vee turns up with a bag of money‚Äîbut the bills are all from 1982. After the police attempt to take Leah and Vee out with sniper fire, an outgoing call indicator on an office telephone catches Leah's attention. She picks it up and listens to the same robbery message that Detective Iger had heard earlier. Michael cuts into a water pipe to make an escape route and encounters a burned woman pleading for help. Vee finds Cyrus's body with his head blown off. Leah heads outside and releases one of the hostages. She asks Iger who made the phone call to the police, about the message. He answers that it came from the radio, not the phone. Leah goes back inside to the telephone and listens as the same message repeats, suddenly recognizing the voice. Vee escapes through the water pipe. As Michael begins setting the place on fire to cover their escape, Leah lets the hostages go. As she attempts to escape through the water pipe, the masked man and un-dead hostages attack her. Michael distracts them long enough to allow Leah to escape before setting the bank on fire, sacrificing himself. During the ensuing police interview of the hostages, Iger tries to find out why they know nothing about Maas. Susan says she's known all the employees inside the bank for ten years and has never seen the man before. Susan looks at the investigation wall and points to a picture of Maas. Iger tells her the picture is of someone who died in the 1982 incident. He was the assistant manager who had called the police to report the robbery but was shot by the robber. It was the same call Leah and Iger had heard the previous day. Leah and Vee meet in a rural area. The police assume all of the robbers died in the fire, so they are free to start their lives anew. When their jeep fails to start, Vee checks the engine and is attacked by the man in the white mask.

At thirteen, Iervolino launched a small tech business selling websites with his friends to local entrepreneurs in Cassino, where it was unusual to use the Internet for advertising. Following this success, Iervolino left home at the age of fifteen to work as a producer's assistant on Broadway- style shows in the resort town of Bibione, Italy. In September of that same year, he returned to his hometown to produce his first film which was financed through crowd-funding from local investors willing to sponsor his project for small donations. A year later, he had produced his first film The Cavalier of Love (2003). After failing to distribute it in local cinemas, Iervolino began the initiative: Cineschool Day. This strategy involved adding his films into Cassino schools' curriculums giving students the opportunity to go to the watch the films during the day-time at a reduced price. The screenings would then be followed by social debates amongst their classes. For this purpose, Iervolino put together a library of films already in existence with strong social themes and proposed them to schools, complete with information brochures and ideas for how the students could debate. The initiative gained enough traction in the small town that former Italian Prime Minister and Senator for Life Giulio Andreotti attended as spokesperson from 2011‚Äì2012. While in Italy, Iervolino met Luciano Martino who became his fatherly mentor and business partner before he died in 2013. Together, they co-produced several films including the aforementioned \\"The Merchant of Venice\\". Following the launch of AMBI Media Group in 2013, Iervolino and his business partner, Monika Gomez del Campo Bacardi, went on to launch AMBI Distribution in Beverly Hills, and AIC Studios in Toronto. As of 2017, AMBI Media Group also had offices in London, China, and Italy. In 2015, Iervolino's company acquired 85% of the Exclusive Media Group (EMG) film library in partnership with New York- based private equity firm Raven Capital Management granting licensing, sequel and remake rights to over 400 features including Begin Again, Cruel Intentions, Donnie Darko, End of Watch, Ides of March, Rush, The Skulls, Snitch, Undefeated, and Memento. These along with many more worldwide box- office hits are now listed in AMBI Exclusive's library and relicensed to clients around the world. Beginning in 2015, Iervolino and Lady Bacardi began the AMBI Gala Foundation and hosted the first annual AMBI Gala. The proceeds of the gala were given to the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation for investing in environmental causes. The gala was held just before the night of the TIFF in Toronto. Iervolino is one of the first film producers to co- produce a film involving the Pope. Pope Francis appeared as himself in the film Beyond the Sun, which premiered in Vatican City in September 2017.

An example of the horn effect may be that an observer is more likely to assume a physically unattractive person is morally inferior to an attractive person, despite the lack of relationship between morality and physical appearance. Origin of the term The term is derived from the word \\"horn\\" and refers to the devil's horns. This is in contrast to the word halo and the halo effect, based on the concept of a saint's halo. In a 1920 study published by Thorndike that focused on the halo effect, it was noted that \\"ratings were apparently affected by a marked tendency to think of the person in general as rather good or rather inferior and to color the judgments of the qualities by this general feeling\\". =Alternate terminology= It is sometimes called the horns effect, reverse-halo effect, or devil effect. Bias in action The horn effect occurs when \\"individuals believe that negative traits are connected to each other.\\" It is a phenomenon in which an observer's judgment of a person is adversely affected by the presence of (for the observer) an unfavorable aspect of this person. * The Guardian wrote of the devil effect in relation to Hugo Chavez: \\"Some leaders can become so demonized that it's impossible to assess their achievements and failures in a balanced way.\\" * The relation of crime to attractiveness is also subject to the halo effect. A study presented two hypothetical crimes: a burglary and a swindle. The burglary involved a woman illegally obtaining a key and stealing $2,200; the swindle involved a woman manipulating a man to invest $2,200 in a nonexistent corporation. The results showed that when the offense was not related to attractiveness (as in the burglary) the unattractive defendant was punished more severely than the attractive one. However, when the offense was related to attractiveness (the swindle), the attractive defendant was punished more severely than the unattractive one. The study imputes that the usual leniency given to the attractive woman (as a result of the halo effect) was negated or reversed when the nature of the crime involved her looks.

Written by Christopher Hollier & Adam Karp and directed by Geofrey Hildrew, it premiered on ABC in the United States on November 3, 2017. In the episode, Tiana's backstory is detailed involving her encounter with Dr. Facilier, while in the present day Ivy wants Henry to help her find out about what Victoria is up to, Jacinda and Sabine come up with an idea to make money that Victoria is determined to sabotage, and Rogers tries to get information on a missing person that someone else is also seeking.  Plot  = Opening sequence = A firetruck is featured in the background. = Characters' past = In the years before Henry's arrival to their realm, Tiana and her mother Eudora are trying to keep their castle from being sold, as Tiana and her mother are no longer royalty in the wake of her father passing away. Tiana decides to seek out a suitor in the hopes of solving her problems; she goes to a town where, after dealing with unruly beggars, she comes across a mysterious individual named Doctor Facilier. He tells Tiana that he can help her find her prince with the aid of his magic, but that it will cost her. On Facilier's advice, Tiana follows his direction to find the ‚ÄúRed Crow,‚Äù which turns out to be a tavern. As she is being attacked for her earrings, Tiana is saved by a man named Prince Marias, who asks to have dinner with her. Tiana later brings Marias back to her castle and tells him about her late father while showing off the Firefly Ruby, the family's remaining heirloom. Marias agrees to help Tiana, but Tiana catches him trying to steal the ruby. He explains that he isn't actually a prince, just a commoner who has made a deal with Facilier, to give him the ruby in exchange for reuniting with his love, who has been turned into a frog. After understanding the situation, Tiana lets Marias go. After receiving advice from Eudora, Tiana takes it upon herself to deliver the ruby to Facilier in exchange for the frog, claiming that the ruby doesn't possess any power, since she has the power inside her. Facilier, however, is in no mood to break off the deal, as he wants to keep the ruby and the frog. Tiana immediately threatens him with a sword, but Facilier responds by using a voodoo doll he made in her likeness to injure her. Tiana is able to rescue the frog, but Facilier uses his magic to disappear with the ruby. Tiana later returns the frog to Marias, who thanks her. He kisses the frog, using true love's kiss to break the curse that Facilier placed on them; it turns out that instead of his transforming the frog into a princess, it's the other way around, as Marias transforms back into a frog and is reunited with his love. The two frogs look at Tiana in gratitude and hop away into a nearby stream together. = Seattle = At Belfrey Towers, Victoria visits the secret room to see the witch, demanding that she help her to remove Lucy's belief so Anastasia can be brought back to life. The witch instead asks for tea, refusing to help Victoria unless she complies. Meanwhile, Sabine shows up to give Lucy some of her beignets, but is confronted by Victoria, who reveals that she plans to increase the rent for her and Jacinda's apartment. Sabine comes up with an idea to solve the problem by convincing Jacinda into selling her beignets with the supplies she bought with the rent money, to which Jacinda agrees. The two set up shop at Mr. Clucks, where they find success with the business. Unfortunately, the restaurant is burned down on orders from Victoria, although Sabine does save the money they made. With the restaurant now in ruins, Jacinda lashes out at Sabine for costing her her job, upsetting Lucy, who talks to Sabine about not giving up. Sabine plans to leave town, but Jacinda apologizes and surprises her with a gift (a secondhand catering van that they can use to sell her food), and they reconcile. At the same time, Roni asks Henry about his friendship with Ivy, and advises him that he should be pursuing Jacinda instead. At Belfrey Towers, Victoria is demanding a lot more out of Ivy, which angers her. Ivy sees Victoria visiting the secret room on the Tower's security cameras, and calls Henry to ask him for help in finding out what Victoria is up to. However, Roni sees the text come in on Henry's phone and deletes it to protect him, before going to the Tower and meeting with Ivy herself. They access the secret room, where they find a cup of tea and a picture, revealed to be one of her (as Regina) and a younger Henry back in Storybrooke, which surprises and confuses Roni, as she has no memories of Storybrooke. She later shows the picture to Henry, who identifies the boy as himself. At the police station, Rogers tries to get information from a criminal involving Eloise Gardner, the missing girl that he has been trying to find for the past ten years, after recognizing a tattoo that he saw on the man that matches a symbol in Eloise‚Äòs sketch book. The man dodges Rogers' questions, but explains that the symbol is meant to ward off evil; however, the man is later seen spying on Rogers, and calls someone to inform them that Rogers is looking for Eloise. Back at the Tower, Ivy visits the secret room to see the witch. It is revealed that they have known each other all along, with Ivy using Henry and Roni in her scheme to destroy and overthrow Victoria. Not only that, Ivy reveals that she is also awake from the curse, as she reminds the witch that her name is not Ivy, it's Drizella.

He completed postgraduate study at the University of Reading where he was awarded a PhD in meteorology in 1993 for research on the earth's energy budget and heat fluxes supervised by Alan Ibbetson and George Dugdale. Research and career Malhi has advanced our understanding of the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems and how they are responding to the pressures of global change in the Anthropocene, including climate change, biodiversity decline and loss of megafauna. This work integrates insights from ecosystem ecology into earth system science, and has been characterised by an interdisciplinary approach that involves establishing broad networks of field research in tropical forests in some of the most remote and challenging regions of the world. His early career focused on Amazonia, but in recent years his research interests have expanded across Africa and Asia. He has ongoing projects in Malaysia, the Ankasa Conservation Area, Kakum National Park and Kogyae Strict Nature Reserve in Ghana, Lop√© National Park in Gabon, the Serra do Mar coastal forests in Brazil. In the context of the UK he has particular interests in ecosystems restoration, and also conducts extensive ecological research at Wytham Woods the Amazon rainforest and the Andes. He co-founded the RAINFOR network of forest plots across the Amazon forest (with Oliver Phillips), helped establish a 3500 m elevation transect study in the Amazon-Andes of Peru, and more recently founded the Global Ecosystems Monitoring (GEM) network of intensively studied sites across the tropics. His work also makes use of microscale meteorology, global climate datasets, terrestrial ecosystem models and satellite remote sensing. This work has contributed to our understanding of the carbon sink in the terrestrial biosphere, and to how it may be vulnerable to climate warming. Malhi's research interests extend to a broad understanding of contemporary change in the biosphere and how to navigate it through the Anthropocene, through a combination of natural sciences, social sciences and science policy. With Oliver Phillips at the University of Leeds, he co-edited the book Tropical Forests and Global Atmospheric Change published in 2005 by Oxford University Press. He was one of the 620 global contributors to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. As part of his teaching activities, he leads field trips to Wytham Woods in Oxfordshire a Malhi's research has been funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), the Royal Society, the European Union, the European Research Council (ERC), the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Microsoft Research and the Earthwatch Institute. Before moving in Oxford in 2004, Malhi was a postdoctoral researcher(1995‚Äì1999) and Royal Society University Research Fellow (1999-2004) at the University of Edinburgh. Awards and honours Malhi was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2017 One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: having previously been awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (URF) from 1999 to 2005. In 2016 he was awarded the Marsh Award for Climate Change of the British Ecological Society, and in 2018 he was awarded the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. Malhi was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to ecosystem science.

Since the civil war's beginning, Pagak had served as headquarters and stronghold for the rebels, and its loss was believed to possibly greatly weaken the insurgency. A large part of the government forces that took part in the offensive are members of the SPLM-IO (Juba faction), a break-away group from Machar's movement that is loyal to First Vice President Taban Deng Gai. Though pro-government forces managed to capture Pagak on 6 August, their attempts to secure the surrounding areas proved unsuccessful. As result, the SPLA-held corridor between Mathiang and Pagak remained unsafe.  History  = Government offensive = According to rebel officials, the government offensive began around 1 July 2017, as SPLA soldiers and allied \\"Sudanese rebels\\" reportedly launched \\"surprise attacks\\" on positions of Machar loyalists in and around Mathiang and Guelguk, Longechuk County; the rebels claimed that these initial assaults and others in the surrounding countryside were easily repulsed. SPLM-IO military intelligence officer Khamis Mawwil threatened that \\"there will be a river of body bags if they think they can take over our areas in Upper Nile\\". The situation changed, however, as fighters loyal to Taban Deng Gai joined the operations against Machar's followers. By 10 July, these militiamen had captured Mathiang and numerous towns and villages in Longechuk County from the rebels. The fighting led the United Nations to evacuate at least 25 aid workers from the SPLA-IO stronghold of Pagak, while thousands of civilians were displaced and around 50,000 cut off from aid. Meanwhile, the government denied that it was conducting an offensive and said that it was still honoring its unilaterally declared ceasefire. Despite repeated counter-attacks and heavy resistance, government troops continued to advance on the strategic town of Maiwut, center of Maiwut County, over the following weeks. Around 30,000 civilians fled the fighting and sook shelter at Pagak, while the government continued to deny that any offensive operations were taking place. A SPLA spokesman simply stated that \\"if Taban Deng‚Äôs forces are moving to Pagak it is their responsibility\\". The rebels also claimed that the Uganda People's Defence Force supported the government during the offensive with air strikes. On 27 July, the rebel-held town of Maiwut, near the border with Ethioipia, was eventually captured by SPLA troops, consisting mainly of forces loyal to Vice-President Taban Deng Gai. Maiwut is located along the supply route between the Ethiopian border and Mathiang. Only after this victory did the government admit that it had launched an offensive, though it was now framed as \\"self-defense\\" in order to prevent constant rebel attacks on government-held areas. With the fall of Maiwut, the SPLM-IO (Juba faction) called on refugees to return to their homes in Maiwut County, while the SPLA began to besiege nearby Pagak. The first attacks on the rebel stronghold failed, but as more and more SPLA troops arrived with heavy artillery, the situation of the besieged SPLM-IO garrison became untenable. The insurgents consequently retreated on late 6 August, allowing the government to occupy Pagak without resistance on the following day. Before their withdrawal, however, the Machar loyalists set fire to their military barracks and ammunition stores so that they would not fall into the hands of the SPLA. The government went on to say that its forces were welcomed by the residents of Pagak who had \\"been held hostage for almost four years since the conflict erupted\\" by the rebels; this was however denied by local aid workers, according to whom thousands fled the SPLA soldiers. = Rebel counter-offensive = On the same day of Pagak's fall, however, the rebels launched their own counter-offensive against Maiwut. Exploiting that most of the garrison had been moved to secure Pagak, the insurgents reportedly retook the town and captured much military equipment; the government however denied that Maiwut had fallen. According to the regional rebel commander Maj. Gen. Khor Chuol Giet, the rebels had effectively cut off the government forces at Pagak and the Ethiopian border. As the rebels now in turn besieged the government forces in Pagak, they called on the SPLA soldiers to surrender, which they refused to do. Machar's fighters consequently began to attack the town. Between 11 and 15 August heavy fighting raged at the town, with the rebels repeatedly claiming that they had fully retaken it and that the government troops had been reduced to an holdout at the Ethiopian border crossing. The government denied these claims. On 22 August, Machar's SPLM-IO claimed that the government troops had fled into Ethiopia, where they had \\"barricaded themselves\\". In response, Governor Bol Ruach told the Sudan Tribune that \\"maybe they are talking of their own Pagak but the Pagak in which I talk to you is under the full control of the government since I came here.\\" Regardless of who controlled Pagak, fighting in the countryside continued unabated, and prevented the distribution of humanitarian assistance by UN agencies to the civilian population. By 25 August, a United Nations peacekeeping official confirmed that Pagak was fully under government control; nevertheless, heavy fighting continued in the surrounding areas with the corridor to Mathiang remaining unsafe. Meanwhile, Tut Rom, an \\"influential\\" follower of Machar and commissioner of Jotome County in Maiwut defected to Taban Deng Gai. On 30 August, the SPLA claimed that with Pagak under government control, the Palogue oil field was finally secure from rebel attacks.

While most autistic children eventually begin to speak, there is a significant minority who will remain nonverbal.  Background  It is estimated that 25% to 50% of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) never develop spoken language beyond a few words or utterances. Despite the growing field of research on ASD, there is not much information available pertaining to people with autism who never develop functional language; that, in fact, nonverbal autistic individuals are considered to be underrepresented in all of autism research. Because of the limited research on nonverbal autism, there are not many validated measurements appropriate for this population. For example, while they may be appropriate for younger children, they lack the validity for grade-school-aged children and adolescents and have continued to be a roadblock for nonverbal autism research. Often in autism research, nonverbal autistic individuals are subgrouped with LFA, categorized by learning at most one word or having minimal verbal language. Most of the existing body of research in nonverbal autism focuses on early interventions that predict successful language outcomes. Research suggests that acquiring language before age five is a good indicator of positive child development, and the likelihood of acquiring functional language in the future past this age is minimal, that early language development is crucial to educational achievement, employment, independence during adulthood, and social relationships. Most children with ASD can be diagnosed between age two and three because of their behaviors and lack of social skills. They can also have gastrointestinal problems, seizures, and sleep disorders. Early predictors The causes of nonverbal autism are unknown. However, there appears to be a relationship between joint attention and verbal communication. Joint attention occurs between two individuals when one draws the other‚Äôs attention to an object through gesturing (i.e. eye gazing, pointing). The ability to achieve joint attention at an early age plays a significant role in language development, and studies indicate severe lapses in joint attention in children with autism. In one study, researchers suggest that a displayed pattern of delays, absences, or a general impaired response to stimuli (hyporesponsiveness) and a fascination with intense or repetitive stimulation (sensory seeking) is more likely in nonverbal children with autism, suggesting that both hyporesponsiveness and sensory seeking is related to poor communication outcomes in children with ASD. Potential causes =The amygdala theory= There is a growing body of tentative evidence indicating the amygdala's involvement in the development of autism. The focuses on the importance of the amygdala in relation to social functioning and observes that autism is largely a severe impairment of social functioning. The amygdala is thought to be associated with the fight or flight response in animals and its activity is heavily correlated with fear in humans. Additionally, it has been heavily implicated in relation to social functioning in various animal studies. Evidence suggests an amygdala hyperactivity model may be more accurate than one comparing it to a lesion. Lesion studies have shown that amygdala damage results in severe social impairment among animal models. Vervet monkey mothers with amygdala lesions were shown to be much less caring with their young neglecting and even abusing them. Rats with amygdala ablations become much more docile. Monkeys with lesions to the anterior temporal lobe develop a disorder known as Kl√ºver‚ÄìBucy syndrome, characterized by loss of fear, hypersexuality, hyperorality, and an inability to recognize visual objects (often, but not always). Evidence shows the amygdala accounts for the emotional, oral, and sexual abnormalities listed above. These abnormalities coincide with several characteristics of the diagnostic guidelines for autism, at least passably for an animal model. Post- mortem analysis of humans shows an increased neuronal density in the amygdala in autism compared to controls, indicating a potential linkage and supporting the hyperactivity model. Several studies presented subjects with ASD photographs of human eyes and had them report the emotional state of the person in the picture. A smaller amygdala was associated with increased response time but not decreased accuracy. There was also significantly less amygdaloid activation in the brains of those with ASD, than controls. Subjects compensated for this lack of amygdaloid activity with increased activation in the temporal lobe, and are associated with verbally labeling images. This activity is thought to imply less usage of emotional/social cues to identify objects and rather more objective, factually based processing. One may extrapolate from this model that patients with autism may learn that a specific facial configuration represents an emotional state and what that emotional state implies socially, but they may not come to truly understand how that person feels. This supports a theory of mind deficit, or inability to empathize with others ‚Äì a characteristic symptom of ASD. Studies conducted specifically on nonverbal autistics provide similar evidence. Brain studies have shown several amygdaloid impairments among those with ASD. The amygdala in those with nonverbal autism have less volume compared to controls, contain a higher density of neurons suggesting hyperconnection, and show a negative correlation between amygdala size and impairment severity among subjects. Infantile autism is actually associated with an oversized amygdala, there are developmental theories as to how this may occur. Research on major depressive disorder has shown that excessive activation such as stress or fear leads to allostasis, or degeneration of the neurons involved in creating the phenomenon. Initial hypertrophy results in atrophy and reduction of brain size in the given region. Over time, this occurs in patients with severe depression and they develop a decreased amygdala size. Some scientists theorize that this is happening early during infancy the autistic brain, accounting for the initial overgrowth and later observed size reduction. When eye tracking software is employed to record where subjects focus their visual attention on images of human faces, small amygdala volume is associated with decreased eye fixation. Eyes are considered to be especially important for establishing human connection and conveying emotion, thus fixation on them is considered to be a crucial part of identifying people and emotions in a social setting. In addition to a negative correlation to eye fixation studies showed a smaller amygdala was associated with impairment in nonverbal communication skills as well. This suggests that the amygdala is critical in developing all types of communicative abilities, not just verbal. This suggests the amygdala may play a crucial role in relating to other humans in a way that allows for behavioral mimicry. Among patients with nonverbal ASD researchers could predict symptom severity based on amygdala activity. Those with the least amygdala activity had the most impaired nonverbal communication abilities, those with the most activity had the strongest communication abilities. The development of language, similar to the development of most physical skills, relies heavily on mimicry of other humans. ASDs are known to impair one's ability to focus on and relate with people possibly as a result of a damaged amygdala. Nonverbal autistics will often be able to learn more basic communicative skills such as pointing to objects or selecting a picture from a list. These skills are far more simple and do not require the degree of personal connection needed for language development. It is important to note that these studies must be considered with great caution. Cross-sectional studies can only suggest so much about the pathology of a disorder. Further study, particular longitudinal studies, are needed to gain a more complete understanding. It is also important to recognize that most disorders arise from a complex interworking of the entire brain and restricting a theory to one subsystem would be a mistake, this theory merely suggests how the amygdala may be involved with develop of ASD and provides evidence to support an association. Language outcomes For nonverbal grade school children and adolescents with autism, communication systems and interventions have been implemented to enhance language and communication outcomes. Speech-generating devices such as tablet computers use visual displays for children who lack verbal language, giving them the task of selecting icons indicating a request or need. For adolescents with nonverbal autism, interventions can condition them to learn more advanced operations on speech-generating devices that require more steps (i.e. turning on device, scrolling through pages), which would allow them to enhance their communicative abilities independently. The picture exchange system (PECS) is a form of spontaneous communication for children with autism in which an individual selects a picture indicating a request. PECS can be utilized in educational settings and at the child‚Äôs home. Longitudinal studies suggest PECS can have long-term positive outcomes for school-aged children with nonverbal autism, specifically their social-communicative skills, such as higher frequencies of joint attention and initiation, and duration of cooperative play, which are all important roles in improving language outcomes. It has also been suggested that a significant stage in acquiring verbal language is learning how to identify and reproduce syllables of words. One study found that nonverbal and minimally verbal children with autism are capable of enhancing their oral production and vocalizing written words by isolating each syllable of a word one at a time. The process of breaking down a syllable at a time and having it visually displayed and audibly available to the child can prompt him or her to imitate and create nonrandom and meaningful utterances. Most of these studies contain small sample sizes and were pilot studies, making additional research significant to assess whether these findings can be generalized to all age groups of the same population. Furthermore, most studies on nonverbal autism and speech-generating device communication were based on more basic skills, such as naming pictures and making requests for stimuli, while studies in advanced communication is limited.

The process imparts unique, and potentially, highly desirable microstructures to the resulting products. Friction extrusion was invented at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended primarily as a method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials.‚ÄúForming metallic composite materials by urging base materials together under shear‚Äù US patent #5262123 A, Inventors: W. Thomas, E. Nicholas, and S. Jones, Original Assignee: The Welding Institute.  Description of the Process and Essential Process Variables  die rotation and the hydraulic cylinder that provides the extrusion pressure. Wire is extruded vertically through the hollow draw bar of the milling machine. This configuration corresponds to a direct extrusion with a rotating die: i.e. the charge (billet in this case) is pushed into the rotating die. As in conventional extrusion processes, in friction extrusion, a shape change is enforced on the charge by forcing its passage through a die. However, friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in several key ways. Critically, in the friction extrusion process, the extrusion charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. In addition, similar to conventional extrusion, an extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate or they may be counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion. Scrolled features on the face of the die aid material flow into the extrusion orifice which can lead to order of magnitude reduction in extrusion force compared to conventional extrusions of equivalent cross section.\\"Scaled-up fabrication of thin-walled magnesium ZK60 tubing using shear assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE‚Ñ¢)\\", S. Whalen, V. Joshi, N. Overman, D. Caldwell, C. Lavender, T. Skszek, Magnesium Technology, 315-321, 2017. Third, the combined effects of elevated temperature and large levels of deformation normally lead the extrudate to have a relatively fine, equiaxed, grain structure which results from recrystallization after the conclusion of deformation: desirable crystallographic textures may also be created by the process and formation of nanocomposite structures are also possible.‚ÄúDispersoid distribution and microstructure in Fe-Cr-Al ferritic oxide dispersion-strengthened alloy prepared by friction consolidation‚Äù, D.

ShAPE‚Ñ¢ machine at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory capable of 100 ton linear force and 1000 ft-lb torque at 500 rpm.Based on the foregoing, it can be said that the essential controlled parameters in friction extrusion are typically: # The die rotation rate. # The die geometry. # The extrusion force normal to the die face or, the rate of die advance into the charge. The corresponding response parameters include: # The required torque and power. # The extrusion temperature. # The extrusion rate in force controlled extrusion or the extrusion force in rate controlled extrusion. # The extrudate microstructure and properties.  Friction Extrusion Equipment  Figure 3. The friction extrusion process is highly scalable. The extrusion on the left has a 7.5mm diameter, the one on the right has a 50 mm diameter. These extrusions were performed on a TTI friction sir welding machine. Figure 4. Typical die scroll geometries for making rod and tube. Dies are rotated such that the scrolls aid material flow toward the die opening.In principle, friction extrusion can be performed on any machine which can produce the required rotary and linear motions between the die and charge. Examples include machines built for friction stir welding, milling machines modified to accommodate the extrusion forces, and purpose built friction extrusion equipment such as the shear assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE‚Ñ¢) machine at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Figures 1-3 show examples of friction extrusion equipment and extruded products. Figure 4 shows typical friction extrusion dies designed for production of wire, rod and tube. Dies are rotated in the direction which enhances material flow toward the extrusion orifice during the process.  Strain in Friction Extrusion  In conventional extrusion, the strain imparted to the charge is loosely defined by the extrusion ratio.‚ÄúManufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials, 5th ed.‚Äù, S. Kalpakjian and S. R. Schmid, , pp. 307-314, 2008. The extrusion ratio is simply the cross-sectional area of the extrusion billet, A0, divided by the cross sectional area of the extrudate, Af. The extrusion strain is then e=ln(A0/Af). In friction extrusion there is an additional strain component which will arise from the shearing motion of the rotating die as it contacts the charge. The strain produced by the rotation of the die results in redundant work as it does not accomplish a shape change. In order to investigate the strain due to shearing, studies have been performed with marker materials embedded in the material to be extruded.‚ÄúStrain and texture in friction extrusion of aluminum wire‚Äù, X. Li, W. Tang, AP Reynolds, WA Tayon, CA Brice, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, v. 229 ,pp. 191-198, 2016. After extrusion, these materials are detected by metallographic methods and provide insight regarding the way in which material flows during the extrusion process. Figure 5 shows an example of how the amount of shear strain changes with changing ratios of extrusion rate to die rotation rate. In the limit of very high extrusion rates, the friction extrusion process closely mimics the conventional extrusion process with respect to strain levels. Figure 5. Distribution of AA2195 marker wire in an extruded 6061 wire. The marker was inserted into the billet at 1/3 of the billet radius prior to extrusion. The amount of shearing is a function of the extrusion rate relative to the die rotation rate: this ratio increases from a-h.  Typical microstructure resulting from friction extrusion  Figure 6 shows the cross section and microstructure of a titanium wire produced by friction extrusion of Ti-6-4 powder. Notably, the cross section is fully consolidated and the transformed b microstructure indicates that extrusion likely occurred near 1000 ¬∞C (above the beta transus for the alloy).

He owned Coons Gallery in Bishop, California, the original art studio and residence built by the artist Robert Clunie. Early life Coons was one of three sons born to William 'Bill' Coons and Grace Eva Manley on December 13, 1929 in Los Angeles, California. In November 1928, William Coons was hired by the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as a member of the survey crew for the proposed Colorado River Aqueduct. The recently organized Metropolitan Water District of Southern California would be the agency authorized to oversee the construction of the aqueduct. Due to a delay in the start of the project, William Coons was temporarily assigned to field survey work in eastern California‚Äôs Owens Valley, where Los Angeles had large land and water holdings. The family moved back and forth between Culver City in Los Angeles and the Owens Valley towns of Bishop, Big Pine and Independence. By 1941, the family settled in Long Beach. Richard and his brothers joined the Sea Scouts. In response to the home front war effort, Richard became a civil defense volunteer, messenger class. Near their home on Elm Street was an extensive area of open marshland adjacent to the mouth of the Los Angeles River. Overgrown with willow trees and waterfowl, it was an ideal place to practice survival skills. The brothers bought a 14-foot sailboat and portaged it from in a backyard berth several blocks, over curbs, through sand, to its launch into Alamitos Bay. For the next several summers, Richard secured work on fishing boats. The sea's energy‚Äîits still moments, its beauty, its sense of danger‚Äîoffered the youthful Coons a kaleidoscope of images. Unconsciously, the observing eye of the artist within was storing away an inventory of memory, of the sea in all its capricious shades, the play of light or shadow on water. Several times every year, the family returned to Bishop, California in the Owens Valley, to visit relatives. In 1946, at the end of his sophomore year in high school, Richard asked his parents if he could live with relatives in Bishop while finishing high school. They agreed, as his father's work would take them up to Bishop again. When the family reunited in Bishop, Bill Coons worked with Mammoth Mountain Ski Area founder, Dave McCoy as a hydrographer. McCoy dreamed of finding a slope suitable for skiing and ultimately one on which a rope tow could be built. Richard often accompanied them, sitting in the back seat of their car, as they traveled on what are now abandoned roads, looking for a slope \\"good for skiing.\\" Richard was on the Bishop Union High School's ski team coached by Tony Milici, Mammoth Mountain Ski Area's first Vice President. Early artistic influence In the fall of 1947, Richard assisted his grandfather and the family business, Bishop Pumice Concrete Products, in the delivery of concrete blocks to artist and Bishop newcomer, Robert Clunie, a member of the California Art Club. The building materials were for the construction of the Clunie home and studio on Bishop Creek. Aware of Richard‚Äôs notable track accomplishments as reported in the local newspaper, and as an athlete of some note himself, Clunie struck up a conversation about sports with the younger Coons. Clunie‚Äôs son Kent enrolled that same year in Bishop High School and he and Richard quickly became good friends. Often a visitor in the Clunie home or accompanying Kent and 'Bob' Clunie into the Sierra backcountry, Richard observed Clunie, the artist, capture on canvas ‚Äúthe beauty and perfection‚Äù of nature. Clunie's were the first oil paintings Richard had seen close enough to touch. Not long afterward, twenty-year-old Richard purchased, by installment, his first Robert Clunie painting, \\"Monterey Boat Works\\". The painting is still in the collection of Coons Gallery and was exhibited in the Robert Clunie Retrospective (2013)at the Santa Paula Museum, Santa Paula, California. In 1972, Clunie received a commission to paint Lake George above Mammoth Lakes area and invited Richard to accompany him and experiment with painting in the open, in \\"plein-air.\\" At 43, Richard began painting. Clunie told him that a fledgling artist should never release any of his early works for at least one year \\"lest they come back to haunt you.\\" Richard heeded Clunie‚Äôs advice and destroyed approximately fifty of his early paintings. With wry humor he mused, ‚ÄúThey do make a nice fire.\\" In the years following the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act, the United States Forest Service, during the course of its continued mission, to uphold the new permit restrictions on occupancy in the backcountry and to remove the remnants of human impact in the newly created wilderness areas, instructed Clunie to dismantle his 'permanent summer camp' that he occupied for years. The camp was located between Fourth and Fifth Lakes in the North Fork of Big Pine Canyon, next to the lower basecamp for The Palisade School of Mountaineering, started by Sierra mountaineer Norman Clyde and later run by author and guide, Smoke Blanchard and climbing guide, John Fischer. It took Richard, Kent, Robert Clunie and at least two USFS rangers almost three months to remove more than thirty years of accumulated possessions stored deep within the crevices of the granite boulders surrounding the camp. Because of Clunie‚Äôs lengthy career in the high country and the extensive collection of art that it inspired, Richard was obsessed with similar high mountain scenes, ‚Äúwhere you find the granite peaks with snow and glaciers, white bark and lodgepole pines and the wonderful north face snowfields, the places you had to hike to‚Äînot the ones at the end of the road.‚Äù The scenery of the Alpine Zone, at 11,000 feet and above, was Richard's favorite to paint, so he was away from home much of the summer. Although on occasion he hired a packer with pack animals, generally he hiked in to the selected area laden with a heavy pack of essential supplies for a ten-day excursion. Career A year after Clunie‚Äôs death in 1984, the family sold the art studio and residence to Richard who opened Coons Gallery. With the help of Frenchy, a local sign maker, they built the monument sign that stands outside the gallery, on U.S. 395 at Tu Su Lane. The new studio provided the environment he needed to focus on painting. He was disciplined, in the studio every day at eight, then finishing up by two, so he could spend a few hours playing a round of golf at the local country club. Often in winter, when the Sierra was covered with snow, Richard traveled to drier climates to paint. Laguna Beach, Virginia City, the Great Basin and Death Valley were some of his favorite locations. Once, while painting Dante‚Äôs View in 1982, a sand storm interrupted his work. Having left the windows of his trailer open for ventilation, he returned to find the bed and much of the interior covered with two inches of sand. Unlike his mentor, Robert Clunie, who hired Glacier Pack Station to take him into the mountains, Richard carried a large external frame backpack, topped with a small easel, rolled canvas, an umbrella, his paints and brushes. He recalled a painting trip to Hungry Packer Lake, \\"Soon it began to hail. I was sitting under my big umbrella, not getting wet, but hailstones were hitting the meadow grass and boulders and bouncing two feet in the air like a million jumping grasshoppers. It began to thunder and lightning, closer and closer. I found myself down in the lowest spot I could find, between the big boulders, sitting on my foam rubber cushion and huddled in my poncho with the rain coming down in buckets and lightning and thunder banging all around.\\" He spent close to a year in Laguna Beach, associated with Larry Kronquist Gallery. At Larry's urging, he took a marine painting workshop with Bennett Bradbury in Monterey, California. He soon returned to the Sierra, and spent many months hiking into the backcountry with his painting canvases and supplies. In 1998, Coons wrote and published the definitive volume on his mentor‚Äôs life: Robert Clunie Plein-Air Painter of the Sierra. An artist member of the California Art Club, Richard participated in many exhibitions, including several California Art Club Gold Medal Shows as well as a joint exhibition with Robert Clunie at the Ventura County Historical Museum (now the Ventura County Museum). He won many awards and placed in the National Parks Art For the Parks Top 100 competition. A prolific painter, Richard was able to complete a thirty by thirty-six inch oil canvas in two days. It is estimated that he painted at least 3,000 realist and impressionist canvases of primarily the Sierra Nevada, but also classic California landscape scenes and oceanscapes, from Monterey to Laguna. Following his untimely death from cancer in 2003, his wife, Wynne Benti, publisher of outdoor books at Spotted Dog Press, continued to keep the gallery open.

Afterwards, he became a private tutor for a family from Lehe living in Paraguay. There, he gathered linguistic information on indigenous peoples of the Gran Chaco and conducted zoological research, especially on ants, discovering several new species. Bohls was a member of the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory. After his return from South America, he became assistant at the Natural History Museum in Hamburg. In the mid 1890s, Bohls returned to his hometown, where he maid acquaintance with the writer Hermann Allmers, who introduced him to the union of M√§nner vom Morgenstern. Together with Gustav von der Osten, he formed in 1898 a homeland association for the whole area between the mouths of the Elbe and Weser rivers. During this time, he also took an important role as a mediator in the beginnings of the German boat research.Hasemann, Christian. (2011) Jan Bohls und die M√§nner vom Morgenstern.

He examined an urn cemetery in Dingen near Wursten, where he excavated old Saxon vessels with Barbotine technique of Romanesque origin. In the Fickm√ºhlen Forest, he uncovered a grave of the stone age. Bog body finds and an excavation of the gallows hill () of , which dates back to the Bronze Age, were other projects of his.

With the specter of Communism exorcized, his new enemy is Islam.\\" Derbyshire wrote that Schneider's \\"representation of ethnic minorities in Berlin Now is strictly black-and-white‚Äîas either victims or perpetrators of crimes, rarely active agents....Instead of a depiction of a diverse and fast-evolving minority making in-roads into the city‚Äôs intellectual, cultural, and business life, what Schneider gives us is an attack on Muslims.\\" Derbyshire concluded \\"What Peter Schneider gives us in Berlin Now is his own very limited perspective on present-day Berlin.\\"http://quarterlyconversation.com/berlin-now-by-peter- schneider In The New York Times Nicholas Kulish writes that \\"Schneider seeks to explain why the city became 'the capital of creative people from around the world today.'\\" Kulish, however is critical of Schneider \\"pontificating\\" about Muslim immigrants and his apparent praise for anti-Muslim politicians.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/books/review/peter-schneiders- berlin-now-and-rory-macleans-berlin.html References Category:2014 non- fiction books Category:Books about Berlin Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:Penguin Books books ","title":"Berlin Now"},{"id":"54914147","text":"Mgr Denis JachietDenis Jachiet (born 21 April 1962) is a French Catholic prelate, Auxiliary Bishop of Paris since 25 June 2016,Article at, Press office of the Holy See. and Titular Bishop of Tigisis (a former bishopric now in rural Algeria). the Euro 2016, the Church of Paris at the forefront .

History The council was proclaimed on 20 October 1864 and divided south east to north west by the new Port Road into two wards - one for each constituent township. The inaugural councillors appointed by the governor were James Page, Thomas Bails, Samuel Wilson, John Formby and William Wheewall. On 2 June 1898 the council was amalgamated into the Town of Port Adelaide, the latest in what became a series of annexations of small port-side councils into the larger corporate township. Neighbouring local government The following adjacent local government bodies co-existed with the Queenstown and Alberton council: * District Council of Portland Estate (established 1859) lay immediately north and north west. In 1884 it was amalgamated with the Town of Port Adelaide making the latter Queenstown and Alberton's northern neighbour. Four years later, Queenstown and Alberton was also amalgamated in to the Port Adelaide council. * District Council of Rosewater lay north east from its establishment in 1877. * District Council of Yatala lay east. In 1868, Yatala council was split into two, at the approximate course of Dry Creek.

This quarter used to be the residential, manufacturing and commercial center, where each street was specialized in one specific type of manufacturing or commerce. Another common name referring to approximately the same area is the 36 streets (), after the 36 streets or guilds that used to make up the urban area of the city.  Extent  Map showing the official extent of the Old Quarter The official extent of the Hanoi Old Quarter has been fixed by a 1995 decision from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction: in the north it is limited by H√†ng ƒê·∫≠u street, in the west by Ph√πng H∆∞ng street, in the south by H√†ng B√¥ng street, H√†ng Gai street, C·∫ßu G·ªó street, and H√†ng Th√πng street, and in the east by Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i street and Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Du·∫≠t street. Several of the streets that were part of the historic urban area of Hanoi lie outside this region, which was determined for being most dense in historical streets and for having maintained its historical character best. The official Old Quarter is part of the Ho√†n Ki·∫øm District. Its total area is about 100 ha and it counts 76 streets distributed over 10 wards.  History  H√†ng M·∫Øm street around 1905 Copper wares shop The residential and commercial area that is now the Old Quarter came to be during the L√Ω and Tr·∫ßn dynasties and was then located east of the Imperial Citadel of ThƒÉng Long and along the Red River. During the L√™ dynasty, scholar Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i already mentioned some of the areas each specialized in one particular trade. It was then surrounded by a defensive wall with several gates. During the L√™ dynasty, the area included several lakes and wetlands, the largest of which was Th√°i C·ª±c lake. These lakes, as well as the T√¥ L·ªãch River were connected with Ho√†n Ki·∫øm lake and the Red River. Near the end of the 19th century these lakes and rivers became isolated from each other. During the L√Ω and Tr·∫ßn dynasties, many people from the surrounding plains migrated to the city and settled in what is now the Old Quarter, creating the densest urban area of the city. The L√™ dynasty period saw an additional influx of Chinese immigrants who arrived to trade, creating several Chinese neighbourhoods.. When the French ruled over Vietnam, they partially rebuilt the area. This period saw many French and Indians settling there to conduct business. Two small markets were demolished to make place for ƒê·ªìng Xu√¢n Market. Furthermore a tramway was constructed through the quarter. The area is still the commercial heart of Hanoi.  36 guild streets  H√†ng B√® street The most famous trait of the Old Quarter are its areas dedicated to one specific trade or guild. Craftsmen from villages around the city used to gather in one area of their guild to sell their wares to merchants. The crafts or guilds of each area gave the names to the streets of the quarter, so that most streets acquired names starting with ' (\\"wares\\"), such as H√†ng Tre street (\\"bamboo wares street\\") and H√†ng ƒê·ªìng street (\\"copper wares street\\"). Several of the streets are still specialized in the trade that gave them their names. Others still specialize in one specific trade, but a different one from their traditional specialty -- such as H√†ng Bu·ªìm street (\\"sails street\\") which has become dominated by Vietnamese cakes and candy. The Old Quarter has been shown by researchers using the quantitative social anthropology approach to have exhibited Hanoi's cultural evolution during the first decades of the 20th century.  Historical architecture  Old shophouse architecture The Old Quarter contains many historic sights, such as temples, pagodas, and assembly halls. Most craft streets used to have a temple dedicated to worshiping mythical founders of the craft. Particular is that the ground floor of such communal temples in the Hanoi Old Quarter was often still used for commerce. With the passage of time, most such communal temples have been destroyed. Several temples have survived, such as the M√£ M√¢y and Kim C·ªï temples. Several city gates were located in what is now the Old Quarter. Only the Quan Ch∆∞·ªüng gate is still left Characteristic of the Old Quarter is the ancient architecture of the commercial area. Most of the historic houses there are shophouses with slanted tile roofs, of which the side facing the street used to be used as entrance to the shop inside. Houses of this type were mostly built in the 18th and 19th centuries -- before that most houses had thatched roofs. Since the end of the 20th century, the number of traditional houses have been dwindling in number.  Preservation  Quan Ch∆∞·ªüng Gate, the remaining city gate of old Hanoi Many of the historic remnants of the Old Quarter have deteriorated and are in need of restoration. For the 1000th anniversary of N·ªôi in 2010, the Hanoi People's Committee decided to spend 50 billion VND on the refurbishing of 75 streets inside and outside the Old Quarter, among others for applying lime to restore the yellow color of fa√ßades in the Old Quarter. The process has been criticised for having been executed carelessly, leading to a less than optimal result.

The second, a gun and bomb attack, took place at Donnelly's Bar & Filling Station in Silverbridge, County Armagh, just across the border inside Northern Ireland. The attack has been linked to the Glenanne gang, a group of loyalist militants who were either members of the UVF, the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the closely linked UVF paramilitary the Red Hand Commando (RHC), some of the Glenanne gang were members of two of these organizations at the same time like gang leaders Billy Hanna who was in both the UVF and the UDR and who fought for the British Army during the Korean War and John Weir who was in the UVF and was a sergeant in the RUC.The Cassel Report (2006), cain.ulst.ac.uk; retrieved 28 September 2013.

Then if there was any heat Mitchell could claim the bombers and shooters were with him when the attacks happened.The Barron Report (2003), pp. 144‚Äì145.

Jack Rooney who was walking past the town hall on the opposite side of the street was struck in the head by flying shrapnel and died three days later. A further 20 people were injured in the explosion, several of them very seriously. The car bomb was fitted with fake southern registration plates and placed in one of the busiest streets in Dundalk in the hope of causing maximum death and injury. According to Joe Tiernan, UVF commander Robin Jackson planted the bomb and along with other members of his unit escaped across the border in a blue Hillman Hunter around the time the bomb went off.Joe Tiernan: The Dublin and Monaghan Bombings And The Murder Triangle (2006) pp.226.

As the unit arrived in two cars came unusually fast towards the pub, the publican's son Michael Donnelly (14) who was serving petrol to a customer noticing the strange speed of the cars ran towards the pub to warn people, but before he could make it inside, McConnell jumped out of one of the cars and shot the teenage boy dead with a Sten gun. McConnell then shot the man Michael Donnelly had been serving petrol to in the head, although the man survived the shooting he was maimed for life. Then a second gunman, believed to be Billy McCaughey, a UVF volunteer and member of the RUC Special Patrol Group, shot dead a second person, local man Patrick Donnelly (no relation to the pub owner's family) who had been waiting for petrol. McConnell then went inside the pub and sprayed the bar with his Sten SMG, killing a third man, Trevor Bracknell, and seriously injuring three more people. As McConnell withdrew to his car, two other members of the unit carried a 25-pound cylinder bomb inside the pub. As McConnell's unit fled back to Mitchell's farm, the bomb detonated inside the pub, however by this time most of the people had already left. The explosion at Kay's Tavern destroyed about 80% of the building, started a huge fire and injured two more people; with one of the injured men losing a foot and a hand in the explosion. Nobody has ever been charged for these crimes.

The college offers associate and comprehensive baccalaureate science degrees to Licensed Practical Nurses, Registered Nurses, and individuals who are not already nurses. The college is located in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in the Mount Morris Park Historic District across from Marcus Garvey Park. It was founded years ago in 1945.  Admissions and curriculum  The college offers three programs: # A program for licensed practical nurses who want to earn a degree with a major in nursing at the registered nurse level. # A program for registered nurses with associate degrees who want to earn a baccalaureate degree with a major in nursing. # A program for individuals with no prior nursing degree who want to earn a baccalaureate degree with a major in nursing. On May 2, 2014, the college made history by conferring its first Bachelor of Science degrees.  Enrollment  As of 2019, there were approximately 600 full- and part-time students enrolled in the associate degree and baccalaureate programs.  Honors program  The Honors Program ‚Äî now in its year (founded in February 2010) ‚Äî was established to enhance academic enrichment for exceptional students in the LPN to RN Associate degree program ‚Äî and to officially recognize and support their collegiate achievements.

Its inaugural class graduated October 29, 1946. By 1950, the program was named \\"Hospital for Joint Diseases School of Practical Nursing\\". The school, in 1955, received a grant from the Helene Fuld Health Foundation and was subsequently named the \\"Helene Fuld School of Practical Nursing\\". In 1964, under the leadership of Justine Hannan, RN, Director of Nursing Services and Nursing Education, the school launched the first program in the country to offer licensed practical nurses an accredited curriculum in higher education leading to a degree as a Registered nurse. In 1973, Mary Ahl- Heugel (n√©e Mary Ellen Ahl; born 1918), PhD, RN, became Director of Nursing Education. In 1976, the school received a permanent charter from New York State with the authority to confer the associate degrees in Applied Science with a nursing concentration, becoming one of the first hospital-based schools in New York State to offer the associate degree. In 1978, the school phased out its practical nurse program. The last class of about 300 in practical nursing graduated in October 1978. In 1979 the Hospital for Joint Diseases relocated downtown on East 17th Street and a new, private, non-profit corporation named \\"Joint Diseases North General Hospital\\" became the new tenant at 1919 Madison Avenue location in East Harlem. Helene Fuld College of Nursing had been, since October 15, 1945, a New York State Registered Nursing School. = Constituent college of North General Hospital = In 1980, Margaret Wines, PhD, RN, became Dean. In 1981, the school's associate degree program became the first such hospital program to be accredited by the National League for Nursing. On October 27, 1987, the hospital was renamed North General Hospital. In 1988, the school became the first hospital-based nursing school to become accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. On December 12, 1991, North General Hospital moved into a newly built, modern facility at 1879 Madison Avenue, between 120th and 121st Streets, two blocks south of its old location. In 1992, the Helene Fuld School of Nursing moved into its current location at 24 East 120th Street, New York. In February 1996, with the permission of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, the name \\"Helene Fuld School of Nursing\\" was changed to \\"Helene Fuld College of Nursing\\", reflecting the depth and breadth its curricular programs in higher education. = Independent college = In July 2007, the college separated from North General hospital and amended its charter with the New York State Board of Regents as an independent not-for-profit college. North General Hospital ‚Äì its former parent institution ‚Äì closed July 2, 2010, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2012, Wendy Robinson, PhD, RN, became president of the college and the New York State Education Department authorized the college to confer Bachelor of Science degrees for registered nurses. = Colors = The college uses blue, green, purple, and black in its publications. Moreover, the interior design color palette of the college's main reception area uses those colors. With the exception of black, nurses commonly wear scrubs in those colors. Since 2010, there has been a growing trend for hospitals and health care organizations to assign scrub color codes to help identify healthcare professional by discipline or department. Color coded uniforms, however, have been widely criticized by healthcare workers for various reasons, one being that it cultivates a caste mentality in an environment that requires teamwork across all disciplines. In any event, the colors at the college do not represent a particular discipline or academic level.  Notable people  =Hospital executives= *Abraham Rosenberg (1900‚Äì1976) was appointed Executive Director of Hospital for Joint Diseases in 1952; he had been associated with the hospital since 1929. *Eugene Louis McCabe (1937‚Äì1998), a healthcare activist, was Founding President and CEO of North General Hospital until his death. With philanthropist Randolph Guggenheimer, McCabe was co-founder of North General Hospital. McCabe was married to, divorced from, but remained close friends with Jewell Jackson McCabe, feminist, business executive, and social and political activist. When Gene McCabe died, he was married to Elsie, (n√©e Elsie Alberta Crum), who, in 2009, married New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson. Before marrying McCabe, Elsie had been divorced from Roger Ellington Coy, whom she married in 1990. *Harold Page Freeman, MD, was named President and CEO North General Hospital in 1999. He was the former President of the American Cancer Society and, before being appointed, was Chief of Surgery at NGH. *Samuel J. Daniel, MD (n√© Samuel Jeremiah Daniel; born 1950), was President and CEO North General Hospital from 2001 to 2010. Daniel is married to Cheryl Joan McKissack (maiden; born 1961), granddaughter of Moses McKissack III (1879‚Äì1952). Moses III and his brother, Calvin Lunsford McKissack (1890‚Äì1968) co-founded in 1905 the family architectural and engineering firm, McKissack & McKissack, the first African-American-owned architectural firm in the United States and currently the oldest African American-owned architecture and engineering firm in the country =College directors, deans, presidents= *Bernice (\\"Bernie\\") Burnside Huffman (n√©e Evangeline Bernice Burnside; 1900‚Äì1979), in 1945, was appointed Superintendent of Nurses at HJD, replacing \\"Delia\\" G. Dowling (n√©e Bridget G. Dowling; 1881‚Äì1966), who retired after having served as Superintendent of Nurses at HJD for 21 years. In 1946, Huffman became the Founding Director of the School of Nursing at HJD. :Huffman had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Illinois (Physical Education) in 1923 and a Graduate Nurse degree from the School of Nursing at Washington University in St. Louis in 1936. In 1940, Huffman was appointed Superintendent of Nurses at the Ellis Fischel Cancer Center in Columbia, Missouri. During World War II, around 1943, Huffman had been a representative and recruiter for the Cadet Nurse Corps. From October 1943 through December 1943, Huffman served on the field staff of the Nursing Council on National Defense, an organization that ran from 1940 to 1951, with an objective to analyze the country's needs for the education, procurement, and distribution of professional nursing and auxiliary nursing services in relation to national defense. Surveys by the National Nursing Council revealed the there was an acute shortage of nurses, nationwide. On January 5, 1944, Huffman became a vocational assistant in the hospital and nursing school fields at Nurse Placement Service, based in Chicago. The Nurse Placement Service was a not- for-profit organization established in 1931 by the Midwest Division of the American Nurses Association. :Huffman grew up in Abingdon, Illinois.

The title \\"Dean\\" was interchanged with other titles, but the upshot was that Hannan was both the Director of Nursing at the Hospital and the Director of the School. Before joining HJD, Hannan had been a nurse and nurse instructor at Israel Zion Hospital in Brooklyn. She subsequently served as Director of the Wyckoff Heights Hospital School of Nursing (practical nursing) in the early 1950s. Hannan was born and raised in Ohio, graduating in 1932 from Fredericktown High School, then, graduating December 21, 1938, from Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science in Education with a Certificate of Graduate Nurse. Hannan also earned a Master of Arts degree from New York University. Hannan resigned December 1972 after 17 years serving as Director the Nursing Department and Nursing College for the Hospital for Joint Diseases. She died one month later ‚Äì on January 4, 1973. She had been married to Eugene Rizzi. *Mary Ahl-Heugel (n√©e Mary Ellen Ahl; born 1918), PhD, RN, in 1973, became Director of Nursing Education. Around 1972, she married Andrew Anthony Heugel, PhD (1909‚Äì1999). *Margaret (\\"Peggy\\") Wines (n√©e Elder; 1936‚Äì2012) retired September 7, 2012 ‚Äì after 31 years as head of the college. Wines died weeks later, on November 17, 2012. Her reign as head of the college is the longest in its history. In her honor, the college named its library the Peggy Wines Memorial Library. *Wendy Robinson (born 1955), PhD, RN, FNP was appointed President in September 2012 and departed from the position in May 2019.

Dr. Griffin-Sobel has a distinguished academic administration record and is particularly noted for reestablishing academic quality to troubled colleges. She is a Navy veteran. =Trustees= *Stephen C. Frauenthal (1939‚Äì2015), a math teacher, was a long-term Trustee of the Helene Fuld College of Nursing and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. His paternal grandfather, Herman C. Frauenthal, MD (1866‚Äì1942), was a brother of Henry William Frauenthal, MD (1863‚Äì1927), who founded the Hospital for Joint Diseases in 1905. Herman C. Frauenthal, MD, had been a physician at the Hospital for Joint Diseases. *James C. Frauenthal, PhD (born 1944), had been a long-term Trustee of the Helene Fuld College of Nursing and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. He is the brother of Stephen C. Frauenthal.  Neighborhood  The immediate neighborhood, until about 1992, had been blighted. This was the case with many neighborhoods and districts throughout the five boroughs. In 1992, when North General Hospital moved into its new quarters two blocks south, Maple Plaza, an eight-story, 155-unit residential co-op, designated for affordable housing, was built in its place at 1919 Madison Avenue. Maple Plaza was developed in the 1990s under a plan by the city and North General Hospital to revive the area around the hospital. Eugene Louis McCabe (1937‚Äì1998), President and CEO of North General Hospital from its inception in 1979 until his death in 1998, was a strong advocate of developing Maple Plaza. Maple Court, another similar project in the area with 135 units, was completed before Maple Plaza. Since then, the area around Marcus Garvey Park has developed. The neighborhood is no longer blighted. While gentrification is typically criticized by civic leaders for making neighborhoods unaffordable ‚Äì particularly to those who, for generations have thrived and lived there ‚Äì the neighborhood surrounding Marcus Garvey Park, by design, offers a mix of affordable housing. At the same time, adjusting to gentrification throughout Harlem is an ongoing concern of policy makers, citizens, civic leaders, and religious leaders. Two blocks west of the college, in the Mount Morris Park Historic District, there has been considerable recent (since 2000) residential development and restoration. The stretch of 122nd Street between Mount Morris Park West and Malcolm X Boulevard (aka Sixth Avenue and Lenox Avenue) is known as \\"Doctors' Row\\". As has been the case in many neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs, old, historic residential buildings, including brownstones, fell into disrepair. Until around 1999, on Mount Morris Park West, between 120 and 121st Streets, there was a row of brownstones, built around 1885, which, according to the New York Times, were so deteriorated that they came known as \\"The \\"Ruins\\". That row has been completely rebuilt into luxury condominiums that were initially priced for mixed income buyers. Revitalization since the 1990s has occurred in many neighborhoods, including the Mount Morris Park Historic District, notably brownstones, and in particular the brownstones at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 West 122nd Street, on the south side of the street, which date back to 1888 and 1889. Those particular brownstones were designed by William Tuthill. St. Martin's Episcopal Church, featuring a tower that houses the city's second largest carillon (40 bells), is at 18 West 122nd Street ‚Äì at the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard. It is a New York City Designated Landmark. \\"Fifth on the Park,\\" Harlem's first Upper East Side-style high-rise condominium tower is one block east from the college, at the southeast corner of 120th Street and Fifth Avenue ‚Äì at 1485 Fifth Avenue. Its architects are FxFowle. The tower, 28 stories, 26 of which are residential, includes a 38,000 square foot (3,500 m2) church with a four-story, 1,800-seat sanctuary for the Bethel Gospel Assembly, who sold the development rights for a full block. There are 194 residences, of which 47 are church-owned affordable rental apartments, and 147 are market-rate condominiums. The spa includes a 55-foot (16.76 m) lap pool.  Other schools by the same name  * The Helene Fuld School of Nursing in Trenton, New Jersey, was founded in 1895 as \\"Training School for Nurses\\" at Trenton City Hospital. The hospital and school changed their names in 1902 to William McKinley Memorial Hospital and William McKinley Memorial Hospital School of Nursing. In 1951 school changed its name to Helene Fuld School of Nursing, honoring the mother of its benefactor, Leonhard Felix Fuld ‚Äì the same benefactor as the Helene College of Nursing in New York City. The Trenton school closed in 2011, citing, among other things, changes in nursing education. The Trenton school was not related to the New York school. * Coppin State University, College of Health Professions, Helene Fuld School of Nursing in Baltimore was founded in 1973 and, as of 2017, offers baccalaureate degrees for RN, BSN, accelerated BSN, and a graduate program that began in fall 1999. The School offers a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) and a post-masters certification track with a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) role concentration. From 1963 to 1973, it was known as the Helene Fuld School of Nursing at Provident Hospital. At its founding in 1895, it was named the Provident Hospital Training School of Nursing. Luci V. Ashton (1870‚Äì1948), who graduated from Freedmen's Hospital Training School for Nurses in 1895, served as the school's first director for a year and a half before becoming Superintendent of Nurses at Douglass Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas. The Baltimore school is not related to the New York School.  Notable alumni  * 1962: Dorothy A. Campbell, RN (retired) (n√©e Dorothy Anne Patterson; born 1938), graduated from the Fuld College of Nursing in 1962. She is a poet and author. Her books include: # Pearl ‚Äì A Journey of a Lifetime,‚Äô‚Äô (2014) # It Happened in Manhattan (2017), an autobiography wherein Campbell reflects upon, among other things, her experiences attending the Helene Fuld School of Nursing.

Early life Hasan was born around 775 AH (1373/1374), son of the Emir of Mecca Ajlan ibn Rumaythah (d. 1375). After his father's death Hasan and his brother Ali ibn Ajlan were raised by their elder brother, the Emir of Mecca Ahmad ibn Ajlan (d. 1386). In Dhu al-Hijjah 789 AH (December 1387) Ali ibn Ajlan assumed the Emirate. Hasan traveled to Egypt to secure support for his brother's reign, returning to Mecca a few months later, either in Rabi al-Thani or Jumada al-Awwal (April/May 1388). On his return he reinforced Ali with a troop of fifty Mamluk horsemen and delivered him the robe of honor and letter of confirmation from Sultan al-Zahir Barquq. Though Hasan enjoyed good relations with his brother during much of the latter's reign, rivalry between the two sharifs twice broke into open conflict. On both occasions Hasan attempted to capture Mecca and overthrow Ali. The first time was in early 792 AH (c. early 1390), and the second time was in Jumada al-Thani 797 AH (March/April 1395). After twice failing to take the Emirate by force, Hasan went to Egypt seeking support for his cause. In Ramadan (June/July 1395) of that year Sultan Barquq arrested Hasan and imprisoned him in Cairo Citadel. On 7 Shawwal (28 July 1395) Ali was killed, only a week after receiving news of Hasan's capture, and was succeeded by his brother Muhammad ibn Ajlan. First reign On 9 Dhu al-Qi'dah (c. 26 August 1395) upon receiving word of Ali's death Barquq freed Hasan and appointed him Emir of Mecca. News of his appointment reached Mecca in the last ten days of Dhu al-Qi'dah (September 1395). Since Hasan himself had not yet arrived, Muhammad ibn Ajlan continued to serve as Emir. Hasan finally reached Mecca on Saturday night, 24 Rabi al-Thani 798 AH (4 February 1396). After entering the city he was invested with the robe of honor and proclaimed Emir of Mecca. In 809 AH (1406) Hasan successfully petitioned Sultan al-Nasir Faraj to appoint his son Barakat as co-Emir of Mecca. Barakat's diploma of investiture, dated Sha'ban 809 AH (January/February 1407), arrived in Dhu al- Hijjah (May 1407). In 811 AH (1408) Hasan had al-Nasir appoint his son Ahmad coregent alongside Barakat. At the same time al-Nasir raised Hasan to the newly created post of Vice Sultan (or Viceroy) in the Hejaz (na'ib al-saltanah bi'l aqtar al-Hijaziyah), giving him supervisory authority over Mecca, Medina, Yanbu, Khulays, and al-Safra. Robes of honor for Hasan and his sons reached Mecca in the second half of Rabi al-Thani (September 1408) along with a decree dated mid-Rabi al-Awwal 811 AH (August 1408). Al-Nasir also sent a decree appointing Thabit ibn Nu'ayr as Emir of Medina. Thabit was the uncle of Hasan's wife, and Hasan had proposed his appointment to the Sultan earlier that year. However, since Thabit died before the arrival of al-Nasir's decree, Hasan exercised his new prerogatives as Vice Sultan by issuing a decree appointing Thabit's brother Ajlan ibn Nu'ayr, his father-in-law, to the Emirate of Medina. He also sent a contingent of troops to Medina under the command of his son Ahmad to remove the previous Emir Jammaz ibn Hiba. After Ajlan assumed Emirate, the khatib in Medina was ordered to mention in the sermon first the name of Sultan al-Nasir Faraj, second the name of Hasan ibn Ajlan, and third the name of the Emir of Medina. In 812 AH (1410) Hasan fell from favor and al-Nasir ordered the Egyptian amir al-hajj Emir Baysaq to arrest him along with his sons. Baysaq assembled an army and on reaching Yanbu announced that the Sultan had deposed Hasan and his sons. Hasan received the news on 10 Dhu al-Qi'dah, and by the end of the month he had assembled an army of 600 horsemen and over 6000 soldiers to fight Baysaq. In the meantime, al- Nasir decided against removing Hasan and ordered Baysaq to stand down. To Mecca he sent the messenger Fayruz al-Saqi bearing robes of honor and a decree dated 12 Dhu al-Qi'dah which reinstated Hasan, Barakat, and Ahmad to their offices. During this time, Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah, the Sultan of Bengal, commissioned some money in order to buy property for establishing and maintaining the two Ghiyathiyyah Madaris located in Makkah and Madinah - which were considered to be the best institutions in the region. An account of these can be found in the Tarikh Makkah (History of Makkah).. Azam Shah also sent a lot of money to repair the Arafat Stream. Hasan, however, decided to use the money given by the Sultan for another project instead. On 20 Jumada al-Thani 815 AH (c. 27 September 1412) Hasan and his sons received robes of honor and a letter from the new sultan, the Caliph Musta'in Billah. However, the mention of the Caliph's name in the dua and khutbah of Mecca was short-lived, for in Shawwal (January 1413) they received robes of honor and a letter from the new sultan, al-Mu'ayyad Abu al-Nasr Shaykh. On 14 Safar 818 AH (c. 25 April 1415) the Sultan issued a decree appointing Rumaythah ibn Muhammad ibn Ajlan as Vice Sultan in the Hejaz and Emir of Mecca in place of his uncle and cousins. Rumaythah received the decree 16 Rabi al-Awwal 818 AH (c. 26 May 1415), but the du'a in Mecca continued in the name of Hasan and his sons until Rumaythah entered Mecca in the beginning of Dhu al-Hijjah (February 1416). Second reign In Rajab 819 AH (September 1416) Hasan sent Barakat to Cairo to petition for his reappointment. Sultan al-Mu'ayyad responded to the entreaty and sent Hasan a robe of honor and a decree, dated 18 Ramadan 819 AH (c. 9 November 1416), returning him the Emirate of Mecca. He entered Mecca and was proclaimed Emir on Wednesday, 26 Shawwal (16 December 1416). In the second half of Shawwal 820 AH (November/December 1417) Barakat arrived from Egypt as Hasan's coregent. The following year in Rabi al-Awwal (April/May 1418) Hasan ordered those in his service to pledge allegiance to Barakat, thereby indicating his intention to cede the bulk of his duties to his son. In 823 AH Hasan requested al-Mu'ayyad to appoint his son Ibrahim coregent with Barakat. On 12 Rabi al-Awwal 824 AH (c. 17 March 1421) he received a decree, dated Safar 824 (February 1421) and in the name of the new sultan al-Muzaffar Ahmad, that confirmed Hasan and Barakat as Emirs but did not mention Ibrahim. As a result the brothers quarreled and Ibrahim left for Yemen. He returned to Mecca with a group of his supporters and ordered the mu'adhdhin to insert his name in the dua alongside his father and brother. This continued until 826 AH (1423), when Hasan ordered for Ibrahim's name to be removed. In 825 AH (1422) the Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay appointed Rumaythah ibn Muhammad Emir of Mecca. The latter was in Yemen, however, and nothing came of his appointment. When the amir al-hajj Fayruz al-Nasiri reached Mecca Hasan came out to receive the mahmal as usual, even though he had already received word that he had been deposed. When Emir Fayruz returned to Egypt he delivered Barbay a large tribute from Hasan and spoke well of the latter's governance as Emir of Mecca. Barsbay was appeased and sent Hasan confirmation of his rule. On Friday, 15 Rabi al-Thani 827 AH (17 March 1424), news reached Mecca that Ali bin Inan ibn Mughamis was on his way from Egypt with an army, having been appointed Emir of Mecca by Sultan Barsbay. After a few days Hasan left towards Yemen, allowing Ali to enter the city without bloodshed on Thursday, 6 Jumada al-Awwal 827 AH (6 April 1424). Third reign In 828 AH Barsbay deposed Inan from the Emirate. Qadi Najm al-Din ibn Zahirah and the amir al-hajj Emir Taghri Birdi al-Mahmudi delivered the news to Hasan in al-Lith that he was reinstated as Emir of Mecca on the conditions that he return to Mecca to receive the Hajj, and that he afterwards appear before the Sultan in Cairo. Hasan sent Barakat back to Mecca where the amir al-hajj swore an oath to Barakat at the Black Stone that neither he nor the Sultan bore any malice towards Hasan. Barakat returned to his father, then they entered Mecca together and resumed their offices on Wednesday, 4 Dhu al-Hijjah (17 October 1425). After performing the Hajj Hasan accompanied the amir al-hajj to Cairo, leaving Barakat in Mecca. He arrived on 24 Muharram 829 AH and was received with great honor. On 27 Muharram Barsbay confirmed Hasan as Emir of Mecca after he agreed to pay the sum of thirty-thousand dinars. Hasan was kept as an honored hostage in Cairo until the first installment of five-thousand dinars arrived. On 20 Jumada al- Awwal (c. 30 March 1426) Hasan departed for Mecca. After falling ill he returned to Cairo, where died on Thursday night, 17 Jumada al-Thani 829 AH (25 April 1426).

The story revolves around a high school senior (Troian Bellisario) who struggles with life after the tragic death of her twin brother (Tom Felton), causing her physical and mental health, as well as her grades and social relationships, to deteriorate rapidly. Still haunted by her brother's passing, she tries to maintain a facade of normalcy while continually battling with her inner demons. Plot Twins Olivia and Matt are as close as they are different. Olivia strives for excellence, something that her father (James Remar) seems to expect of her more than her fraternity- destined brother. Yet, despite the fact that Matt seemingly has it \\"easy,\\" he's also the one who looks out for Liv. And while their relationship isn't perfect (perhaps Matt is a little too protective), it is one that Liv can count on. But after arguing with Liv about her decision to get drunk and hook up with their mutual friend Julian (Ben Winchell) at a Halloween party, Matt crashes the car they are in, and dies. Olivia, unable to carry the guilt she feels alone, begins to see Matt ‚Äî or some hostile version of him ‚Äî in moments she might need him most. Matt tells her what to do, what to say, what to think ‚Äî and, specifically, when not to eat. (Liv visualizes that she's saving the food for Matt, who can only live on if Liv makes this sacrifice.) After a suicide attempt at a party her parents hosted, Liv is sent to an Eating Disorder Inpatient Treatment Center. Even there, her brother torments her by forcing her to lie to the therapists or forcing her to save food for him (against the center's rules). During a therapy session, Olivia finally talks to her therapist how she's really been feeling which causes the ghost of Matt to go into a rage, screaming at her about how he hates her and never loved her. After talking to him, she lets go of this version of Matt and recognizes that the voice that is telling her to control her eating isn't that of her brother.

Today, their few remaining descendants live primarily in the provinces of Chaco and Santiago del Estero, with smaller numbers in the Rosario and Buenos Aires urban areas. In the province of Chaco, the Vilelas live together with the Toba (or Qom) people in communities such as the Colonia Aborigen Chaco (Chaco Aboriginal Colony). They also reside in rural areas and at the periphery of large cities such as Resistencia, S√°enz Pe√±a, Machagai, and Quitilipi. In Santiago del Estero Province, the Vilela people live in their own communities as well as in communities shared with the Lule people, with whom they are closely related and share a language family.  History  The Vilela people refer to themselves by the endonym uakambalelt√©, or waqha-umbael-te, both of which translate to \\"those who speak Waqha\\" in their native Vilela language, which they refer to as Waqha. The language is subdivided into three dialects, chinipi, sinipi, and ocol. Ocol, with only a handful of current speakers, is the only dialect which survives to this day. Similarly to the Lules, the Vilelas had a culture intermediate between those of the indigenous peoples of the Andes, the Pampas, and the Cuyo region. By the fifteenth century, they had established themselves in the north of today's Tucum√°n and Santiago del Estero provinces, as well as the east and southeast of the Salta Province. They were nomadic and sustained themselves through hunting and gathering. They hunted the peccary, and harvested carob and honey. After the Spanish conquest of the Tucum√°n region, the Vilelas moved eastward, into the eastern and southeastern parts of the Gran Chaco. At that time, they were made up of the following subgroups: chunup√≠, pazaine, atalala, omoampa, yeconoampa, vacaa, chole, ipa, and yooc (or guamalca). During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Guaycuru peoples successfully domesticated the horse, which they used for hunting, transportation, and waging war. This allowed them to expand their region of influence, forcing the Vilelas to move even further east, toward the Paran√° River. The Jesuits founded three missions in Vilela lands, lasting until the Jesuit expulsion of 1767-1768: *San Jos√© de las Petacas, founded in 1735. *Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar, founded in 1763. *Nuestra Se√±ora del Buen Consejo, founded in 1763. The last Vilela cacique, or chief, in the Chaco region, known as Leoncito, lived near the city of Resistencia during the mid- nineteenth century.  Today  With few exceptions, the Vilela people no longer speak their native language, instead primarily speaking Spanish, with some speakers of Toba (Qom). The 2004-2005 Complementary Indigenous Survey did not identify the Vilela people;Informaci√≥n Estad√≠stica however, the 2010 Argentine Census identified 519 people of Vilela heritage in Argentina, 359 of them in the province of Santiago del Estero.

He became Bishop's Secretary in St. Gallen in 1967 and then Bishop's Vicar in 1969. In 1971 he helped found the Working Community of Christian Churches in Switzerland, a body of the National Council of Churches. In 1972 he was the president of the Swiss and diocesan synods. He was General Secretary of the Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe from 1977 to 1995. He became a cathedral deacon in 1991. F√ºrer was elected bishop of St. Gallen on 28 March 1995 and appointed to that position the next day by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated a bishop on 5 June 1995 by Bishop Otmar M√§der with Bishops Henri Salina and Karl Lehmann as co-consecrators. In 1995 F√ºrer and Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini of Milan guided the formation of a group of about a dozen like-minded cardinals and bishops who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen to discuss church reforms, including the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops' conferences, the primacy of the papacy, and sexual morality. They differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was not the sort of candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave. Though some media reports discussed this as a conspiracy, F√ºrer said in 2015 that it was a circle of friends (Freundeskreise) that at first discussed church policy and then also candidates for the papacy as the health of Pope John Paul II declined. He said it last met in 2006. The diocese presents an archive of its press releases. The press release of the diocese is \\"Sensationsmeldung?\\" (\\"Sensational News?\\") dated 30 September 2015 and at the bottom of that is a link to F√ºrer's statement \\"Erkl√§rungen von em. Bischof Ivo F√ºrer\\" (\\"Explanations by Bishop emeritus Ivo F√ºrer\\"). As a member of the Swiss Bishops' Conference he was responsible for the Deaconate and Relief Services. Beginning in 1997 headed the Secretariat of the Council of European Bishops' Conferences since 1997. He submitted his resignation on his 75th birthday, and Pope Benedict XVI accepted it on 16 October 2005. In 2005, the University of Fribourg awarded him an honorary doctorate in recognition of his contribution to implementing the principles of the Second Vatican Council in Switzerland and in Europe. In 2007 the University of St. Gallen named him an Honorary Senator for \\"his important contribution towards the promotion of openness and tolerance across the borders of denominations and cultures\\". From 1998 to 2009 he served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Swiss Catholic Lenten Fund (Fastenopfer), a Roman Catholic charity based in Lucerne that fights hunger and poverty and promotes the development of a sustainable way of life.

He also works in sculpture, photography, video and installation. He has been a two-time finalist in the Wynne Prize, won the Woollahra Small Sculpture Prize, and been named as the Art Gallery of NSW Director‚Äôs Choice Winner at Sculpture by the Sea three times. In 2015, Seton was awarded a Grand Jury prize at the Fondation Fran√ßois Schneider ‚ÄòContemporary Talents‚Äô competition. He was the Inaugural Nancy Fairfax Artist in Residence, Margaret Olley Art Centre, Tweed River Art Gallery, Murwillumbah, in 2014; and in 2012 participated in the Omi International Arts Center residency program in New York. Seton lives and works in Newtown, an inner suburb of Sydney, Australia.  Early life and education Seton was born in Sydney, Australia. He is one of four brothers, one of whom, Ben Seton, is an actor. He was raised in Sydney and attended the exclusive school St. Ignatius Riverview. His family's rural property is at Wombeyan Caves located in the Southern Highlands (New South Wales). This rural upbringing saw him raised near the Wombeyan Caves Marble Quarry, which operated continuously from 1915 ‚Äì 1997 before being closed due to decreasing demand and environmental concerns. Seton has credited this early exposure to marble with his interest in the medium. His mother left Cairo in the 1960s after it had become a socialist republic under Gamal Abdel Nasser's government to settle in Australia. Growing up listening to stories of displacement fostered a strong interest in migration and his mother's relocation to Australia, something he continues to explore through his art works. Seton honed his craft through internships and residencies with Italian carving studios, an experience that continues to influence his work. He graduated in Art History and Theory from the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales, in 1998. Career Seton is known for his use of marble and traditional carving techniques in contemporary ways, which has positioned him as one of Australia‚Äôs foremost living sculptors. He frequently works directly with contemporary political issues, such as Australia‚Äôs treatment of asylum seekers, and questions of conflict and nationhood. In 2017, his work Refuge was included in the Kochi- Muziris Biennale (India) following exhibition in Paris in 2016 as part of The Journey at Galerie Paris Beijing. 2017 also saw a survey exhibition of Seton‚Äôs works about asylum seekers at Newcastle Art Gallery, called The Island. In 2014 he participated in the Adelaide Biennial: Dark Heart, producing the large sculptural installation Someone died trying to have a life like mine, twenty- eight life inflatable jackets made in marble. The installation referenced an event of May 2013, in which 28 life jackets were found washed ashore the Cocos Islands, a known departure point for refugees attempting to reach Australia by boat. The work garnered critical and popular acclaim, and was acquired by the Art Gallery of South Australia. In 2011 the Australian War Memorial acquired and commissioned the ongoing work As of today (2011‚Äì14), which is composed of one folded marble flag for every Australian casualty in Operation Slipper in Afghanistan. This work reflects Seton‚Äôs interest in Australian politics, ideas of patriotism and nationalism and the symbols attributed to them. Seton has also regularly shown at art fairs both in Australia and internationally. He has exhibited in the last five Hong Kong and Art HK fairs, as well as participated in Sydney Contemporary, Art International Istanbul, Art Stage Singapore, Art Paris, and Art Stage Jakarta. In 2012 Seton showed his solo exhibition Elegy on Resistance at Art HK, featuring as its centerpiece Soloist (2012), a lone hooded figure sitting cross-legged. Soloist garnered Seton considerable mainstream appeal, having been shared extensively on sites like Reddit.

He is best known for his association with William Kidd. History Tempest Rogers was born in 1672 or 1675, and by 1693 had married Johanna Little in London. Three years later he was master of the Fidelia, sailing to the American colonies. He was suspected of sailing from Rhode Island to St. Mary's on Madagascar, which had long been a known pirate trading post. He may have sailed alongside another Rhode Island pirate, Thomas Wake, who was also bound for Madagascar and the Indian Ocean to eventually sail with Henry Every. Rogers was dispatched from London in 1697 to the East Indies to set up a factory on behalf of the ship's owners; on the way back in July 1698 he stopped at St. Mary's again. While there William Kidd called on the port to switch his leaky Adventure Galley for his newly captured Quedagh Merchant, renamed to Adventure Prize. Rogers met with Kidd privately then offloaded troublesome crewman Edward Davis (or Davies), telling him he'd send a boat but putting to sea and abandoning Davis there instead. Davis sailed with Kidd rather than remain on Madagascar; once they returned to New York, he was arrested with the rest of Kidd's crew and sent to London for trial. Acquitted, Davis returned to piracy by 1702 under the command of Nicholas Brown. When Kidd sailed to the Caribbean on his way back to New York before his capture, he stopped to offload a great deal of his captured loot. Rogers apparently met with Kidd and bought or took possession of his plunder, possibly by prior arrangement. Rogers then traded the Fidelia to William Symes (or Syms) for Symes‚Äô own sloop; after sailing north, Governor Bellomont of New York in 1699 seized the Fidelia on suspicion of carrying stolen goods. Bellomont thought Symes, a known criminal, may have murdered Rogers and stolen the Fidelia. Rogers himself had been seized by Governor Read Elding of the Bahamas, and revealed that he'd sent his London backers over ¬£27,000. Bellomont observed, ‚ÄúTempest Rogers, it‚Äôs to be feared, was not sent from London on an honest design.‚Äù By the early 1700s Rogers was living in South Carolina, likely in Charleston.Coincidentally, this had also been the one-time home of Richard Want, another pirate who‚Äôd sailed to Madagascar with Thomas Wake to fight alongside Henry Every. Rogers died sometime on or before 1704, when his widow Johanna married Richard Oglethorpe, a ‚Äúbroken rascally fellow ‚Ä¶ a person of a very scandalous life.‚Äù Oglethorpe wrote a letter to Secretary of State Charles Hedges (‚ÄúAn account of persons trading with pirates‚Äù) in which he repeated the accusations that Rogers had dealt with Kidd, naming others who he claimed had bought Kidd's goods from Rogers, and claiming Rogers had bought Dutch citizenship in order to trade with the French and Spanish as a neutral party, and that he had \\"since dyed amongst ye French.\\" A few months later, Oglethorpe was granted administration of Rogers‚Äô estate in South Carolina.

Biography  Joseph Midiburo was born in 1930 in Bwisha, Rutshuru Territory, Belgian Congo. He could speak Kinyarwanda. He underwent four years of secondary education and took correspondence courses on accounting. Midiburo founded the Rassemblement de l'Est du Congo (RECO/REKO) party, which later merged with the Centre du Regroupement Africain (CEREA). He subsequently became a vice president of the party. He served on the Executive College of the Goma territory. Midiburo was elected to the first Congolese Chamber of Deputies in May 1960 on a CEREA ticket from the North Kivu constituency. On 21 June he was elected 74 votes to 55 to become the Second Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies. In October he was made a member of a commission assembled by deposed Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba tasked with managing his relations with the United Nations Operation in the Congo. He briefly served in the Stanleyville government from late 1960 until he returned to the capital, L√©opoldville, in mid-1961. Midiburo was elected First Vice- President of the Chamber on 24 July 1961. In October 1962 he was arrested by Cyrille Adoula's government on charges of subversion, but he was released several weeks later. He was elected President of the Chamber on 3 March 1963. In April 1963 Parliament resolved to create a joint committee to prepare revisions for the constitution. Though the presiding officers of both houses nominally chaired the committee together, Midiburo was left responsible for leading the panel. He served as President of the Chamber until September 1965. He took part in organising the Conference Nationale Souveraine of the early 1990s. Midiburo died on 13 June 2008 while receiving medical care in Kinshasa in the presence of his son, Adolphe.

Military career  Al-Werfalli began his career in the Libyan Army in 2000 after graduating from the country's military college. He eventually became a member of the elite al-Saiqa unit and remained a member when the Libyan Civil War against Gaddafi's rule began in 2011. Soon thereafter al-Saiqa, under the command of Wanis Bukhmada, defected and joined the rebels. Following the end of Gaddafi's rule, al-Saiqa aligned itself with the Libyan National Army, led by Khalifa Haftar, and fought against the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries in and around the city of Benghazi from 2014 to 2017 in a battle for control of the city. By at least 2017, al- Werfalli was a regional commander of al-Saiqa and oversees at least one detention center. In that year al-Werfalli gained international notoriety by appearing in videos posted by al-Saiqa's social media accounts that depicted him executing or ordering the execution of prisoners. In total 7 videos were published. One video in particular depicted the execution of 20 men. Al- Werfalli's actions were singled out by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which documented several of these incidents and called for a full investigation.  International Criminal Court charge  Mahmoud al-Werfalli was indicted on 15 August 2017 with the war crime of murder with regard to the situation in Libya. The arrest warrant against him alleges that he \\"appears to be directly responsible for the killing of, in total, 33 persons in Benghazi or surrounding areas, between on or before 3 June 2016 and on or around 17 July 2017, either by personally killing them or by ordering their execution.\\" The arrest warrant notes that in seven incidents, which were videoed and posted on al-Saiqa's social media accounts, al-Werfalli either appeared to order the execution, or conducted the execution himself, of prisoners. The Court notes in the arrest warrant that \\"the executions were exceptionally cruel, dehumanising and degrading.\\" Two days after the Court issued the warrant of arrest, the Libyan National Army (LNA) announced that it had arrested al-Werfalli and that he was under investigation. On 24 January 2018, he was accused of executing 10 prisoners in Benghazi.http://www.libyanexpress.com/icc-wanted-libyan-commander-mahmoud-al- werfalli-conducts-summary-executions-of-10-prisoners-in-benghazi/ Automatically after that, an Interpol red notice against him, on behalf of International Criminal Court, was issued. , al-Werfalli had not been transferred to the custody of the ICC.

It usually has some type of consistent structure and can take place at a school, a tutoring center, or at home. The tutor can be a professional, paraprofessional, volunteer, or family member. Reading Tutoring can be used for all ages, and is dependent on reading ability and/or level.  Where tutoring takes place  *Tutoring Centers. There are tutoring centers specific to reading, reading for students with disabilities, or multiple school subjects. *Schools. Some schools offer tutoring during or after the school day. *Home. Tutors may visit a child‚Äôs home, or family members may tutor children in reading.  Types of tutors  *Professionals: This type of tutor will have a teaching credential, a reading certificate, and/or a reading specialist credential *Paraprofessionals: This type of tutor may have been trained in certain aspects of reading tutoring, but has not been credentialed, nor do they have certification. See: Paraprofessional educator *Volunteers: A tutor may be a volunteer that was trained to carry out a reading program. *Family Members: A family member may be considered a tutor when they implement specific tutoring practices with a child during at home reading practice.  U.S. Legislation that impacts reading tutoring  In response to the high rate of students reading below their grade level in the United States, the America Reads Challenge Act of 1997 was proposed. Its main goal was to get children to appropriate reading levels by the time they left third grade (‚ÄúAmerica Reads Challenge Act,‚Äù 1997).3 The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 had the goal of getting all students to a proficient level in both reading and math by closing the achievement gap. It has now been replaced with the Every Student Succeeds Act at the end of 2015.  Research on the effectiveness of reading tutoring  = General = Much of the research that can be found on tutoring programs is implemented in kindergarten, or first grade, through the third grade. Generally, empirical research finds that students who are tutored perform better on reading assessments at the end of the year relative to their untutored peers. Reading tutoring is usually geared toward students that are considered at-risk or below their grade level in reading achievement. To obtain the desirable higher achievement outcomes for students, tutors‚Äîvolunteer, family members, and paraprofessionals‚Äîmust be trained properly on reading correction procedures. = Examples of correction procedures = *Ask the student to sound out an unknown word that is phonetically regular, and only supply sounds, or the whole word, once the student has tried on their own. Then have the student practice the word on its own, and then in the sentence it was found in *Remind the student of rules that may help them figure out how to properly pronounce a word *Supply a word that is phonetically irregular. Then have the student practice the word on its own, and then in the sentence it was found in = Parents as tutors = There are conflicting results in research on this subject. One study found that parents using either children‚Äôs books or school materials had no significant impact on the child‚Äôs reading achievement level (Powell-Smith et al., 2000). Other studies have found that when parents are trained in proper tutoring procedures they can positively impact their child‚Äôs reading achievement level  Examples of reading tutoring programs being implemented  *Everyone A Reader: San Diego, California (‚ÄúEveryone a Reader,‚Äù n.d.) *Start Making a Reader Today (SMART): Oregon (‚ÄúStart Making,‚Äù n.d.) *Reading Partners: California, Colorado, Washington, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Maryland, New York, and Washington, DC References Category:Learning to read ","title":"Reading tutoring"},{"id":"54917714","text":"Gabriel Oscar Giron Villarreal (born 27 February 1988) is a Mexican professional basketball player.

Fr√©mont of Virginia. History =Background= The expansionist movement of the 1840s motivated many Americans to work to push America's borders out into land claimed by Spain, Mexico, Britain, and Native American tribes. \\"Manifest Destiny\\", a term coined by journalist John O'Sullivan, captured the idea that the young American nation was destined to rule all of the North American continent. Democratic Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri was a prominent leader of this movement, into which he enlisted his son-in-law, John C. Fr√©mont. Benton obtained government funding for several expeditions led by Fr√©mont to map and explore the western territory. In 1845, Captain Fr√©mont was sent by the War Department on an expedition to survey the Great Basin and Alta California, a possession of Mexico. Upon arriving in California, Fr√©mont and his men moved about the northern half of the state for several months, provoking the Mexican authorities and building up patriotic sentiment among Americans who had settled there. =Incident= On 30 March 1846, the band arrived at the Lassen Ranch in the upper Sacramento Valley. There they met Americans who claimed that an encampment of Indians was preparing to attack White settlers. Fr√©mont moved his men up the Sacramento River in search of such Indians. The party reached Reading's Ranch (near present-day Redding, California) on 5 April 1846 and spotted a large Indian camp, likely of the Wintu tribe. Captain Fr√©mont ordered an advance on the Indians, with every one of his men carrying a rifle, two pistols, and a knife. The Wintu were unable to flee the camp as the majority of their ranks were women and children and they were pinned against the river. The men of the Wintu camp formed a defensive line with the women and children behind them. Expedition member Thomas E. Breckenridge states that \\"the order was given to ask no quarter and to give none.\\" Fr√©mont's men lined up and began firing several rifle volleys, slaughtering the Indians in front of them. The long range of the rifles rendered it impossible for the Indians' arrows to reach them. The men then approached towards the camp, fired another volley at closer range, and rushed in with their sabers and pistols. Breckenridge writes: > The settlers charged into the village taking the warriors by surprise and > then commenced a scene of slaughter which is unequalled in the West. The > bucks, squaws and paposes were shot down like sheep and those men never > stopped as long as they could find one alive. The remaining Indians were forced to flee, with some running for the hills and others braving the river. Eyewitness William Isaac Tustin reports that men of Fr√©mont's band mounted on horses chased down the running Indians and tomahawked them to death, while riflemen stood on the shores of the river and took potshots at the Indians trying to swim to safety. He described the scene as \\"a slaughter.\\" Estimates of the casualties vary. Expedition members Thomas E. Breckenridge and Thomas S. Martin claim the number of Indians killed as \\"120-150\\" and \\"over 175\\" respectively, but the eyewitness Tustin claimed that at least 600-700 Indians were killed on land, with another 200 or more dying in the water. There are no records of any expedition members being killed or even wounded in the massacre. Kit Carson, one of the mounted attackers, later stated, \\"It was a perfect butchery.\\" Breckenridge, who claims not to have participated, laments: > I think that I hate an Indian as badly as anybody and have as good reason to > hate them, but I don't think that I could have assisted in that slaughter. > It takes two to fight or quarrel but in that case there was but one side > fighting and the other side trying to escape. =Repercussions= Neither Fr√©mont nor any of his expedition members were charged or punished in any way for the killings. Several expedition members suggested that the massacre led local Indians to fear the White men and avoid raiding the settlements and ranches that American settlers had begun erecting on Indian land. Aftermath Fr√©mont and his band continued up the Sacramento River, killing Indians on sight as they went. The Klamath people they met further north in Oregon Territory eventually retaliated and killed 2-3 members of Fr√©mont's party on the night of 9 May 1846, leading to the Klamath Lake massacre three days later. On 9 May 1846 Fr√©mont received word that war with Mexico was imminent. He quickly returned from Oregon to participate, killing several more Sacramento Valley Indians in the journey south in the Sutter Buttes massacre. By August 1846 American military officers had fully occupied the northern half of the state, and by December all of modern California was under American control. John C. Fr√©mont became Military Governor of California in January 1847, but was forced to give up the position less than two months later under disputed circumstances. In 1850 Fr√©mont became California's first U.S. Senator. Fr√©mont, who in the meantime had become wealthy off of gold mining claims, wrote a bill limiting gold mining claims to White citizens of the United States. In 1856 Fr√©mont was nominated as the Republican candidate for President, losing the race to James Buchanan. He later fought as a Union general during the Civil War. While some locals had admired the massacre, the wealthy landed settlers were beginning to depend on Indian labor in a sort of feudal system, with the Indians working both as free and as bonded labor. To some degree this saved the local Wintu from immediate annihilation, though smaller scale massacres occurred as early as the next year. By the 1850s, White American animosity at Indian possession of the land had built, and large-scale massacres involving hundreds of Wintu deaths recommenced, including the Kabyai Creek massacre, the Old Shasta Town massacre and the Bridge Gulch massacre.

Fr√©mont and Kit Carson. History =Background= The expansionist movement of the 1840s motivated many Americans to work to push America's borders out into land claimed by Spain, Mexico, Britain, and Native American tribes. \\"Manifest Destiny\\", a term coined by journalist John O'Sullivan, captured the idea that the young American nation was destined to rule all of the North American continent. Democratic Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri was a prominent leader of this movement, into which he enlisted his son-in-law, John C. Fr√©mont. Benton obtained government funding for several expeditions led by Fr√©mont to map and explore the western territory. In 1845, Captain Fr√©mont was sent by the War Department on an expedition to survey the Great Basin and Alta California, a possession of Mexico. Upon arriving in California, Fr√©mont and his men moved about the northern half of the state for several months, provoking the Mexican authorities and building up patriotic sentiment among Americans who had settled there. On 5 April 1846 Fr√©mont and his men committed the Fr√©mont massacre on the banks of the Sacramento River near present-day Redding, California. They then proceeded north up the Sacramento River Valley and into Oregon Territory. =Incident= Fr√©mont and his band had taken to killing Native Americans on sight as they traveled. Expedition member Thomas S. Martin stated in his memoirs, \\"We followed up the Sac. river killing plenty of game, and an occasional indian. Of the latter we made it a rule to spare none of the bucks.\\" Expedition member Thomas E. Breckenridge said that the men \\"had orders while in camp or on the move to shoot Indians on sight. While on the march the crack of a rifle and the dying yell of a native was not an unusual occurrence.\\" On the night of 9 May 1846 a band of 15-20 Klamath natives retaliated and attacked Fr√©mont's group under cover of darkness, killing 2-3 members of the party. Fr√©mont now \\"determined to square accounts with these people.\\" His scouts killed two Klamath warriors on 11 May 1846, but Fr√©mont considered that inadequate. On 12 May 1846, Fr√©mont's assistant Kit Carson led an assault on a Klamath village named Dokdokwas on the shores of Klamath Lake. The assailants destroyed the village and killed at least 14 villagers, without taking a single casualty themselves. =Repercussions= Neither Fr√©mont nor any of his expedition members were charged or punished in any way for the killings. Orders from the U.S. government recalled Fr√©mont back to California to participate in the war against Mexico, and he did not return to Oregon territory. Aftermath Fr√©mont and his band continued to kill Native Americans on sight on the way back down to California, and committed a \\"preemptive\\" attack on a rancheria (see Sutter Buttes massacre). John C. Fr√©mont became Military Governor of California in January 1847, but was forced to give up the position less than two months later. In 1850 Fr√©mont became California's first U.S. Senator. In 1856 Fr√©mont was nominated as the Republican candidate for President, losing the race to James Buchanan. He later fought as a Union general during the Civil War. The Klamath peoples continued to be subject to violence from White settlers, including a long string of similar massacres and attacks. By 1855, the Humboldt Times reported that miners were \\"determined to commence an indiscriminate massacre of all the Indians\\" in the Klamath watershed, while the Sacramento Daily Union reported that \\"people look upon it there as a war of extermination, and are killing all grown up males.\\" Judge Fletcher of Klamath County stated of fleeing natives that \\"whites are hunting them down like deer.\\" Captain H.M. Judah reported men advocating, \\"the total extermination of all the Indians in this section.\\"quoted in In 1864 the Klamath people were forced to give up claims to twenty million of the twenty-two million acres they had lived on, with the remaining two million acres forming the Klamath Reservation. They became financially self-sufficient on this land, due to a profitable timber mill, cattle ranching, and other enterprises. In 1954 an Act of Congress (against the will of the Klamath people) terminated the tribal status of the Klamath, forcing them to give up their claim to the land and lose all federal services in exchange for a monetary payoff. In 1986 their tribal status was restored, but their land was not returned.

King, Sarah Vaughn, Elton John and Ray Charles. * * He is a former art director for Famous Music (1970), ABC-Dunhill (1972), and Paramount Records. Early life and education Mazur was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up on Long Island. He began drawing at the age of 5. He studied at the Philadelphia College of Art for three years. He is of Jewish ancestry. His nephew is musician Epic Mazur. Career In 1995, he hosted an event for Billboard, during which they called him a \\"world famous artist.\\"  Mazur created \\"thousands\\" of album covers during the 1970s. These covers included The Rolling Stones' 1972 single, \\"Tumbling Dice\\", and albums by B.B. King, Jimmy Buffett, Dave Mason, Dusty Springfield, and Elton John. Mazur also created the cover for the soundtrack to the 1971 film, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. In a 2004 interview with the Las Vegas Sun, Mazur cited the increasingly \\"formula[ic]\\" creation of album covers which started during the late 1980s as the reason that he started painting. In the mid 1990s, he created a painting of a model with a cigar in her hand a suggested addition by a friend that was purchased by Saudi Arabian Prince Mohammed Al-sudairy before the paint had dried. = Tongue and Mouth disputed authorship = The authorship of the Rolling Stones' \\"Tongue and Mouth\\" logo is a matter of dispute. While The New York Times and others have previously stated that John Pasche created it, period sources have indicated otherwise. New York Daily News and Florida Today state it was Mazur who created the logo, while the Ottawa Citizen has listed both Mazur and Andy Warhol as probable creators. = Feud with Jagger = Since the 1980s, Mazur has been in a feud with Mick Jagger after Jagger allegedly refused to give him trademark rights to the \\"Tumbling Dice\\" cover, which he created. He was paid $10,000 by Jagger for the artwork, but says he asked several times for Jagger to give him the rights to the trademarked art. In the 1990s, Mazur attempted to sue Jagger for trademark infringement, but the statute of limitations had passed. It is estimated he could have earned in excess of $100 million from the album art if he possessed the trademark rights. After the suicide of Jagger's girlfriend L'Wren Scott in 2014, Mazur wrote a harshly worded post on Facebook, that he soon deleted. In an interview with Page Six afterwards, Mazur called Jagger a \\"very bad guy\\", and stated he succumbed to depression and suicidal ideation when he could not get the trademark to his artwork from Jagger. > \\"In the late '80s, I was living in New York, going to the clubs and being > introduced as the creator of the ‚Äòmouth and tongue‚Äô for the Stones, and then > go home to my dumpy apartment. I was balls-off-my-ass broke, having created > the most famous logo in the world.\\" - Ruby Mazur In response, a representative for Jagger told Page Six \\"this person made a business deal decades ago. How sad and contemptible that they would use this time of personal loss to gain attention.\\"  Personal life  Mazur has four children. His three sons are Matisse and twin brothers Cezanne and Miro. His daughter Monet is an American actress and model. He moved from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Gilbert, Arizona, in 2006. He currently resides in Maui, Hawaii.

A study by Alex Casillas has identified that \\"FGCS [‚Ä¶] face greater pressure not to go to college, either because of a lack of role models or because of pressure to contribute to their family‚Äôs financial needs.\\" Many interventions are being explored to lower and/or remove the fears and struggles FGCS face regarding their education. These interventions are intended to bridge the gap between FGCS and their educational experience by providing them with the access to information and resources their non-first-generation peers already have. This article discusses three of the programs currently being implemented, including AVID, GEAR-UP, and after-school programs. First-generation college students FGCS are defined as those whose parents‚Äô highest level of education is a high school diploma.Nunez, A.M., Cuccaro-Alamin, S., & Carroll, C.D. (1998). First- generation students: Undergraduates whose parents never enrolled in postsecondary education. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. This group of students is getting larger in the United States at the same time as educational opportunities become more accessible to students on high school campuses. There are educational interventions that have been found to help FGCS from immigrant families reach higher education. A descriptive analysis was conducted to examine how several variables influence the persistence and attainment rates of first-generation college students compared to non-first generation college students. The researchers were interested in the effects that gender, age, socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, and institutional type had on the persistence and attainment rates of first-generation college students. Results from the analysis concluded that first-generation college students persisted and attained postsecondary degrees at significantly lower rates than students whose parents did graduate from college. Educational interventions for FGCS have included interventions like AVID, GEAR-UP, and after‚Äìschool programs. AVID program The Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program has become a national educational intervention for first-generation college students in U.S. public middle and high schools. The AVID curriculum was developed on the foundation of research developed and presented by David T. Conley in his book College Knowledge,Conley, D.T. (2005). College Knowledge: What It Really Takes for Students to Succeed and what We Can Do to Get Them Ready. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. which states that American education consists of two systems created independently of each other (high school and college), that have not worked collaboratively to benefit all students regardless of their race-ethnicity or socioeconomic status. AVID‚Äôs goal is for all of their students to gain acceptance into a 4-year university course. In order to achieve this goal, AVID's curriculum was developed in alignment with David T. Conley‚Äôs Knowledge and Skills for University Success (KSUS) Standards. Conley‚Äôs KSUS Standards recommend that students complete the course requirements that have been created in collaboration with U.C./C.S.U. schools as a result of this research. In addition, a quasi-experimental research design was used to explore the effects the AVID program had on students' attitudes toward school, self-efficacy, self-reported grades, time spent on homework, educational goals, and academic motivation. Two schools were randomly assigned to the AVID program while one school continued with the traditional high school curriculum. The study found significant differences between the schools that implemented the AVID program and the one that did not. Results found the AVID program students spent significantly more time on homework and on college plans than students from the school that did not implement AVID as an educational intervention.Black, Anne C., Little, Catherine A., McCoach, D. Betsy, Purcell, Jeanne H., & Siegle, Del. (2008). Advancement via Individual Determination: Method Selection in Conclusions about Program Effectiveness. Journal of Educational Research, 102(2), 111-124. AVID has significantly increased the number of FGCS accepted into college (Swanson et. al., 1993).Swanson, M. C., Mehan, H., & Hubbard, L. (1993, December). The AVID classroom: A system of academic and social supports for low-achieving students. (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED368832) GEAR-UP Program The Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Program (GEAR-UP) is another evidence-based intervention that promotes higher education for low-income students in U.S. public middle schools. GEAR-UP is a federally-funded program that has been implemented nationwide at schools in low-income neighborhoods. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Education, parents and students who attended a GEAR-UP school have increased knowledge concerning routes to higher education. In addition, the researchers found that GEAR-UP students enrolled more often in algebra and more advanced sciences classes in the 8th grade than non-GEAR-UP students.Standing, Kim, United States. Department of Education. Policy Program Studies Service, & Westat, Inc. (2008). Early outcomes of the GEAR UP program: Final report. Washington, D.C.]: U.S. Dept. of Education, Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development, Policy and Program Studies Service. After-school programs After-school programs may also be used as a form of educational intervention for FGCS. Programs after school provide students with additional opportunities to be part of the school culture. There are programs like Umoja to help give back to the community and help people succeed in life by uplifting others. The Bridge Project study examined the academic and psychosocial effects on students who participated in an after-school program for 25 English-language-learner Mexican immigrant children, from prekindergarten through 6th grade . The results of the study found children‚Äôs reading comprehension increased by an average of 2.8 grade levels and their English proficiency by an average of 2.8 California English Language Development Test levels over a 2-year period.McElvain, Cheryl Marie.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1974. Overview During the early to middle J≈çmon period (approximately 4000 to 2500 BC), sea levels were five to six meters higher than at present, and the ambient temperature was also 2 deg C higher. During this period, the T≈çhoku region was inhabited by the J≈çmon people, many of whom lived in coastal settlements. The middens associated with such settlements contain bone, botanical material, mollusc shells, sherds, lithics, and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with the now-vanished inhabitants, and these features, provide a useful source into the diets and habits of J≈çmon society. Most of these middens are found along the Pacific coast of Japan, and the rocky ria coast of Miyagi Prefecture was densely settled from the early through late J≈çmon period. Located on the northwest shore of Matsushima Bay, this shell midden is on a small peninsula about 15 meters from the current coastline. The midden measures 130 meters from east-west and 200 meters from north-south. As with the nearby Satohama shell mound, it is considered a type site for J≈çmon period artifacts in the southern Tohoku region. Excavation in 1959 to 1960 and from 1966 to 1967 found remains from the early through the late J≈çmon period, extending through the Yayoi period, Kofun period and into the early Heian period, indicating continuous occupation of this site for many thousands of years. Artifacts included bone fish hooks, harpoons and swords made from bone, along with the bones of deer and wild boar. A number of human remains were also found. Some of the earthenware pots found at the site appear to have been used for the production of sea salt. The midden is now part of the Nishinohama Historical Site Park; however, the midden itself site backfilled after excavation, and there is now nothing to see except for a stone monument and plaque. The site is located about 14 minutes on foot from Takagimachi Station on the JR East Senseki Line.

The text is in the 5th-century official history Book of Later Han, and the inscription was rediscovered by researchers in the Baruun Ilgen hills located south of Inil/Inel (modern Delgerkhangai) mountain, which is in the Gobi desert of Dundgovi Province, Mongolia. History In the first year of Emperor Yongyuan (89 AD), the imperial brother-in-law, General of Chariots and Cavalry Dou Xian, led the joint army of the Han and its allies (Southern Xiongnu, Wuhuan, Di and Qiang) in a battle against the Northern Xiongnu at the Altai Mountains. The battle was a decisive victory for the Han. After the battle, Dou Xian held a memorial ceremony for the Tian at Mount Yanran. He ordered inscriptions to be carved on the cliff face to commemorate the victory. The text was composed by the historian Ban Gu, a member of his staff. The full text was recorded in the Bibliography of Dou Rong (great-grandfather of Dou Xian), chapter 23 of Book of the Later Han. The inscription starts with a relatively long account of the battle, and concludes with five lines of Chu Ci style poetry. Cultural significance Cliff inscriptions on Baruun ingen (West visible) hills in south of Inel (Delgerkhangai) mountains were commonly used to record military success in ancient China. The inscription of Yanran is one of the best known. The expression \\"to carve a stone on Yanran\\" () was regarded as one of the highest achievements for military generals. Rediscovery Mongolian travel journalist/writer Badamsambuu.G found a cliff with inscriptions in 27 June 2001 and showed on national TV, but researchers were unable to decode the text. It was finally identified in June 2016 by a team that was led by professor Mr. Battulga.Ts from National University of Mongolia. Thus the article \\"Ancient inscription at Baruun ilgen hills\\" by Battulga.Ts, Badamsambuu.G, Batjargal.B was published. Then in August 2017, a joint team from Chinggis Khan University, Mongolia, and Inner Mongolia University, China have also expedited the area. The lead archaeologist was Professor Chimeddorji of Inner Mongolia University. Written in typical Han clerical script, the inscription comprises 260 Chinese characters, of which 220 are legible. The text is identical to the recorded text in the Book of the Later Han.

It is a metallole with reduced aromatic character compared to thiophene. Nomenclature Atoms in selenophene are numbered sequentially around the ring, starting with the selenium atom as number 1 following normal systematic nomenclature rules. Oxidized forms include selenophene 1,1-dioxide. Related ring structures include those with only one double bond (2-selenolene and 3-selenolene) and the fully saturated structure selenolane. Production Although Ida Foa claimed to have made selenophene in 1909, the first confirmed production was by Mazza and Solazzo in 1927. They heated acetylene and selenium together at about 300 ¬∞C. The selenium burst into flame, and up to 15% selenophene was formed, along with selenonaphthene. Another way to make it is from furan heated with hydrogen selenide and aluminium at 400 ¬∞C. Substituted selenophenes can be made using a Fiesselman procedure in which a Œ≤-chloro-aldehyde reacts with sodium selenide, and then ethyl bromoacetate. Properties The selenophene molecule is flat and aromatic. Being aromatic, it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions at the 2- or 2,5-positions. These reactions are slower than that of furan, but faster than thiophene.

It includes content in Korean and English (with subtitles in both languages) describing the reactions of English people to aspects of Korean culture and food. The channel initially introduced Korean food to their English friends who had never tasted it before; most famously introducing them to fire noodles and challenging them to eat it. It later developed into the: Fire Noodle Challenge. The channel introduced a variety Korean food to celebrities in the form of short interviews, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Tom Holland, Pom Klementieff, Ryan Reynolds, Will Smith, David Beckham and two actors from Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Taron Egerton and Mark Strong. At first, the channel mostly had Korean viewers, but now has a more global audience. Initially, Kendal was rarely seen on screen in videos, as he was in charge of filming and editing, while his friend Carrott (an Englishman who lived in Korea) served as the main host of the show. Over time, however, Kendal began to appear more often and now co-hosts many of their videos. Kendal, Carrott's best friend and his ‚Äúfirst wife‚Äú, is now many viewers favourite; being much loved by the channel‚Äôs subscribers, also on their second channel that represents their lives in England, called JOLLY: the combination of both of their first names, Josh and Ollie.

He also enjoys spending time with his family, walking in the country, riding quad bike, playing real tennis and eating cheese. He has 10.3 thousand followers on his Instagram @olliesfather. Oliver's mother's name is Jane. She has not been featured on his Instagram or Youtube channel, but has been mentioned several times. Oliver has a younger brother called Patrick Kendal and a younger sister. Elizabeth Anne Kendal, popularly called Lizzie, is Oliver's wife. He met her in Secondary school and was married to her at the age of 21. Lizzie Kendal is an artist and museum and gallery learning facilitator based in London.

She has been associated with pineapples and has received multiple pineapple related presents from all over the world. She loves fluffy things, strawberries, aquariums and the colour yellow.

Education and career of Oliver Kendal started as he attended SOAS with Carrott where he did some studies related to Human Psychology, including materials related to Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. He also has a masters in an unknown subject. He got a job as the director of This is growth LTD on December 3rd 2014 and resigned on 12 January 2017. He also had a part-time job and was also managing a debt advice centre for a while when the duo started their career as YouTubers on 10 August 2013 after uploading their video on their channel ÏòÅÍµ≠ÎÇ®Ïûê (Korean Englishman) which currently has 4.0M subscribers (as of October 2020). Kendal has opened up in many videos about the anxiety he suffered from during this time due to the enormous workload, in one of which he recalled having panic attacks. On 13 February 2017, they started another channel called JOLLY that has reached 2.15M subscribers (as of October 2020). All videos are subtitled in English and Korean. Often featured on the channels is guest Reverend Christopher Lee (popularly known as Rev. Chris), Ollie's brother-in-law. Reverend Chris' twin brother, Major Charles Lee, also occasionally features on their channels, co- starring with Rev. Chris in a 2019 series titled 'British TWINS Come to Korea!! (Priest + Commando)'.  Jolly  Jolly (stylised as JOLLY) started more as a smaller channel of Korean Englishman. Unlike Korean Englishman, the newer channel Jolly, started in 2015, which represents a portmanteau of their names Josh and Ollie as well as the English word \\"Jolly\\" as it is, is equally co-hosted by the two with Kendal taking a more prominent role on the screen, as the co-host, compared to their main channel. While the style of the videos on the Korean Englishman channel has a higher production value than Jolly, Jolly was created to have a more communicative and personal feel to viewers, more casually through experimental contents in shorter and simpler videos. Jolly is also different from Korean Englishman because it focuses on seasonal shows; whereas the latter is often a themed series of videos. While JOLLY is a mix of Mukbang (eating broadcasts), reaction, interviews with famous celebrities, mail/box opening, and vlogging channel, Korean Englishman focuses on the Korean culture, having people come to Korea to experience the food and customs, or Carrott and crew travelling to other countries to experience what Korean food is like in other countries, or Carrott introducing Korean food and culture to famous people, friends, family, loved ones from his home in England, in Korean-styled restaurants in London, or amongst the English public. Unlike Korean Englishman, JOLLY episodes are divided into seasons, from Season 1 to Season 12 (as of January 2020), each season being indicated by a unique arrangement of 5 colours below the big \\"JOLLY\\" text during the introduction. Episode numbers are indicated with Roman Numerals. As of 25 August 2020, JOLLY is on Season 12, Episode 190 (CXC), where Josh and Ollie (Carrott, Kendal) show Rev. Chris (Lee) the game Doom Eternal. JOLLY is also where Kendal learns Korean (Hangeul), in their playlist of 35 videos.

She was a member of the LUCHA (Lutte pour le changement - Struggle for Change) which had been founded in her home town in June 2012. LUCHA was a non-hierarchical non-violent movement for change.

He claimed that Diego Garcia was used by the CIA for \\"nefarious activities\\". He said that he had heard from three US intelligence sources that Diego Garcia was used as \\"a transit site where people were temporarily housed, let us say, and interrogated from time to time\\" and, \\"What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable at the moment\\". In June 2004, the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw stated that United States authorities had repeatedly assured him that no detainees had passed in transit through Diego Garcia or were disembarked there. Diego Garcia was first rumoured to have been one of the locations of the CIA's black sites in 2005. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is one of the \\"high-value detainees\\" suspected to have been held in Diego Garcia. In October 2007, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament announced that it would launch an investigation of continued allegations of a prison camp on Diego Garcia, which it claimed were twice confirmed by comments made by retired United States Army General Barry McCaffrey. On 31 July 2008, an unnamed former White House official alleged that the United States had imprisoned and interrogated at least one suspect on Diego Garcia during 2002 and possibly 2003. The existence of the site was confirmed by US general Barry McCaffrey, and Swiss Senator Dick Marty. Also, Manfred Nowak, one of five of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, says that credible evidence exists supporting allegations that ships serving as black sites have used Diego Garcia as a base. The human rights group Reprieve alleges that United States-operated ships moored outside the territorial waters of Diego Garcia were used to incarcerate and torture detainees. Inmates included Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, and Riduan Isamuddin was held there before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The United Kingdom government, who lease the island to the US, denied any knowledge of the incident, saying that two prisoners had passed through Diego Garcia but the plane they were on had only stopped to refuel. Nasar's location is still unknown since his arrival on Diego Garcia was announced in Spanish newspaper El Pais. On December 9, 2014, the United States Senate Intelligence Committee published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,700 page secret report on the CIA's abuse of its secret prisoners.

In the same year, on the permission of the Holy Synod, an independent parish was established for the church. The first service there was held on the feast of the Trinity. In 1894 a parish school began to function there, and later, under the Soviet government, it was transformed to seven-year school. The church's construction was carried out with funds collected by local dwellers and lasted for about eight years. Father Mikhail was the first priest to serve there. The church was closed in 1938. During the Nazi occupation it was opened, but in 1961 was again closed. Its premises were used as a granary. In 2003, local Cossacks, led by the head of the settlement N.S. Kudinov, officially registered the parish and began to restore the Holy Trinity Church. On September 3, 2008, crosses were erected on dome of the church, and in 2010 bells were also installed. On September 13, 2011, Father Pavel held a festive liturgy. As of 2015, the church was being reconstructed.

The film is based on the true story of Eleanor Riese. Premise The story is about a woman committed to a mental health facility. Prior to 1987, it was assumed that the Lanterman‚ÄìPetris‚ÄìShort Act allowed involuntary treatment for those who were detained under an initial three-day hold (for evaluation and treatment) and a subsequent fourteen-day hospitalization (for those patients declared after the three-day hold to be dangerous to themselves or others or gravely disabled). In 1987, in Riese v. St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center, the California State Court of Appeals declared that these patients had the right to exercise informed consent regarding the use of antipsychotic drugs, except in an emergency, and if they rejected medication \\"a judicial determination of their incapacity to make treatment decisions\\" was required before they could be involuntarily treated. This case was a class action suit brought in the name of patient Eleanor Riese by the California ACLU. Cast Release The film had its world premiere in the Gala Presentations section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. Its theatrical release began in Germany on 3 May 2018. Reception =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 6.83/10.

It is meant to show the relationships of the surviving manuscripts of the Greek text, with special reference to those which are to be taken into account for a critical edition, hence for translations in modern languages, for commentaries, and for any other kind of scholarly reference to the text of the Metaphysics. It is partly conjectural by its own nature and it is an object of lively debate, since these latest years especially. The main controversial question the stemma is meant to answer is the role of the so called beta group of manuscripts of the Metaphysics, described as a separate beta branch in the stemma. Special focus is on manuscript Ab (Laur. 87.12), as opposed to the alpha group of manuscripts (which forms the main part of the tree) and especially to its oldest representative, namely J (Wien Phil. Gr. 100) and E (Paris. Gr. 1853).S. Fazzo, \\"Lo stemma codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele\\", Revue d'Histoire des Textes, XII, 2017, pp. 35-58 The first partial draft of a stemma, including Ab, E, J, has been produced by Alfred Gercke in 1892A. Gercke, \\"Aristoteleum\\", in Wiener Studien, 14, 1892, p. 146-148.. On this basis, 20th century editors, William David Ross (1924) and Werner Jaeger (1957), have taken into account eclectically Ab in the one side and J and E on the other. Different versions of the stemma codicum of the Metaphysics have been proposed since 1970Silvio Bernardinello, Eliminatio Codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele, Padova, Antenore 1970. , most remarkably by Dieter Harlfinger in 1979.D. Harlfinger, \\"Z√ºr √úberlieferungsgeschichte der Metaphysik\\", in P. Aubenque, Essais sur la M√©taphysique d'Aristote, Paris, Vrin 1979, pp. 7-33. According to Harlfinger‚Äôs stemma, current 20th century editions of the Metaphysics (Ross, Jaeger) rely on the most valuable manuscripts for most of the fourteen books, except for the last ones: starting from the final part of the 12th book, they should not have used Ab, but other beta manuscripts instead (M, C), which form no longer a unified group with Ab. In 2010 Silvia Fazzo suggested a revision of Harlfinger‚Äôs stemma according to which manuscript Ab should not be followed in the whole of book 12 either, nor in the final part of book 11. She showed that starting from book 11 chapter 8 already Harlfinger‚Äôs supposed beta manuscripts Ab, M, C do not form any unified group.S. Fazzo, \\"Lo stemma codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele\\", cit.. In 2015 Pantelis Golitsis replied to Fazzo‚Äôs revision showing that starting from book 11 chapter 8 manuscripts M and C can not be regarded as representative of a separate beta branch. Based on unpublished new collations funded by the DFG, Golitsis shows that M and C are heavily collated (others would say ‚Äòcontaminated‚Äô in this case) with various sources including late manuscripts of the alpha group (when this kind of collation is concerned, Golitsis argues that the idea of contamination should be left aside and rejected). He then submitted a revised version of Harlfinger‚Äôs stemma codicum.P. Golitsis, \\"Editing Aristotle‚Äôs Metaphysics: A Response to Silvia Fazzo‚Äôs Critical Appraisal of Oliver Primavesi‚Äôs Edition of Metaphysics Alpha\\", Archiv f√ºr Geschichte der Philosophie, 98 (2016), 458-473. In 2015 Fazzo further argued that neither Ab nor its cognate manuscripts M and C should be followed at all as long as the reading of J and E is not proved to be corrupt. Based on published and available materials she submitted a different stemma where all manuscripts ultimately stem from a unique source, possibly archetype Œ† from which manuscripts J and E are directly derived. As a consequence, a critical editor is left with manuscripts J and E as the most reliable basis.S. Fazzo, \\"Verso una nuova editio minor della Metafisica di Aristotele\\", Chora. Revue d‚ÄôEtudes Anciennes, XIII, 2015. In 2017 Fazzo submitted her stemma to discussion in the Revue d‚ÄôHistoire des Textes, prefaced with a general history of the stemma codicum of the Metaphysics. There she agrees with Golitsis vs. Harlfinger that manuscripts M and C should not be regarded as representative of an independent beta source for the final books of the Metaphysics. Moreover, Fazzo argues that the bifid shape of 20th century proposals concerning the stemma codicum heavily depends on the implicit acceptance of Jaeger's genetic views as applied to the manuscripts tradition of the Metaphysics.

It was first opened in 1899 and is currently located in the Wiehre district. Around the church, further historic buildings were built. On the western side is the presbytery of the community next to a vocational school and to the north is the Lessingschule. At the same time as the Johanneskirche was being completed, the Protestant Christians built their own church near to Johanneskirche, the Christuskirche. The interior of Johanneskirche  History  After the Wiehre district had joined with Freiburg in 1825, a large construction project took place. The population rapidly grew within a few decades. Since the Church of St. Cyriakus and Perpetua was only designed for less than 200 people,Die Pfarrkirchen der Vorst√§dte. In: Badischer Architekten- und Ingenieur-Verein (Hrsg.): Freiburg im Breisgau. Die Stadt und ihre Bauten. H. M. Poppen & Sohn, Freiburg im Breisgau 1898, S. 402 (Digitalisat). the church was no longer adequate for the rising population figures. This led to a decision being made to build a new church in 1889. The client was the domain directorate, subordinated to the Ministry of Finance of the Grand Duchy of Baden. The contract was given to building manager Josef Durm. The Ministry rejected its draft because of its costs. In order to accommodate the required space on a smaller site, the Ministry of Finance called for galleries. Durm and the church initially rejected this as unsuitable for a Catholic church since the faithful in the gallery could not participate appropriately during mass. Churches with galleries were only considered suitable for Evangelical preaching services. Finally, Durm gave in. The city council was also involved in designing the church. Durm's next draft, in Romanesque-early Gothic style, seemed to be too much in competition with the Minster. Durm then changed his design and emphasised more strongly the Romanesque sections. He designed the towers to be taller and later added them to another storey. Construction served to mark the town-planning guiding principle under Lord Mayor Otto Winterer to mark the expanding of the city of Freiburg by towering buildings.Winterer waren die ausgef√ºhrten T√ºrme dennoch nicht hoch genug, vgl. Gudrun Matys: ‚ÄûDer M√ºnsterturm erfreut sich am Kranz sch√∂ner Kirchen‚Äú ‚Äì √úberlegungen zu den Freiburger Kirchenbauten des 19. Jahrhunderts in ihrem Bezug zum M√ºnster. In: Zeitschrift des Breisgau-Geschichtsvereins \\"Schauinsland\\" 111, 1992, S. 95‚Äì128, hier S. 112. Construction work on a site near to the Dreisam, on which the first gasworks had stood, began in 1894 and ended when the church was consecrated in 1899. In order to make good use of the existing site for a church with 900 seats, the church was designed with a very wide central nave (11m) and two side aisles (each 3.5m) with galleries. The length of the building is 74.3m. The crossing of the nave and the transept has a diameter of 16.8m. The building is decorated in red sandstone and resembles the typical features of new Romanesque architecture, which included elements of late Romanesque churches. Unlike older churches, Johanneskirche is not orientated to the east, with the altar located to the west. The facade, whose entrance is shaped in the form of an octagon, is flanked by two towers about 60m high with very steep spires pointing eastwards towards Talstra√üe, which forms a long line of sight for the church. Architect Josef Durm, in a letter addressed to the Finance Directorate,Schreiben Durms, nach Ulrike Grammbitter: Josef Durm (1837‚Äì1919).

On the other hand, both the floor plan and the interior are clearly different from the aforementioned model. \\"The architect has found his idols rather in late Romanesque of the Lower and Upper Rhines.

After the interior was renovated between 1971 and 1973, crossings with the alter island and celebration made by Joseph Henger were redesigned in 1975. A further exterior renovation (especially the roof, but also damage to the masonry, windows etc) took place from 2006 to 2008.  The former Fourteen Holy Helpers' chapel  In the Johanneskirche, there is still an old painting depicting the Fourteen Holy Helpers. It originated in the defunct chapel as well as two Baroque figures and a medieval Madonna.

The modern day  The community of St. John, alongside the community of St. Cyriak and Perpetua, whose church is also called Annakirche, the Liebfraugemeinde in G√ºnterstal and the Maria-Hilf community in the Upper Wiehre formed the pastoral unit of Freiburg-S√ºd. The pastoral unit was supervised by Order of Friars Minor from Poland from 2005 to 2013, who were located in the Franciscan monastery at G√ºnterstalstra√üe.  Organ  The organ on the church's eastern gallery was built in 1981 by organ builder Metzler (Dietikon, Switzerland). The organ has 50 stops (3536 pipes) on three keyboards and pedals. In addition to the main console, the organ also has a figured bass console in the lower section of the positive organ with a pedal attached. Tjos console is independent of the main console so that two organ players can play music on two organ consoles. The organ has mechanical and registered tracker actions.

It was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It tells the story of German war criminal Willi Herold, who assumed a stolen identity as a German officer and orchestrated the killing of deserters and other prisoners at one of the Emslandlager camps. Plot In April 1945, during the final weeks of the war, Willi Herold, a young Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger (paratrooper) escapes the pursuit of a roving German military police commando that wishes to kill him for deserting. After his escape, Herold finds an abandoned car containing the uniform of a decorated Luftwaffe captain. Herold takes the uniform and impersonates a captain, taking command of a number of stragglers as he moves through the German countryside under the guise that he is on a mission, ordered by Hitler himself, to assess morale behind the front. Although initially promising the local populace a decrease in looting, Herold becomes increasingly despotic as more disparate troops join his command, named Kampfgruppe Herold. These troops include Freytag, a kind, aging rifleman who is made Herold's driver, and Kipinski, a sadistic drunk. Eventually, Kampfgruppe Herold find a German camp full of deserters awaiting execution and assumes control over operations there. While in the camp, Herold orders the execution of dozens of prisoners (with Kipinski being the principal executioner), and becomes increasingly infatuated with his newfound power. Over the course of their stay, Freytag becomes suspicious of Herold, and realises that the captain's uniform does not belong to him after seeing a tailor shorten the pant legs. Eventually, the camp is destroyed by an Allied air raid, and Kampfgruppe Herold moves to a local town. While there, the group loots considerably from the local population, and sets up a makeshift command in a hotel under the name Sonderkommando und Schnellgericht Herold. Under this command, Herold orders the execution of Kipinski. After a night of debauchery, the group hotel is stormed by military police of the Wehrmacht, and Herold is arrested. While in court, Herold claims that he acted only in the defense of the German people, and escapes out of a window before his being sent back to the front. In the final scene, Herold is seen walking through a forest filled with skeletal remains, and the audience is informed that he and several of his accomplices were sentenced to death after the war by the Allied forces. The ending credits are accompanied by a sequence of Herold and his group driving through the streets of modern-day G√∂rlitz in their Mercedes-Benz G3 , eventually stopping to accost and harass local passersby on foot.

They are typically worn on the torso of the body on the officer's uniform. Body worn cameras for policing are often similar to other body worn video equipment used by civilians, firefighters, or the military, but are designed to address specific requirements related to law enforcement.  Definition = Device = Body Worn Cameras (BWC's) are used by law enforcement to record their interactions with the public, or gather video evidence at crime scenes. There are numerous suppliers across the globe. Current body cameras are much lighter and smaller than the first experiments with wearable cameras as early as 1998. There are several types of body cameras made by different manufacturers. Each camera basically serves the same purpose, yet some function in slightly different ways than others or have to be worn in a specific way. Some are meant to be mounted on the chest or shoulder, while others are attached to glasses or may be worn in a function similar to a headband or on a helmet. The various needs and budgets of police departments have led to a wide range of body camera equipment to be offered in recent years. Body camera manufacturers have constantly looked for technical innovations to improve their products. Many body cameras offer specific features like HD quality, infrared, night vision, fisheye lenses, or varying degrees of view. Other features specific to law enforcement are implemented in the hardware to integrate the bodycam with other devices or wearables. Another example are automatic triggers that start the recording when the officer starts a specific procedure, for instance when a fire-arm or taser is pulled from a holster, when a siren is activated or when the car door opens. Ever since body cameras were first worn by police officers, there has been a debate over whether capabilities that make the camera superior to that of the officer's eyes should be allowed. For instance, infra-red recordings could in hind-sight clearly show that a suspect did or did not carry a gun in his hand, but the officer at the scene may not have been able to see this. This type of issue forces companies to choose whether they want to incorporate 'super human' features into their products, or not. HD video quality, for instance, no doubt improves usability of recordings as evidence, but at the same time increases file size, which in turn leads to an increase in bandwidth requirements for data transfer and storage capacity. At present, HD quality is the industries' standard, but until roughly 2016 that was not the case even though the technology was widely available in other devices. Another important feature in law-enforcement is buffering: the option to let a body camera 'pre- record'. The bodycam can record continuously and store the most recent for instance thirty seconds. If the officer presses the record-switch, the preceding thirty seconds of recording will be kept. If he does not, the recording will be deleted after thirty seconds have passed on a 'first in, first out' basis. The ability to buffer enables officers to retain video of everything that occurred prior to the moment the record switch was pressed. This buffered video and audio may provide more context to an incident. = Storage = Bodycams in docking stations during charging of batteries and uploading of recordings Other features are constantly being trialed and implemented into the cameras and the data-storage process, such as cloud storage. Axon offers the possibility of sharing footage outside the police department, for instance with district attorneys or other prosecutors or the courts. Algorithms can be helpful in sifting through the recorded data that can quickly become overwhelming. Video content analysis, such as facial recognition or automatic indexing of recordings to simplify searching of the data, can help to reduce the time needed to find relevant fragments. = Policies = The device and storage are important and often require specific adaptation to make the technology suitable for law enforcement. But another important aspect of bodycams are the policies that shape the way officers use the bodycams. Three main questions are important: 1) Who wears the bodycam? This can be an individual voluntary choice or a collective mandatory requirement. Not all officers have this option. 2) What has to be recorded? Officers can have discretion to turn the bodycam on or off as they see fit or they can be guided through protocols. 3) Who has access to the recordings? Access to the recordings determines to a large extent whether police officers will embrace the technology or not. Important questions in this domain are whether supervisors can access the footage and whether the recordings are public records or not. The rules that determine who has access, influence the willingness of officers to comply to the rules concerning wearing of bodycams and the on/off instructions. Important in this respect is whether the software automatically logs who has accessed the footage and whether any editing has been done. English language countries = Australia = The number of body-worn cameras in use by the police of Australia is growing increasingly prevalent in parallel with other countries. The first bodycams or 'cop-cams' were trialed in Western Australia in 2007. Victoria has been trialing body- worn cameras since 2012, and in 2015 the NSW police announced they had invested $4 million in rolling out body-worn cameras to frontline police officers. Queensland police have had the cameras in operation for some time, and have already collected 155,000 hours worth of footage. According to research being conducted in 2016 'the use of body-worn cameras has now gathered traction in most Australian states and territories'. Despite the increasing prevalence of the devices, some Australian commentators have expressed privacy concerns.Julian Murphy, \\"Through a glass, darkly: unanswered questions about police body-worn cameras\\", Overland (28 July 2018). =Canada= Some police services in Canada such as the Calgary Police Service have outfitted all front-line officers with body-worn video systems since 2019. Police unions in Canada have been opposed to body-worn video systems, citing privacy and cost concerns. In 2015, several city police units, including those in Winnipeg and Montreal, announced plans to experiment with the technology. The Toronto Police Service started a pilot in 2014 with the technology during a year-long study of body-worn cameras. In total, 100 officers were using the technology from May 2015 thru May 2016. The evaluation report concluded that support for the body cameras was strong and increased during the pilot. There were technical issues, for instance with battery life, camera mounting, docking, recharging, ability to classify, ease of review and other issues. Administrative responsibilities associated with the body cameras resulted in significant commitment of time by officers that then was not available to spend on other duties. In September 2016, the Toronto police wanted to put out a call for proposals from suppliers. =Singapore= The Singapore Police Force announced on January 2015 that officers stationed at its Neighbourhood Police Centres will be issued body cameras with those located at Bukit Merah West.https://web.archive.org/web/20171023185507/http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/police- start-wearing-body-cameras-friday Officers stationed at Ang Mo Kio North, Bedok South, Bukit Merah East, Jurong West and Toa Payoh in June 2015 with the entire island covered by June 2016.

The test was begun on a small-scale by Devon and Cornwall Police. / In 2006, the first significant deployments of body worn video at the national level were undertaken by the Police Standards Unit (PSU) as part of the Domestic Violence Enforcement Campaign (DVEC). The basic command units equipped with the head cameras recorded everything that happened during an incident from the time of arrival which led to the \\"preservation of good-quality first disclosure evidence from the victim\\". The evidence gathered was deemed especially useful in the way of supporting prosecutions if the victim was reluctant to give evidence or press charges. Plymouth study 2007 This led the Home Office to publish a report stating that \\"evidence gathering using this equipment has the potential radically to enhance the police performance at the scene of a wide range of incidents\\". In the same report, the Home Office concluded that the body worn camera system used in Devon and Cornwall had \\"the ability to significantly improve the quality of the evidence provided by police officers at incidents\\". However, mostly due to the limitations of the then available technology, it was also recommended that police forces should await the completion of successful trials and projects to re-evaluate the technology before investing in cameras. By July 2007, the Home Office was beginning to encourage the emerging industry and published another document entitled \\"Guidance for the Police use of Body Worn Cameras\\". The report was based on the first national pilot of BWV conducted in Plymouth. Tony McNulty MP, Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism and Police wrote a foreword that held BWV in a promising light: \\"The use of body-worn video has the potential to improve significantly the quality of evidence provided by police officers‚Ä¶video recording from the scene of an incident will capture compelling evidence‚Ä¶that could never be captured in written statements.\\" Despite being hailed as a tool to enhance the quality of evidence, the focus was beginning to shift away from exclusively benefiting prosecutions. The Home Office highlighted that BWV also had the significant potential to \\"prevent and deter crime\\". In addition, the final report on the National Pilot for BWV announced that complaints against the officers wearing the cameras had been reduced to zero and time spent on paperwork had been reduced by 22.4%, which led to a 9.2% increase in officer time spent on patrol (\\"50 minutes of a 9-hour shift\\"). Over 40 UK police areas with BWV in 2010 Following the national pilot, BWV began to gain some traction in the UK and, by 2008, Hampshire Police began to use the technology in parts of the Isle of Wight and the mainland. These were the first steps that paved the way for Chief Constable Andy Marsh becoming the national lead for BWV. Pioneers of BWV in the UK began to drive the need to review the legislation surrounding the use of the equipment. In 2009 the Security Industry Authority concluded that a CCTV license could be extended to cover the use of a body camera. The summary stated that a CCTV license was required to review footage from a body camera and that a door supervision or security guard license was required to operate a body camera if security activities were also being performed. In 2010, 5 years after the first BWV venture, over 40 UK police areas were using body cameras to varying degrees. Grampian Police were one such force that initiated a trial in July 2010 which paved the way for the Paisley and Aberdeen body wore video project in 2011. The project was considered a huge success and it was identified that the benefits saved an estimated minimum of ¬£400,000 per year due to the following: *Increase public reassurance; *Reduce fear of crime in local communities; *Increase early guilty pleas; *Resolve complaints about the police or wardens more quickly; *Reduce assaults on officers. The concluding sections of the report on the Paisley and Aberdeen project turned the attention to the digital, back-end solutions for BWV. Now that the benefits of using body cameras were being realized, the implications on the digital infrastructure were being called into question. The report suggested providing \\"robust central IT support\\" to have established the processes behind information gathering and monitoring. Code of Practice surveillance cameras In 2013 the Home Office released an updated code of practice for surveillance cameras, in which Principle 8 included the use of body cameras, stating: \\"Surveillance camera system operators should consider any approved operational, technical and competency standards relevant to a system and its purpose and work to meet and maintain those standards\\". 2013 also saw the start of Operation Hyperion, a Hampshire Police initiative on the Isle of Wight that equipped every frontline police officer with a personal issue body worn camera, the biggest project of its kind at the time. Sergeant Steve Goodier oversaw the project and was adamant that the project would drive legislative changes to free up further uses for body worn cameras. He said \\"I strongly believe we could make some small changes to legislation that can have a big impact on officers: \\"PACE was written in 1984 at a time when BWV was not around‚Ä¶We want to get the legislation changed so that BWV could replace the need for handwritten statements from officers when it is likely that an early guilty plea would be entered at court or that the incident could be dealt with a caution or community resolution.\\" MPS PCSO in London (UK) with bodycam In 2014, the Metropolitan Police Service began a 12 month trial in ten London boroughs, testing the impact of Body Worn Video on complaints, stop and search and criminal justice outcomes for violent offenses. Following the trial, the decision was made to issue body cameras to all officers who have regular engagement with the public. Other officers will be able to access cameras on an ‚Äòas needed‚Äô basis. A total of 22,000 cameras will be issued. Northern Ireland In 2016, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) formally introduced Body Worn Video technology commencing with Derry City and Strabane District, with Belfast becoming the second District to introduce the technology. A pilot Body Worn Video camera scheme was run during 2014/15, which illustrated the benefits of Body Worn Video. On that basis a business case was submitted to the Department of Justice and funding was secured to purchase Body Worn Video technology for officers across the service. In 2017, the Northern Ireland Prison Service implemented Body Worn Video, following the success of the PSNI deployment. Devon and Cornwall In September 2018, Devon and Cornwall Police announced their intention to begin outfitting officers with body worn cameras. The force was the first to trial BWV in the UK in 2005. The project was launched alongside Dorset Police. The cameras will be switched on by officers to record specific incidents including performing arrests, searches, stopping motor vehicles for any reason, and during violent incidents or where domestic abuse or modern slavery are suspected. =United States= Body camera worn by policeman of North Charleston, South Carolina  Law and policies  In 2012, the National Institute of Justice at the United States Department of Justice issued a primer regarding laws, policies, practices, and technology for local police departments to consider. Following The Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act (eff. 1-1-16), the state of Illinois became one of the first states to have a comprehensive set of rules for police departments in regards to body camera usage. The Chicago Police Department as well as the mayor of the city, Rahm Emanuel, have been vocal about their plan to enact a body-worn camera expansion that would equip police officers by the end of 2017. The goal of this plan, as well as the hiring of more officers, is to improve public trust in the law, expand transparency, and halt the climbing number of homicides. Springfield Police Department (Illinois) has also been among the local departments that have expanded the use of body worn cameras despite the Springfield Police Chief Kenny Winslow stating that \\"there are still problems with the state body camera law, and many departments in Illinois aren‚Äôt adopting the cameras as a result\\". One of those departments is the Minooka Police Department that discontinued the use of body cameras because they felt overburdened by administrative responsibilities. The considerable cost of cameras and the support of related technology is another factor limiting the speed of their adoption. In New York City, for example, initial purchase of body-worn cameras could cost up to $31 million. However, proponents hypothesized that body-worn cameras would save money by reducing lawsuits targeted towards the police force and by aiding in the dismissal of court cases with digital evidence provided by the recorded footage of the body-worn cameras. On December 1, 2014, President Barack Obama \\"proposed reimbursing communities half the cost of buying cameras and storing video‚Äîa plan that would require Congress to authorize $75 million over three years to help purchase 50,000 recording devices\\". He also asked Congress for a $263 million package overall to deal with community policing initiatives that would provide a 50 percent federal match for local police departments to purchase body cameras and to store them. With the push from then President Barack Obama to ‚Äúexpand funding and training to law enforcement agencies through community policing initiatives‚Äù, the United States Department of Justice announced in May 2015 that they would grant 73 out of the 285 awards requested for a total of 20 million dollars. This allowed for the purchase and distribution of 21,000 cameras to be placed in active duty. A National Institute of Justice report found this in regards to responding police agencies: \\"In a sample of police departments surveyed in 2013, approximately 75 percent of them reported that they did not use body-worn cameras\\". A November 2014 survey of police departments serving the 100 most populous cities, Vocativ found that \\"41 cities use body cams on some of their officers, 25 have plans to implement body cams and 30 cities do not use or plan to use cams at this time\\". Investigations have shown that although in many states the usage of body worn cameras is mandatory, there are instances where some officers have failed to adhere to the law. From 2015 until 2017, there have been nationally recognized scenarios of fatal shootings in San Francisco, Alabama, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles in which the officer was wearing a body camera, but did not activate it during the incident. The Los Angeles Police Department is one of the first to publicly discuss solutions as to how they will try to fix this problem. Small reminders such as stickers in the station and cars are meant to remind officers to use this technology. In addition, Los Angeles Police Department is testing new technology that would activate the cameras at the same time as the officer turns on their emergency lights. The LAPD has also been working with the body camera manufacturer it uses, Taser International, to increase a buffer that saves video from 30 seconds before and after the camera is turned on and off.  Study results  Studies have produced mixed findings on the impact of body-worn cameras and the effect these have on police, civilian, or suspect behavior. Early reports touting the benefits of police body cameras were based on limited research of small groups of police officers in a short period of time. In recent years, more robust research became available. = 1) 'Yes: they work' - the Rialto and Orlando studies = An impact assessment, based on 54 Rialto police officers wearing body cameras showed that civilian complaints against officers dropped by 88% and \\"use of force\\" dropped by 59%. Another report that studied the effects of body-worn cameras for 46 officers of the Orlando Police Department over one year concluded that for officers wearing the body cameras, use-of-force incidents dropped by 53%, civilian complaints dropped by 65%, two in three officers who wore the cameras said they‚Äôd want to continue wearing them in the future and that it made them \\"better officers\\". Other studies produced similar results. For instance, an analysis by the San Antonio Express-News of San Antonio law enforcement's use of body-worn cameras found that incidents where police used force and formal misconduct complaints decreased significantly. Scholars of crime were unsure to what extent body-worn cameras played a role in these declines, but noted that the results were consistent with trends in other cities were cameras had been introduced. = 2) 'No: they don't' - the Washington study = As more studies in more police departments were performed, the evidence became more mixed. One of the most robust studies was done among thousands of Washington, D.C. officers, led by David Yokum at the Lab@DC, a team of scientists embedded in D.C. government, and Anita Ravishankar at D.C.‚Äôs Metropolitan Police Department (M.P.D.). The evaluation found no effect on use-of-force by officers or on the number of complaints by civilians. The researchers concluded that police officers equipped with body cameras used force and confronted civilians in a similar manner compared with officers without body cameras: ‚ÄúThis is the most important empirical study on the impact of police body-worn cameras to date. ... These results suggest we should recalibrate our expectations‚Äù of cameras‚Äô ability to make a ‚Äúlarge- scale behavioral change in policing, particularly in contexts similar to Washington, D.C.\\". The study not only presents statistical analyses, but also provides qualitative research and analysis to shed light on the controversies surrounding the cameras. According to the study, several factors could explain why the cameras did not change the behavior of the police - even though there was a high level of compliance to the rules governing the activation of the cameras: desensitization to the cameras and the fact that police officers already performed better due to an increase in monitoring of their actions before the introduction of the cameras. A third possibility was that officers without cameras acted similar to officers with cameras, because they were aware of their colleagues who did wear these devices. Since the Washington- study, several others have been published that concluded the body cameras did not live up to - perhaps too high - expectations. The meta-evaluation cited below contains information on all studies if they met the methodological quality requirements. = 3) 'It depends' - meta-evaluations = In reviewing the existing research on police body-worn cameras in 2017, University of Virginia economist Jennifer Doleac noted that the existing research was mixed as to whether the cameras reduce the use of force by police officers or increase the communities' trust in police. But a reduction in complaints against police using excessive force does not necessarily mean there are fewer cases of misconduct, it could mean that people are just not speaking up or the body camera was not turned on and the footage cannot be investigated. More time and research was expected to allow a more precise answer to whether or not body worn cameras improve officer conduct. As more empirical evidence became available, the importance of differences in local contexts and policies was revealed. The level of discretion that officers have in the activation of the body cameras has, for instance, been suggested as one of the deciding characteristics in any body camera policy and therefore in the results that can be expected. Unintended outcomes can even be the result from increased transparency due to over-deterrence: officers who know they are being recorded, will only do the minimum required. These officers will also tend to do everything by the book, reluctant to apply discretion. More information on the results of these meta-evaluations is presented below under 'Impact studies'.  Unions  Police unions in several U.S. cities, such as New York City (the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents part of the NYPD), Las Vegas, and Jersey City, New Jersey, and St. Louis, Missouri, expressed doubts or opposition to body cameras. Specifically, union officials expressed concerns about possible distraction and safety issues, and questioned \\"whether all the footage filmed by body cameras will be accessible via public-records requests, whether victims of domestic violence will be hesitant to call police if they know they will be filmed and whether paying for the cameras and maintenance will lead to cuts elsewhere in the police budget\\". Others have worried about a \\"gotcha discipline\\". Some unions have argued that it was \\"mandatory\\" for police departments to include provisions about body-worn cameras in union contracts because it would be a \\"clear change in working conditions\\" as well as something that could \\"impact an officer's safety\\".  Civil liberties  The American Civil Liberties Union is an organization that has been a major proponent of body cameras on officers, but only in certain situations. The ACLU has advocated body camera use for both police departments and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, granted that safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of both officers and civilians. However, they have opposed the use of such camera systems for parking enforcement officers, fire marshals, building inspectors, or other code enforcement officers. The questions raised by the ACLU and others fuel the most heated debate on body-worn cameras. Some believe similarly to Fox News resident psychiatrist Keith Ablow, who stated that it was an \\"insult to police officers\\" to provide them body cameras. Others, such as Black Lives Matter, have released specific policy solutions to tackle the issue of police violence and escalation that include body cameras for police, limited use of force, and demilitarization of the police are a few of the ten crucial policies listed in Campaign Zero. Other countries = China = Urban Management Officer with Body worn Camera The use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement offers potential advantages in keeping officers safe, enabling situational awareness, improving community relations and accountability, and providing evidence for trials. A legislation regarding body-worn camera has been enacted by the Ministry of Public Security, making the body-worn camera standard and mandatory policing equipment for law enforcement agencies in China. Two million police officers are being equipped with this camera in China. The police in Hong Kong has been experimenting with body cameras since 2013. Based on positive findings from an (unpublished) evaluation, the decision was taken to supply all front-line officers with a bodycam. = Denmark = The police in Denmark has been credited in English media as the first police force to use body cameras, even before the English pilots of 2007 were initiated. In 2017, the Minister of Justice has equipped security personnel in detention centers with body cameras. = Finland =  Pilot project 2015  In Finland, a pilot with body cameras was started in 2015. Thirty cameras were used by the Helsinki Police Department to help the police in maintaining public order. It was hoped that body cameras might prevent crime and disorder. Furthermore, it was expected that the cameras could at the same time improve the way the police worked. The cameras were meant to be used in specific settings and only in public places. Filming inside homes would only be allowed as part of a criminal investigation. The data were to be encrypted and could only be accessed with specific software, according to the police. It was expected that most recordings would be deleted right after each shift, because of the need for privacy protection.  Results  According to a report from 2017 by a working-group, the pilot justified the national roll-out of bodycams in Finland. The report concluded that police officers' safety improved, reduced resistance to the police and better protected police. During the experiment in Helsinki, the report noted, behaviour of citizens improved when people see that the situation is being recorded. The introduction could be based on current legislation, but an additional legal framework would be needed regulating recording and storage of recordings. Filming inside homes is not generally allowed. The cameras could be available at the end of 2018, after the necessary training and purchases. The Federation of Police Officers wants provisions to make sure that human errors will not be problematic for officers wearing cameras. The question is whether police can erase recordings when they want to. According to the working group, this is no different from the handling of other police documentation. During the pilot, the recordings were stored for 24 hours and then wiped, unless a criminal offence was recorded. The working group recommended to extend that period to 96 hours.  Plans for national roll-out in 2018  In early 2018, some 30 cameras were in use at Helsinki police department on a trial basis. The National Police Board recommended in April 2018 to issue all police officers on patrol with cameras. The ambition is to make the procurements in 2018. The two main reasons are to improve officers' safety by reducing confrontations with members of the public and to make recordings that can be used as evidence. = France = French law enforcement has been experimenting with bodycams - called 'cam√©ra-pi√©ton' or 'mini-cam√©ras' in French - since 2013, but possibly even before then.  Police  National and municipal police have also been outfitted with body cameras, starting with 2 000 cameras in 2017, after experimentation during the previous years. This number of cameras has been expanded and 10 400 additional cameras are being rolled out in what has been called a 'massive deployment'. Nearly 400 municipalities applied for permission to use bodycams in the pilot that was conducted in 2017 and 2018. These communities ranged in size from 1 500 inhabitants like Collias to 100 000+ cities like Marseille and Nice.  Other organisations  In 2018, the senate approved plans to experiment with bodycams in fire fighting and in detention centers. Other organisations that use these small wearable cameras are the national organisation for rail transport (SNCF), but also regional public transport for Paris (RATP). In 2019, public transport company K√©olis, introduced body cameras for its security staff on trams and buses in the city of Brest.  Uses  The body cameras in France are intended to de-escalate interventions and reassure the security forces. Formally, according to the 2016 law, that was extended in 2018 for use of bodycams by municipal police officers, the goals of the cameras are: # prevention of incidents during interventions by the police or the military (gendarmerie nationale); # detection of violations of the law and the prosecution of the suspects by collecting evidence; # training and education of officers  Legal framework  The legal framework has been determined by a law of 3 June 2016 by the national committee on information and freedoms (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert√©s - CNIL). Their opinion is that because of the elevated risks created by surveillance of persons and personal life that could result from the use of these cameras, a specific legal framework was needed. Separate laws have been developed for national police and gendarmerie and for municipal police \\\\- the latter being adopted by parliament in 2018. Recordings have to be retained for at least six months. Specific legislation has also been developed for law enforcement in sectors such as rail transportation and regional public transport for Paris. One of the key components of the law in France is that officers are not allowed to review the recordings. However, the bodycams acquired offered this option and would have to be replaced with different type progressively, but not before the end of 2017 - according to the source quoted in the article.  Identity checks  One of the main reasons for the national police, gendarmerie and municipal police to start using bodycams is the systematic recording of identity checks in public places. Starting in March 2017, the police and gendarmerie in 23 prioritised security zones ('zones de securit√© priorities), including Paris, Marseille, Nice, Toulouse and Lyon, had to record each identity check. Up to 2013, the decision to start a recording was discretionary, but after 2017 recording of these checks was supposed to become the rule. According to a critical article, this requirement was not fulfilled, given the fact that there were 2 500 bodycams available for the total of around 245 000 officers in the country. Some controversy surrounded the introduction because of a statement in the Senate by ministre de l'int√©rieur, Bruno le Roux, that recording would be triggered automatically - a statement that later had to be revoked because it proved to be incorrect. The report describing the results of the experiment was not published, but a spokesperson of the National Police told a reporter that the cameras increase the legitimacy of officers, pacify difficult situations and offer the possibility to record the specifics of each intervention, in this case identity checks.  Future developments  The Mayor of the city of Nice has asked the Minister of the Interior to rewrite the legal framework to include live streaming of bodycam-footage. This would enable supervision centers to not only watch regular CCTV-cameras but also body cameras. Included in the request was the suggestion to enable these centers to distribute the footage to the devices in police vehicles. The national privacy watchdog, CNIL, has called for a democratic debate to define appropriate frameworks and to strike a balance between security and the rights and freedoms of everyone. = Germany = alt=  Reasons for bodycams  In some parts of Germany, some state police services have used body-worn video systems since 2013 and the number of states (German: Land or L√§nder) where police use bodycams has increased ever since. The reason for the introduction of these cameras in Germany has overwhelmingly been to protect police against assaults from suspects. The second reason is the ability to reconstruct events and to use the recording as evidence. A third reason has been the fact that civilians are filming the police and that the police wants to add their own recordings to what they perceive as selective filming by civilians. As R√ºdiger Seidenspinner, the president of the union of policemen for the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, explained: \\"The reason is simple: our colleagues have had enough in this era of smartphones of being filmed only when they intervene. What caused the intervention, what actions, insults etc. took place does not seem to concern anyone. Furthermore, we will not use the BodyCam in all situations, but only for specific deployments and especially in areas with high levels of crime\\". According to a representative sample of 1,200 citizens from Germany in 2015, a majority of 71% is in favour of body cameras and 20% is opposed to the technology.  L√§nder with bodycams  Detailed information is available on the use of body cameras in five L√§nder. In State of Hesse, the police were the first force in Germany to use body cams in May 2013. According to official registrations, the resistance (Widerstand) to police decreased from 40 to 25 and only one of the policemen wearing a body camera was wounded, compared to nine colleagues without camera. Following the pilot, the number of bodycams acquired went up from the original 13 to 72 in total, also meant for other areas in Hesse. The success of the pilot inspired many other German cities and the Federal Police to start using body cameras as well. Police services from Hungary, Switzerland, and Austria were interested as well and asked the German police for information. In the State of Rhineland-Palatinate body cams are in use since July 2015 in the cities of Mainz and Koblenz to reduce violence towards the police and to collect footage that can be used as evidence. The costs of these body cams was 18.500 euro. Based on the positive experiences, eighty more bodycams have been acquired to be deployed in more areas in these two cities. In Hamburg, one of five members in each team that surveils during weekends is equipped with a bodycam since June 2015. These cameras can be pointed in different directions by manually operated remote control. Since 2016, the Bavarian State Police has been testing bodycams in Munich, Augsburg and Rosenheim. The cameras have to be activated in critical situations and at dangerous locations, for instance in nightlife entertainment areas where fighting is a common occurrence. In Baden-W√ºrttemberg, bodycams are deployed in Stuttgart, Mannheim and Freiburg since 2016. The aim here is to test the bodycams during one year with the purpose of reducing violence against the police.  Federal police  Starting in February 2016, the Federal Police began testing bodycams at trainstations in Berlin, Cologne, D√ºsseldorf and Munich. In early 2017, the Bundestag agreed with government plans to introduce bodycams to protect officers.  Legal issues  All L√§nder in the country use bodycams, but there are substantial differences in the legal framework. Some have explicitly created a legal basis (Hesse, Hamburg, Saarland, Bremen, Baden-W√ºrttemberg), some are still working on it and in the meantime fall back on existing norms (North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, pilot projects in Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony-Anhalt, Federal Police). Still others have no concrete plans for legal adaptations (Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia). = Italy =  Milan and Turin 2015 and 2017  In the cities of Milan and Turin, police forces have started experimenting on a small scale with bodycams. One of the first projects started in 2015 in Turin where police used the bodycams for their own protection during protests. Starting in May 2017, ten bodycams were being trialled by the police forces of Turin and Milan to be used in high-risk operations and use-of-force incidents. Part of the trial was to connect the live streams of the cameras to the control-room of the police. The bodycams for these pilots were supplied free of charge by a manufacturer for a period of three months. Based on the experiences during the trials, a decision would have to be reached whether to supply all front-line officers with bodycams. The price for fifty bodycams in Milan was 215,000 euros.  Rome 2017  Police officers in Rome have not yet been equipped with bodycams. However, in October 2017, the secretary of the union Sulpl Roma, announced that police officers who ask for them will receive a bodycam before the end of the year 2017. The reason would be two-fold: to modernise the officers' equipment and to settle disputes with drivers who disagree with police, for instance over a fine or the cause of an accident.  Privacy  The privacy law governing the use of bodycams by police in Italy is the law that protects personal data. According to a spokesperson of the police in Rome the law allows for the creation of video recordings of police interventions, provided the footage is used only for the reconstruction of police activity. The fact that other people including innocent by-standers could be recognised by their faces or voices does not mean the recording can not be used for legitimate purposes. = Netherlands =  Police  alt= Public transport officer in Amsterdam with bodycam The first body worn video used by the Dutch police were portable videocameras used by the mounted riot-police in 1997. The first experiments with more modern bodycams date back to 2008 and were all small-scale technical tests. After four large-scale experiments from 2009 through 2011, the conclusion was that bodycams did not reduce violence and aggression against the police, largely due to technical problems with recordings and 'wearability' of the equipment. The Department of Justice concluded that bodycams were not ready to be 'rolled out' on the national level. Regional police forces continued experimenting with bodycams. In 2011, according to a survey by one of the major suppliers of body worn video cameras in the Netherlands, 17 of the 25 regionale police forces were using bodycams in 2011. In 2015, the Dutch National Police published their plans to integrate more 'sensing' capabilities into routine police work. This plan focused on CCTV, automatic number plate recognition and bodycams. Thirty experiments were conducted with body cameras to determine whether the technology should become part of the standard equipment of all police officers. The biggest experiment was done in Amsterdam where one hundred bodycams were tested for 12 months by 1,500 officers. The trial was monitored and independently evaluated, according to the highest possible methodological standard: a randomised controlled trial. Violence and aggression towards police officers were reduced significantly. Based on these positive findings, the management of the National Police in 2019 decided to roll-out 2,000 bodycams to all front-line police units in the country.  Other law enforcement with bodycams  Other organizations besides the police use bodycams, mainly local law enforcement officers employed by municipalities. All local 'handhavers' or city wardens in Amsterdam and Rotterdam wear bodycams, in addition to over thirty smaller cities. Other organisations use body cameras including public transport, security professionals, ambulances and fire-fighters.Visit the Dutch page on bodycams to find references and more examples. = Sweden =  Police  Swedish police have used body cameras, for instance at large football games and demonstrations. According to a spokesperson for the Swedish Police in 2015, body cameras would not become standard equipment for police officers. They would be used for special purposes because there was no need to record all interactions. \\"We are not in the same situation as the police in the US who need to document everything in order to maintain credibility\\". Early trials with body cameras have been carried out in Gothenburg and S√∂dert√§lje in 2017. Many other Swedish police regions expressed interest in using body cameras. The police in Stockholm have piloted body cameras in 2018 and 2019. In total, 300 body cameras were used in three parts of Stockholm to prevent violence against police officers. The Swedish Crime Prevention Council (Brottsf√∂rebyggande r√•det - Br√•) evaluated the pilot. The evaluation revealed that the body cameras had the intended effects, but on a relatively modest scale. Certain types of violence decreased: harassment and violence using weapons. Sexual intimidation of female officers was reduced too. The sense of security improved, according to interviews with officers: people 'guard their tongue'. Physical violence has not decreased in the same amount. According to the police, this type of violence is perpetrated by people who are either drunk or mentally troubled. Their behaviour is not adjusted when they realise they are being filmed. Footage has rarely been used as evidence in courts: overall, 178 recordings were pulled for prosecution and conviction. In roughly half of these cases, the footage was used as evidence, but in the other half the decision was made to not submit the recording as evidence. Another conclusion is that the level of activation of bodycams varied from one officer to the next. There was a lack of clear instructions and guidelines on which situations needed to be recorded. The researchers believe that the bodycams could lead to more positive outcomes if a better strategy for the deployment of the bodycams would be developed and implemented.  Other law enforcement  The Swedish army in Afghanistan has used helmet cameras, according to this article from 2015. In 2016, train hosts in Gothenburg and West Sweden started testing bodycams. They were only allowed to turn on the cameras if a passenger became violent or threatened to use violence. Public transport in Stockholm, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, started using body cameras in 2018. Security guards were the first to start using these cameras and ticket controllers followed in December 2018. The cameras are used in order to improve the safety of staff. Additionally, the cameras can be used to make a recording of travellers without a valid ticket. By filming them, the identity of the person in question can be verified even if they used someone else's identity during the check. =United Arab Emirates= Following a successful six month pilot scheme, the Dubai Police Force decided to adopt body worn video technology in 2015. Speaking to the media at the time, Gen Al Muzeina flagged-up the value of footage from these cameras. He said that this evidence could, potentially, be used where there are objections to traffic offences or a failure by officers to meet acceptable standards. The Abu Dhabi Police also confirmed in the same year that ‚Äì following two years of trials ‚Äì it would be rolling out body worn video cameras to patrol officers.  Impact studies  In 2019, a team of researchers published the most comprehensive overview to date of the impact of BWCs. They based their overview on seventy empirical studies, most from U.S. jurisdictions (74%). The study reports on officer behavior, officer perceptions, citizen behavior, citizen perceptions, police investigations, and police organizations. = Officer behavior = Impact on officer behavior is measured by complaints, use of force reports, arrests/citations or proactive behaviors. This is one of the greatest expectations of BWCs by civilians: that these cameras can change police officer behavior. Studies in this area (22 studies looked at complaints) have mostly shown that officers wearing BWCs receive fewer complaints than do those that are not wearing the cameras. The more important concern for police agencies and researchers is why complaints decline. It may be because of a change in officer behavior. But it may also be a more complex story involving reduction of frivolous, malicious or unfounded complaints because civilians change their behavior. The number of complaints as a measure of officer behavior may itself be problematic: they are rare and only reflect exceptional occurrences, not the everyday officer interactions with the public. Use of force (16 studies) went down according to five of the rigorous impact studies. Four other studies, however, showed no statistically significant effects. The level of discretion officers have may explain these differences, one team of researchers suggested. As with complaints, use of force is rare and may not be the best measure of the impact of BWCs on police officer behavior. Other studies look at arrests and citation behaviors (fourteen studies showed 'no clear patterns') or on proactivity (six studies: 'results not definitive'). The question whether BWCs impact on disparate outcomes in policing has yet to be tackled. = Officer attitudes about BWCs = At least 32 studies focused on officer attitudes about cameras. First of all, the authors describe the methodological challenges of many of these studies. Despite those issues and despite mixed findings, one consistent theme is that once officers start using cameras, they feel positive or become more positive about BWCs. = Civilian behavior = At least 16 studies were aimed at examining the Impact of BWCs on civilian behavior. This can be measured by compliance with the police, willingness to call the police, willingness to cooperate in investigations or crime and disorder when an officer is present. The results were varied and some aspects have not been studied at all, for instance the concern that BWCs may reduce people's willingness to call the police due to worries about personal privacy. = Civilian perceptions = Sixteen studies looked at civilian attitudes about BWCs. This can be measured by looking at satisfaction with specific officer encounters or satisfaction with police more broadly, attitudes related to privacy and impact on fear of crime and safety. Civilians often have high expectations: police will be more accountable and civilian confidence in the police will increase. This can depend however on certain backgrounds (age, race, prior experiences). BWCs seem not to remedy the disparates between the legitimacy afforded to the police by various groups. Results from studies looking at broad satisfaction and privacy concerns are unclear. The few studies that looked at fear showed that civilians who know they are being recorded express strong agreement that BWCs make them feel safer and more confident in the police. = Police investigations = This aspect consists of criminal investigations, crime resolution, intelligence gathering or court proceedings and outcomes. Prosecutors rarely bring cases against the police and it remains to be seen whether this will change much as a result of BWCs. Empirical results are hard to find. Three studies (all from the UK) revealed positive outcomes: officers can pursue prosecution even without victim cooperation and cases may more likely be charged. = Police organizations = This is about training, policies, accountability, supervision et cetera. It is the least researched area, with some exceptions. Technologies often have unintended consequences on police. Much more research is needed to understand whether BWC footage can help officers to learn skills better and whether that in turn has an impact on their actual behaviour. BWCs can - in theory - strengthen the accountability structure in an organisation, but perhaps not if existing accountability mechanisms in the agency are weak. BWCs for instance will unlikely improve mentorship or supervision in an agency that does not value such mentorship or supervision.  Privacy concerns  As with all forms of surveillance, bodycams highlight issues of privacy. There is concern about the privacy of the people being filmed (suspects, victims, witnesses) but also about that of the officers wearing the cameras or the officers whose actions are record by their colleagues. = Support = With 88% of Americans and 95% of Dutch people supporting body cameras on police officers, there is strong public support for this technology. However, it is important to note that not all civilians are necessarily aware of the presence of bodycams. A study in Milwaukee revealed that awareness of the bodycams was comparatively low in the first year following implementation (36%) but increased after two more years (76%). In that study, respondents were asked whether they thought bodycams would improve relationships between the police and community members: 84 percent (strongly) agreed. An even larger proportion, 87 percent, (strongly) agreed that Body-Worn Cameras would hold Milwaukee police officers accountable for their behaviors. These percentages hardly changed in the three years following introduction, which suggests that opinions such as these are independent of awareness of bodycams. = Facial recognition = One possibility is that a police officer wearing this technology could become a 'roving surveillance camera'. If the bodycams are equipped with biometric facial recognition technology, this could have a major impact on people's everyday lives, depending on the reliability of the technology to prevent false positives (those that are mistaken for a person on a list of suspects, for instance). Furthermore, cameras equipped with facial recognition technology heighten worries over ‚Äúsecret surveillance at a distance‚Äù. Information about civilian whereabouts can consistently be tracked if they appear in public and it happens without their knowledge. There are more concerns about the advancement of these facial recognition technologies in body cams and the lack of government regulation over them. Particular concerns have been noted with respect to the use of cameras equipped with facial recognition at public protests. It has been suggested that such camera use may \\"chill\\" rights of free speech and association.Julian Redmond Murphy, \\"Chilling: The Constitutional Implications of Body-Worn Cameras and Facial Recognition Technology at Public Protests\\" (2018) 75 Washington & Lee Law Review Online 1 https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1104&context;=wlulr- online Looking at the United States in particular, there are 117 million Americans in the FBI's shared database according to the Georgetown Report. People can become fearful of the police's ability to identify them in public and gather information about where they've been and where they might be going. In the US, there is no federal law in place that directly protects Americans when it comes to the use of facial recognition technology. Only the states of Illinois and Texas have regulations, ‚Äúthat require(s) an individual to give consent for their biometrics to be used, protecting its application in a system that it was not originally intended for‚Äù. = Consent = In the context of recording, the biggest issues arise from whether consent from parties involved is required before starting a recording. The nature of police work has officers interacting with civilians and suspects during their most vulnerable moments, such as those in the hospital, or domestic violence cases. There is also a threat of people not coming forward with tips for fear of being recorded. In terms of the police officer's private contexts, they may forget to turn off cameras in the bathroom or in private conversations. These situations should be considered as the technology is developed further and the use of it is becoming more saturated. In the U.S. federal and individual states have varying statutes regarding consent laws. = Search and seizure = Another major concern that has arisen since the implementation of police body cameras is how these technologies will affect the privacy rights of individuals in regards to search and seizure laws. The 1967 Supreme Court case Katz v. United States determined that ‚Äúthere need not be a physical or technical trespass to constitute a search or seizure deserving deserving of constitutional protection.‚Äù Extraction of sensitive information from individuals through electronic transmission is deemed to be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. Police body camera recordings conducted on private property without a warrant or probable cause are expected to violate the individual search and seizure rights of the property owner. Video recording conducted in public spaces aren‚Äôt generally subject to Fourth Amendment protections under the ‚Äúplain view‚Äù doctrine developed by the Supreme Court. In these circumstances an officer can record an individual and their actions as long as they are in public spaces. Many other nations have their own search and seizure laws that have specific implications associated with the use of body cameras worn on police officers.  Supply = Pricing = Body cameras require sizeable investments. In 2012, the price of the camera itself was between $120 and $1,000, according to a market survey by the United States Department of Justice in which seven suppliers were compared. A more recent market survey in 2016, describing 66 body cameras of 38 different vendors, showed that the average price (or actually: the average manufacturer's suggested retail prices) was $570, with a minimum of $199 and a maximum of $2,000. In 2017, based on information from 45 police forces in the United Kingdom, research showed that nearly 48 000 body cameras had been purchased and that ¬£22,703,235 had been spent on the cameras. Dividing this total by the number of cameras gives an estimate of the average costs per camera: ¬£474. The minimum was ¬£348 for the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the maximum was ¬£705 for the Metropolitan Police Service. These differences may be partly attributable to the fact that some forces have included more types of costs than other forces. In any case, the camera itself is just the start of the expenses. Police departments also have to run software and store data for all the cameras which can add up quickly. Other costs include maintenance, training and evaluations. In addition, several indirect costs will be incurred by bodycams, for instance, the hours police and others in the criminal justice system spend on managing, reviewing and using the recordings for prosecution or other purposes such as internal reviews, handling of complaints or education. These 'hidden' costs are difficult to quantify, but by looking into total cost of ownership, some indication can be given of the percentage of costs is associated with the body cameras themselves or other expenses: * The New South Wales Police Force in Australia produced 930 terabytes of recorded video each year with 350 bodycams. The costs involved in storing and managing the data was estimated at 6.5 million Australian dollars each year. The body cams were bought for less than 10% of that amount. * The Los Angeles Police Department (United States) acquired 7,000 cameras in 2016 for an amount of $57.6 million. At an estimated price of $570 per camera, the costs of the cameras would be around $4 million, which is 7% of the total amount. The other costs involve replacement equipment and digital storage of the recordings. * Police in Denver, Colorado (United States) bought 800 body cams and storage servers for the amount of $6.1 million. The price of the body cams was estimated to be 8% of that amount, the other 92% was spent on storage of recordings and management and maintenance of the body cams. The costs involved in reviewing, editing and submitting recorded video or the training of personnel were not included. * Rochester Police Department (NY, United States) purchased 550 cameras in January 2016 and from July 2016 to March 2017, successfully deploy 500 cameras to all patrol Lieutenants, Sergeants and Officers. Additional information on the full deployment can be found here. The Rochester Institute of Technology provides a full report of the program here. *The Sacramento Police Department (California, United States) purchased 890 cameras for all patrol staff under a five-year, $4 million agreement. Storage on an ongoing basis was expected to cost about $1 million per year. The city would also hire three full-time police employees to handle technology issues, including editing of video. * The Houston Police Department (Texas, United States) estimated that the total cost of about 4,100 cameras was $3.4 million for the equipment and an expected $8 million over five years to buy servers and other equipment to store video collected by the cameras, plus staffing costs. * Toronto Police Services concluded that the major challenge associated with any adoption of body-worn cameras is the cost. Staffing, technology and storage requirements would be about $20 million in the first year of implementation, with a total 5-year estimated cost of roughly $51 million, not including costs for integration of records management and video asset management systems. The most expensive component would be storage of recordings reaching nearly 5 petabytes in five years = Costs and benefits = All costs and benefits, including indirect costs and benefits, have to be weighed against each other in a cost-benefit analysis, to be able to judge whether body cameras lead to a positive or negative business case. The police in Kent, United Kingdom, predicted a positive business case within two years after their investment of ¬£1.8 million in body cameras, purely because of a reduction in the number of complaints. =Manufacturers and suppliers= In a 2012 market survey by the U.S. Department of Justice, eight companies producing body cameras were compared: Taser International, VisioLogix, StalkerVUE, Scorpion, FirstVU, Wolfcom, MuviView and Panasonic. In 2014, the three top companies that had been producing body cameras throughout the United States were Taser International, VieVu, and Digital Ally. In 2016, a market survey described 66 body worn video cameras produced by 38 different vendors.

In March 1841 three Mexicans, Valencia, Linares, and Duarte were under sentence of death at Los Angeles for robbing and murdering the German Trader Nicholas Fink. Meanwhile the vagabond class had broken into and robbed a tavern, and committed other violent acts. Thirty-three citizens petitioned government for a prompt execution of the trio to serve as an example. On April 7th they were executed, a strong guard of citizens remaining under arms for three days to repress any outbreak in favor of the prisoners. Although the excitement was strong no disturbance occurred. It was through the exertions of foreign residents at Los Angeles that these men were brought to justice. They confessed their guilt in open court. The judge of the first instance condemned them to death, and Governor Alvarado approved the sentence, and ordered the comandante at Santa Barbara to carry the same into execution within three days after receipt of the order. De Mofras says that the foreigners intimated to Alvarado that if the government did not execute the sentence the people would; but what this dogmatic Frenchman says on any subject must be taken cum grano salis.\\" Bancroft, Hubert Howe, Popular tribunals V.1, The History Company, San Francisco, 1887 At the San Diego Presidio Victor was married to a widow, Maria Micaela Villa, with two sons, Sebastian Villa, age 5 and Francisco age 2 on January 8, 1826.GARCIA, Maria Micaela, Female, 1801 - from schwaldfamily.org, accessed July 26, 2017. That April, while serving as a sentry, Victor Lenaris killed Juan German, a vecino of San Diego.

Bancroft & Company, San Francisco, 1885 Within a year of the courtmartial Victor Linares had left San Diego and was living near Mission San Gabriel, where his first son Pedro was born on July 30, 1827 and christened the following day. Victor had become a vecino of Los Angeles by 1831, when his second son, Pio was born May 4 and the following day was christened in La Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora la Reina de los √Ångeles in the town plaza.LINARES, Pio; Male 1831 - from schwaldfamily.org, accessed July 25, 2017.

Ranchero  The following year in 1837 Victor Linares was granted the two leagues of Rancho Tinaquaic in what is now in Santa Barbara County, California.Bancroft, Hubert Howe, History of California Vol. 3 (1825-1840), A. L. Bancroft & Company, San Francisco, 1885 There three more of his children, two daughters Maria and Augustias and a son Raymundo were born, between 1838 and 1841. Located far from a church there are no surviving records known of birth or christening for these children, only later census data for their approximate age. In 1839, Victor Linares was appointed majordomo of the lands of the Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa from May to October when he was let go to save the $20 salary and cost of his large family. However, in on April 22, 1840, Victor Linares as an alf√©rez in the Monterey company of auxiliaries, was ordered by Governor Juan B. Alvarado to take charge of a Sergeant and 11 men, under the command of Captain J. M. Covarrubias to be an escort of Prefect Castro during his mission to take 60 foreign prisoners including Isaac Graham, to Mexico City. They were accused with of plotting the overthrow of the government of Alta California. However his detachment was later replaced by a larger number of men under more experienced leaders.Bancroft, Hubert Howe, History of California Vol. 4 (1840-1845), A. L.

The rancho lay west of San Luis Obispo to Morro Bay in the Los Osos Valley, between the Irish Hills to the south and the Nine Sisters to the north.  Vecino and Juez of San Luis Obispo  In 1844, Victor Linares sold his Rancho Ca√±ada de los Osos to James Scott and John Wilson who also bought the adjacent Rancho Pecho y Islay a strip of Pacific coastal terrace and the Irish Hills bordering the terrace from Pecho Creek to the east and Islay Creek to the north. Scott and Willson added it to their Los Osos rancho and combined them in a new 32,431 acre grant, Rancho Ca√±ada de los Osos y Pecho y Islay from Governor Pio Pico in 1845. In January 1846 Victor Linares was appointed Juez of the Second Instance for San Luis Obispo. On March 7, Linares ordered Padre Jose Nicolas Gomez, curate of the Mission San Luis, to turn over Mission property to Juez Jesus Pico for James Scott and John Wilson its purchasers. Padre Gomez appealed to the bishop, who asked the Governor to reserve certain storerooms and the mills of the Mission. The Governor promised to investigate. March 10, Padre Gomez wrote to the Governor, complaining of lack of means of support, also of his mortifications and insults. March 29, possession given to Jesus Pico.

It stars Ellen Page, Sam Keeley, and Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, and was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot A plague called the Maze Virus has previously swept through Europe, transforming its victims into a homicidal, zombie like state. Ireland was particularly badly affected. A cure was later discovered, and 75% of those infected who could be captured have been treated and cured of the virus. The remaining 25% have proven resistant to the cure. The two groups are known as the Cured and the Infected. The Infected are held in captivity, despite public fears that keeping them alive could lead to another outbreak. Senan and Conor are Cured patients who have been interned together. Their 'Rehabilitation Officer', Sergeant Cantor, has little faith that the Cured can integrate back into society without further violence, and treats them with hostility. Senan reunites with his sister-in- law, Abbie, who has a young son, Cillian. Abbie asks Senan what became of her husband, Luke, Senan's brother, who is still missing. Senan claims ignorance of his fate, though it is revealed in one of Senan's many flashbacks that Conor infected Senan, who then killed Luke, in the house that Abbie still lives in. The Cured have a detailed memory of what they have done while infected; many of them suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder. Conor, formerly a lawyer with political aspirations, cannot find work and is shunned by his family for his acts while infected. He forms an underground movement called the Cured Alliance, with the aim of regaining the civil liberties that the Cured have lost. The government is planning to euthanise the 25% (5,000 patients) who are infected, despite the assertions of a prominent virologist that a better vaccine for the Infected is nearly developed. Senan takes a job at the hospital where the Infected are housed, and observes that they show no interest in attacking the Cured. This is a source of political tension in the community, as the never-infected suspect aloud that the Cured would love to see another outbreak of the Maze Virus, as they would be largely immune to its effects. Conor attempts to recruit Senan into the Cured Alliance. Senan initially refuses, but after experiencing the hostility of society towards the Cured, he takes part in an arson mission for the group. Conor claims that the targets are uninhabited houses, but a soldier is killed and Cantor suspects Senan and Conor. Cantor approaches Abbie at her house and tells her that the Infected are linked in some telepathic manner, and that they form into packs like predatory animals. He suggests that the predatory traits are not eliminated by the vaccine, and that the Cured are still dangerous. He shows Abbie a photograph of Conor and Senan roaming together when they were infected. Conor appeared to be leading Senan in murderous acts in the photo. Conor later approaches Abbie, and tacitly admits that he and Senan killed her husband while they were infected during the early days of the outbreak. Abbie confronts Senan and throws him out. Senan realises that Conor has no remorse for what he has done in the past, and what he is still doing. Senan assists Cantor in a sting operation to arrest Conor after he confesses aloud to the arson; however, Conor violently murders Cantor and flees. The Cured Alliance initiate a plan to free the Infected from their confinement. The Infected take to the streets, killing and infecting new victims and causing mass chaos. Irish Army troops are deployed. Senan finds Abbie, who is frantically trying to retrieve Cillian from his school. Senan rescues Cillian but is confronted by Conor, who beats him savagely. A soldier shoots Conor but he escapes. Senan, Abbie and Cillian return to their house, but Cillian is bitten and infected. Senan, knowing he is immune, takes Cillian, and tells Abbie he will keep him safe until another vaccine is available. Some time later, a news broadcast announces that order has been restored, although 8,000 new infected people are now in captivity. During the announcement, promotional posters of Conor (as the voice of the Cured Alliance) can be seen. It is publicised that some Infected are now in hiding, as the government is again discussing euthanasia for the resistant 25%. Senan goes into hiding with the infected Cillian.

It was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. The story follows Tara, a stay at home mother, who is beginning to fall out of love with her husband, Mark, and their kids. Plot Tara (Gemma Arterton) is a wife to Mark (Dominic Cooper) and a stay- at-home mother to two children, Teddy and Florrie. Tara goes to a nearby park and seems upset. There is a passage of time. Tara and Mark are asleep in bed, when they are woken by a phone call. Tara resignedly has sex with Mark, during which she is in tears, unknowingly to Mark. She helps Mark get ready for work, and takes the children to school. When she leaves the school she stops and stands outside, in distress. The following Saturday morning Tara wakes up early, trying not to wake up Mark. He does wake up and she reluctantly engages in sex with him, again in distress unnoticed by Mark. Following a visit to the park, Mark tries to have sex with her in one of the children's rooms, which she refuses. Mark questions whether she's having an affair which she denies and they argue. Later they're having a BBQ with friends and Mark berates her for not providing drinks for the guests. That evening they are having sex again, and Tara again is crying and in distress. Afterwards she repeatedly whispers that she is not happy, and after some brief discussion with Mark she says she's going to sleep. There is a passage of time. Tara goes to London by herself, where she discovers and buys a book about the tapestries of The Lady and the Unicorn at a second-hand bookseller. Later that evening she discusses with Mark attending an art course and is upset that he does not understand how important it is to her, although he ultimately agrees that she should do whatever makes her happy. Later they go out for dinner, but they are both disconnected. A following morning, Tara takes the children to school and on the drive home stops at the Eurostar Ebbsfleet International railway station. She sits and watches the trains and forgets to pick the children up from school, arriving late. Teddy is particularly upset, and once home Tara becomes enraged and swears at him for moving her book. Enraged, she leaves the house briefly then returns to apologise profusely to the children. Later that evening she discusses with Mark how she doesn't care about being a parent. The following day she discusses her issues with her mother, Alison, who is not supportive and tells her it's a phase. A following morning, Tara refuses to help with the children during breakfast. Mark takes the children to school and returns home to try and resolve things with her. Mark berates her, but ultimately apologises and tells her he just wants her to be happy. There is a passage of time. Tara is increasingly detached and anxious. She knocks over a jug of orange juice while tidying up breakfast for which Mark berates her. She goes to the bedroom and packs a bag with clothes and her passport. Mark tries to stop her but she leaves in the car. Mark is upset and tries to calm the children. Tara goes to Ebbsfleet and takes a train to Paris. Tara walks around Paris, happy. She stays overnight at a hotel. The following morning she travels by Paris M√©tro to the Mus√©e national du Moyen √Çge to see the tapestries of The Lady and the Unicorn. On the way in to the museum she passes a man with a camera. Later in the museum the man, Phillipe, takes photos of Tara and discusses the history of the tapestries with her. They both tell each they are not in a relationship. They spend the rest of the day together and end up having sex in Tara's hotel room. They are interrupted by a message on Phillipe's phone. Tara questions who the message is from, and Phillipe admits to being married and having a child. She tells him to leave, which he does. Tara listens to the pleading voicemails from Mark, her children, and her mother, while crying. She leaves the hotel and is extremely upset and anxious. Tara wakes up on the sofa the following morning. A French woman, Anna, took pity on her and she spent the night at her house. Anna counsels Tara about her life and tells her to try and change her life with her husband, but if that does not work, then do it without him. Mark has travelled to Paris, and Tara goes to meet him. They embrace. There is a passage of time. The first scene of the story plays again, and it transpires that it was from the future. Tara is living in a different home. Tara goes to the park, and this time we hear she stops to see a mother and child playing together. She is upset, briefly, then continues to walk on.

Sulzberger. It stars Ed Harris, Jason Sudeikis, Elizabeth Olsen, Bruce Greenwood, Wendy Crewson, and Dennis Haysbert. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2017, and was released on April 20, 2018, by Netflix. Plot Matt Ryder is an A&R; representative at a record label who is in danger of losing his job after his company's biggest client signs with another label. His father's assistant and nurse Zooey Kern arrives at his office and informs him that his father Ben, a famous photographer, is terminally ill. Though they have not spoken in over ten years, Ben has requested that Matt drive him to Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas, the last shop that still develops Kodachrome film. Ben has several undeveloped rolls he wants to have processed before he dies, and Dwayne's will stop in the near future because Kodak no longer makes the required dyes. Matt refuses, but Ben's manager Larry, persuades him by offering to arrange a meeting between Matt and the Spare Sevens, a band he has been trying to sign to his label. Matt, Ben and Zooey start the journey, and Ben throws away Matt's GPS and insists on taking back roads so he can take photos and enjoy the scenery. In Ohio, the group makes a detour so they can visit Ben's brother Dean and Dean's wife Sarah, who were Matt's surrogate parents following his mother's death. Zooey and Matt bond over Matt's old music collection, and later a drunk Matt leans in to kiss her, but falls off the bed. He sleeps on the floor, and they end up sharing stories of their failed marriages. The next morning, Zooey is awakened by Ben, who has fallen in the bathroom and needs help to stand up. Ben irritates Dean and Sarah at breakfast by mentioning that he and Sarah once had a sexual relationship. Sarah explains that it was before she and Dean dated, which does little to assuage Dean's anger. In Chicago, Matt gets the chance to make his pitch to the Spare Sevens, and follows his father's advice not to tell the band how great they are, but to point out what they're doing wrong and why they need Matt to fix it. Lead singer Jasper and the other band members admire Matt's nerve and begin to agree to the outlines of a deal, but start to mock Ben when he accidentally urinates on himself. Though it will probably cost him his job, Matt tells them he does not respect them and leaves the meeting to check on his father. At their hotel, Ben expresses disappointment to Zooey that Matt did not close the deal. Zooey points out that Matt made a career- ending decision in defending his father, which leads to Ben firing her. Zooey joins Matt at a bar, where he receives several texts from his boss letting him know he has in fact been fired. They continue to drink, and then spend the night together. The next morning, Zooey calls her night with Matt a mistake and returns to New York. Matt receives no answer at Ben's door and has the hotel staff open it. Ben is unconscious on the floor, and Matt has him rushed to the hospital. The doctor tells Matt that Ben's cancer can no longer be treated, he cannot travel, and he should be placed in hospice care. That night, Ben struggles to load film into a camera, eliciting Matt's help. Through tears, Ben tells Matt that he does not expect forgiveness, but that he loves him. Matt and Ben embrace. The next day, Matt takes Ben out of the hospital so they can finish the trip to Parsons, which will require driving nonstop overnight to make it to the photo lab in time. They drop off Ben's film at Dwayne's and as they start to leave, Ben is recognized by several patrons, most of whom are well-known photographers also on hand to get their film developed. One says he became a photographer after seeing Ben's work, and several ask to have photos taken with Ben, giving Matt insight into his father's influence and legacy. In the hotel room, Ben is cleaning his camera when he dies. Larry arrives to make funeral arrangements and Dwayne delivers the developed photos. Matt offers them to Larry, but Larry refuses, saying that Ben's wish was for Matt to take possession and curate them for a showing. At Ben's home, Matt loads the photo slides into a projector and is surprised to see dozens of pictures of himself as a little boy, many with his deceased mother, and some with his father. Zooey arrives and asks if he would like some company, then they stand together and view Ben's slides.

It is home to over 300 undergraduates, and is the second oldest of the residential colleges, after Victoria House. History In 1926, the death of William Weir left the University with an estate of ¬£77,500 to build its first hall of residence for male students. Although work began in 1930, the building had to be redesigned when the Napier earthquake struck in February 1931. On 1 March 1933, the governor-general planted a pohutukawa and officially opened Weir House. Sixty-five students took up residence that year in the original William Weir wing. By 1935, there was a waiting list. In 1968, the Department of External Affairs funded the James Hutchison Wing as part of the Colombo Plan. This was later renovated and extended in 1994. After litigation due to the will of William Weir stating his money was to be used for a male hall of residence, female students were finally allowed to take up residence at Weir House in 1979 as the hall had built its extension through government funding. The former Japanese ambassador's residence was acquired and converted to Andrea Brander House in 1987, accommodating students who wish to live in an alcohol free area. In 2006, a new alcohol-free block called Te WhƒÅnau was built and has a glass lounge (named Piringa), which is used as a common area. In 2015 and 2016, Weir House residents' drinking was the cause of media coverage, with near-by Kelburn residents concerned about noise and litter. In June 2017, Victoria University proposed that the position of Head of Hall across its six halls be cut, and replaced by three Hall General Managers. The cited reason was that students had stated in a survey that pastoral care was not important to them.

Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy was released theatrically worldwide on 2 October 2019.  Reception  = Critical response = Neeshita Nyayapati writing for The Times of India gave the 3.5 stars out of 5 stating that \\"the story-telling has its flaws, but the characters are intriguing. What's impressive is the massive canvas the film is mounted on. Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy might work only in bits and pieces, but the scenes in which the film works makes it all worthwhile!\\". Rahul Devulapalli writing for The Week gave the 3.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"The movie's biggest strengths are its visuals, especially the war scenes. Roping in of international stunt directors has enhanced the overall experience. Producer and son of Chiranjeevi, Ram Charan, has pulled out all stops in marketing the film and it did not go waste. In the end, though the product is worth appreciating, it cannot be called a biopic of Narasimha Reddy as a lot of events in the movie are historically questionable. If you can silence the fact-checker in you, watch the movie for Chiranjeevi and the action sequences\\". Hemanth Kumar writing for Firstpost gave the 3.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"At a runtime of nearly 170 minutes, Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy tells a fascinating story about a rebellion that's never been explored in Telugu cinema. Despite the familiarity of the genre, the film relies quite a lot on Chiranjeevi's screen presence. And he packs a punch and how\\". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu praised the cinematography, costumes, Chiranjeevi's performance and adding that the makers skilfully use cinematic liberties to play to the mainstream, crowd-pleasing format. Joel Kurian writing for Republic TV gave the 3.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy is inconsistent, but should easily make it to every list of the best films based on Indian freedom fighters, thanks to its technical brilliance, an amazing climax and Chiranjeevi\\". DNA India gave the 3.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Sye Raa has enough strength to start a rebellion even today. It is a tale of how the warrior changed the future with his life and even in death\\". Jigar Ganatra of Mumbai Live gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy Is Packed With Powerful Performances.\\" Haricharan Pudipeddi writing for PinkVilla gave the 3.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy definitely needed a visionary filmmaker like SS Rajamouli to make it work even more wholesomely. But, Surender Reddy still manages to impress and delivers a product that's masses- friendly. Ram Charan deserves a lot of praise for believing in this story and in his father and mounting this project on a scale that's only next to Baahubali, and there's no second thoughts about it\\". Shruti Rhode writing for Times Now News gave the 3 stars out of 5 stating, \\"The background score, crisp script and effective screenplay of Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy make for an intense, entertaining film that you definitely ought to watch. And don't be surprised if you find yourself amidst whistles, cheers, and hoots every once in a while\\". Janani K writing for India Today gave the 3 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy, directed by Surender Reddy, takes the safe route in showcasing the fight to freedom. Chiranjeevi's excellent performance makes up for an underwhelming screenplay\\". Apoorva Gupta writing for India TV gave the 3 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Though the movie boasts of a great cast and a good story-line, it fails to make the desired impact on the audience. The screen time is too long, with movie running for over 2 hours and 50 minutes. The story-telling feels rushed in the beginning and too-streched in the second half. With great sets, action scenes and talented actors, Sye Raa Narasimha can make for a good one time watch!\\". The Hans India gave the 3 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Mounted on an epic scale the movie has some breathtaking visuals, elaborate sets, life-like battle scenes, and colorful costumes. There is a lot more in the movie than just the war for freedom. There are so many wonderful scenes in the movie which will make the audience applaud. The movie is all about why Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy went against British rule and how he had formed a group and rampaged the British etc. There are some outstanding scenes in the film which will give goosebumps to the audience. Especially the one where the British hang Narasimha Reddy will make the audience emotional. Also, the court scene is definitely amazing and the climax is handled really well. Overall, Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy is an epic story that cannot be forgotten\\". Harshada Rege writing for The Times of India gave the film three stars out of five, praising performance of Chiranjeevi and Kichcha Sudeep, Rege noted that film was jingoistic in parts. Criticising the screenplay and direction he opined that film was lengthy. Concluding, he wrote, \\"While the storytelling has its flaws, what needs to be lauded is that the makers pulled out this tale from the pages of history and mounted it on such a massive canvas for us to see.\\" Krishna Sripada writing for The News Minute gave the 2.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"Surender Reddy's could-have-been magnum opus is not boring. Yet, for the budget it had, the storytelling and narrative threads leave a lot to be desired\\". Manoj Kumar R writing for The Indian Express gave the 2.5 stars out of 5 stating, \\"The major flaw in Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy is Surender's attempt to force a sprawling story into a mould that fits the narrow definition of mainstream commercial cinema\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote \\"But even the biggest star needs the gravity of a strong screenplay, and that's where Sye Raa falters, and ultimately fails. Apart from Chiranjeevi, there is nothing holding things together ‚Äî and nothing that differentiates this rise-against-the-British saga from any villager-versus-evil-landlord masala movie\\". = Authenticity = Historians across India have noted that the concept of Indian nationalism was not yet developed at the time. Instead the rebellion was his struggle to keep his rights and privileges that the British were trying to take from him. Nekkanti Srinivasa Rao, a Telugu historian, told to media that the movie lacks historical accuracy, saying that Narasimha Reddy only questioned the British authorities for his monthly pension which he was supposed to inherit from his grandfather. Telugu writer SDV Aziz who penned the popular biography of Narasimha Reddy Renati Surya Chandrulu was of the opinion that some cinematic liberty is necessary because of the emotional charge it needs to provide to the viewer. However, director Surender Reddy has made it clear to the Telangana High court that Sye Raa is not a biopic but is inspired by his life. The film was released with a disclaimer through which the makers emphasize that while the story is inspired by the life of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy, they do not claim historical accuracy for all the events shown in the narrative.  Box office  The movie opened in the United States on 1 October 2019 and it collected around $750 thousand. and in Australia it collected at A$162k.The film grossed total box office of 240 crores against the production budget of 300 crores.

The station will serve the Portway park and ride facility on the A4 Portway and form part of the MetroWest scheme.  History  The railway through the site was inaugurated on 6 March 1865, when services began on the Bristol Port Railway and Pier (BPRP), a self- contained railway which ran along the north bank of the River Avon to a deep- water pier on the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. The route was standard gauge single-track. The BPRP ran into trouble by 1871, when the terminal pier at Avonmouth became difficult to use due to a build-up of silt. With no prospect of a proper dock being funded without a connection to the national rail network, the Clifton Extension Railway (CER) was approved. This was a joint venture by the BPRP, Great Western Railway and Midland Railway which ran from Sneyd Park Junction, south of , via , to join up with the national network at Narroways Hill Junction. The link opened in 1877. Despite the increased traffic the BPRP suffered financially, and was taken over by the CER in 1890. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, the line came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways and, upon privatisation, transferred to Railtrack and later Network Rail. A park and ride was opened near junction 18 of the M5 motorway, adjacent to the railway, in 2002. Station proposal In 2009, it was proposed that a railway station should be built. The plan was supported by Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways and the Bristol branch of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. The plan was approved in October 2012. In 2017, ¬£2.23million was allocated for construction, of which ¬£1.67M came from the government's New Stations Fund, with additional funding coming from the West of England Combined Authority and West of England Local Enterprise Partnership. Ground surveys began in 2017, with completion originally planned for 2019; however, planning permission was not granted until March 2019. The station, part of the MetroWest scheme, will have a platform suitable for five-car trains. There will be seven disabled parking spaces by the access point, and parking for 40 bicycles.

' ‚Äûchop‚Äú, from Fr. ' resp. Lat. ' ‚Äûrib‚Äú), also known as Koteletts, Karree, Karbonade or cutlets, are a German meat dish made of slices of meat from the rib area, including the bone. The piece of rib is found on both sides of the spine behind the neck. Koteletts are typically offered from pork, veal and mutton, but they can also come from beef. Usually, koteletts are served either roasted or grilled, but in some cases they are also served breaded (cf. breaded cutlet).  Kinds of meat used for koteletts  Pork: front or neck kotelett Pork: middle kotelett Pork: hind or fillet kotelett = Pork = The part where the koteletts are taken from reach from the front to the hind leg. Due to the proximity to the neck, koteletts taken from the front are also known as \\"Nackenkotelett\\" (lit. neck kotelett) in Germany or \\"Halskotelett\\" in Switzerland. The middle ones are known as \\"Stielkotelett\\" or \\"Rippenkotelett\\" (lit. rib kotelett) due to the long and closely fitting rib cage. The hind koteletts, including parts of the fillet, are known as \\"Lummerkotelett\\", \\"Lendenkotelett\\" or \\"Filetkotelett\\" (lit. loin kotelett or fillet kotelett) in Germany or \\"Nierenst√ºck\\" (en. loin) in Switzerland. These hind koteletts are especially low on bones and fat. = Veal = Only the front part of the ribs are used to make koteletts when speaking of veal. The hind part of the ribs is typically sold without the bones. = Mutton = Similarly to the veal, koteletts from mutton are taken from the front or middle part of the ribs only. = Beef = The front kotelett of the beef is known as \\"Hochrippe\\" (lit. high ribs) and is usually used as boiled beef, goulash or, without the bones, as steak. The hind kotelett or the beef is known in two variants: with ribs and without. Together with the fillet, it is similar to the t-bone steak. Without bones, it is also sold as Roastbeef or rump steak. = Fish = In some instances, the slices of fish with several centimeters of thickness that are cut vertically from the spine are known as koteletts as well. They are typically cut from bigger fish such as cod.  Trivia  In Switzerland, the popular Cervelat sausage is also known as the kotelett of the laborer.

S√°nchez, and starring George MacKay, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton, Mia Goth, and Matthew Stagg. The film tells the story of the titular Marrowbone siblings (MacKay, Heaton, Goth, and Stagg), who relocate from England to their mother's ancestral estate in Maine, where they are faced by a sinister presence in the home. Marrowbone was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and released in Spain on 27 October 2017, by Universal Pictures. Plot In 1968, a woman named Rose brings her four children from England to her childhood home, the Marrowbone Residence, in rural Maine. She urges them to leave their past behind and make new memories. Things start off well, and they make friends with a girl named Allie. However, Rose's health worsens and she dies, leaving behind her children Jack (20), Jane (19), Billy (18) and Sam (5). Before dying, Rose instructs Jack to hide news of her death until he turns 21 and legally able to care for his siblings. Six months later, the person the family was running from finds the place. Another six months later, the siblings still live in the house. All the mirrors are hidden or covered to protect them from a \\"ghost\\" in the loft, which has apparently been gone for several months. Of all the siblings, only Jack visits the local town to take care of any necessities. He courts Allie, now a library employee, while keeping his past from her. The town lawyer, Tom Porter, is in charge of the Marrowbone estate, and has unrequited affections for Allie. Tom informs Jack he will come to collect the $200 fee and Rose's signature to finish the paperwork that transfer ownership of the estate to Jack. Desperate for money, Jack uses the \\"cursed\\" money of their father. Billy retrieves the money box at a secluded spot on the beach. Jack gives ¬£200 to Tom, and Jane fakes Rose's signature on the papers, concluding the transfer. After several incidents, the siblings believe the \\"ghost\\" is back because they used the money. Billy \\"returns the money\\" by climbing on the roof and throwing the box with the rest of the money down the chimney into the attic. Sam sneaks into Rose's old room, where all the mirrors are kept, sees the \\"ghost\\" inside a mirror, and is traumatized. At this point, it is heavily implied that the \\"ghost\\" was their abusive father, who was bricked up in the attic and starved to death. Jane suggests properly burying him, but Jack dismisses the idea. After Allie firmly rejects Tom's advances, he gives her a folder containing the investigation on the Marrowbone siblings. The files inside revealed their father, Simon Fairbairn, to be a notorious criminal. He was convicted in court, with Jack a key witness, and later broke out of jail. In the house, Jane saw a racoon being attacked and dragged into the attic and is convinced that Simon is still alive. Tom was informed his potential employer is no longer interested in an employee, but a partner. He is offered 10% of their share for $5,000, which he doesn't have. Tom believes that the Marrowbone siblings have ¬£10,000, which was listed as missing from Simon Fairbairn's property, and blackmails Jack. Billy climbs down the attic to retrieve the box, and barely escapes Simon's assault. Billy confronts Jack about Simon and urges Jack to deal with him together. Their argument is interrupted when Jack faints and has a seizure. Jane decides they must tell Allie the truth. The siblings send Allie their diary. While Allie reads through it, Tom arrives at the house. Seeing the bricked up attic entrance, he is convinced the money is hidden there and tears down the wall. The diary reveals when Simon found the house six months ago, Jack locked his siblings inside the attic. He tried to give the money box back to Simon at the secluded place on the beach, but is knocked out by the vengeful father. When Jack regained consciousness, he returned to the house, only to realize Simon had entered the attic through the chimney and killed his siblings. After bricking up the attic, Jack prepared to commit suicide, but hallucinated his siblings into existence. Mimicking his mother, Jack begins to \\"make new memories.\\" He hides all the mirrors to avoid reminding himself that he is alone, and avoids going into the attic for the same reason. The siblings eventually become alternate personalities within his mind. After learning the truth, Allie goes to the Marrowbone house and finds Jack's different personalities arguing with each other. She tries to snap him out of it, but he drives her away, unwilling to accept the deaths of his siblings. Noticing Tom's belongings, Allie goes up the attic and finds Jane, Billy and Sam's desiccated corpses, as well as a dying Tom. She confronts a horribly malnourished but still ferocious Simon, while calling out for Jack's alternate personalities for help. Eventually, Billy takes over and kills Simon. Some time later, Allie is shown living in the Marrowbone house with Jack and all of his siblings' personalities.

It opened in 1819 and is a grade II* listed building. The church is situated just off Trinity Street, named after the church and forming part of the main A640 road from Huddersfield to Rochdale, and is just outside the town centre, in the suburb of Marsh. The parish forms part of the diocese of Leeds. In the early 19th century the town of Huddersfield was growing rapidly as a result of the industrial revolution and the town's parish church was too small to cope. In order to address this, Holy Trinity was built between 1816 and 1819 as a chapel of ease. The new church was funded by Benjamin Haigh Allen, a local banker, and designed by the architect Thomas Taylor of Leeds. Benjamin Haigh Allen invited Henry Maddock (1781-1826) to be Holy Trinity's first Perpetual Curate. Maddock met Allen during a preaching tour he gave in 1814 along with the Revd. Legh Richmond, on behalf of the Church Mission Society.http://www.holytrinityhuddersfield.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/11/Churchwardens-Blog-No-8.pdf Holy Trinity became a parish church in its own right in 1857, serving Marsh and the adjoining suburbs of Edgerton and Springwood.

It is home to 182 undergraduates. Opened in 1907 as the Women Student's Hostel Society, Victoria House is the longest established hall of residence at Victoria University of Wellington, and the second hall of residence for women students in New Zealand. History In the early years of the twentieth century Margaret Wallis (the wife of the Bishop Frederic Wallis, Anglican Bishop of Wellington), Jean Gibb (wife of Rev Dr James Gibb, minister of St John's Presbyterian Church) and a group of other like-minded women recognised the need for a hostel for women who had come to Wellington to undertake study at Victoria University of Wellington and the Wellington Teacher's Training College. This group of women formed the Women Student's Hostel Society, and the outcome of their initial efforts was a two-storied wooden building at 282 the Terrace, which accommodated 29 residents. A kitchen, dining and sitting room, and accommodation for the matron - the person who ran the hostel - were included.History of Vic House http://www.vichouse.org/history/ Opened in 1907, this building is still part of Victoria House. Almost immediately the building was finished, the Society purchased the cottage next door (280 The Terrace), using it for additional accommodation. This was the first of many acquisitions of adjacent or nearby properties over the next century. In the mid-1950s, the original building was extensively refurbished and extended over the site of the adjacent cottage, providing a few additional rooms, and improved kitchen facilities, dining room and common room. Then in the early 1970s, a five- storeyed accommodation block ‚Äì later called Wallis Wing ‚Äì was built across the back of all the old houses the Society had acquired from 280 to 288 The Terrace. As before, the opportunity was taken to build a new kitchen and dining room to accommodate the greatly increased numbers of residents, and as a consequence the original hostel building was refurbished once again. Some of the old houses along The Terrace were subsequently removed to enable construction of the modern buildings now known as Pope House (opened in 1993), and the Bennett Houses. Most recently, 9 Maurice Terrace (behind Wallis Wing) was reconstructed as Hutchison House (2013). In 2014 seismic strengthening was undertaken of Wallis Wing and a progressive refurbishment programme for the building was started, the first stage of which was completed in early 2015.

It was installed in that location in 2017. Between 1938 and 2016, the bridge was located approximately 50 miles away, and carried M-86 over the Prairie River near Nottawa, Michigan, and was known then as the M-86‚ÄìPrairie River Bridge. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, and is the last remaining camelback pony truss bridge used on the state trunkline system in Michigan. History This bridge was designed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1923, and was constructed by contractor Ira Lyons. It was originally located on Telegraph Road over the Rouge River. In 1938/39, the bridge was moved to this site and rebuilt as part of a Public Works Administration federal relief work project, replacing a pin-connected through- truss span bridge. Contractor L. W. Lamb oversaw the reconstruction. The bridge was rebuilt to the original plans, save for the elimination of two sidewalks which had been previously cantilevered outside the trusses. In 2016, the Michigan Department of Transportation removed the bridge and replaced it with a wider structure. This bridge was restored and moved to Crystal Springs Street over the Dowagiac River in Pokagon Township, Cass County in 2017. Description The bridge is a riveted steel eight-panel single span camelback pony truss bridge on a rural section of M-86. The bridge is 90 feet long, with a 32.8-foot-wide concrete deck and a 27 feet wide roadway. Five I-beams support the floor. The upper chord is constructed with back-to-back channels with lattice, while the lower chord and verticals are constructed from two pairs of angles with a plate in the middle. A metal guard rail serves as a railing. The bridge is supported with concrete abutments, and U-shaped concrete wing walls line the approach on each side.

It is also sometimes spelled chaumos. It is celebrated for two weeks at winter solstice (Dec. 7-22), at the beginning of the month chawmos mastruk in two weeks. Chawmos is celebrated without musical instruments in the Rumbur and Bumborate villages but with instruments in Birir village. Chawmos comes after the Kalash finish their fieldwork and store their cheese, fruit, vegetables and grains for the year.  Rituals  The first week of Chawmos (7-14 December) is for the Kalash people only. Kalash girls select their bridegrooms after some rituals. The entire population remains indoors. It is celebrated by feasting until the elders, who sit on a hilltop, watching the sun reaching the orbit, declare the advent of the New Year. Children go up to the mountain, where they divide into boys and girls, and respectively make a big bonfire. In the second week of Chawmos (15-22 December), the people thank their god with dance and music. This part of festival is public. It involves much music and dancing, and the sacrifice of many goats. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical homeland of the Kalash, Tsyam (Tsiyam, ts√≠am), for the duration of the feast. Food sacrifices are offered at the clans' Jeshtak shrines, dedicated to the ancestors. At Chawmos, impure and uninitiated persons are not admitted; they must be purified by a waving a fire brand over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving juniper brands over the men. The 'old rules' of the gods (Devalog, dewal≈çk) are no longer in force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. 'The main Chawmos ritual takes place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra's place, \\"indrunkot\\", or \\"indr√©yin\\". Indrunkot is sometimes believed to belong to Balumain's brother, In(dr), lord of cattle. Ancestors, impersonated by young boys (≈çnje·π£·π≠a 'pure') are worshipped and offered bread; they hold on to each other and form a chain (cf. the Vedic anvƒÅrambha·πáa) and snake through the village. The men must be divided into two parties: the pure ones have to sing the well-honored songs of the past, but the impure sing wild, passionate, and obscene songs, with an altogether different rhythm. This is accompanied by a 'sex change': men dress as women, women as men (Balumain also is partly seen as female and can change between both forms at will). During the Chawmos prayers, a procession goes to a high plateau outside the village in Balangkuru where a long night of dancing begins. The festivals continue for many more days, moving on to different locations within the valleys. It is the most exciting among all the festivals. Girls dance in cold weather and snowfall and boys play various winter games in the festival. Tourists rarely visit the festival due to blockage of roads and heavy snowfall.

Early life Kate Brousseau was born on April 24, 1862, in Ypsilanti, Michigan, daughter of Judge Julius Brousseau (1834‚Äì1903), born in New York by French Canadian parents, and Caroline Yakeley (1834‚Äì1901), of English and German heritage. Brousseau was the older of 4 siblings. Brousseau was educated at Los Angeles High School and Los Angeles State Normal school (later University of California, Los Angeles). She was valedictorian of her class, the first graduating from Los Angeles State Normal School in June 1884. She then studied at University of Minnesota, University of California, University of Chicago Law School, in Germany and in Paris. In Paris she was the only woman in a class of 60 students. She was granted a doctorate with high honors, Ph.D., from the Sorbonne, Paris, in 1904. Career Brousseau Mansion, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1960. Around 1882, Kate Brousseau started her teaching career giving private French lessons at her family home, the Brousseau Mansion, built around 1878 by her father, at 238 South Bunker Hill Avenue, Los Angeles. The house appears in the movie The Money Trap (MGM, 1966) and also briefly in Bus Stop (1956) (across the street from Marilyn Monroe's boarding house) and it was demolished shortly after The Money Trap was filmed there. In 1891, Brosseau taught French at the Los Angeles State Normal School and also translated French literature for the Los Angeles Times. From 1897 to 1903 Brousseau was on the faculty at the Los Angeles State Normal School teaching mathematics and psychology. From 1907 to 1928 she was professor of psychology and in the end chair of the Psychology Department at Mills College, Oakland. Brousseau made a psychological survey of the inmates of Sonoma State Home for the Feebleminded (later Sonoma Developmental Center) in 1914 and 1915, giving tests to about 1400 disabled children and was director of the psychological services at the Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles. In 1937, Brousseau wrote Psychological service at the Los Angeles Institute of Family Relations. Brousseau served in the French Army in World War I from 1917 to 1919, as \\"directrice des Foyers du Soldat\\" (director of a soldiers' home), stationed on Lorraine Front; she was with the French Army of Occupation in Germany and in devastated districts of Northern France. At the end of the war Brosseau helped to rehabilitate traumatized soldiers and was assistant to surgeon Dr. E. Toulouse in examining street railway employees. Brousseau was awarded the Medaille Commemorative Francaise de la Grand Guerre by the French Government in 1920. Brousseau is the author of L'√©ducation des n√®gres aux √âtats-Unis (1904) and Mongolism: A Study of the Physical and Mental Characteristics of Mongolian Imbeciles (1928). In \\"Mongolism\\" Brousseau argues that a precursor of the Mongolian idiocy was to be found in the \\"furfuraceous cretin\\" described by √âdouard S√©guin in Idiocy and its Treatment by the Physiological Method (1866). The term Mongolism was replaced by the term Down Syndrome only later, in 1961, after Clemens Ernst Benda signed a petition on The Lancet journal. Brousseau was treasurer and director of the Southern California Society of Mental Hygiene. Brousseau was a member of American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Association of University Professors, American Association of University Women, Women's Overseas Service League, Lique d'Hygiene Mental of Paris, American Psychological Association, Southern California Academy of Criminology, Ecole d'Antropologie-Paris. Personal life Kate Brousseau moved with her family to California in 1877, and lived at 2617 Cole St., Oakland, California. At the time of her death she was living with her sister Mabel at 513 North Beechwood Drive, Los Angeles. During World War I, Brosseau supported Edith Wharton in her war-reliefs projects; a letter from August 7, 1919, from Wharton to Brosseau, thanks Brosseau for sending 100 francs from Mills College, Wharton writes \\"all the children of Flanders went back to Belgium last month\\". Brosseau retired in 1928 and died on July 8, 1938. She is buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Los Angeles.

The flight was carried out by Propair, a charter airline based in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, using a Fairchild Metroliner SA226. On 18 June 1998, the aircraft suffered an in-flight fire shortly after take-off from Dorval and the crew elected to conduct an emergency landing at Montr√©al‚ÄìMirabel International Airport. The intense heat of the fire caused a structural failure in the left wing during the landing and the aircraft crashed, killing all 11 passengers and crew on board. The investigation conducted by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board revealed that the left brakes of Flight 420 had overheated during take-off, causing a fire inside the wheel-well which destroyed warning systems, causing the crew to be unaware of the severity of the fire, then ruptured hydraulic pipe-lines and spreading to the left wing. Following the accident the Canadian TSB issued several recommendations, one of which was a recommendation to the FAA regarding the crew training and flight manual, and another being a recommendation to install an overheat warning system inside the wheel-wells of every Metroliner; before the accident warning systems were not required on such aircraft. Flight Propair Flight 420 took off from Dorval Airport (now Montr√©al‚ÄìPierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport) at 07:01 EDT carrying 9 passengers and 2 crew members. The flight was chartered by General Electric to transport personnel to a GE facility in Peterborough, Ontario. It was foggy at the time with light winds blowing from the right side of the aircraft. Flight 420 was cleared to 16,000 ft. At 07:13, the crew of Flight 420 informed the tower that there was a decrease on the hydraulic pressure and requested to return to the airport. Dorval Tower cleared Flight 420's request to return and ordered them to descend to and make a 180 degree turn. At the time there was no indication that the flight was in grave danger. Approximately 30 seconds after Flight 420's request to return, control problems started to occur. The aircraft became harder to control and a warning indicator showed that an engine problem was developing. 40 seconds later, the wing overheat warning system was illuminated. Before the crew had conducted the checklist for handling such an emergency, the warning light went off. 5 minutes later the left engine appeared to be on fire. The crew later shut down the engine. The aircraft could barely be controlled by the crew; an abnormal right aileron input was needed to keep the aircraft on heading. Dorval Tower then suggested that the crew divert to Montr√©al‚ÄìMirabel International Airport. The crew agreed. The fire intensified and the crew could see that fire was coming out from the engine nacelle. The crew then conducted emergency checklist and configured the aircraft for landing. At 07:23, the crew stated that the fire in the left wing had died out. However, less than four minutes later, they announced that the fire had started again. The aircraft became harder to control and even started to roll. Maximum aileron trim were set by the crew. While Flight 420 was short on final, the landing gear was deployed. When Flight 420 was near the runway threshold, the severely damaged left wing failed. The aircraft then rotated 90 degrees to the left: fuel spilled from the aircraft and ignited. The aircraft spiralled and crashed, coming to rest on the left side of Runway 24L. All 2 crew members and 9 passengers on board were killed. 2 passengers initially survived the crash, but ultimately died of their injuries. Passengers and crews The flight was chartered by General Electric to transport their workers to their facility in Lachine, Quebec and Peterborough, Ontario. Flight 420 was carrying 9 passengers (initially reported 10). All of them were engineers, working as a team in the design of hydroelectric turbines. All of them were regular commuters. Speaking on a press conference, Company President of Propair, Jean Pronovost, claimed that both pilots were \\"very professional\\". The pilot of the flight was identified as 35 year old Captain Jean Provencher. He began his pilot career as a first officer on the type in November 1996 to May 1996. He served as captain and as check pilot on similar aircraft types for several air carriers. In May 1996, he was hired by Propair as company chief pilot. He had accumulated a total flying hours of 6,515 hours, of which 4,200 of them were on the type. The co- pilot was identified as 35 year old Walter Stricker. Stricker began his pilot career in June 1995. In March 1998, he was hired as a first officer by Propair. He earned his first officer endorsement on May 9 and started his training and line check phase on May 13. He had accumulated a total flying hours of 2,730 hours, of which 93 of them were on the type. Investigation Minutes before the crash, the crew of Flight 420 reported that there was a fire on board the aircraft. Inspection on Flight 420's wreckage confirmed that fire indeed had occurred in mid-flight. Constable Gilles Deziel, who had toured the crash site, stated that \\"three quarters of the plane was all burned and all black\\". Investigators then investigated the ignition source of the fire and conducted several tests. =Experiments on the equipment= Investigators found out that when pressures were added to the brakes, then there would be an increase in drag force and temperature on the assembly. Examination on the brake assembly of Flight 420 revealed that at the time, the brake assembly's temperature were exposed to a temperature of more than 600 degree Celsius, which may indicated that there was a significant amount of drag force at the time of the crash. Another test was conducted by investigators. This time, they conducted the test to know if hydraulic fluids of Flight 420 would ignite when it contacted the hot surface of the brake assembly. Investigators used two kinds of hydraulic fluids; the contaminated and uncontaminated one. The result was that an intense fire broke out after it contacted with the hot surface. The test also revealed that the contaminated hydraulic fluids have lower ignition point than the uncontaminated one. =Sequence of events= Investigators noticed that during Flight 420's take off roll, the aircraft was pulled to the left and the crew had to apply right rudder input in order to correct the path of the aircraft. The aircraft also had to take off in much longer time than usual. These indications were consistent with presence of drag force on the left brakes. Examination on the left brakes confirmed this. It revealed that the brakes had been dragged. The crew did not notice that the left brakes had been dragged during its take off roll and had overheated. The overheated brakes were retracted by the crew and entered the wheel wells. The wheel wells subsequently closed to secure the wheels. The wheel wells did not have sufficient cooling, and so the temperature of the brakes continued to rise, reaching as high as 600 degree Celsius. The overheated brakes and wheels then spread the heat to the tires and the surrounding structures. Tests conducted by investigators revealed that when tire fragments came into contacted with overheated brakes they ignited. The tire was exposed to a temperature of 600 Celsius, igniting a fire. The situation was worsened when a Nitrile piston leaked its flammable fluid. The Nitrile Piston would start to degrade when it contacted a surface temperature of 135 degree Celsius. The flammable liquid contacted the fire, causing an intense flame. A brake overheat warning system should have warned the crew. However, a brake overheat warning system was not required on the type of the aircraft, so the crew of Flight 420 did not know that a fire had developed. Since hydraulic lines were located near the wheel wells, the fire ruptured the aircraft's hydraulic line, which caused the fire to intensify. An orange warning light then went on to warn the crew that an overheating had occurred on the left wing (as the fire had spread through the left wing). Before the crew initiated the checklist to handle the emergency, the warning light suddenly went off. They thought that the warning had ended. However, this was wrong. The ceasing of the warning was caused by the fire in the wheel wells; the fire had destroyed the warning system's electrical circuit. The crew never realized the severity of the fire. The fire was already too severe and started to degrade the structural integrity of the lift wing. This caused the crew to hardly be able to control the aircraft. The crew had to apply maximum aileron trim setting due to the reduction of the stiffness of the wing. The left wing then failed upwards, causing the aircraft to roll through 90 degree and crash, subsequently bursting into flames and killing everyone on board.

The first was in the 8th district, when Democrat Alfred Leopold Luongo was appointed to the federal bench in September 1961. A second vacancy that same year occurred in the 10th district when Democrat John M. McDevitt resigned in June 1962 to become a Catholic priest. An at-large seat also became vacant when Victor E. Moore resigned in September 1962 to become the head of the Philadelphia Gas Works. Special elections were scheduled for November 6, 1962, to be held at the same time as the federal and gubernatorial elections that year. Democrats held two of the seats but lost the 8th district to a Republican. Background Alfred Leopold Luongo was a lawyer who had represented the 8th district in the northwest section of the city since 1959. The district was among the city's most marginal, electing a Democrat in 1951 and a Republican in 1955, both times by narrow margins. On September 14, 1961, President John F. Kennedy nominated Luongo to a new seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and he was confirmed by the Senate later that month. In June 1962, John M. McDevitt resigned his seat to enter a Roman Catholic seminary. McDevitt had represented the 10th district, which covered much of Northeast Philadelphia, since 1955. He had won convincingly in his most recent election, carrying 58% of the vote over his Republican opponent. In September of that year, at-large councilman Victor E. Moore resigned his seat to become head of the Philadelphia Gas Works. The at-large seat he held was safely Democratic, as that party's candidates had won the maximum possible at-large seats in each election since the seats were created in 1951. Moore had been first or second in votes in each of those three elections, including his most recent victory in 1959. Philadelphia officials had anticipated another special election that years, as well, when Mayor Richardson Dilworth resigned to run for Governor of Pennsylvania. According to the city charter, the President of City Council, James H. J. Tate would serve as acting mayor until a new one was elected at the next general election; however, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the charter violated state law in calling for a municipal election in an even-numbered year. That decision required Tate to serve for another year as acting mayor, which led to another lawsuit demanding that he vacate his 7th district council seat and call a special election. That case also went to the state Supreme Court, which held that no such vacancy existed under the charter's rules and that Tate could continue to take a leave of absence without legally vacating his seat. Candidate selection Instead of a primary, the nominees were selected by the ward leaders of the wards that made up the councilmanic districts. In the 8th, Republican ward leaders selected Stanley B. Smullen, a real estate agent who also served as the Republican leader of the 59th ward. Democratic leaders nominated John A. Geisz, the head of the inheritance tax bureau of the state board of revenue. In the 10th district, Republicans nominated Joseph Leo McGlynn, Jr., an attorney. Democrats settled on Robert B. Winkelman, an insurance broker. For the at-large seat, ward leaders from across the city took part in the selection process. The Republicans selected James T. McDermott, a local lawyer who had previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney. Democrats decided on Walter S. Pytko, the executive director of the Philadelphia Parking Authority and a former state senator and ward leader. Pytko's nomination came as a surprise to many observers of the political scene, and his nomination was believed to be the choice of William J. Green, Jr., the Democratic organization's chairman. Result At the at-large race, Pytko easily defeated McDermott for the seat, winning by more than 140,000 votes in the citywide election, a reduced but still sizable majority compared with the 1959 at-large vote. In the 10th district, Winkleman retained the seat for his party, dispatching McDermott by more than 10,000 votes, but with a smaller percentage than McDevitt's 1959 total. The one surprise result was in the 8th district as Smullen picked up the seat for the Republicans in what the Philadelphia Daily News called \\"a major upset.\\" The results meant that the Democratic majority on the council was reduced to 13 to 3. All three races showed a roughly five percentage point increase in the Republican vote, in line with the increases in row office elections the previous year. Aftermath Pytko remained on city council until 1967, when he retired. His opponent, McDermott, ran for mayor in 1963, but was unsuccessful. He was appointed to a judgeship on the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas in 1967 and was elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1981. He and Pytko in died the same week in June 1992. Winkelman and Smullen both saw their election results reversed the following year when a Republican won the 10th district and a Democrat won the 8th. Smullen remained active at the ward level and in his business but, after an unsuccessful attempt at a state house seat in 1964, never ran for office again. Winkelman ran again in 1967 and for an at-large seat in 1971, but was unsuccessful. Both of their opponents later became judges: McGlynn on the federal bench and Geisz on the Court of Common Pleas.

He was Prior of the Irish house of the Knights Hospitallers at Kilmainham, and a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. Despite his political eminence and his clerical office, he was a man of ruthless character and violent temper, who once tried to murder a senior judge, and was later responsible for the death of his intended replacement as Prior. After a long and turbulent career he was removed from the office of Prior for his treason in supporting the Lambert Simnel Rebellion of 1487, and died in poverty a few years later.Brenan Vol. 2 p. 66 Biography He was born in Bree, County Wexford. Little is known of his family or his early life. He joined the Order of Knights Hospitallers, rose rapidly through its ranks and in 1461 became Prior of the Order's Irish house at Kilmainham.Brenan p.66 =Attempted murder of Robert Dowdall = Soon after his appointment as Prior, he committed a crime which might well have ended his career and his life. At Pentecost 1462 Sir Robert Dowdall, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, came on a pilgrimage to Kilmainham Priory. Keating attacked him with a sword and seemingly had every intention of killing him.Ball p.177 The motive for the attack is unknown, although crimes of violence, even among the ruling class, were not uncommon in that era: twenty years earlier another senior Irish judge, James Cornwalsh, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, had been murdered: his killers had been pardoned for the crime.Ball p. 44-5 Keating was not, it should be said, the first Prior of Kilmainham to have a reputation for lawlessness: Thomas FitzGerald, who was removed from office as Prior in 1447, was another turbulent and litigious individual, who clashed with James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormonde and more seriously with Sir William Welles, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whom he was accused of kidnapping. Keating was arrested and arraigned for trial before Parliament on a number of charges including attempted murder, but the charges were dropped on condition that he pay Dowdall 100 marks in damages (although it seems that he never did so). He owed his immunity from punishment to the influence of the powerful Anglo-Irish magnate Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare, who acted as Keating's patron. =Prior of Kilmainham= For the next few years he seems to have run the Order smoothly enough. He was later accused of bankrupting the Irish house: in his defence he pointed out that in 1467 his superiors in Rhodes had increased the annual payment due to them from Kilmainham from ¬£40 to ¬£70 without consulting him. He argued that the increase took no account of the Irish house's ability to pay, and insisted that he had been simply unable to find the extra money.Brenan p.64 Politics As Prior of Kilmainham he was entitled to sit in the Parliament of Ireland and on the Irish Privy Council, and was thus able to play a key role in Irish politics. During the Wars of the Roses, the dynastic struggle between the rival branches of the Plantagenet dynasty, Keating in common with almost all the Anglo-Irish nobility favoured the House of York over the rival House of Lancaster. The victory of York over Lancaster in the year Keating became Prior for a time increased his political standing. However he was in temporary disgrace when in 1467 King Edward IV sent the notoriously ruthless John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester (nicknamed \\"The Butcher of England\\") to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.Ross p.204 Worcester held a Parliament at Drogheda where he proceeded to deal mercilessly with those whom he regarded as his political enemies, including the Earl of Kildare, who fled abroad, and Keating, who was imprisoned.Ross p.204 =Lord Grey as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland= His fortunes improved greatly after the House of Lancaster, which had briefly regained the throne in 1470-1, was finally crushed at the Battle of Tewkesbury. Among the defeated Lancastrians who were executed for treason after Tewkesbury was Sir John Langstrother, Prior of the English Hospitallers. Weir p.409Keating by contrast was commended by the victorious Yorkists for his loyalty to their cause. In 1478 however he clashed again with the English Crown when King Edward, to strengthen his authority, sent Lord Grey of Codnor to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant. The Anglo- Irish nobles, led by Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare and his father-in- law Baron Portlester, simply refused to recognize his authority: Otway-Ruthven p.398 Keating, who had assumed the role of Constable of Dublin Castle, apparently without legal authority,Wright p.190 played a key role in these events by refusing Lord Grey entry to the Castle. Otway-Ruthven p.398After a few months of political deadlock, the King yielded and Grey returned to England, leaving Keating and his allies triumphant.Otway-Ruthven p.398 =Prior Marmaduke Lumley= Siege of Rhodes 1480 The next threat to his position as Prior came from his own superiors in Rhodes, who were outraged by his refusal to give any assistance to the beleaguered Order against the Ottoman Empire during the Siege of Rhodes in 1480. In 1482 he was removed from office and replaced by an English member of the Order, Marmaduke Lumley, who obtained Papal approval for his election. Brenan p.65 Keating however was not a man to submit meekly to such a decision, and when Lumley landed at Clontarf, Dublin, Keating led a large force which captured and imprisoned him, and later put him in chains. Both the Papal Legate, Octavio de Palatio, and the Archbishop of Dublin, John Walton, expressed their outrage at Keating's conduct and demanded Lumley's release. In 1484 they sent a troop of soldiers to free him, but Keating, who was a trained soldier (like all his Order), easily defeated the opposing force. Lumley died in prison soon after.Brenan p.65 Keating was excommunicated for his actions, but true to his stubborn character, simply ignored the excommunication.Wright p.190 Lambert Simnel  Lambert Simnel in Ireland The downfall of the House of York at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, and the establishment of the Tudor dynasty under King Henry VII came as unwelcome news to the pro-Yorkist Anglo-Irish nobility. Led by the Earl of Kildare and his father-in-law Lord Portlester, they refused to accept the legitimacy of the new dynasty, and their resistance to Henry led to Keating's ultimate ruin.Chrimes pp.72-76 In 1487 Kildare, Portlester, Keating and their allies made the mistake of supporting the claims of the pretender Lambert Simnel, who claimed to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, the rightful heir of the House of York.Chrimes pp.72-76 Simnel was an imposter, but is known to have born a striking resemblance to the real Warwick, who was a prisoner in the Tower of London, where he remained until his execution in 1499. Simnel was proclaimed King Edward VI and crowned in Dublin. He invaded England with a large army, only to be crushed at the Battle of Stoke Field.Brenan p.66 Keating's ruin  Henry VII was remarkably merciful in victory: Simnel became a royal servant, and almost all of the Anglo-Irish nobility received a royal pardon. The one notable exception was Keating, whose record of violence, and defiance both of the Crown and his own superiors, made it impossible for the King to trust him.Brenan p.66 Sir Richard Edgcumbe, the Crown official sent to Ireland accept the submission of the Anglo- Irish nobility, chose to regard him as the \\"prime instigator\\" of the rebellion, although most historians attach more importance to the role of the Earl of Kildare and his father-in-law Lord Portlester. Despite repeated pleas to Edgcumbe on Keating's behalf he was refused a pardon and deprived of office once more. Showing all his old stubbornness, he refused to leave Kilmainham, but was finally ejected in 1491. He died in poverty soon afterwards.Brenan p.66 Sources *Ball, F.

It is located in Campania, between the Province of Benevento and the Province of Avellino. Comunes In the Valle Caudina there are 14 italian comunes (10 belonging to Benevento and 4 to Avellino). The comunes with \\"*\\" are located in the outskirts of the Valle Caudina (without them the population of the valley is of 52,000 circa). Geography The Valley seen from Taburnus. In the center there is the castle of Montesarchio and on the backgroung there are the Partenio's mountains. Valle Caudina is in the center of Campania being surrounded from the south by Partenio and from the north by Taburnus massif. It is about 20 km from Benevento, 23 km from Avellino, 22 km from Caserta, 38 km from Napoli e 57 km from Salerno. The main west entrance is the Stretta di Arpaia, where the Battle of the Caudine Forks may have happened, between the mountains Tairano and Castello; another is the Moiano's gorge. Instead, the east entrance is the passo of Sferracavallo in the comune of Montesarchio. The Valle Caudina is mostly flat and it is crossed by the Isclero river. History Originally, in the valley there was a lake fed by the waters coming from the Taburnus and the Partenio. Ceramic remnants at San Martino Valle Caudina suggest early settlements dating back to the Bronze Age (1800-1000 BC). Around the 8th century BC, the city of Caudium was born. It was the capital of the Caudini tribe, remembered above all for the humiliating defeat of the Caudine Forks that the Samnites inflicted on the Romans in 321 BC during the Samnite Wars.

It is approximately , with an area of , and is deep in the centre. It is believed to be named after the London borough. The lake is less than from the coast, having separated from the ocean at Cockburn Sound within the last 4,000 years. The shallow waters within about of the edges of the lake are home to thrombolites, estimated to be about six million years old. The internal structure of the thrombolites is believed to be unique in the world. Before 1960, the lake's salinity was 20003500 mg/L. In the 1960s it was used as part of an urban drainage scheme; the Water Board constructed inlet and outlet drains. Subsequently the salinity level dropped to 300400 mg/L. A boardwalk extends approximately into the lake. Water birds that inhabit the area include the Australian pelican, black swan, Australian shelduck, musk duck, white-faced heron and common greenshank. The lake is home to the Swan River goby (Pseudogobius olorum), eastern mosquitofish, sea mullet, goldfish and yabbies. The lake was used as a source of fresh water by the local indigenous Noongar people, as well as the settlers of the Swan River Colony. The 10th Light Horse Regiment had a camp near the lake during the war years. In 2017, the lake was given a permanent entry on the State Register of Heritage Places.

History and etymology  Bozbash is a word of Azeri Turkish origin. It may be derived from Azeri Turkish boz (\\"light gray\\") and bash (\\"head\\"), which in turn may point to the light color of the dish when its cooked. However, Mohammad R. Ghanoonparvar notes that \\"no scientific etymology\\" has been offered to this effect by Gerhard Doerfer. Bozbash is the equivalent of the Iranian dish abgoosht-e sabzi. Ghanoonparvar notes that bozbash was introduced \\"relatively late\\" into Iranian cuisine; Mirza Ali-Akbar Khan, the chef of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (1848‚Äì1896), was reportedly the first to mention it. He classified it as part of a group of meat stews and soups, often eaten cold.  Ingredients and preparation  Ghanoonparvar notes in relation to bozbash: In Armenian cuisine, there is a special kind of bozbash not commonly seen, Shoushin bozbash, made from lamb, quince, apple, and mint.

It is considered as a Category I MRAP vehicle. The Alpha was marketed to eventually phase out the use of the Humvee. History The Oshkosh Alpha was first revealed to the public in September 12, 2006 at the Modern Day Marine show in Quantico, Virginia with the US Marine Corp Systems Command awarding a contract for 100 Alphas for US$30.6 million. Oshkosh announced on February 26, 2007, that it would supply the MRAPs within 120 days.Guardia, Page 11. During its production, the vehicle was given the codename of Bulldog. MCSC announced on June 29, 2007, that the contract was cancelled due to design concerns, such as ergonomic and automotive deficiencies as well as questionable vehicle survivability. It is mentioned that the time needed to give the Alpha a redesign would delay future production orders. As of 2017, Oshkosh has halted sales of the Alpha since PVI went bankrupt in 2007. Most Alphas made prior to the contract being discontinued have been transferred to units of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Design ICE Homeland Security and Investigations. Oshkosh and PVI worked together to create the vehicle with Oshkosh handling production capabilities and engineering experience while PVI created its armored chassis. The MRAP has a capacity for a total of eight people with a V-shaped hull with a monoque layout used to deflect mine and other explosive blasts. It is also capable of being transported to the field by air transport. The MRAP is equipped with ShieldAll armor made in cooperation with Batelle. ShieldAll is based on available components, including FlexAll hyperplastic material. ShieldAll is made with the weight being one-third lighter and less bulky than steel. Depending on operational needs, the Alpha can have add-on armor added. The Alpha's ShieldAll armored body incorporates research conducted after the death of Dale Earnhardt, when NASCAR was looking to develop shock-absorbing technology for its racetrack barrier walls. The Alpha has all-round protection against 7.62mm bullets. It can also withstand .50 BMG bullets. During Explosively Formed Projectile tests, it was able to survive against multiple EFP explosives. It can be equipped with either 7.62-mm/12.7-mm machine guns or a 40-mm automatic grenade launcher on the roof.

In 1971 one of her ensembles, designed for her by Graziella Fontana, was chosen as the Dress of the Year. She then went on to become a successful American fashion designer. Career Hornby was originally a model, before entering fashion design and retail. She commissioned samples and garments from freelance designers such as Graziella Fontana. NB: Lester incorrectly refers to Serena Sinclair as Serena Sutcliffe The Fashion Museum, Bath asked Serena Sinclair, voted Fashion Writer Of The Year in 1970, to choose the defining look for 1971 to add to their Dress of the Year collection. Sinclair selected one of Fontana's Liberty-print cotton hotpants ensembles for Hornby as her womenswear look, alongside a Blades man's suit. As a designer, Hornby enjoyed mixing printed textiles, and in 1972, the unisex quality of some of her work was noted by The Baltimore Sun. By 1975, due to export regulations, she had left the United Kingdom to live and work in the United States. She opened a small boutique with only one in-house seamstress on East 60th Street, Manhattan, called Hornby of Plenty, in September 1975, which was well-received by buyers who had formerly had to travel to London to see her wholesale collections. Hornby of Plenty swiftly gained a good reputation due to its dedicated customer service and willingness to alter and even make new garments to fit clients at no extra cost, meaning that by December 1975, Hornby had to employ eight additional seamstresses to meet demand. In 1979, Hornby was selling her work to over 40 shops across the United States, and was described as a master of unexpected colour and pattern mixes which looked anything but haphazard. By the 1980s, she was considered a leading designer alongside Zandra Rhodes and Stephen Burrows. Women's Wear Daily reported in 1994 that Hornby had stepped in to take over the Chicago- based Becky Bisoulis brand after Bisoulis fell ill. Later life By 2005, Hornby had moved to Connecticut and opened an antiques shop there, also offering antique-buying trips to France for American collectors. Her husband, Jerry Larrabue, is a vintage watch dealer.

Williams was a founding member of AfriCOBRA. His work has been featured in exhibitions at some of the most important museums in the world, including the Tate Modern,Press release from the Tate listing Gerald Williams as a participating artist in the Soul of a Nation exhibition the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the Studio Museum in Harlem,Exhibition checklist listing Gerald Williams' participation in exhibitions at the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia. In addition to his influence as a contemporary artist, he has served in the Peace Corps, taught in the public schools systems of Chicago and Washington, D.C., and served as an Arts and Crafts Center Director for the United States Air Force. In 2015, he moved back to his childhood neighborhood of Woodlawn, Chicago, where he currently lives and works.  Education  Williams graduated from Englewood High School in 1959, which was then located at 6201 S. Stewart. The school was torn down in 1979, reopened in another location, and then that location was closed in 2008. After high school, he enrolled as an accounting major at the downtown Chicago campus of Roosevelt University, located at 430 South Michigan Avenue. After leaving Roosevelt, he studied from January 1961 to December 1962 at Woodrow Wilson Junior College on South Halsted Street, known today as Kennedy-King College, where he received his associate degree in art. After serving for two years in the Air Force, he returned to Chicago in 1966 and enrolled in night classes at Loop College, now known as Harold Washington College, while also taking drawing and design classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1967, he enrolled full-time in art classes at Chicago Teachers College, now known as Chicago State University. He earned his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Chicago Teachers College in 1969. In 1973, Williams moved to Washington, D.C., and enrolled in the graduate program at Howard University. He earned his Masters of Fine Arts degree in painting from Howard in 1976.  Background  Gerald Williams was born in 1941 on the south side of Chicago, Illinois. He grew up on South Evans Street, a block from Oak Woods Cemetery, in the Woodlawn neighborhood, with 10 siblings in a house his mother and father owned. His father worked in the steel mills at South Works that were then prevalent around the area where the Calumet River meets Lake Michigan. In February 1963, Williams enlisted in the United States Air Force as an illustrator. He did his basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and was then assigned to the graphics shop at McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma, Washington. While at McChord, Williams transferred into the education department and soon accepted a transfer to Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, Japan, where he served the remainder of his military service. Williams returned to Chicago in August 1966 to finish school. While working full-time as a facilities manager for the art department at Northeastern Illinois University, which was Chicago Teachers College North back then, he met an artist named Jeff Donaldson, who was on the faculty there. Donaldson invited Williams to join him and several other black artists who had started getting together casually once a week to discuss aesthetics. At the time, Williams was also renting studio space in a coach house in Hyde Park. After attending the first meeting with Donaldson and the others, Williams realized that, unbeknownst to him, another member of the group, Wadsworth Jarrell, was the artist who was renting the other side of the coach house. Over the course of the next few years, Williams, Donaldson, Jarrell, along with Jae Jarrell and Barbara J. Jones, became the nucleus of AfriCOBRA, one of the most influential, transnational black art movements of the 20th Century. By 1970, the group also included Napoleon Henderson, Nelson Stevens, Sherman Beck, Omar Lama, and Carolyn M. Lawrence. In 1969, Williams finished his undergraduate degree and began teaching in the Chicago Public Schools. His first teaching assignment was at Bradwell School of Excellence in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood. Later, he worked at nearby Bryn Mawr Elementary until the end of 1973 when he left to attend Howard University. While teaching, Williams continued his efforts with AfriCOBRA. Epiphanies gained from the group's weekly discussions manifested in bodies of work, which the group began sharing in unified exhibitions, starting with the show AfriCOBRA I: Ten in Search of a Nation, which ran from June 21 to August 30 at the Studio Museum in Harlem. In 1973, Williams left Chicago for what would end up being a 42-year span. He first moved to Washington, D.C., where he earned his MFA in painting at Howard University. After finishing his MFA, he participated along with other members of AfriCOBRA as a United States delegate to FESTAC 77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, which was held in Lagos, Nigeria. Only months after he returned from Nigeria, Williams joined the Peace Corps, returning to Africa where he accepted an assignment as Pre-vocational Director in the Jacaranda School for the Mentally Handicapped in Nairobi, Kenya, where he mentored students to produce handicrafts that were marketed in a store on the campus and in shops in town. Williams concluded his two-year assignment in the Peace Corps in 1979, ending it with a solo exhibition of his paintings titled \\"Can You Feel the Brand New Day,\\" which was held at the French Cultural Center in Nairobi. In 1980, he returned to Washington, D.C., where he worked for four years as a teacher in the public school system. In 1984, he accepted a job directing the arts and crafts center on an American Air Force base in South Korea. After five years in South Korea, he was transferred to Japan to direct the arts and crafts center at Yokota Air Base, about 25 minutes outside of Tokyo. He stayed there for three years, accepting a transfer to Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina in 1992. In 1996, he transferred again, this time to Aviano Air Base, a NATO air base in Aviano, Italy, run by the Italian government, but which hosts the USAF 31st Fighter Wing. In 1999, Williams was transferred back to Shaw AFB in South Carolina. In 2001, he accepted his final transfer, to direct the arts and crafts center at Lajes Field, in the Azores, a group of islands off the coast of Portugal. In 2005, Williams retired in Sumter, South Carolina, where he continued to focus full-time on his art. In 2015, he moved back to Chicago, where he currently lives and works. In 2016, his participation in a historical panel discussion hosted by the University of Chicago was filmed, and is available on YouTube.  Exhibitions and Collections  Williams' work has been exhibited extensively nationally and internationally in solo and group exhibitions. His solo exhibitions include shows at Chicago State University, the University of South Carolina, NOA Gallery in Washington, D.C., the American Cultural Center in Dakar, Senegal, and the French Cultural Center in Nairobi, Kenya. His work has also been featured in group exhibitions at several of the world's most esteemed museums, including in the exhibitions Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power at the Tate Modern in London, England; The Freedom Principle, which traveled to the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia as well as the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and AFRICOBRA in Chicago, a multi-venue exhibition hosted by the South Side Community Art Center, the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts at the University of Chicago, and the DuSable Museum of African American History. His work is also included in numerous private and institutional collections, including that of the Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum, the DuSable Museum of African American History, and the Johnson Publishing Company, publishers of Ebony and Jet.
