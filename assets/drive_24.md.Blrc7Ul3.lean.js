(formerly Just Energy Income Fund and before that Energy Savings Income Fund) is a Canadian-based natural gas and electricity retailer operating in Canadian and American markets across North America, and in Germany, Ireland and Japan. Operations Just Energy is a publicly traded company (TSX:JE, NYSE:JE) and serves 4.5 million customers collectively under its affiliate companies Just Energy, Hudson Energy, Commerce Energy, Tara Energy, Amigo Energy, Momentis and Hudson Energy Solar. The company was listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on January 30, 2012 (NYSE:JE) and celebrated its 20-year anniversary in the energy industry in May 2017. Just Energy entered the United Kingdom commercial energy market in July 2012 under its Hudson Energy UK brand. In October 2013, the company expanded into the UK residential market under the Green Star Energy brand, but in October 2019 it agreed to sell Green Star's customers (around 200,000 in number) to Shell Energy. In 2016, Just Energy further expanded with operations in Germany, followed by Ireland in 2017. Just Energy's business involves the sale of natural gas and/or electricity supply to residential and commercial customers under long term fixed price, price-protected or variable-priced contracts and green energy products. The company derives its margin or gross profit from the difference between the price at which it is able to sell the commodities to its customers and the related price at which it purchases the associated volumes from its suppliers. Markets Just Energy supplies natural gas and/or electricity in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan in Canada; California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas in the United States; and in Germany, Ireland and Japan. The Just Energy Group's portfolio includes Amigo Energy and Tara Energy, which both serve the Texas market; and TerraPass, a California-based carbon offsetting business. Name change In 2009, the company undertook a rebranding campaign from Energy Savings Income Fund and U.S. Energy Savings, Ontario Energy Savings, Alberta Energy Savings to Just Energy Income Fund across all of its Canadian and U.S. markets. The company incorporated in 2011 and was renamed Just Energy Group. Acquisitions In April 2010, the company expanded its marketing distribution channel and launched a new network marketing arm under the brand, Momentis. The company completed the acquisition of Toronto-based direct energy marketer Universal Energy Corporation on July 1, 2009. From that acquisition, Just Energy gained National Home Services. In May 2010, Just Energy acquired Hudson Energy Group, an energy marketer in the U.S. commercial sector. In August 2011, Just Energy announced a deal to acquire Fulcrum Retail Holdings LLC, a privately held electricity provider operating in Texas. Controversies Former Enron executives James Lewis and Deborah Merril were Just Energy's senior executive, president, and Co-CEOs since 2007. San Francisco's KPIX-TV news reported on June 2013 that there had been tens of thousands of complaints across the U.S. from consumers saying they were misled into signing up with Just Energy, and instead of saving money on their monthly bills as advertised, the cost went up. The complaints led to a consumer fraud lawsuit filed by the state of Illinois, and investigations in New York, Ohio, and Canada. Just Energy settled each of these cases, paying large fines and promising to change its sales practices. In June 2003, the Toronto Star reported that both Direct Energy and the Ontario Energy Savings Corp., a subsidiary of the Energy Savings Income Fund, had been charged with fraud as a result of its agents having forged energy contracts, and had been fined. In 2010, three former Just Energy salespeople were charged in Alberta, Canada with having forged customer signatures on fraudulent energy contracts. The three defendants pleaded guilty and were fined a total of $6,800. In July 2008, the Attorney General of New York state brought action against U.S. Energy Savings (now Just Energy) for deceptive sales practices. The company was obliged to pay $200,000 in penalties and costs to the state. \\"U.S. Energy Savings (now Just Energy) is purposely deceiving consumers\\", Attorney General Madigan said. \\"Many of these families signed up for this program based on the false claim that they would save on their monthly utility bills. Instead, U.S. Energy locked them into a contract that actually charged them more for natural gas.\\" In response to criticism, Just Energy's CEO Ken Hartwick said in an interview with Report on Business magazine in 2013 that Just Energy dropped the savings claim years ago. Hartwick claims the company has taken steps to ensure that consumers know that they are purchasing what equates to an insurance product. He further claims all sales are followed up with a verification phone call by a third party to mitigate against any aggressive sales tactics. However, Just Energy salespeople are still making claims of savings, despite the vast majority of customers paying more. Since Hartwick's claim, Just Energy has been cited by the Ontario Energy Board in November 2013 and November 2014, and by the Attorney General of Massachusetts in January 2015, for continued infractions, including widespread deceptive sales practices. Hartwick left the company in 2014. James Lewis and Deborah Merril, who helped to found the company in 2002, are now joint CEOs. Rebecca MacDonald, Just Energy's executive chair, has been accused of falsifying her credentials and her biography. Additionally, forensic accounting firms have determined that Just Energy uses questionable accounting practices and has misled investors as to their financial condition. In September 2014, the police department of Sudbury, Ontario, issued a warning to the city's residents regarding the aggressive and illegal door-to-door sales activities of Just Energy sales representatives, and advised contacting the police if salespeople refuse to leave when requested. In November 2014, the Canadian Federal Competition Bureau says a subsidiary (National Energy Corp, which operates as National Home Services) of Just Energy Group Inc. has agreed to pay $7 million in penalties, restitution and other costs related to complaints over its door-to-door water heater marketing practices in Ontario and Quebec. Finding by the bureau that sales staff were misleading customers about their identity and the purpose of their visits. In January 2015, the Attorney General's Office of Massachusetts announced that Just Energy had agreed to pay $4 million to settle allegations of deceptive marketing and overcharging consumers. According to the settlement, Just Energy charged rates that were higher than the rates for the electricity supply provided by NSTAR and National Grid, and induced elderly and non-native English speakers by continuing to offer electricity supply services even after it became clear that they did not understand the terms of the contract. Consumers were also switched to Just Energy without authorization, and termination fees worth tens of thousands of dollars were charged to small business owners who weren't advised of the charges. May 2015, a class action against the Just Energy group of companies claimed it unlawfully withheld the minimum protection of the Employment Standards Act from its door-to-door sales agents.

He has been sued by the federal government for his alleged role in the Virginia Fontaine Memorial Treatment Centre controversy. Political career Courchene was Chief of the Fort Alexander Indian Band during the 1980s. The community's name was later changed to the Sagkeeng First Nation. In 1984, Courchene and the Sagkeeng Band Council refused an order from the Canada Labour Relations Board to reinstate four teachers who were fired for engaging in union activities. Justice Paul Rouleau of the Federal Court of Canada found Courchene and the other councillors in contempt of court for their decision, remarking that he had seldom seen such brazen contempt for authority. The band council was fined $15,000, and Courchene was fined $5,000.\\"Fired teachers, Manitoba Indians get $25,000 fine\\", Globe and Mail, 22 November 1984, P4. Newspaper accounts do not indicate if the sentence was appealed. Courchene served as acting chairman of the First Nations Confederacy in 1987. He welcomed a report from the Coopers & Lybrand Consulting Group, which found that federal Indian Affairs officials deliberately ignored regulations for expenditure controls in Manitoba.Geoffrey York, \\"Indian Affairs rules broken by officials, auditors report\\", Globe and Mail, 22 September 1987, A3. The Department of Indian Affairs took over Fort Alexander's programs and finances later in the same year, arguing that the band was at least $1.2 million in debt. Courchene had previously rejected a plan to devolve oversight powers to a committee with federal and band representatives.\\"Ottawa oversees band's finances\\", Globe and Mail, 23 November 1987, A10. In 1989, Courchene argued that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spent too much time patrolling his territory. A local RCMP official denied that his department was profiling Fort Alexander residents, and said that officers generally entered the reserve in response to calls for assistance.\\"RCMP too attentive, chief tells Manitoba inquiry\\", Globe and Mail, 2 February 1989, A9. Courchene was succeeded as chief by Jerry Fontaine later in the same year. Virginia Fontaine Memorial Treatment Centre Controversy After standing down as chief, Courchene became Chief Operating Officer of the Virginia Fontaine Memorial Treatment Centre in Sagkeeng. The centre was the subject of a federal audit in 1995, which uncovered nearly $1.2 million in \\"unsupported per diem billings\\", $1.3 million in \\"questionable expenditures\\" and $200,000 in \\"travel expenses not supported with original receipts\\". Courchene said that the audit was \\"born in a series of lies\\" by Indian Affairs officials trying to assert control over the band's finances.David Kuxhaus, \\"Where did themoney go?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 October 2004, B1. In October 2000, the Canadian media reported allegations that centre directors, staff members and their spouses had taken a week-long Caribbean cruise with money from their professional development budget. The federal government donated $7.2 million per year to the centre at the time, and there were concerns that federal funds had been used for the vacation. Courchene said that employees raised the money privately, and that it was not of the general operating budget. He later said that the money was raised through charity bingos. Notwithstanding his comments, the federal government ordered a forsenic audit into the centre's budget in the same month as the controversy broke.Jennifer Ditchburn, \\"Federal health minister orders audit of Manitoba treatment centre\\", Canadian Press, 18 October 2000, 16:56 report; Paul Waldie, \\"Bingo, not public money, paid for cruise: official\\", National Post, 19 October 2000, A3. Other allegations of improper spending were reported in the following weeks, and some executives at Manitoba's other aboriginal treatment centres expressed surprise at the amount of federal money received by Virginia Fontaine.Bill Redekop, \\"Sagkeeng a magnet for federal cash\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 January 2001, A9. Courchene argued that the treatment centre was not required to cede its financial records to federal auditors, saying that the institution was an independent contractor in partnership with the government.Bill Redekop, \\"Sagkeeng centre keeps financial records secret\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 November 2000, A4. He later agreed to provide the government with documents covering the period after July 1, 2000. The federal government accepted this condition in mid-November.Bill Redekop, \\"Audit will miss how millions were spent at Sagkeeng centre, critics say\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 November 2000, A1. One month later, Health Canada announced that it was withdrawing financial support from the centre. A representative said that the federal agency had \\"lost confidence in the foundation's ability to manage the funds they've been receiving\\", adding that staff were not cooperating with the audit.\\"Feds cut funding to Mba native treatment centre after controversial spending\\", Canadian Press, 1 December 2000, 21:20 report. The federal government subsequently sued Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation Inc. and its directors for the recovery of public funds, and attempted to bring the centre into receivership.Bud Robertson, \\"Ottawa takes Sagkeeng centre to court\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 December 2000, A1. Health Canada and the RCMP later reviewed allegations that the Sagkeeng centre's network administrator was asked to delete financial records. See Bill Redekop, \\"Bid to wipe Sagkeeng centre records alleged\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 December 2000, A1. In February 2001, Courchene acknowledged that he had made several incorrect statements in a prior affidavit detailing the centre's financial activities. Among other things, he retracted his claim that the centre had never held board meetings before negotiating a $35 million deal with the federal government. He also said that he did not know the source of $491,000 deposited in the centre's account in September, and blamed a bad memory and shoddy bookkeeping for the discrepancies.Mike McIntyre, \\"Wrong statements, bad memory\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 February 2001, A1; \\"Audits, not junkets, for native reserves\\" [editorial], National Post, 10 February 2001, A15. Associate Justice Jeffrey Oliphant of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba issued a scathing indictment of financial practices at the centre on February 8, 2001, and gave the federal government permission to conduct an \\"unrestricted audit\\".Bill Redekop, \\"Sagkeeng loses battle\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 February 2006, A1. The centre closed later in the month.Bill Redekop, \\"Sagkeeng centre closes\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 February 2001, A1. It was later revealed that SJC Consulting, operated by Courchene's cousin Steve Courchene, received $1.9 million from the centre between April 1, 1992 and September 30, 1995. Steve Courchene was an executive member of the Virginia Fontaine Memorial Centre at the time of the payments.Bill Redekop, \\"Centre paid adviser $1.9M\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 February 2001, A1. The Fontaine Centre's executive members initially filed a joint statement of defence in response to the federal government's civil suit. This unity collapsed in 2005, when Courchene, Lana Daniels and Keith Fontaine submitted that centre director Perry Fontaine and two federal officials had conspired for the deliberate misuse of public monies. Courchene, Daniels and Keith Fontaine sued Perry Fontaine and the federal government, and were in turn sued by Perry Fontaine.Paul Samyn, \\"Health Canada officials linked to fraud probe\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 January 2005, B4. In November 2005, the federal government further alleged that Ken Courchene, Steve Courchene, Keith Fontaine and Perry Fontaine were part of a conspiracy to defraud the federal government of $332,000 relating to the lease on a gym they claimed to own.Paul Samyn, \\"New charges stemming from addiction centre\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 November 2005, A5. None of the charges against Courchene have been proven in court. Magistrate In July 2002, Ken Courchene was appointed by the province of Manitoba as magistrate for the Sagkeeng and Pine Falls area.\\"Lawsuit, audits dog new magistrate Courchene named to community job\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 September 2002, A8. Joy Smith, the opposition Justice Critic, unsuccessfully called for the appointment to be rescinded.\\"Tory critic attacks appointment of former treatment centre director\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 September 2002, A8. His duties included authorizing police searches, issuing summons and taking oaths, and he often worked from the RCMP detachment in Powerview.Graeme Smith, \\"Ex- bosses' fate frustrates whistle blowers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 July 2003, A4. Courchene's position was placed under judicial scrutiny in early 2004, after a forensic audit drew attention to \\"unusual\\" payments he received from the Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation over a 29-month period.Paul Samyn, \\"'Unusual' pay for ex-CEO of rehab clinic\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 February 2004, A3. Provincial justice officials argued that the payments raised \\"a perception of poor judgment and conduct unbecoming of a judicial officer\\".Paul Samyn, \\"Judge to decide on magistrate's future\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 February 2004, A1.

Because of the Volkswagen Golf's definition and long standing dominance of this class it is often referred to as the \\"Golf segment\\" in much of Europe. Mainstream compact sedans began falling in popularity since 1990s, when Peugeot stopped production of 306 in 4-door saloon form, and also sharply declining since 2010s, as well as the reduced sales of 4-door Ford Focus. = Compact MPVs = During the late 1990s, compact MPVs increased in popularity as a competitor to the compact car, with models such as the Renault Scenic and the Citroën C4 Picasso becoming popular in Europe. By the early 2010s, demand for compact MPVs was declining, due to the rise of the compact SUV.  History in the United Kingdom  = 1970s = Morris 1300 (1971-1974) At the start of the 1970s, the two most popular sectors of the UK market were small family cars and large family cars. Since its launch in 1962, the BMC 1100/1300 had often been Britain's best selling car, and other locally produced compact cars included the Ford Escort, Vauxhall Viva and Hillman Avenger. Imported small family cars that were popular in the UK included the Citroën GS and Datsun Sunny 120Y. British Leyland replaced the BMC 1100/1300 with a variety of models; the 1969 Austin Maxi, the 1971 Morris Marina, and the 1973 Austin Allegro. A second-generation Ford Escort (jointly designed in Britain and Germany) was released in 1974. The same year, the German Volkswagen Golf front-wheel drive hatchback was released, becoming one of the first significantly-imported small family cars in the UK market. The sporty \\"GTI\\" version of the Golf sparked a huge demand for \\"hot hatches\\" in the UK and many other countries. The third-generation Vauxhall Viva was produced until late 1979, when it was replaced by the Vauxhall Astra (a rebadged Opel Kadett D which was initially produced in West Germany and Belgium). The Astra was part of a late-1970s transition in small family cars from being predominantly rear-wheel drive saloons, to becoming front-wheel drive hatchbacks (by then increasingly popular in mainland Europe). The Austin Allegro - introduced five years earlier - was front-wheel drive but was built in only saloon and estate body styles. Only the related Austin Maxi was a hatchback. The Hillman Avenger (marketed as a Chrysler Avenger 1976-1979 and as a Talbot Avenger 1979-1981) continued to sell well, in spite of the 1978 launch of the Talbot Horizon front-wheel drive hatchback. = 1980s = Ford Escort Mk3 (1980-1986) The Ford Escort Mk3 went on sale in the autumn of 1980, replacing the rear-wheel-drive saloon format of the Mk2 with a hatchback and front-wheel drive. (A saloon version called the Ford Orion was added in 1983.) Only in 1983 was the Austin Allegro replaced by the Austin Maestro hatchback. In 1984, the Vauxhall Astra Mk2 hatchback/estate/cabriolet was released, alongside a saloon version called the Vauxhall Belmont. The first significant Japanese-designed compact car in the UK was the 1981 Triumph Acclaim, a licensed version of the four-door Honda Ballade with a Honda- designed engine. The Acclaim was replaced in 1984 by the Rover 200. In late 1985 the Peugeot 309 became the first Peugeot to be built in the UK at the Ryton plant. = 1990s = Rover 200 Mk2 (1989-1995) Ford began the 1990s by replacing its 10-year-old Escort (and the Orion saloon version) with the Ford Escort MkV. In 1998, the European version of the Escort was replaced by the global Ford Focus MkI model. General Motors released the Vauxhall Astra Mk3 update in 1991 and the all-new Astra Mk4 in 1998. Rover Group introduced the Rover 200 Mk2 in 1989. The Rover 200 Mk3 was introduced in 1995, replacing the Honda Concerto-based Mk2 with a UK-designed car.

It was abolished during the French Revolution. First Proposition It was first proposed by the minister of finance, Jean-Baptiste de Machault, comte d'Arnouville, in 1749. The War of the Austrian Succession had just ended, with the French government at the point of bankruptcy. A temporary income tax, the dixième, had been levied during the war, but Louis XV had promised that it would be removed with the end of the war. The comte d'Arnouville planned to introduce a new permanent tax modelled upon the dixième, to create a sinking fund to repay the national debt. The vingtième was to be 5% of income, collected directly by the government, from all people regardless of their rank. Legislation Legislation establishing the new tax was put before the parlements for registration in 1749 and was briefly though vociferously opposed. The most determined objections came from the pays d'ètats, regions which traditionally avoided direct collection of similar taxes, the estates paying instead abonnements, or annual lump sum payments which usually ended up being much less than the proper amount collected individually. After registration of the vingtième edicts by the parlements, the Languedoc estates voted to deny the government their usual annual payment, and were subsequently dissolved until 1752, the vingtième being collected directly by the royal intendant. In Brittany, the estates successfully prevented the collection of the new tax, leading to the imprisonment of several leading nobles. Obtaining money from the clergy was to prove more difficult. The comte d'Arnouville estimated the taxable income of the clergy at the time at 114 million livres, and the average annual contribution made by the clergy to the government over the past fifty years was 3.65 million livres, falling somewhat short of the 5.7 million the vingtième would raise. At the Assembly of the Clergy in 1750, he requested a payment of 7.5 million livres over five years, to contribute to his sinking fund. Protests ensued when Louis pressed the issue, and the assembly was dissolved. Opposition continued until the resignation of d'Arnouville from the ministry in 1754, whereupon his successor, Jean Moreau de Séchelles, relented and allowed the clergy to be exempt and the pays d'ètats of Brittany and Languedoc to contribute with a lump sum payment. Second Tax A second vingtième was levied at the beginning of the Seven Years' War in 1756, in the fashion of the old dixième, and as the war continued, a third tax was levied in 1760. At the conclusion of the war both the war taxes were expected to be removed, but the ministry were pressed for funds. Finance minister Henri Léonard Jean Baptiste Bertin not only extended the second vingtième, but attempted to instigate a land survey for the proper assessment of the tax. Aware that this would greatly increase their payments, the parlements resisted. Louis forced the legislation through the Paris parlement with a lit de justice, but continued opposition in the provinces led him to give way and dismiss Bertin, replacing him with Clément Charles François de Laverdy, a judge of the Paris Parlement. Although Laverdy allowed the extension of the second vingtième, he ensured it would be on the old property assessments, meaning it would not increase over time with the national income. Although some improvements in the assessments were managed under the radical reforming administration of Maupeou and Terray, the taxes remained inefficient. In 1778 the Paris Parlement had demanded, without success, that the government should accept without contest the declarations of individual taxpayer. In 1780 Jacques Necker registered another extension of the second vingtième without difficulty. Abolishment of Taxes The two vingtièmes were to be abolished and replaced with a new tax under Charles Alexandre de Calonne's reform plans of 1786. After his failure to convince the Assembly of Notables of his reforms, and his subsequent resignation, the new finance minister Étienne Charles Loménie de Brienne largely adopted his plans. After a first attempt in June 1787, Louis XVI and de Brienne forced the registration of the reforms at Paris on August 6, 1787. A public controversy ensued, with the parlement declaring the legislation illegal. Louis exiled the parlementaires to the provinces, but de Brienne eventually settled the matter with a compromise consisting of yet another extension of the second vingtième in September. The vingtièmes were finally abolished by the National Assembly in 1790, along with all the other vestiges of the taxation system of the ancien régime.

Initially established in the mid-20th century, the breed was developed by crossing native Danish mares with elite stallions from established European bloodlines. History  The Danish Warmblood registry was established in mid-20th century. The registry oversees the registration of Danish warmblood foals and approves stallions for breeding. As with most warmblood studbooks, only stallions who meet certain standards are permitted to breed. Foals with approved pedigrees may receive a brand depicting a crown over a wave. One of the more recent of the selectively bred European competition horses is the Danish Warmblood, whose stud book wasn't opened until the 1960s. In a relatively short space of time, however, Danish breeders have succeeded in producing a competition horse they claim to be of superior quality and more versatility than many of the European breeds. Present day While still a young breed, Danish warmbloods are currently represented at international competitions in both dressage and show jumping. The Danish Warmblood is still an uncommon breed in the United States; however in 2001 a North American Danish Warmblood Association was formed to promote the breed in the U.S. Characteristics The best Danish horses have a Thoroughbred outline that is combined with substance, strength, and good legs. They are courageous and spirited, have excellent temperaments, and good free action. They are used as dressage horses and make first-class performers in cross country. Danish horses also make good show jumpers. They can be all solid colors and stand anywhere from . Breeding The Danish Warmblood was founded on Frederiksborg stock, crossed with the Thoroughbred. The resultant local mares were bred to Anglo-Norman stallions, Thoroughbreds, and Trakehners. The mix was adjusted to produce a sound horse of excellent conformation, relatively fixed in type, and with scope and galloping ability.

He was a major landowner, owning up to . Background Bridgeman was the oldest son of George Bridgeman, 4th Earl of Bradford and his wife Lady Ida Frances Annabella Lumley, second daughter of Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough. Bridgeman was educated at Harrow School and went then to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1896 and with a Master of Arts in 1903. At Cambridge, he was secretary of the Pitt Club. He succeeded his father as earl in 1915. Career Bridgeman joined the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of The Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment), and was appointed a captain on 29 April 1899. The battalion was embodied in December 1899 to serve in the Second Boer War, and in early March 1900 left Queenstown, Ireland on the SS Oriental for South Africa. He fought in the war after arrival in 1900, and again in 1902, returning from Cape Town to the United Kingdom with most of his regiment in May 1902. He again fought in the First World War from 1915 as a lieutenant-colonel. Bridgeman was appointed Honorary Colonel of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry in 1939. Bridgeman was assistant private secretary to Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury in his posts as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between 1898 and 1900 and as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for a few weeks during the summer of 1902. Salisbury resigned on 11 July 1902, and Lord Newport subsequently was private secretary to Salisbury's successor Arthur Balfour from July 1902 until 1905. Having joined the House of Lords on his father's death, Bridgeman became Government Whip in 1919, a post he held until 1924. He was Justice of the Peace for Shropshire and represented the latter county as well as Warwickshire as Deputy Lieutenant, too. In 1932 he served as treasurer of the Royal Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury. Family On 21 July 1904, he married The Hon. Margaret Cecilia Bruce (28 October 1882 – 16 April 1949), daughter of Henry Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare.

It belongs to subsection Australes in subgenus Pinus. It inhabits tropical and subtropical coniferous forests such as Bahamian pineyards, in both lowland savannas and montane forests. Taxonomy As of 2013, the species has three accepted varieties: *Pinus caribaea var. caribaea - pino macho, Caribbean pine, Nicaragua pine, pitch pine (Pinar del Río Province and Isla de la Juventud in western Cuba) *Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis (Grisebach) W.H.Barrett & Golfari - Bahamas pine, Caicos pine, Caribbean pine (The Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands) *Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Sénéclauze) W.H.Barrett & Golfari - Caribbean pine (states of Quintana Roo and the Yucatán in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua). Note the Yucatán population is also considered to be the nominate variety. Distribution It has been proposed that the pines of Australes subsection (of which Caribbean pine is part) arrived to the Caribbean basin from Southeastern USA.Adams, D.C., Jackson, J.F. (1997). A phylogenetic analysis of the southern pines (Pinus subsect. Australes Loudon): biogeographical and ecological implications. Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington 110: 681–692. Regarding the population on the Bahamas, it has been proposed that this species emigrated into the region from Florida four or five thousand years ago, long after the end of the Ice Age, as the climate became wetter. Based on fossil species assemblages it is believed that the environment on the Bahamas was much less forested and a dry savannah during the glacial maxim some 18,000 years ago when the sea level was some 120m lower than it is today.

Phylogeography of Pinus subsection Australes in the Caribbean Basin. Annals of Botany 107: 229-241. have been used to propose that Pinus caribaea ultimately originated in Central America. According to chloroplast genetic data, Pinus caribaea lineages colonized the Caribbean islands from populations in Central America at least twice (one leading to Cuban populations and another leading to the populations on the Bahamas). It has been widely cultivated outside its natural range, and introduced populations can be found nowadays in Jamaica, Colombia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Fiji and China. Ecology Periodic wildfires play a major role in the distribution of this species; this tree regenerates quickly and aggressively, replacing broadleaf trees after fires. In zones not subject to periodic fires, the succession continues and the pine forest is replaced by tropical broadleaf forest. The young pines require extensive amounts of sunlight to grow, and are resistant to fire once they become adults. Uses Lumber and pulpwood from this tree shipped to Florida is the main export of the Abaco Islands. Conservation According to the IUCN, this species as a whole is considered of least concern, but two of the three varieties are considered endangered (var. caribaea) or vulnerable (var. bahamensis).

It was constructed to protect Cincinnati and the Ohio River valley. The location of this battery's powder magazine is marked by a bandstand in Evergreen Cemetery in Southgate, Kentucky. Shaler Battery was one of the 28 artillery batteries that were built on northern Kentucky hilltops from 1861 to 1863 for the Defense of Cincinnati. It was originally a small earthwork fortification on the point of a hill, ringed by rifle pit entrenchments. This smaller battery was removed following the construction of a larger earthwork approximately 50 feet behind (north). This portion of the earthwork remains, as well as part of the earthen ramp and small drainage ditches. The surrounding area is covered with graves and the rifle pits were filled in to form a road which is now paved. The battery was named for Dr. Nathaniel Burger Shaler, a prominent Newport, Kentucky physician, who offered his family's hilltop vineyard (which was adjacent to the cemetery and would eventually be purchased from the family estate as an addition to Evergreen) as a site for the battery.

Works He began at an early age to write his important work, Pitchei Teshuvah (פיתחי תשובה), which is the most popular and useful index to the responsa and decisions of later authorities on the subjects treated in the Shulchan Aruch. Eisenstadt's great merit consists in having collected all the material given in the works of his predecessors, and in having added to it an almost complete collection of references to responsa of all the later eminent rabbis. Of lesser value are the novellae which Eisenstadt added to Pitchei Teshuvah under the title Nachalat Tzvi. The part of Pitchei Teshuvah on Yoreh De'ah was published at Vilna in 1836 (republished Jitomir, 1840, and Lemberg, 1858); that on Even haEzer, in 1862; and, after the author's death, that on Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ, in Lemberg, 1876 (republished in Vilna, 1896).

Philolaches has also borrowed a lot of money to buy the freedom of the slave-girl he loves. One day he is having a house party with many friends, when his slave Tranio interrupts the merry-making to announce that Philolaches' father has returned unexpectedly and will arrive from the harbour at any minute. Amid the general panic, Tranio has an idea. He hustles Philolaches and his friends into the house and locks the door. The father now arrives. Tranio greets him respectfully but pretends that it is dangerous to enter the house because it is haunted. Unfortunately, at this moment a money-lender turns up to claim the money that Philolaches borrowed. Tranio thinks quickly and pretends that the money was borrowed to buy the house next door. Even when Philolaches' father meets the real owner of the house, Tranio manages to hide the truth for some time, but he is found out at last and jumps onto the top of an altar to escape punishment. All ends happily, however, when one of Philolaches' friends offers to repay the debt, thus allowing the father to forgive his son. Even Tranio is forgiven.

He is further mentioned in the Welsh Triads and in certain medieval Welsh genealogies. Caradog is the grandson of the sea god Llŷr, the nephew of Manawydan, Branwen, Efnisien and Nisien. Role in Welsh tradition The Irish king Matholwch sails to Harlech to speak with Bran the Blessed, high king of the Island of the Mighty and to ask for the hand of his sister Branwen in marriage, thus forging an alliance between the two islands. Bendigeidfran agrees to Matholwch's request, but the celebrations are cut short when Efnisien, a half-brother to the children of Llŷr, brutally mutilates Matholwch's horses, angry that his permission was not sought in regards to the marriage. Matholwch is deeply offended until Bran offers him compensation in the form of a magic cauldron that can restore the dead to life. Pleased with the gift, Matholwch and Branwen sail back to Ireland to reign. Once in Matholwch's kingdom, Branwen gives birth to a son, Gwern, but Efnysien's insult continues to rankle among the Irish and, eventually, Branwen is mistreated, banished to the kingdom and beaten every day. She tames a starling and sends it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brother Bendigeidfran, who raises a huge host in preparation for invasion. A council is held among the British and it is decided that seven men should stay behind to defend Britain; Bran's son Caradog is given seniority over the chieftains, namely Hefeydd the Tall, Unig Strong Shoulder, Iddig ab Anarawd, Ffodor ab Erfyll, Wlch Bone Lip, Llassar fab Llasar Llaes Gyngwyd and Pendaran Dyfed. Bran's host sails across the Irish Sea. Upon Bran's departure, Caradog and his men are attacked by his uncle, Caswallawn fab Beli, who murders Caradog's men whilst concealed by a cloak of invisibility. Caradog, whom Caswallawn had not intended to kill, breaks his heart in despair at the deaths of his kinsmen, and Caswallawn ascends to the throne. Caradog's paternal uncle Manawydan learns of his nephew's death upon his return from Ireland and submits to the usurper. The triads allude to both Caradog's role as a defender of Britain and to his death; Triad 13 names him as one of the Chief Defenders of Britain, while Triad 95 refers to him as one of the three people who broke their hearts out of bewilderment.

Rubin, dedicated to film and television of the \\"Golden Age\\". Its offices are located in Muscatine, Iowa and it is published by the Muscatine Journal division of Lee Enterprises, Inc. History and profile Classic Images, which has readers around the world, was founded in 1962 and was first known as The 8mm Collector (issues 1-15) and later as Classic Film Collector (issues 16-60). The magazine under the name Classic Film Collector was published quarterly in Indiana, Pennsylvania. At first the magazine focused heavily on reviews and information on silent films available on the then flourishing 8mm film home movie market, the performers and filmmakers of the silent period, and leaders and trends in the current home movie industry. Over the years Classic Images has become an increasingly important source of information on collectible film art such as posters and lobby cards. Films available in various gauges such as 16mm and 8mm received coverage also. Since the demise of a rival publication, The Big Reel, Classic Images became the foremost publication for 16mm and 8mm collectors, until the decline of those film gauges given the rise of Blu-ray and other high- definition video formats. Since the early 1980s, the newspaper has expanded coverage to include the \\"golden age of Hollywood\\", and continues to regularly feature articles on silent movies and their stars. Many minor film stars and character actors in Hollywood history have received their first major profiles in the pages of Classic Images in addition to articles of scores of legendary screen personalities and filmmakers. The magazine also features reviews of books relating to film history, news and reviews of classic films released on video, and articles on film fan conventions with photographs of famous attendees. Classic Images at times features exclusive interviews with vintage film personalities often offering valuable insights into movie history. Several leading classic-period film historians and critics published some of their first articles for the magazine, including Leonard Maltin. All articles were written voluntarily, without compensation; subscriptions and advertising by dealers in the home movie industry supported the printing costs, and a small salary for two or three office assistants: Rubin began publishing while head of a furniture store operation in Pennsylvania, but sold his business to devote his full-time and personal resources to his publication. In the early 1970s, he moved to Muscatine, Iowa, where he entered into a printing arrangement with that town's newspaper publishing enterprise, which eventually purchased the publication from Rubin. After Rubin's retirement in 1988, the publication entered into a period of decline which was reversed after Bob King became editor and general manager in 1991. As the internet and other changes in the publishing industry led to the demise of its rivals, Classic Images became an increasingly popular and respected resource of the film fan community, often referred to as \\"the film fan's bible.\\" (Rubin continued to write for the magazine until mid-2007, and published his autobiography featuring the history of the magazine, Moving Pictures and Classic Images: Memories of Forty Years in the Vintage Film Hobby, in 2004.) Laura Wagner, Tom Weaver, Robert E. Tevis, and Harris Lentz are four of Classic Images regular writers. In 1995, Classic Images also spun off a quarterly \\"sister\\" publication, the magazine Films of the Golden Age, also edited by King. Classic Images made national news in 1992 when one of its writers discovered silent film legend Vilma Bánky had died unnoticed the previous year. Since the mid-1990s, the covers of issues of Classic Images usually feature reproductions of vintage movie posters. Previously, covers were original color illustrations of classic film personalities or characters. The publication has been preserved on microfilm and may be found in university libraries. Since the mid-1980s, there has been a website, largely devoted to promotion of Classic Images and Films of the Golden Age as print publications.

He started to study the Buddhist scriptures at the age of fifteen as a novice monk. He received the higher upasampada ordination in 1947 and continued advanced studies of Buddhist scriptures. He practised Vipassana meditation under the instruction of the most Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw from 1953 to 1954. He was then invited by the State Buddha Sasana Organization to be an editor of the Buddhist scriptures in Pali for reciting Buddhist scriptures at the Sixth Buddhist Council in Myanmar. Starting from 1957, the Venerable Sayadaw spent six years in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where he continued his studies of English, Sanskrit, Hindi and Sinhalese languages. He returned to Myanmar in June 1963. At the invitation of the state Buddha Sasana Organisation, he took up residence at Kaba-Aye where he edited the publications of Pali Texts. In 1967, he was appointed by the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw as a meditation teacher at Mahasi Sasana Yeiktha, Yangon. In 1977 Sayadaw Ashin Janakabhivamsa took up residence at Chanmyay Yeiktha Meditation Center which was donated to him by some devotees and became the abbot of the center. He has been since then well known as Chanmyay Sayadaw. In 1979 - 1980 Chanmyay Sayadaw accompanied the Most Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw's Dhamma Mission to Europe and the U.S.A.

The episode was written by Robert Carlock and was directed by Don Scardino. Guest stars in this episode include Katrina Bowden, Lonny Ross, Keith Powell, Maulik Pancholy, Teddy Coluca, James Murtaugh, Donald Glover, Doug Moe, Joey La Varco and Matthew Stocke. The episode focuses on Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) pressure on the writers of TGS with Tracy Jordan to integrate General Electric products into the show, which forces Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to integrate Jack himself into a self-referential sketch about product placement. Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) and James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell) trick Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) into thinking that her job is in danger, and Liz wonders if Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) might be illiterate when he refuses to read cue cards. Plot Jack tells Liz and the writers of TGS Tracy Jordan that he wants them to insert General Electric (GE) products into the show. The writers express their reluctance in doing product placements for GE (even though during the scene the cast talk about how great Snapple's White Green Tea tastes), but Liz agrees on the condition that Jack appears in the sketch. The next day, Liz watches a video containing outtakes from Jack's product placement video, where she discovers that he repeatedly forgot his lines after 142 takes. After realizing that he needs help, Liz encourages Jack to go through with the sketch, which he ultimately is able to shoot. Tracy decides that he is going to take a break from rehearsals after he is called back on stage to read his cue cards. When Tracy appears to be ignoring his cue cards, Jenna informs Liz of the situation, and realizes that Tracy might be illiterate, citing an earlier promo cue card mishap (\\"The Aftermath\\") as an example. Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits that he is illiterate and agrees to get help. Liz later notices Tracy reading a newspaper, and learns that he was using the ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is not going to take it anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch. Jenna tells Pete that she wishes to insert a music number called \\"Muffin Top\\" into the show, which she claims is a big hit overseas. As a prank, Frank and Toofer tell her that several people are going to be fired. Believing them, Jenna tries to seduce an NBC executive whom she sees talking to Jack. Liz later notifies Jenna that no one is going to be fired, and that the executive is actually an extra on the show. Jenna aims to get back at the pair, and although Toofer admits that he was too smart for Jenna's tactics, Frank is seen running around naked outside Jack's balcony. Jenna finally gets her chance to perform \\"Muffin Top\\", unaware that the show has already ended and the number was scratched at the last moment, thanks to Liz. Production Although credited, Jack McBrayer did not appear in this episode. In an effort to improve ratings, \\"Jack-Tor\\" was the first episode of 30 Rock to air on a Thursday night, which is advertised by NBC as \\"Comedy Night Done Right\\". 30 Rock was also one of several sitcoms to have a \\"super-sized\\" episode, which NBC employed as a sweeps stunt, and to initiate a mostly comedy lineup. Instead of the usual 30-minute episodes, \\"Jack-Tor\\" was increased to 40 minutes. Despite the increased length of the episode, Jack McBrayer, who plays Kenneth Parcell, received credits but did not appear in the show, except for a brief non-speaking cameo at the very end when Jenna is singing \\"Muffin Top\\". Fey said that there was \\"such a big ensemble\\" in the episode that he was crowded out. Fey said that she thought \\"McBrayer is fantastic\\", and that she is \\"planning to use him lots and lots\\". Executive producer Lorne Michaels also praised McBrayer, saying \\"we're very high on him. He's obviously the breakout performer on the series. We like him, the network likes him, viewers like him, everybody likes him.\\" Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock, beginning with the pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger, and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four Halloweens. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference \\"started happening organically\\" when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference \\"in almost every show\\". Fey said that from then on \\"it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going\\", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a \\"pretty high batting average\\". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as \\"the resident expert\\". In this episode, Star Wars is referenced when Frank mentions a \\"friend in accounting\\" named Lando Calrissian, a prominent Star Wars character. Reception \\"Jack-Tor\\" brought in an average of 5.2 million American viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States, achieving a 2.4/6 in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The 2.4 refers to 2.4% of all people of ages 18–49 years old, and the 6 refers to 6% of all people of ages 18–49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast. 30 Rock's timeslot change, from Wednesday to Thursday, which was aimed at improving ratings, was a success compared to the previous episode, \\"Jack the Writer\\"; it was watched by approximately 4.61 million American viewers,ABC Medianet, (November 7, 2006) \\"Weekly Program Rankings \\". Retrieved on August 8, 2008. and only received a rating of 1.7/5 in the key adults 18–49 demographic. Overall, however, the move was thought to be a failure. Joal Ryan of E! reported that the \\"sparse crowd\\" of 5.2 million viewers was a large decrease from the ratings 30 Rock achieved on Wednesdays, where it averaged 6.3 million viewers per episode. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that while the storyline of Liz being forced to integrate GE products into the show was a \\"good idea\\", it \\"missed the bull's-eye\\". He also felt that the storyline of putting Jack on TGS with Tracy Jordan was \\"fun\\", but thought \\"that for some reason fell a bit flat\\". Tom Shales of The Washington Post felt that \\"30 Rock had \\"consistently and considerably improved since its premiere\\". He praised Alec Baldwin, whose performance he described as \\"rare and rich [...] perilously close to perfect, beyond improving\\". Shales said that it was \\"painful to report\\" that Jack McBrayer was absent in the episode, saying he was \\"the show's brightest discovery\\", and his \\"performance has been a bittersweet beauty\\". Rob Canning of IGN said that 30 Rock's was \\"one new comedy we do not want to see taken off the air\\". He said that \\"Jack-Tor\\" had him \\"laughing from every angle\\", and may have \\"begun a debate as to which character is more fun to watch – Jack Donaghy or Tracy Jordan?\\". He said that the outtakes of Jack's sketch were \\"one of the best parts of the episode\\", and that Tracy was evolving into his own \\"uniquely hilarious character\\". Overall, he felt that Jack was winning the \\"comedy showdown\\". Robert Carlock, the writer of the episode, was nominated for his work for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series.

It was released February 20, 2007. Recording The album was recorded over the course of summer 2006. On October 19, the band announced they had finished recording. Title and artwork The album title itself is perhaps a reference to a line of dialogue spoken by the character of Mabel Longhetti (Gena Rowlands) in the 1974 John Cassavetes film A Woman Under the Influence. Having just seen her children taken off to school by their grandmother, Mabel states, \\"All of a sudden I miss everyone; I don't know why.\\". Another strong possibility is that the title refers to a famous The Catcher In The Rye quote during its 26th (and last) chapter.

Isaac (Isaak) Hirsch Weiss, also Eisik Hirsch Weiss () (February 9, 1815 – June 1, 1905), was an Austrian Talmudist and historian of literature born at Groß Meseritsch, Habsburg Moravia. After having received elementary instruction in Hebrew and Talmud in various chadorim of his native town, he entered, at the age of eight, the yeshiva of Moses Aaron Tichler (founded at Velké Meziříčí in 1822), where he studied Talmud for 5 years. He then studied at home under a tutor, and later in the yeshiva of Trebitsch, Moravia, under Ḥayyim Joseph Pollak, and in that of Eisenstadt, Hungary under Isaac Moses Perles, returning to his home town in 1837.  Early abilities  From the early age at which Weiss began to study Talmud and rabbinics it may be deduced that he was endowed with remarkable ability. He felt a keen desire for the pursuit of the secular sciences also, of which he was deprived in his youth, although he had been instructed in German by his private tutor. In some of the yeshibot which he attended instruction was given also in the Hebrew language and grammar, but that did not satisfy Weiss. It was for this reason that he changed from one yeshibah to another, hoping that he would ultimately find one in which his desire for learning would be satisfied. Influenced by Nachman Krochmal, by Rapoport, and by Leopold Zunz's Gottesdienstliche Vorträge, Weiss devoted part of his time to the study of religious philosophy. Talmudic studies, however, occupied the greater part of his time, and during the years that he spent in his parents' home he wrote several pamphlets containing novellæ on Talmudic tractates, as well as on the Shulḥan 'Aruk, Yoreh De'ah and Ḥoshen Mishpaṭ. He also kept up a correspondence with many distinguished rabbis, particularly Joseph Saul Nathanson, and contributed to Stern's Kokebe Yiẓḥaḳ and to Kobak's Jeschurun. To the former he contributed articles on general subjects, as well as verses and a number of biographies, among which that of Rab (Abba Arika) deserves special notice. In the Jeschurun he published several articles on the origin of prayer.  Activity at Vienna  In 1858 Weiss settled in Vienna, where he became corrector for the press in the printing establishment of Samarski and Dittmarsch. Six years later (1864) he was appointed lecturer in the bet ha-midrash founded by Adolf Jellinek, holding that position until his death. In Vienna, where Jellinek and other prominent Jewish scholars were congregated, Weiss found greater scope for his literary activity. He immediately turned his attention to a Vienna edition of the Talmud, and the notes with which he provided most of the tractates give evidence of his vast erudition. Then, at the request of Jacob Schlossberg, he wrote a compendium of the laws and observances relating to the ritual; this work, which was entitled Oraḥ la-Ẓaddiḳ, was published by Schlossberg at the beginning of the Seder Tefillat Ya'aḳob (Vienna, 1861). In the following year Weiss edited the Sifra with the commentary of Abraham ben David of Posquières; to this work he added a historical and linguistic introduction in nine chapters, and he provided the text with critical and exegetical notes entitled Masoret ha-Talmud, giving the variants of different manuscripts as well as an index showing the parallel passages in both Talmudim. In 1864 Weiss took a prominent part in the Kompert trial, publishing a pamphlet entitled Neẓaḥ Yisrael in support of the testimony of Horowitz and Mannheimer with regard to the belief in the Messiah. This work called forth a reply by Nissan Schidhoff, entitled Nesheḳ Bar (Fürth, 1864). See Heinrich Graetz #The Kompert Affair. In the same year Weiss edited the mishnayot of the treatise Berakhot, giving a list of variants in both Talmudim and a brief synopsis of the contents. A year later (1865) he founded a monthly magazine, Bet ha-Midrash, of which, however, only five numbers appeared. In the same year he edited the Mekilta, to which he added an introduction dealing with the historical development of both Halakha and Aggada, and a critical commentary entitled Middot Soferim. After the publication of his Mishpaṭ Leshon ha-Mishnah (1867), an essay on the mishnaic language, Weiss began to prepare his stupendous work, the Dor Dor we-Dorshaw (1871–91; see below). Although Weiss had not been successful with his Bet ha- Midrash, he was more fortunate with the Bet Talmud, a monthly magazine which he founded in 1881 with Meïr Friedmann. In this periodical Weiss published numerous articles of his own, most of them treating of the Talmud in general and of Talmudic subjects. No less important are his biographical sketches, among which are those of Maimonides, Rashi, and Jacob Tam (Bet Talmud, i., ii., and iii., and reprinted in book form under the title Toledot Gedole Yisrael). In 1891, on the completion of his Dor, Weiss reedited Isaac Campanton's Darke ha-Gemara, a methodology of the Talmud. His last work in book form was his Zikronotai (Warsaw, 1895), a collection of his reminiscences from his childhood to his eightieth year. He continued to contribute to various Hebrew periodicals, writing mostly biographies, of which may be mentioned that of Saadia Gaon (in Ha-Asif, ii. 275-293), published before Weiss had attained his thirtieth year, and that of Mannheimer (in Mi-Mizraḥ umi-Ma'Arab, iii. 17 et seq.). In his lectures Weiss was rather free with regard to the text of the Talmud and the Midrashim. He did not hesitate to declare the text faulty when it seemed so to him; but, on the other hand, he was very careful in making corrections. He held also that the words of the ancient rabbis should not be interpreted according to modern conception, such interpretation being liable to result in error. Isaac Hirsch died at Vienna on June 1, 1905.  His Dor Dor we-Dorshaw  Weiss's most important production, through which he acquired great renown, is his Dor Dor we-Dorshaw, (דור דור ודורשיו; \\"Each generation and its Scholars\\") a work in five volumes. As its German title, Zur Geschichte der Jüdischen Tradition, shows, it is a history of the Halakha, or oral law, from Biblical times until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain at the end of the 15th century. The first volume (1871) covers the history from the inception of the oral law to the destruction of the Second Temple; vol. ii. (1876) treats of the tannaitic period until the conclusion of the Mishnah; vol. iii. (1883), of the amoraic period till the completion of the Babylonian Talmud; vol. iv. (1887), of the geonic period until the end of the fifth millennium (= the middle of the 13th century); and vol. v., of the period of the casuists (\\"poseḳim\\") until the composition of the Shulḥan 'Aruk. As the oral law is in reality the interpretation of the Pentateuch, Weiss thinks that it originated immediately after the redaction of the latter by Moses. The apparent divergencies in the Pentateuch and the various books of the Prophets (as the well-known differences between the books of Ezekiel and Leviticus, and many others) are due only to different interpretations of the Pentateuch in different epochs. It will be seen that Weiss defended the unity of the Pentateuch and vindicated the authorship of Moses. But he believed that Moses himself followed certain traditions current in his time, as it is said that Abraham observed God's commandments and laws (Gen. xxvi. 5). He asserted also that while the Pentateuch contains no simple repetitions of the laws, it contains additions which amplify or limit the commandments laid down in the earlier books. In the second volume Weiss gives the history of the Mekhilta, Sifra, Sifre, and Mishnah. This volume contains also monographs on the Tannaim which are invaluable to the Talmudic student; without concealing the failings of some, he defends them, especially the patriarchs, against the charges of Schorr and others. In the third volume much space is devoted to the Aggada and the aggadists, and the author does not endeavor to find apologies for those seemingly strange passages in this part of the Talmud which serve as pretexts for those who seek to detract from its value. But he points out the many edifying sentences that are scattered throughout the Aggada, and quotes a great number of them. As was to be expected, this work, adopted by the majority of Haskalah Talmudic scholars as the standard history of the oral law, called forth replies from some dissenters. Isaac Halevy is known to have written his Dorot ha-Rishonim against Weiss's Dor (mainly in notes at the end of the sixth vol.), and Eleazar Zarkes published a criticism of the work in Keneset ha-Gedolah (iv., part 2, pp. 65 et seq.). Simḥah Edelmann issued a small pamphlet entitled Ma'amar Doreshe Reshumot (Warsaw, 1893), in which he endeavored to make evident Weiss's mistakes, and Simḥah Weissmann, in his pamphlet Teshubot u-Ma'anot Nimraẓot, did not even abstain from personalities. Y. Lifshitz wrote a refutation \\"Dor Yesharim\\" that received approbations from major Chareidi figures such as Chaim Ozer Grodzinski.

It closed as a staffed station in 1930, reopened as an unattended gate in 1931 and with full closure on 27 September 1993. The name Meeandah comes from the English word \\"meander,\\" after the twisting and turning route of the nearby Brisbane River. Meeandah railway station falls within the suburb of Pinkenba. History The line to Pinkenba opened on 1 April 1897. During World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945), troop camps were located in the area because of deep berthing available to ships at Pinkenba on the mouth of the Brisbane River. Passenger ships of the Orient Steam Navigation Company--later P&O;--used the Pinkenba wharf, and special trains ran from Brisbane. The station mistress was withdrawn and the station closed in 1930 due to economic measure brought on by the Great Depression. With public outcry by the local residents and workers to Commissioner Davidson, the station was reopened in 1931 as an unattended gate. The HMS Nabreekie Mobile Naval Air Base and a large army camp defense storage and warehouse facility were located near Meeandah railway station during World War II; the army camp remains today as the Damascus Barracks. In 1988, part of the Pinkenba line was electrified; however, only as far as the earlier Eagle Farm station. Diesel-hauled passenger services in stainless steel carriages infrequently operated passenger services through Meeandah. All passenger services on the line were suspended on 27 September 1993 by the Goss Labor Party government's rationalisation of the state rail network with the suspending or closing of unprofitable and underutilised rail lines.

Originally a non-profit based in Washington, D.C., the organization merged with CFI in 2016. History After Richard Dawkins' success with the book The God Delusion, he created the foundation with its headquarters in the United States to work toward a world in which religion no longer interferes with the advance of science and in which people use their critical thinking skills to evaluate theist claims about the nature of reality. Dawkins complained of the difficulty he faced in gaining tax-free status, which he attributes to the secular nature of the organization. In contrast to the presumption by officials that religious organizations benefit humanity without evidence (for instance Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption), he points to a letter he received from the British Charity Commission requesting evidence for the claim that the advancement of science is connected to the public good. Theist author Marion Ledwig suggests that the foundation may have been set up as an atheist counterpart to the John Templeton Foundation, an organization which Dawkins has publicly criticized, especially in The God Delusion, for corrupting science. In a TED talk prior to writing The God Delusion, Dawkins had called for the need for an \\"anti-Templeton\\" to step up, saying that if his books sold better, he would take the initiative himself.Dawkins 2002 TED talk accessed 14 April 2010 Dawkins describes his foundation's purpose this way: > \\"Critical thinking is the real saviour of humankind. My foundation promotes > respect for people who hold critical thinking as a cherished personal value > and use it in day-to-day life. The logical counter to religious extremism is > people who rely on evidence to make decisions. Yet the voice of secular > people is maligned in this country. Forty-five percent of Americans think > you have to believe in God to be moral. Secular voices are considered > immoral. They are not listened to on that basis. We must counter this > baseless hostility to allow the contributions of secular people in vital > national debates to count. Making secular views and people welcome in > politics and policy-making will advance human safety, security, health, > achievement, prosperity and most of all, science.\\" The organization began accepting members in April 2015. Among its activities, RDFRS finances research into the psychology of belief and religion, finances scientific education programs and materials, and publicizes and supports secular charitable organisations. The foundation has been granted charitable status in the United Kingdom and status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit private operating foundation in the United States. RDFRS financed research on the psychology of belief and religion, financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported charitable organisations that are secular in nature. The foundation also offers humanist, rationalist, and scientific materials through its website. Dawkins has said the \\"trend toward theocratic thinking in the United States is a danger not only for America but for the entire world.\\" Connected to this concern, Dawkins invited Sean Faircloth to serve as opening speaker on Dawkins's 2011 US book tour. Faircloth is author of the book Attack of the Theocrats, How the Religious Right Harms Us All and What We Can Do About It. The Richard Dawkins Foundation (United States branch) later hired Faircloth, who has ten years experience as a state legislator, as Director of Strategy and Policy. Activism RDFRS also invests in creating, producing and influencing the development of entertainment products for general audiences that support secularism and fight scientific illiteracy. =2009= In March 2009, following proposed anti- evolution resolutions by Oklahoma State Representative Todd Thomsen, including condemning a visit by Dawkins to Oklahoma, he instructed the U.S. branch of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science to donate $5,000 to Oklahomans for Excellence in Science Education. =2011= In March 2011, the RDFRS along with the Freedom From Religion Foundation began The Clergy Project which is a confidential on-line community that supports members as they move from their faith. =2014= In 2014 RDFRS joined several similar organizations, including the Stiefel Freethought Foundation, the Secular Student Alliance, and the Secular Coalition for America, to form Openly Secular, an initiative which aims to combat and draw attention to anti-atheist discrimination and to encourage more people to openly self-identify as nonbelievers. Among the strategies is to get celebrities to come forward as openly secular. Videos have been posted by Penn & Teller, Bill Maher, NFL star Arian Foster, Julia Sweeney, John Davidson and others. =2015= In April 2015, RDFRS launched the Teacher Institute for Evolutionary Science (TIES) to provide middle school teachers with workshops and free online tools to teach evolution and answer its critics. TIES is led by Bertha Vazquez, an award- winning middle school science teacher in Miami, FL. = 2016 = In January 2016, RDFRS announced that it was merging with the Center for Inquiry, with Robyn Blumner as the CEO of the combined organizations. The merger was completed in December 2016, with RDFRS becoming a division of CFI.

They have thus far not qualified for a Rugby World Cup, but have participated in qualifying tournaments. Colombia made their debut against Mexico in 1996. In 2018, the Colombians won their first significant international honour, winning the inaugural Americas Rugby Challenge, the 'B' championship to the Americas Rugby Championship. The national side is ranked 33rd in the world (as of 29 July 2019).https://www.world.rugby/rankings/mru?lang=en History Colombia attempted to qualify for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, participating in the Americas qualifying tournaments during November 2001. They contested matches in the Round 1 (South) group, against nations including Brazil, Venezuela and Peru in Round 1. Colombia was involved in qualifying for the World Cup (France 2007) in 2004 when they contested Round 1b (CONSUR 2nd division). They finished fourth in the final standings which knocked them out of contention, though their fixtures against Peru and Venezuela were close, losing 15-10 and 27-31 respectively. Rugby has little support by the government or media, as football (soccer) has a stronger tradition in the country. The Colombian rugby team is called Los Tucanes. The team has competed in the B Division of the South American Rugby Championship since its second edition in 2001. It won the competition in 2009, and again, three times in a row in 2014, 2015 and 2016. However, there is no direct promotion to the A Division; to win promotion it must beat the lowest-place team in the A Division in a playoff. In an attempt to qualify for the 2019 edition of the Rugby World Cup, Colombia showed some progress. Colombia easily beat Ecuador 75-5 then went on to defeat Peru 41-14 and Venezuela 35-10 progressing the team to the next round. This involved Colombia playing Mexico in a Pan- American qualifier, which Colombia won 29-11. Colombia's final qualifying match was played against Paraguay who had come in last place in 2015 South American championship Division A. This was the end of the road for Colombia as they gallantly lost this match 39-27. After winning Sudamericano B three times in a row (Apartadó 2014, Lima 2015 and Lima 2016), Sudamérica Rugby promoted Colombia to the top tier of South America, alongside Uruguay, Chile, Brazil and Paraguay, to start in 2018. The competition changed its format, and a South American Six Nations was played in May 2018. This tournament included the Top 5 teams of South America and Argentina XV. Colombia will have another important competition each year, and it will be Americas Rugby Championship B. This new competition will be structured as the second tier competition of the Americas, after Americas Rugby Championship.

HistorySchool's website, History St. Teresa's School was named by Reverend Father Jackson MHM in honour of a renowned Carmelite sister. He arrived in Borneo in 1881 upon the invitation of Rajah Charles Brooke to establish Catholic mission schools in Kuching and Kanowit. The name chosen for the convent and school was in fulfillment of a promise made many years ago before by Rev. Father Jackson. While still a student, he found great difficulty in mastering Philosophy and Theology. In his distress he appealed to the great Saint Teresa of Avila to intercede for him and promised he would do something in her honour, if his wish was granted. St. Teresa was born in Avila, Spain in 1515 and died in 1582. She came from a noble family with high moral values. However, she gave up all her material possessions and became a Carmelite nun in 1536. Because of her great wisdom, intelligence, humility, diligence and integrity she was declared a Doctor of the Church in September 1880. Since its foundation in 1885, the school has been entrusted under her patronage and protection; and therefore it is expected that the students of St. Teresa's School emulate and uphold her outstanding qualities and virtues. St. Teresa's School in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia had its beginnings in a small shop, at 149 Yorkshire Street, Rockdale, in England. The shop was kept by Alice Ingham and her widowed stepmother. Both were devout and hardworking women. Alice and a small group of friends understood the human need for spiritual and physical food and clothing. They helped whatever way they could. They conducted religious classes for children; they nursed the sick; they assisted with parish work. After a few years of this, Alice was asked by Bishop Herbert Vaughan to undertake the management of domestic affairs at a newly founded missionary college in Mill Hill, near London. This meant that she was to be in charge of household toil- cooking, cleaning and pressing linen with heavy charcoal irons until 2 in the morning with four sisters. They no longer taught, nursed nor earned money for their many charities. In 1883, the Congregation of St. Joseph's Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart was officially formed. Some of its members grouped in communities outside the college, but Mill Hill was where Mother Francis (Alice Ingham) lived. It (Mill Hill) was the Congregation's centre of gravity- it was also the link between Sarawak and Rochdale. A political exception in its day, Sarawak in the late 19th century was an oriental principality founded by Sir James Brooke in 1841, who expanded the boundaries of Sarawak, until his death in 1868, leaving a sizable amount of land to his nephew, Charles Brooke. Rajah Charles Brooke had been in his uncle's service throughout his adult life. He thoroughly knew and loved Sarawak. He knew what was best for his land and his people. Rajah Charles disliked European commercial influence of the money-grabbing kind. The Borneo Company was the only foreign firm allowed to operate in Sarawak for a long time. He believed that unchecked western influences was sure to exploit and spoil the natives of Sarawak, and was more than half inclined to add the Christian missionaries in his suspicious, remarking once that Bishops are a bit of a nuisance out here and the missions do not benefit the Dayaks. The Rajah expected the missionaries to settle the Dayaks; to cure them out of their roving habits and aggressive ways: to transform them into law-abiding citizens of the sturdy gentlemen type. When Rajah Charles mentioned the Dayaks, he usually meant the Ibans, Sarawak's largest tribal group, and the one he understood and loved the most. And so, when a letter came to him from the Bishop Vaughan requesting permission to set up a Catholic Mission in Sarawak, he wrote back: “… the Sarawak Government will have no objection to there being a Catholic Mission. I would recommend that your missionaries, on their arrival, to a district of Dayaks who have been almost untouched by teachings of any sort. This district would not be far from the capital, in which almost everything in the way of clothes, etc. can be obtained…” Principals of SMK. ST. TeresaSchool's website, Principals of SMK. ST.

That is, if the code rate is k/n for every k bits of useful information, the coder generates a total of n bits of data, of which n-k are redundant. If R is the gross bitrate or data signalling rate (inclusive of redundant error coding), the net bitrate (the useful bit rate exclusive of error-correction codes) is \\\\leq R \\\\cdot k/n. For example: The code rate of a convolutional code will typically be 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, etc., corresponding to one redundant bit inserted after every single, second, third, etc., bit. The code rate of the octet oriented Reed Solomon block code denoted RS(204,188) is 188/204, meaning that 204 - 188 = 16 redundant octets (or bytes) are added to each block of 188 octets of useful information.

History  Medgyesbodzás was the part of the old Zanard vármegye in the medieval, after that it was the part of Arad vármegye by the Treaty of Trianon. By the country reforming in 1950 it’s belonged to Csanád- Arad-Torontál megye, after that it moved to Békés megye. The village founded at 1857 as a garden community. The most of the population were Roman Catholic Hungarian.  History of the Jewish community  In the old Bodzáspuszta Jewish families have already lived before the foundation of the community. At 1890 53 Jewish people lived here. Lajos Löbl and his family, and Ábrahám Buchbinder and his family lived here among the two world war.

While much of traditional chemistry teaching centers on multi-gramme preparations, milligrammes of substances are sufficient for microscale chemistry. In universities, modern and expensive lab glassware is used and modern methods for detection and characterization of the produced substances are very common. In schools and in many countries of the Southern hemisphere, small-scale working takes place with low-cost and even no-cost material. There has always been a place for small-scale working in qualitative analysis, but the new developments can encompass much of chemistry a student is likely to meet.  History  There are two main strands of the modern approach. One is based on the idea that many of the experiments associated with general chemistry (acids and bases, oxidation and reduction, electrochemistry, etc.) can be carried out in equipment much simpler (injection bottles, dropper bottles, syringes, wellplates, plastic pipettes) and therefore cheaper than the traditional glassware in a laboratory, thus enabling the expansion of the laboratory experiences of students in large classes and to introduce laboratory work into institutions too poorly equipped for standard-type work. Pioneering development in this area was carried out by Egerton C. Grey (1928), Mahmoud K. El-Marsafy (1989) in Egypt, Stephen Thompson in the US and others. A further application of these ideas was the devising by Bradley of the Radmaste kits in South Africa, designed to make effective chemical experiments possible in developing countries in schools that lack the technical services (electricity, running water) taken for granted in many places. The other strand is the introduction of this approach into synthetic work, mainly in organic chemistry. Here the crucial breakthrough was achieved by Mayo, Pike and Butcher and by Williamson who demonstrated that inexperienced students were able to carry out organic syntheses on a few tens of milligrams, a skill previously thought to require years of training and experience. These approaches were accompanied by the introduction of some specialised equipment, which was subsequently simplified by Breuer without great loss of versatility. The text of the book is available in electronical format free from the author. There is a great deal of published material available to help in the introduction of such a scheme, providing advice on choice of equipment, techniques and preparative experiments and the flow of such material is continuing through a column in the Journal of Chemical Education called 'The Microscale Laboratory' that has been running for many years. Scaling down experiments, when combined with modern projection technology, opened up the possibility of carrying out lecture demonstrations of the most hazardous kind in total safety. The approach has been adopted worldwide. It has become a major presence on the educational scene in the US, it is used to a lesser extent in the UK and it is used in many countries in institutions with staff who are enthusiastic about it. For example, in India, small scale chemistry/ microscale chemistry is now implemented in a few universities and colleges.  Advantages  *Saves time for preparation and clear away *Reduces waste at the source *More safety *Lower costs for chemical substances and equipment *Smaller storage area *Reduced reliance on intensive ventilation systems *Pleasant working atmosphere *Shorter reaction times *More time for evaluation and communication.

They are Hindus. The community consists of two groups - the Palakkad Iyers and Iyers of the Cochin and Travancore regions. Kerala Iyers, like the Iyers of Tamil Nadu and the Nambudiris of Kerala, belonged to the Pancha- Dravida classification of India's Brahmin community. They mostly belonged to the Vadama and Brahacharanam sub-sects. Iyers were usually not recruited as the priest (shanthi) in Kerala temples which followed Tantric rituals. So Iyers being Vedic scholars built their own temples in their Agraharams to conduct pooja, since they followed different rituals and not the Tantric rituals of the Nambudiris.Temples of Kerala  Brahmana Samooham  Where ever they settled, the Kerala Iyers lived together in communities. The settlement consisting of array of houses and other amenities developed by Tamil Brahmins in Kerala came to be known as Agraharam as in other parts of South India. Each Agraharam consist of two rows of houses facing each other. There is no courtyard but only common street. Several such Agraharams together form an organization called \\"Samooham\\". There existed 95 Agraharams in Kerala where Brahmins lived in peace, with unity, equality and simplicity.  Palakkad Iyers  The Palakkad Iyers were greatly affected by the Kerala Agrarian Relations Bill, 1957 (repealed in 1961 and substituted by The Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963) which abolished the tenancy system.  Travancore Iyers  During the rule of Travancore kings, many Iyers (Tamil Brahmins) were invited to Thiruvananthapuram for administrative requirements of Travancore kingdom and for participating in rituals related to Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Some Padamangalam Nairs involved in temple service are thought to be descendants of Travancore Iyers. The migration continued for decades, and thus Iyer population is concentrated around this temple in Trivandrum.

Major characters * Astro Boy (Tetsuwan Atomu; \\"Mighty Atom\\" in Japanese versions) - The robotic boy fashioned after Tobio Tenma (Astor Boynton III in the B/W American translation) by his father, the head of the Ministry of Science in the year 2000. Aside from possessing the strength of 100,000 horsepower (later 1,000,000, though these numbers often fluctuate between stories) and the kind personality of a child, he has what are called his \\"seven amazing powers\\": jet-powered flight, multilingualism, analytical skills, headlight eyes, super-sensitive hearing, hidden weapons in his back, and the ability to tell if a person is good or evil. In addition, he has a built-in geiger counter and shortwave communication system. * Uran (Uran)/Zoran/Astro Girl - Astro's robotic sister with a shown adoration towards Astro; she is a superhuman robot with a naive, tomboyish personality. Constructed by Dr. Ochanomizu as a \\"gift\\" for Astro, Uran is an extremely mischievous little girl who constantly lands her older brother in trouble. While lacking Atom's weaponry and propulsion systems, she is extremely powerful (50,000 horsepower) and regularly accompanies him on various missions (or attempts to). Like Atom, she is fully capable of experiencing human emotions - though being somewhat less 'mature'. Uran first appeared in Episode 35 (Uran) under the misleading name Astro Girl (due to the fact it sounds more like a female dubbed version of the protagonist; in the manga she has always been known as Uran, although in the 2000 anime series she was renamed Zoran, despite this being a male name). In the 2003 anime and Naoki Urasawa's Pluto Uran has the ability to communicate with animals. In the Canadian version of Astroboy, she is dubbed as \\"Sarah\\". Her name is based on uranium, a metal used to power nuclear reactors. * Dr. Umatarō Tenma (TENMA-hakase; \\"Dr. Astor Boyton II\\") - The former head of the Ministry of Science. Ever since his son died, he decided to build a robot boy who looks like his son. But when he discovered that Astro could not grow, he sold his son to the circus. He appears only in Episodes 1: Birth of Astro Boy, and 97: Mystery of The Metal Men. * Hoshie Tenma (TENMA Hoshie) - deceased wife of Dr. Umatarō Tenma and mother of Tobio Tenma. Her facial features are taken from Michi, a superhuman being created from synthetic cells in the manga version of Metropolis. This is quite appropriate as Michi was something of a spiritual predecessor to Atom and in a way could even be seen as his mother. Hoshie was the model for Atom's robotic mother as seen in volumes seven and Eight of the Tetsuwan Atom Manga. * Professor Ochanomizu (OCHANOMIZU-hakase; \\"Dr. Packerdermus J. Elefun\\") - The present head of the Institute of Science and a fearless campaigner for robotic rights. Kind, patient and good-natured, he serves as a mentor for both Atom and Uran, and would willingly give his life for either. Somewhat eccentric by nature, he tends to be excitable when faced by a scientific mystery, particularly when his opinions are questioned by his scientific colleagues. He first appeared in Episode 1: Birth of Atom, where he rescued Atom from Hamegg's circus. * Police Inspector Tawashi (Tawashi-keibu; translated as \\"Inspector Hairbrush\\"; known in English as \\"Inspector Gumshoe\\") - a highly placed police detective with an innate distrust of androids and robots (the reason to this is never explained in detail). Due to his opposition to Tokyo's robotic population, Tawashi has a long-standing feud with both Dr. Ochanomizu and Higeoyaji, and frequently engages in volatile arguments with them. While arrogant, cantankerous and, in some cases, downright rude, he eventually comes to respect Atom's courage and abilities, even calling for his assistance in particularly difficult cases. Partnered with Chief Nakamura, he first appeared in Episode 2: Franken. * Police Inspector Nakamura (Nakamura-keibu; \\"Chief McClaw\\") - The chief of the police and the partner of Inspector Tawashi. Played mainly for comic relief, he was normally portrayed as fat, dim-witted and gullible; a stereotype \\"clueless flatfoot\\" of the period. Nonetheless, he instantly recognized Atom's good side and frequently stood up for Atom against his bullying partner (as seen in Episode 23). In the 1960s English translations, he has an Irish accent. He first appeared in Episode 2: Franken. * Shunsaku Ban (BAN Shunsaku; \\"Albert Duncan\\") aka Victor (later Percival) Pompous in the first series, Mr. Mustachio (Higeoyaji; \\"Daddy Walrus\\") in the second - originally introduced as a private investigator in the first American dub, Higeoyaji played several roles in the Japanese strip series, including school teacher and martial arts expert. Like Dr. Ochanomizu, Higeoyaji serves as a surrogate father for Atom and Uran, providing guidance and advice when necessary. While gruff and comically short-tempered, he harbours a deep admiration for Atom, seeing him as the son he never had, and even stands up to the formidable Inspector Gumshoe in the boy's defence. Higeoyaji first appeared in Episode 7: Denkou. In both the original comic strip and the second 1980s Japanese series, he was Atom's school teacher (in Naoki Urasawa's Pluto he has apparently been promoted to principal), and his nickname was Mr. Mustachio or Daddy Walrus. In the 2003 remake, he is notably absent from Atom's school, working full-time as a private eye and is also the uncle of Ochanomizu's assistant, Yuko Kisaragi. * Mama and Papa - Astro's robotic parents. Mama is depicted as an idealized 1960s housewife, and she is sweet, kind and nurturing. She is entirely trusting of her son's impeccable nature, knows he would never deliberately lie or harm another being (as seen in Episode 20). In contrast, Papa is portrayed as something of a well-meaning blowhard, often jumping to conclusions and losing his temper over minor incidents. They first appeared in Episode 2: Franken. In the Sankei Newspaper Atom manga series, it is revealed that Mama was modified to resemble Dr. Tenma's wife who had died of a heart condition shortly after Astro was sold to the circus. * Cobalt (Kobaruto; \\"Jetto\\"; later replaced by a character named Atlas in the 1980 anime version) - Atom's robotic brother. His origins differ in the continuities of the manga and anime versions. In the manga, he is an inferior copy of Astro created as a replacement by Prof. Ochanomizu when he was missing and presumed scrap. In the anime version, he was a defective prototype of Atom built by Dr. Tenma, then sealed within the Ministry of Science archivesand later released. Cobalt has abilities comparable to his brother's, but lacks Astro's intelligence and common sense. Clumsy, accident- prone and gullible, he is a constant source of trouble for Atom's family (and everyone else who crosses his path). Despite these problems, Cobalt is often shown to be extremely kind-hearted and loyal. In addition to the abilities that were copied from Atom, he also shares a kind of telepathic link with his brother that gives him the ability to sense when Atom is in danger and home in his location. He originally died a heroic death at the conclusion of the Midoro Swamp story arc in the Shonen Magazine serial version of the manga, but Tezuka later changed his mind and rewrote the ending for the paperback version so that he survived. He first appeared in Episode 84: Cobalt. His name is based on Cobalt-60, an isotope used in nuclear reactors. Physically, he resembles Astro, but is taller and thinner. * Chi-Tan - Astro Boy's baby brother created by Dr. O'Shay and seen primarily in the last season of the anime. Created primarily as a comic relief character. Main characteristic is his loud bawling, which can shatter things. Believed to have been inspired by the character Swee'Pea from the Popeye cartoons, Chi-Tan's name is a pun on Titanium, as in Japan, it is cute to replace \\"ch\\" sounds with \\"t\\" sounds, thus making Chi-Tan's name pronounced similarly to Titan in Japanese. * Ken'ichi - Atom's classmate. He's the class president and also the smartest. He first appeared in the manga Episode, Franken, but he does not appear in the 1963 TV show. * The Blue Knight - also known as Blue Bon. He is known to be a hero among many robots for helping those who were treated poorly by humans. As he wears a blue suit armor, people call him \\"The Blue Knight\\" out of fear. He also wields a sword that emits an aura that affects certain robots. During a fight against him, Atom realizes that the sword does not affect robots that tend to revolt against human however those that do not will feel tired as he did. He only appeared in one manga episode, \\"The Blue Knight\\". In the 2003 anime series his character was expanded and was given a background story line. During his early days as normal robot, he used to work at a robot circus, repairing broken robots who lost in robot fighting matches. When he saw how badly robots were treated in the circus, he decided to take action by helping them all escape; however, he was caught by his human owner, who happens to be the ringmaster of the robot circus and was thrown out into space. He was later found by Shadow who rebuilt him into The Blue Knight. He is portrayed as a crusader for robots and tends to be cold and cruel towards humans, especially those who mistreated robots. He does not listen to anything they say and does not care if he hurts anyone of them whether they are innocent or not because of all the anger that he had in the past. * AL Mechanic - A mechanic who dislikes beautiful things. He was last seen crying after Astro Boy forgives him. This character appeared only in Episode 37, \\"Astroboy Goes To School\\". However, this actor appeared in other episodes in other roles, but always as a villain. * Ali Baba - A leader of an Arabian bandit gang. Astro Boy met Ali Baba in an Arabian desert while suffering from low energy. Ali Baba gave Astro Boy his robot horse's energy enabling him minimal functionality.

One author describes the syndromes of chronic testicular pain thus: > \\"The complaint is of a squeezing deep ache in the testis like the day after > you got kicked there, often bilateral or alternating from one side to the > other, intermittent, and, most commonly, associated with lower back pain. > Sometimes it feels like the testicle is pinched in the crotch of the > underwear but trouser readjustment does not help. There may also be pain in > the inguinal area but no nausea or other symptoms. Back pain may be > concurrent or absent and some patients have a long history of low back pain. > Onset of pain is commonly related to activity that would stress the low back > such as lifting heavy objects. Other stresses that might cause low back pain > are imaginative coital positions, jogging, sitting hunched over a computer, > long car driving, or other such positions of unsupported seating posture > that flattens the normal lumbar lordosis curve.\\" Differential diagnosis * Post-vasectomy pain syndrome Diagnosis Testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be routinely performed. Treatment Treatment is often with NSAIDs and antibiotics however, this is not always effective.

It was also known as the Highland, Hebridean or Irish pig.Macdonald, J (1810), General view of the agriculture of the Hebrides, or Western Isles of Scotland, pub Richard Phillips et al, Edinburgh, p 486 Etymology \\"Grice\\" is a Scots and northern English dialect word originally meaning \\"young pig\\" (compare the Scandinavian gris, meaning \\"pig\\").Oxford English Dictionary 1933: Headword \\"Grice\\" History Accounts from the early 19th century suggest the grice was an aggressive animal with small tusks, an arched back, and a coat of stiff, dark bristles over a wiry, woollen fleece.Extinct island pig spotted again Highland examples were described as \\"a small, thin-formed animal, with bristles standing up from nose to tail...\\". Like other livestock in these areas, the grice was small and hardy, able to survive the harsh environmental conditions. Highland grice foraged for berries on moorland. Most Shetland crofts would have at least one grice kept on grazing lands, but they would often roam across adjacent farmland, rooting up crops and occasionally killing and eating newborn lambs. According to geologist Samuel Hibbert, who wrote an account of the islands in 1822, although the grice was \\"small and scrawny\\", its meat made \\"excellent hams\\" when cured. Islanders also made footballs from grice bladder, and even windowpanes from their intestines, by stretching the membrane over a wooden frame until it was sufficiently thin to allow light to pass through. The animal's bristles were used as thread for sewing leather and for making ropes. However, useful as the animals no doubt were, neighbours were constantly grumbling about the behaviour of their neighbour's grice, and the courts were empowered to confiscate particularly troublesome ones, and to impose \\"hefty fines\\" on their owners. In the 19th century, landowners discouraged the keeping of these swine (one agricultural writer commented, \\"it is voracious in the extreme, and excessively difficult to confine in pasture or to fatten; it is also destructive and mischievous, and therefore ought gradually to be extirpated\\"). This, combined with the increasing import of other breeds from the Scottish mainland, resulted in a dwindling grice population, and sometime between the middle of the 19th centuryShetland pig is not so appealing as the pony and the 1930s the breed was extinct. Note that Fetlar is one of the North Isles of Shetland. The legacy of grice remains, however. The wild bulb vernal squill is known locally as \\"grice's onions\\" because it was a favourite food of the swine. In 2006, curators at the Shetland Museum and Archives commissioned a taxidermist to recreate a grice from the stuffed body of an immature wild boar. As no one alive had seen a grice, the accuracy of the model relied on descriptions in \\"published sources ... investigated artefact and archaeological findings\\". The model grice went on public display in spring 2007. In 2020 a skull was discovered in Nesting that may be the first recorded full grice skull specimen. Some doubt has been cast over the skull's origin due to the shorter than expected length of the snout, however verification is in progress.

The Sharadamba Temple at Sringeri (Shringa giri in Sanskrit) is an 8th-century temple, founded by Sri Adi Shankaracharya. It housed a sandalwood statue of Shardamba in a standing posture, which was installed by Adi Shankarachaya until the Vijayanagara rulers and Sri Vidyaranya (12th Jagadguru) installed a seated gold statue of Sri Shardamba in the 14th century. Legend Sankara is believed to have envisioned this place as the holiest where a snake hooded as an umbrella to protect a pregnant frog from hot Sun during its labour. https://www.come2india.org/sringeri.html To commemorate this incident, a sculpture known as KAPPE SHANKARA is there on the footsteps to the river Tunga. This was the first place where Sankara is believed to have established one of the four major mutts. As per Hindu legend, the place is associated with sage Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandakamuni. He did severe penance at this place, leading to the name Sringeri. The temple was renovated during the regime of Vijayanagara Empire during the 14-16th centuries and later during 1916. Shringeri Sharada Suprabhatha The Shringeri Sharada Suprabhatha was adopted by the Shringeri matha in the late 1970s by Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha swamiji. The very famous Sree Sharada Suprabhata Stotram was composed by Veda Brahma. Turuvekere Subrahmanya Vishweshwara Dikshith (also known as Sri. T. S. Vishweshwara Dikshith) for the divine Shringeri Sharada maata (God Mother). Veda. Brahma. T. S. Vishweshwara Dikshith was born in Turuvekere, a small town in Tumkur district, and was the Sanskrit professor in Maharaja College in the Royal Kingdom of Mysore and resided at Mysore. He was the Aasthana Vidwan of Alankaara Shasthra of King Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur. Dikshith was a learned Sanskrit scholar in several Vedas (Yajur Veda in particular) and specialised in Ghana Krama -- the essence of the Vedas. He composed the Sree Srikanteshwara Suprabhata and Sree Chandramoulishwara Suprabhata of Lord Srikanteshwara of Nanjangud and Sri Chandramoulishwara temple in V. V. Mohalla, Mysore respectively along with Sree Sharada Suprabhatha of Sringeri Sharada Peetham. He was a Ghana Pathi and had mastered several shastras such as Alankara Shastra, Jyothishya Shastra (astrology), Tarka, and Vyakarana (grammar) to name a few. He received several awards and accolades from the Maharaja of Mysore and the pontiffs of Sringeri Sharada Peetham and Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam respectively for his contributions to Sanskrit literature. Significance of the Sringeri Temple It is believed that Lord Shiva gifted the crystal Chandramouleeshwara Linga to Sri Adi Shankaracharya. The Linga can still be visited and the Chandramouleeshwara Pooja is performed for the Linga every Friday night at 8:30 PM. It is believed that Goddess Sharadambika is the incarnation of Goddess Saraswati, who came to Earth as Ubhaya Bharathi. It is a common faith that by worshiping her, one can receive blessings of Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu along with Parvati, Lakshmi, and Saraswati. The ritual of Aksharabhyasa performed here is considered to be sacred and fulfilling. The parents of kids in the age of 2-5 are given a slate and chalk or alternatively, a plate of rice on which they pray to Goddess Saraswati and the Guru to impart good knowledge and education to their children. Temples in Sringeri There are over 40 temples in Sringeri. Important ones are the Malahanikareshwara Temple on a small hillock called as Mallappa Betta. This is built on Dravidian style. There is one Bhavani Temple, SthamBha Ganapati (Ganesha on the piller). One of the best example of temple architecture can be found in Sri Vidyashankara Temple which is next to Sri Sharadamba Temple. Janardhana Temple, Harihara Temple, Brindavana of past Jagadgurus at the Narasimha Vana are worth visiting.

The event is organised in order to raise funds to support the activities of the Charitable Trust Rhino Ark. The event was conceived in 1989 to raise funds for the construction of the Aberdare Electric Fence. Rhino Ark founder Ken Kuhle, Rally Enthusiasts Rob Combes and Brian Haworth mooted the idea of an off-road event to support the fencing project carried out by the recently established Charitable Trust Rhino Ark. The Trust was committed to saving the dwindling Rhino population in the Aberdare National Park, as well as mitigating human-wildlife conflicts around the National Park. On 4 February 1989, 31 competing vehicles entered the first event which was won by Travers Allison in a Suzuki jeep. Whilst the first Rhino Charge raised only KES 250,000, this amount increased tremendously over the years to reach over KES 90 million in the 2013 event.  Vision, Mission and Values  Rhino Charge 1994 Model 'A' Ford - oldest ever vehicle in Rhino Charge The vision of Rhino Charge is to mobilise the public to raise funds for Rhino Ark, the Kenyan conservation charity. For over 30 years Rhino Ark has been raising funds for the building and maintenance of an electrified fence that encircles nearly 400 km of the Aberdare ecosystem. The fence is a vital management tool for ensuring the ecosystem's long-term integrity. In 2010 Rhino Ark announced a formal commitment to support conservation of other mountain forest ecosystems in Kenya, starting with Mount Kenya and Mount Mau Eburu. These new initiatives are undertaken in addition to the long term commitment to the Aberdares. Rhino Charge 1995 The mission of Rhino Charge is to organise an annual off-road competition that consistently meets the highest standards of excellence and does not adversely impact on the environment in which the events take place. The values of Rhino Charge are Sportsmanship, Integrity and Commitment to Excellence.  History  Rhino Charge 1998 Phil Tilley and Crew wait anxiously for the start The Rhino Charge was conceived in Nairobi, Kenya when Rhino Ark founder Ken Kuhle asked Rally Enthusiast Rob Coombes whether he would organise a motorsport event to help raise funds for the Rhino Ark Kenya Charitable Trust that he had recently formed. The trust was committed to saving the dwindling Rhino population in the Aberdare National Park. The concept discussed was to hold an offroading competition whereby the winner would drive a vehicle to the highest altitude on Mount Kenya. Rob then discussed the idea with Brian Haworth who was enthusiastic and agreed to join Rob in organising it. Presentations to Kenya Wildlife Service quickly determined that the permission to hold the event on Mount Kenya would not be granted and the concept went back to the drawing board. Some years prior to this, Brian had recced a route around Mount Longonot for an off-road event at the request of Derek Gates (Safari Rally organiser). It never took place as they decided to hold a mini event at Hell's Gate National Park instead. Brian's concept was to use distance, rather than speed as the deciding factor, this was to prove the basis for what would become the Rhino Charge. Based on this experience and after much discussion, Rob and Brian decided to attempt an event to drive over Mount Suswa in the Rift Valley. Two controls would be sited on either side of the Volcano and whoever did it in the shortest distance would be the winner. One Sunday morning in early 1989 the two set off, with motor bikes, headed for the southern slopes of Mount Suswa. After an exhausting day mostly \\"carrying\\" the bikes, and still only halfway up Mount Suswa they had to head back to base, the idea wasn't going to work! They sat looking across the Suswa plains with Lake Magadi in the distance, several small hills and large luggas in the foreground. Why not put a control on the top of each hill and one at the bottom of the escarpment? The competitors would have to find their way across the luggas to get to the hills! The following weekend, prepared with camping gear, motor bikes and their families, they spent two days driving and riding around the area setting out what eventually became the venue for the first ever Rhino Charge. Thirty- one competing vehicles entered 4 February 1989 event won by Travers Allison in a Suzuki Jeep. Distance was measured with the vehicle's standard odometer. These pioneers probably had no idea of the huge interest this small event would attract in the years to come. At the core of the Rhino Charge is a highly dedicated group of individuals that comprise the Rhino Charge Committee. Over 30 years later, many of the original committee members are still deeply involved in the Charge. Rhino Charge 1999 Rob and Ken are no longer with us, while Brian is still assisting the preparation of the Rhino Charge in many ways. Their legacy is a concept that has developed into the toughest offroad event on the continent and possibly anywhere. It has gained international acclaim and attracts entries from all over the world. The Kudos of winning the Rhino Charge is highly coveted in Kenya and elsewhere. Few Kenyans are not touched by the event in some way, whether taking part, being involved in the organisation, or digging into their pockets for sponsorship. By April every year, the Rhino Charge Fever hits Kenya. Wherever you go, cars are being prepared in garages, tested on and off the road. Shops are full of camping equipment, and the words \\"where are we going this time?\\" are heard everywhere. Then, on the Madaraka Day weekend, the exodus begins, and thousands of enthusiasts head for the hills for another Rhino Charge. Rhino Charge 2003 ladies team  The Competition  Rhino Charge 2006 spectator numbers are getting bigger every year The Rhino Charge is a one-day off-road event during which a maximum of 65 competitors are required to visit 13 control points scattered over approximately 100 square kilometres of rough terrain within a 10 hours period. Supplied with a 1:50,000 scale map of the venue and the GPS coordinates of the 13 control points, each competing team decides the route they want to follow. The winner is the competitor who finishes at the control point where he started having visited all the other control points in the shortest distance (GPS measured). The Charge is a unique and exciting competition that requires bravery and a high level of skill in off-road driving and navigation. To prevent adverse environmental impacts, entries to the event are limited to 65 vehicles. Rhino Charge Pre-Charge Planning 2007 Rhino Charge 2007  Event Organisation  The Rhino Charge is organised by a committee of professional volunteers from various disciplines. Each member of this dedicated team offers his or her time, expertise and resources to ensure that the event is run successfully and to the highest standards. The event is held in a different location each year in some of the most remote and wild areas of Kenya. The preparation requires the search for a suitable venue followed by the negotiations with the resident local community and the actual event organisation. Each competition venue is designed with full participation of local community representatives and is sensitive to local considerations. This process takes many months in which the Rhino Charge Committee volunteers their time and commitment to go on Rhino Charge recces in their free time to organise the next event. Rhino Charge 2009 - tackling steep terrain The event, supported by guard post sponsors, event sponsors and raffle donors, takes place at the end of May/beginning of June each year around the Kenyan public holiday Madaraka Day and is open to all, subject to the Rules and Regulations stipulated by the organising Committee. The Committee keeps the event location secret until the day of the event. The secrecy of the location prevents people from being tempted to look at the site ahead of time. A map of the past Rhino Charge venues can be seen here. RC Action 2012 at the Gauntlet The event is organised with the approval of the local District Commissioner, the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Governing Body of Motorsport in Kenya and the land owner(s) / host community.

Fundraising Efforts  Coming up the hill Rhino Charge 2013 In order to be accepted to the event competitors are required to pledge and raise the minimum sponsorship set by the organising Committee. Most competitors, however, raise considerably more. In 2013, Car No. 5 (Alan McKittrick team) raised KES 12,098,283. Since Car No. 5 entered the Charge in 1989 till 2020, the team has raised a staggering amount of KES 161,029,688. And this is not the only team...Long-time supporters such as Sarah and the late Mike Higgins have raised a total of KES 39,604,399 over the past 20 years. From 1989 to 2019, the Rhino Charge has raised over KES 1.5 billion. In order to ensure that the funds raised by the competitors go to conservation, the Rhino Charge itself is organised mostly based on in-kind support provided by many volunteers, guard post sponsors, event sponsors and raffle donors, Since 1989, the funds raised have been used for the construction of the Aberdare Electric Fence and supporting conservation activities within the Aberdare ecosystem. With Rhino Ark formally committed to supporting conservation in Mt. Kenya and Mau Eburu ecosystems, funds raised are now used for fencing these two mountain ecosystems, in addition to maintaining the Aberdare Electric Fence and engaging fence-adjacent communities in conservation.  The Rhino Charge Raffle  The 2013 Rhino Charge Winners Team BunduFundi \\"No Bush too Thick\\" The Rhino Charge Raffle was introduced in 2002 as a tool to assist Rhino Charge entrants with fund-raising and to thank competitor sponsors for their support. The Raffle offers every donation of KES 2,000 a chance to win a prize, which is a key motivation for the public to support competing cars. The Raffle is organised by a Raffle Committee that voluntarily works towards securing generous prizes from over 100 donors.  UK Rhino Charge  A partner event, the UK Rhino Charge, is held every year in September in Sussex in the United Kingdom. The event has been held every year since 1997, however it is neither as big nor as arduous as its big brother in Kenya but it does allow all types of 4x4 and entrants from enthusiastic novices to hardened experts to enjoy a very different type of day out in the country. All funds raised go towards Rhino Ark, too. In 2017, over £5.000 were raised.  Other related Events  Other events held to raise funds for Rhino Ark are, amongst others, Rhinothon, Run A Ton and the Hog Charge (a children's mountain bike race). Hog Charge 2014  Environmental Impact  Waste Sorting Station donated by Canvas byDESIGN Waste Sorting Station 2013 - view from outside Waste Sorting Station 2013 - view from inside As a conservation organization, Rhino Ark is deeply sensitive to minimising any environmental impacts that could derive from its operations. This extends to the Rhino Charge, Rhino Ark's main fund raising event to support the conservation of Kenya's ‘water towers’. The Rhino Charge always has and always will take great care to minimise and monitor its footprint. Together with Stanbic, who have enabled independent Environmental Impact Assessments at Rhino Charge venues, it is ensured that the monitoring is comprehensive and scientifically precise. This double check, conducted to exacting standards, is welcomed by the organisers, participants and sponsors alike, not only as an assurance that the Rhino Charge does no harm but also as an insurance that any negative impact which might arise in future can be rapidly identified and remedied.http://rhinocharge.co.ke/competition/how-it-works/environmental- impact%e2%80%8b/ Mitigating the impact of the competition cars The format of the Rhino Charge was developed towards minimising the impact of the competition cars on the environment: * To prevent significant impacts the duration of the competition is limited to 10 hours and only 65 competition cars can participate in the event; * To avoid cumulative impacts from consecutive events, the Rhino Charge is organised each year in a different location; *The carbon footprint for entrants, sponsors, spectators and organisers getting to and running the event is offset each year. In 2008 Rhino Ark commissioned an environmental and social impact audit of representative samples of venues where the Rhino Charge event has been held. The venues assessed were Tassia Ranch (Mukogodo Division, Laikipia), Swuari Lagha (Wamba Division, Samburu), Ol Kinyei Group Ranch (Mara Division, Narok), and Lorongoswa Group Ranch (Kajiado). The audit was carried out by African Conservation Centre. The audit found that there were minimal impacts on the sites arising from Rhino Charge activities. Recommendations arising from the audit were incorporated into subsequent event venues and course designs. Recycling the waste generated on the venue One of the main environmental challenges of organising an event with close to 3,000 participants and spectators in the most remote wilderness areas of Kenya is the management of waste. Keeping with Rhino Ark's conservation mission, the Rhino Charge Committee is committed to leaving each venue as it was found. To this end, stringent rules have been set by the Committee to ensure that no waste is left in the entire Rhino Charge venue. This includes a fine system that is strictly implemented to address wastes by competitors. In addition, with the support of key sponsors, wastes are collected across the venue, including in the Spectator Camp and at the Gauntlet. To promote waste recycling, a Waste Sorting Station is set up at the venue. Glass, cans and tins, plastic bottles, among others, are separated and brought back to Nairobi for recycling. In the 2013 event, almost 50 cubic metres of waste were properly sorted and removed from the venue for recycling. A member of the local Ol Doinyo Nyokie community inspects the Rhino Charge waste sorting station facility Finally, comprehensive post event reviews of each event site are undertaken in collaboration with the local communities. The team aims at leaving each venue as it was found.  Awards  In 2013, the Rhino Charge received a special award for fundraising efforts towards the conservation of Kenya's water towers by the Total S.A. Eco Challenge.http://allafrica.com/stories/201307090179.html Footnotes  External links  *http://www.rhinocharge.co.ke The official Rhino Charge Website *http://www.rhinoark.org The official Rhino Ark website Category:Charities based in Kenya Category:Nature conservation in Kenya Category:Fundraising events Category:Off-roading Category:Rally raid races Category:Motorsport in Kenya ","title":"Rhino Charge"},{"id":"7982051","text":"Tarus Balog (born 1966) is an American open source advocate, software developer, commentator and blogger.

His role was to build a business around support and services for OpenNMS, as a complement to Oculan's previous channel-only approach to selling its line of OpenNMS-powered network management appliances. In 2002, Oculan discontinued work on the OpenNMS open- source project, turning its focus solely to its appliance business. Concerned that the project would die without a caretaker, Balog requested to become the new project maintainer. Giles agreed, on the condition that Balog leave Oculan the same week. Balog developed the software project further, gained customers and recruited a group of volunteer core developers while operating as Sortova Consulting Company.

It is the place of origin of the members of the Saadi Dynasty. Despite the fact that Tagmadert is indicated on most older European maps, there is some uncertainty about its exact location. According to Charles de Foucauld its location was identical to present-day Fezouata, the district directly north of the Ktawa, including the village of Tamegroute.Charles de Foucauld, Reconnaissance au Maroc, Journal de route du voyage entrepris par Charles de Foucauld au Maroc en 1883-1884. 4 vols. Paris: Challamel, 1888., p.292 (available online at http://gallica.bnf.fr/VoyagesEnAfrique/ ) \\"Au district du Ternata succède, immédiatement au-dessous de lui, celui du Fezouata, appelé aussi Tagmadart.\\" There is a description of Tagmadert by the 17th century traveller Marmol.1573, Marmol Carvajal, soldier of Spanish origin and prisoner of the Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh, travelled through the Draa River valley and described Tagmadert: \\"It is a fertile country of wheat, barley and dates and of big and small cattle\\". The confusion comes from the fact that he had previously indicated that it is a \\"town of one thousand five hundred inhabitants, on the border of Lybie, at twenty leagues (1 league=5 km) from Quiteoa (Quiteoa refers probably to Bani Hayoun in the Qtawa).\\" The distance given in that description would place Tagmadert in northern Ternata or even Tinzoulin, not far from Zaouiet Amdagh/Tamdaht. The name seems to have referred to both a district and a town. The town Tagmadert was founded in 1550 by Mohammed ash-Sheikh. It was probably destroyed during the reign of Moulay Slimane (1792–1822), possibly like Sijilmassa in 1818 by Aït Atta Berber tribes. The present village of Amezrou may have been built on its ruins. A sequia (irrigation canal) called Tagmadert still exists today in that place. Unfortunately there are no archeological records or Arabic or Berber language sources from which to deduce unequivocal conclusions about its location. The Saadi were Shurafa of Tagmadert. The first Sultan of that dynasty Mohammed ash-Sheikh was called \\"al Drawi at-Tagmadert\\". Some of the members of the Saadi Dynasty have proudly inscribed Tagmadert as their place of birth on their tombstone.Saadian funerary stele (A.D.1580) (cf. the steles of the Saadian tombs in Marrakesh) with Arabic inscription: 'This is the tomb of (..) Fatima (..) the wife of Caid Abdallah of Tamdart'. Tamdart refers to Tagmadert of the Draa valley. Also inscribed on the stele are the Quranic verses 26 and 27 of Sura 55.

Geography It covers an area of and as of 2002, it had a population of 5,723. Although the “prefix” “új”, meaning “new,\\" seems to suggest that the town is of recent creation, it probably dates as far back in history as the neighboring Szabadkigyos \\"Free Kigyos\\" (see the date on the town's Coat of Arms pictured on this page). The town experienced a great expansion after World War II The Hungarian Communist Party was consolidating its power as part of its \\"transformation socialiste de la agriculture” 1 that was imposed on the rural population. Farming families from the surrounding countryside, most of whom had once worked as tenants of the recently departed gentry, were obliged to relocate to a central district and to work the land as part of collective. As recently as the late 1960s, many former residences that had been converted to barns and storehouses were still in use by the collective. The gradual relaxation of government controls that followed the Soviet Russian invasion and subsequent repression of 1956(2) and the slow economic recovery of the 1960s brought marked improvement to the lives of the townspeople. Indoor plumbing was installed, although it was so deficient people referred to it contemptuously as “sozialisch Arbeit.\\" Masses, including wedding masses, were celebrated under official government auspices in the local Roman Catholic church. During the summer of 1968 during the annual national Táncfesztivál, Újkígyós, along with the rest of the country, was able for the first time to welcome many of the 200,000 returning expatriates who had fled the country after the aborted revolt of 1956.(3) This novelty coincided with the apogee of Alexander Dubček’s reform efforts in neighboring Czechoslovakia, the radicalism of which invited the return of the Russian military before the summer’s end on the evening of 18/19 August 1968. (4) Forty years later, the town seems to differ little in size or aspect. In fact, an aerial or satellite view of the region shows little difference from photographs taken in 19625 to showcase the success of the government’s collectivization programs. Modern amenities abound by comparison; there was only one car in Ujkidyos in 1968. But the town has grown little because many of the young people leave to seek their fortunes in the larger cities such as Szeged and Budapest. Since the Communist Party gave up its monopoly of power in 1989, privatization of collective farms has taken place. But more research is needed to shed light on the path taken by the people of Uíkígyós. Research needs to be done as to what extent the collective has continued to function as a cooperative enterprise. It also needs to be determined how much of the surrounding farmland has been deeded to private individuals or restored to previous owners. One source states unequivocally that \\"in the 1990s, the shops of the bankrupt co-operative became privatised, and the co-operative itself was split into several smaller business units. Several families are farming now as private farmers on its land given to them after a compensation movement.\\"7 Uíkígyós has enjoyed many changes since the installation of democratic government. But the photograph shown on this page of the young girl on horseback, taken in the summer of 1968, could be reproduced on the outskirts of town today (2010). The tradition of “horsemanship\\" dates back to the early days of the Magyar migration into the Carpathian basin, and it is not likely to vanish anytime soon.

Fichelscher is the son of jazz pianist and singer Toby Fichelscher. Career Daniel Fichelscher was, for most of their history, Florian Fricke's only stable partner in Popol Vuh. He wasn't a founding member, having joined in 1973 (three years after the group's foundation) for the recording of the album Seligpreisung and replaced guitarist Conny Veit the following year in 1974. While playing with Popol Vuh, he also occasionally played drums and congas with the Krautrock band Amon Düül II, appearing for example on the albums Carnival in Babylon (1972), Wolf City (1972; on which he also sang and played guitar), and Vortex (1981).

Frank Baum under the pen name \\"Edith Van Dyne.\\"\\"Edith Van Dyne,\\" Aunt Jane's Nieces, Chicago, Reilly & Britton, 1906. Since the book was the first in a series of novels designed for adolescent girls, its title was applied to the entire series of ten books, published between 1906 and 1918.Angelica Shirley Carpenter and Jean Shirley, L. Frank Baum: Royal Historian of Oz, Minneapolis, Lerner Publications, 1992; pp. 80-2 and ff. Inception The book and the series were designed to appeal to the same audience as Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and Little Men. This was expressly stipulated in Baum's contract with Reilly & Britton, which stated: :Baum shall deliver to the Reilly and Britton Co. on or before March 1, 1906 the manuscript of a book for young girls on the style of the Louisa M. Alcott stories, but not so good, the authorship to be ascribed to \\"Ida May McFarland,\\" or to \\"Ethel Lynne\\" or some other mythological female.Carpenter and Shirley, p. 80. Plot Jane Merrick is a wealthy, elderly, difficult invalid woman who is preparing for her approaching death. In her youth, she inherited her money and estate from her fiancé, Thomas Bradley, who died before their wedding took place. With no children of her own, she calls for her three teenage nieces to visit her, so she can decide who will inherit her estate. They are Louise Merrick, Elizabeth De Graf, and Patsy Doyle, children of Jane's younger brother and sisters. Louise, seventeen years old, was small when her father died after struggling and failing to succeed in business. Aunt Jane refused his request for financial assistance. He left only his life insurance money, and Louise and her mother lived cheaply on the proceeds for years. However, they developed a plan to improve their lot. They decided to spend the entire principle of their funds on a three-year spree of fancy living to gain Louise an entrance into society, with a goal of finding a suitable husband to support them. Beth, fifteen, has two parents who can barely make ends meet, living under a tightly stretched budget. Aunt Jane refused a request for money from Beth's father just the previous year, and Beth cannot even trust him with her own money. Beth is a brooding small-town beauty, given to sullenness. Sixteen-year-old Patsy manages and dotes on her Irish father after the death of her mother. Aunt Jane refused the only plea this sister ever made, for a loan to pay for medical care that might have saved her life. Patsy is a temperamental redhead who resents Aunt Jane's past neglect and determines to have nothing to do with the old woman's money. The nieces visit Aunt Jane. (Patsy resists at first, but the willful Aunt Jane sends her lawyer to fetch the girl.) The three cousins display their contrasting traits: Louise, sweet but manipulative; Beth, her bluntness tinged with bitterness; and Patsy, forthright and gifted with a natural integrity. Patsy quickly takes herself out of the running for Aunt Jane's fortune, refusing to have any part of it. Yet the old woman takes a liking to the girl, precisely for her vigor, candor, and stubbornness. Beth finds Aunt Jane distasteful, but makes friends with the servants. Louise insists on \\"nursing\\" Aunt Jane, and showers her with gushing affection that Jane finds insincere but hard to resist. Patsy, having declared she does not want the money, visits the Aunt Jane's room when she wishes, with an independence which pleases the invalid considerably. Living on the estate is Jane's dead fiancé's nephew, Kenneth Forbes, who was born long after Thomas Bradley died. As charged in the will, Jane has provided for him since his mother died eight years previously, but despises him, putting him in a room in a distant wing of the house, and never dining with him. The humiliated and neglected boy has become sullen, shy and awkward. Despite his lessons, he seems ignorant, but has nowhere else to go, as Jane will not pay for better education for him. Kenneth's only supporter is Jane's lawyer, Silas Watson, who sees glimmers of Kenneth's possibilities and tries to convince Jane to do him justice. Kenneth is beginning to show some abilities at drawing, but does not think anything of his skill. Aunt Jane has several servants, but the most unusual is James, the gardener, who loves the flowers as much as she does. He was with Thomas Bradley when he died, which traumatized him so badly that he rarely speaks. Aunt Jane is also visited in her final days by her long-lost older brother, the girls' Uncle John. He dresses shabbily, and is presumed to be down and out; his sister gives him a place to stay. Uncle John exhibits the honesty, kindness and good sense that are lacking in most of the family. He befriends everyone, including poor Kenneth, in whom he takes a genuine interest. The nieces gradually learn to accommodate themselves to their contrasting personalities. An incident electrifies the family: Beth and Louise have routinely been teasing Kenneth, causing him to flee the house via a plank stretched from the rooftop to a tree. When Patsy comes to see him about a horse, he runs for his escape, but falls off the edge. In full view of her aunt, she heroically pulls him up and saves him, but loses her balance and falls to the ground, breaking a leg. This accident brings the young people together, breaking down the barriers between them. Kenneth learns to socialize with the girls and overcome his shyness, and the nieces begin to enjoy each other's company. Kenneth receives a mysterious gift of drawing materials, and begins to show his work to the girls. However, Jane's health continues to deteriorate, and she decides to make a will leaving the bulk of the estate to Patsy. Patsy refuses, and insists Jane should leave the estate to Kenneth. After fighting over this for many days, Jane pretends to give in to Patsy, but secretly invalidates the new will. A short while later Jane passes away in the garden, and poor gardener James is the unlucky one who finds her. He runs shrieking away, to hide in his room for days. The inheritance drama comes to a head over not one last will and testament, but three. After the funeral, Silas Watson opens the envelope containing the last will, and discovers that Jane has torn off the signatures and voided it. Her previous will, leaving the estate to Patsy with token amounts to the others, comes into effect. Patsy pledges to give the estate to Kenneth when she comes of age, and to increase her cousin's cash portions. The group is suddenly called to James' room, where he lies dying after being kicked by a horse. This has shocked him into his right mind for the first time since Thomas Bradley's death years ago. He tells them about the accident, and how he drew the grievously injured man from the wreck. He explains that \\"Master Tom\\" demanded paper to make out a new will. The conductor and James both signed it to make it legal. However, the dying James does not recognize the people around him, who look so old to his now- young brain, and refuses to give them the will. He dies, and Watson and Uncle John search the room and find it. In the hasty will, Thomas bequeathed to Jane the use of his estate during her lifetime, after which it should revert to his sister and her descendants. In other words, Jane had no ability to will anything to anyone, and Kenneth is the sole rightful heir. When this is announced, the group is shocked. There are no cash bequests to anyone – the fortune is all Kenneth's. The girls decide to go home; since Uncle John seems homeless, Patsy invites him to move in with her and her father. Back in New York, Uncle John is quietly bemused by their poor apartment and his bed on the sofa. When they leave for work, he slips into an uptown banker's office where he meets with important people who treat him deferentially. After a week, Patsy receives her first surprise from an unknown benefactor – keys to a lovely furnished apartment provided free for at least three years. When they nervously visit it, they discover it has been fitted out completely, and a maid rings the bell reporting for duty, all her wages prepaid. While Patsy and her father retrieve their things from the old apartment, Uncle John makes a quick visit to Louise and her mother, who treat him coldly. He leaves, embarrassed, but in the distance Louise's banker neighbor points him out: \\"he's worth from eighty to ninety millions, at least, and controls most of the canning and tin-plate industries of America.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces, Chapter 27. Patsy is concerned about the apartment, but Uncle John says, \\"There is nothing too good for a brave, honest girl who's [sic] heart is in the right place.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces, Chapter 28. Subsequently, Patsy reports for work and is told she's been fired. When she returns home, she finds a lady waiting to tutor her, to prepare her for women's college. That afternoon, to her delight, a piano teacher arrives. In the meantime, her father is informed that his firm's bankers would like to employ him, in a job that requires very few hours and pays a generous sum. Days later, he encounters Uncle John at the bank conducting his business, and learns the truth. At home, John points out that they all assumed he was poor, and he simply did not correct them. He promises to give the use of substantial money to both of the other girls' families, which can then be left to the nieces, so that they will not be in need. Uncle John asks if he can continue to stay with Patsy and her father. She says, \\"I never meant to part with you, when I thought you poor, and I'll not desert you now that I know you're rich.\\" Criticism The novel \\"is genuinely original and interesting. It focuses on three adolescent girls, two of whom combine basic good character with ugly traits not usually found in fiction for young girls. Baum starts with a trite situation that could occasion prosy moralizing...and gives it several original twists.\\"Katherine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 139. The series The rest of the novels in the series feature travel, adventures, accidents, a kidnapping and rescue, romances, and a marriage for Louise. The final novel, Aunt Jane's Nieces in the Red Cross, was originally published in 1915, when the United States was still neutral in World War I; the nieces treat the wounded of both sides, and express the hope that the War will soon be over. The publisher issued a revised edition in 1918, with a darker treatment of the subject.Carpenter and Shirley, pp. 115-20. *Aunt Jane's Nieces, 1906 (2005) *Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, 1907The second book was printed with the mistaken date of \\"1906,\\" causing confusion in Baum's bibliography.

The first eight volumes in the series were illustrated by Emile A. Nelson, and the ninth by James McCracken. The tenth was illustrated by Norman P. Hall, who had contributed one picture to Baum's 1901 collection American Fairy Tales. (The Edith Van Dyne pseudonym was also used for other Baum works, the two Flying Girl books of 1911-12, and his Mary Louise stories of 1916-20.) Popular success In their era, the Aunt Jane's Nieces books were as successful with their target audience as the Oz books were with younger children. In 1911 the six titles then in print sold 22,569 copies.Rogers, p. 184. Indeed, toward the end of Baum's life they outsold the Oz books. (The books were popular as grammar-school graduation gifts for girls.) After the 1920s the books were largely forgotten for the rest of the century, except for Baum enthusiasts and a small but growing coterie of Baum scholars. By the turn of the 21st century, however, the trend of re-evaluation and re-publication of Baum's works reached the series: nine of the ten books were reprinted between 2005 and 2007.

He is arguably best known for being a pioneer of the Bay Area independent hip hop movement of the early 1990s as the production mind behind the group The Dereliks whose release \\"A Turn on the Wheel is Worth More than a Record Deal\\" is a highly sought recording over 15 years after its initial release. Hiatus and Return to Music DJ Hen Boogie all but vanished from the musical scene after the Dereliks release. Very limited information exists as to why the musical departure but sources speculate it being primarily to focus on his new family which included a marriage and 3 children. In 2003 DJ Hen Boogie quietly returned to the musical scene with the release of \\"Change for the Bus Ride Home\\" on Sublevel Epidemic Records which contained a collection of unreleased Dereliks songs as well as remastered outtakes from their \\"lost\\" demo tapes. Solo career In 2005 he re focused on branding his own identity away from the Dereliks with the release of \\"Nobody Beats the Boog\\" on FemaleFun Records. This release solidified him as a major break record collector and force in hip hop documenting the countless rare records that many artists have previously sampled. In 2006 DJ Hen Boogie returned to production working alongside Jeni Fujita (of Fugees fame) and with Swedish born Kissey Asplund. He also has been credited for remixes with O.U.O. (formerly Zimbabwe Legit) featuring Asheru from Unspoken Heard, CL Smooth (of Pete Rock & CL Smooth fame), and Sadat X (of Brand Nubian fame). He also has completed his debut album, A Happy Present from the Planet Earth, released May 2007 by the Eastern Developments subsidiary Easel Records. 2008 saw DJ Hen Boogie with additional production credits with spoken word artist Karen Gibson-Roc, a remix album titled \\"Time Off\\" with Chicago's Infinito 2017 on Nephew of Frank Records, remixes with Vanessa Daou, and production on Jeni Fujita's debut release \\"This Little Light of Mine...\\" on Low Self Discipline records. 2009 returned to his roots as a DJ/tastemaker/cratedigger with the highly subscribed and downloaded podcast appropriately titled \\"Nobody Beats the Boog.\\" Named after his 2005 FemaleFun records sample break CD, the podcast featured exclusives from artists from around the world. Notable appearances included interviews with singer's Czelena, Suzy Duffy, and an impromptu interview and appearance by beat maker B.O.O.K.S. One. The podcast also featured accolades from various industry friends and cohorts most notably Zelma Davis from C&C; Music Factory fame, Japanese vocalist Monday Michiru, Norway vocalist Kinny, Joy Jones, Karen Gibson-Roc and YZ. The show ended June 2010. In 2011 DJ Hen Boogie was hired as a composer for music licensing and supervision company Thwak Music. He has been tasked to compose music for several major brand commercial advertisements and television shows as a result of this partnership. In 2012 DJ Hen Boogie developed a web series that was the result of an encounter with rapper Biz Markie called #youaintgotnobeats. In the series DJ Hen Boogie, Da Hermit and Biz Markie's DJ, Cutmaster Cool V were interviewed. In 2013 DJ Hen Boogie was reportedly sued by Beats Music for copyright infringement based on the word \\"Beats.\\" DJ Hen Boogie subsequently produced a video documenting the litigation. The site youaintgotnobeats.com has since shut down speculating that a settlement occurred between Apple/Beats music and DJ Hen Boogie although no public mention or documentation currently exists.

The Ladder of Divine Ascent, or Ladder of Paradise (Κλίμαξ; Scala or Climax Paradisi), is an important ascetical treatise for monasticism in Eastern Christianity written by John Climacus in ca. AD 600 at the request of John, Abbot of Raithu, a monastery located on the shores of the Red Sea. The Scala, which obtained an immense popularity and has made its author famous in the Church, is addressed to anchorites and cenobites and treats of the means by which the highest degree of religious perfection may be attained. Divided into thirty parts, or \\"steps\\", in memory of the thirty years of the life of Christ, the Divine model of the religious, it presents a picture of all the virtues and contains a great many parables and historical touches, drawn principally from the monastic life, and exhibiting the practical application of the precepts. At the same time, as the work is mostly written in a concise, sententious form, with the aid of aphorisms, and as the reasonings are not sufficiently closely connected, it is at times somewhat obscure. This explains its having been the subject of various commentaries, even in very early times. The most ancient of the manuscripts containing the Scala is found in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris and was probably brought from Florence by Catherine de' Medici. In some of these manuscripts, the work bears the title of \\"Spiritual Tables\\" (Plakes pneumatikai).

Περί αγάπης, ελπίδος και πίστεως (Concerning the linking together of the supreme trinity among the virtues; a brief exhortation summarizing all that has said at length in this book) Scala paradisi, 1492 edition It was translated into Latin by Ambrogio the Camaldolese (Ambrosius Camaldulensis) (Venice, 1531 and 1569; Cologne, 1583, 1593, with a commentary by Denis the Carthusian; and 1601). The Greek of the Scala, with the scholia of Elias, Archbishop of Crete, and also the text of the \\"Liber ad Pastorem\\", were published by Matthæus Raderus with a Latin translation (Paris, 1633). The whole is reproduced in Patrologia Graeca, vol. 88 (Paris, 1860). Translations of the Scala have been published in Spanish by Louis of Granada (Salamanca, 1551), in Italian (Venice, 1585), in modern Greek by Maximus Margunius, Bishop of Cerigo (Venice, 1590), and in French by Arnauld d'Andilly (Paris, 1688). The last- named of these translations is preceded by a life of the saint by Le Maistre de Sacy. One translation of the Scala, La Escala Espiritual de San Juan Clímaco, became the first book printed in the Americas, in 1532. English language editions The Ladder of Paradise icon (Saint Catherine's Monastery, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt) showing monks ascending (and falling from) the ladder to Jesus The Ladder of Divine Ascent, published by Holy Transfiguration Monastery. () This edition, based on Archimandrite Lazarus Moore's translation is generally preferred over the Paulist Press edition of the Ladder—especially because of the verse numberings, which are the standard way of referencing Climacus's sayings (these are also present in older versions of Archimandrite Lazarus's translation). It contains an icon of The Ladder, many other embellishments, and is printed on high quality paper. The Paulist Press edition contains an introduction by Bishop Kallistos. *Luibheid, Colm; Russell, Norman. John Climacus: The Ladder of Divine Ascent. Paulist Press. *Mack, John. Ascending the Heights: A Layman's Guide to the Ladder of Divine Ascent. Analysis of the Iconography The Ladder of Divine Ascent derived from manuscripts of the 11th and 12th century, pictorially bringing insight to heaven from a 30 rung ladder. The strategic placement of the ladder which cuts the icon into two complementary triangles, representing heaven in the higher triangular module and earth in the lower.Nelson, Robert, S. and Kristen, M. Collins. Holy Image and Hallowed Ground: Icons From Sinai. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, 2006. The journey to the top of the ladder where Jesus reaches with open hands is rife with obstacles of sin represented by the demons with bow and arrows ready to take the souls of those who lack perseverance. The imagery is figurative in the sense that the demons represented visually in the icon are the sins that man battles with internally. In this case the monks that climb each rung with pain as they reach new heights. The act of climbing represents physical pain as well which is true of any exercise that defies gravity. In this sense the weight the monks feel is physical, mental, and spiritual. The icon shows several examples of monks that gave into temptation of sin as the demons with dark chains hoist their victims off the ladder and into hell. These battles are represented visually between the monks and their sin. Lord Nikon shows leadership through perseverance as he reaches the top rung. His inspirational position close to Christ serves as a guide to those still struggling in their journey.Nelson, Robert, S. and Kristen M. Collins. Holy Image and Hallowed Ground: Icons From Sinai. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, 2006. Between the danger of climbing the ladder is a group of brothers gathered at the lower right, arms raised in prayer to the angels above in the upper left. This represents the thoughts and prayers that cut through the battlefield giving support to those on the path to heaven by way of virtue. A life based on prayer and penance as the way to salvation is the virtue they live by. The angels above to the left represent the righteous climbing the ladder below in the same way that the holy brethren to the lower right mirror the angels above.Nelson, Robert S. and Kristen M. Collins. Holy Image and Hallowed Ground: Icons From Sinai. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, 2006. At the top of the ladder is archbishop Holy Antonios in a white robe with golden trim embracing the invitation to heaven with God. The white robe that archbishop Antonios wears is of silk with gold cuffs or “epimanikia” and a sash or “epitrachelion” that distinguishes himself from the others on the ascent. The imperial status held by archbishop Antonios implies a close relation to the icon itself. A symbol of his prominence within the religious community. His hands are lifted openly to mirror the grace Christ has given him. Lord Nikon is in front of the archbishop and leads the same hand gesture. Many inscriptions state that Lord Nikon has been “made one with God.” The icon has been venerated with Lord Nikon in mind as much as archbishop Antonios. According to Hans Belting it is not known if archbishop Antonios came from the capital of Sinai or was even an archbishop.Evans, Helen, C. and William D. Wixom. The Glory of Byzantium: Art and Culture of the Middle Byzantine Era A.D. 843-1261. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1997. Those that suggest he was the archbishop include Doula Mouriki for one. This controversy remains today over the imperial patronage of the icon. Arabic Translation The Heavenly Ladder was translated as an icon for the Arabic speaking religious community probably at Sinai’s Saint Catherine's monastery.Nelson, Robert S. and Kristen M. Collins. Holy Image and Hallowed Ground: Icons From Sinai. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, 2006. John Climacus leads his people through text on the left side of the page to show the Greek tradition instead of the text from the right like the Arabic tradition. He doesn’t sit on the floor like the Muslims but rather at a desk. This is complemented with a smaller adaptation of the icon. The reproduction shows Christ leading the pious to heaven from a ladder that cuts the icon from bottom right to upper left in ascending fashion. This is the opposite of the original icon of the late 12th century. This 17th century Arabic icon is colorful with its imagery. Moses is depicted kneeling before the burning bush at the right. The virgin Mary and Christ child are illuminated inside the tear shaped flame. John Climacus is seen at the lower left with fellow monks at St. Catherine. At the base of the ladder a monk falling to hell maintains footing on the ladder as St. John Climacus assists by grabbing hold of the demon.

History Feyenoord's chairman Jorien van den Herik was given permission for the opening of Feyenoord's own football academy in the Ghanaian settlement of Gomoa Fetteh, just outside the capital Accra. The go-ahead was given by the Chief of Fetteh in 1998 and the academy was opened in October 1999. At the academy, young talented African footballers could work on their football skills. In addition to helping their football potential the students were provided with formal education which was funded by Feyenoord. The idea for Feyenoord’s own football academy was formed in Abidjan. Van den Herik signed the then still unknown Bonaventure Kalou and got into contact with the education institute at Kalou's club. That same year the head of the education institute flew to Africa to take stock of the project and returned with a praising report. In January 1998, Feyenoord started its own Football School in Africa. Former Feyenoord player Mohammed Abubakari was the first player that graduated from the academy and achieved a professional contract at Feyenoord. Before Abubakari's move, Jordan Opoku spent some time at Excelsior and Antwerp before returning to Ghana. In the buildup to the 2008–09 season, right-back Harrison Afful went on trial with Feyenoord, but was not offered a contract.

Founded in 1988 the trust responded to the grave crisis facing Kenya’s Black Rhino population in the Aberdare ecosystem (see also Aberdare National Park). The Rhino were under severe threat from rampant poaching for their highly valued horn. Rhino Ark’s initial aim was to build a fence along sections of the Aberdare National Park on its Eastern Salient where rhino were being mercilessly poached. The Salient borders directly onto farming land. Wildlife was able to maraud at night into the farms bordering the park, destroying crops, creating fear and loss of both revenue and on occasions, lives. This situation fuelled an already volatile community which saw no value in protecting either the wildlife or the forest habitat. Poachers had easy access. Rhino Ark’s formation was specifically to assist the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to finance a protective fence around the Salient area which has the highest concentration of wildlife in the Aberdares. The initial project idea subsequently evolved into a much more ambitious task of encircling the entire Aberdare Conservation Area with a game proof fence. The fence, strong enough to resist elephant pressure, is powered by electricity to keep wildlife within and curb illegal log extraction, snaring, poaching of wildlife (especially rhino and the rare and elusive bongo) from without. The fence construction work started in 1989 and completed on 28 August 2009.Daily Nation, August 29, 2009: Fencing of Aberdares completed On 12 March 2010 the fence was formally commissioned by the former President of the Republic of Kenya, Hon. Mwai Kibaki. Construction of the fence has brought harmony between wildlife and farmers around the Aberdare Conservation Area. The farmers now enjoy peaceful sleep at night without fear of land, crop and house destruction. Over the years, Rhino Ark’s work has evolved towards seeking sustainable, long term solutions to the conservation challenges facing mountain forest ecosystems, and other areas of important biodiversity under threat. In December 2010, Rhino Ark announced its formal commitment to supporting conservation of other mountain forest ecosystems. The initial areas of focus are Mount Kenya and Mau Mount Eburu. In order to secure the long-term management of the fence, the Aberdare Trust was launched on 11 May 2012 by the Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga, former Prime Minister of the Republic of Kenya. The Trust is a public-private partnership with strong 'Participatory Management' by communities that will manage the fence and ensure that the objectives of the fence are met, through among others, properly implemented gate management and access policy. The Trust is intended to be a role model to be replicated in the other montane forest ecosystems. Together with other Kenyan conservancies, like the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Rhino Ark shares and develops best practices for the management of electric fences.  Mission & Objectives  Rhino Ark seeks solutions in the mountain range ecosystems of Kenya and for the benefit of Eastern Africa generally to: * Conserve such ecologically precious indigenous forests and their provision of vital environmental services; * Create a sustainable and harmonious environment that enables people and wildlife, including all flora and fauna, to coexist; * Create and provide sustainable programmes for forest edge communities based on payments for ecosystem services. Such programmes and projects will be tailored to create income generation for the communities that support the conservation of natural resources; * Mobilize stakeholders nationwide and internationally for initiatives to protect and conserve the habitat and promote managed use of forest products for the benefit of present and future generations; * Raise funds and other forms of support to develop sound management processes over entire eco-systems. * Create frameworks where wider society and forest edge communities become involved in the management processes through public-private partnerships; * Build mechanisms and management structures to prevent illegal exploitation of the forest habitat wherever it is threatened. In so doing all stakeholders will benefit and the flora and fauna, particularly endangered species, will be better secured. Rhino Ark's conservation work is anchored in three key values: * Protecting ecosystem integrity; * Ensuring full involvement of and participation by local communities; * Forming effective partnerships The overall approach is embodied in the philosophy HUMANS IN HARMONY WITH HABITAT AND WILDLIFE, and propagated though effective partnerships with stakeholders.  History of the Aberdare Fence  The Aberdares are vital to Kenya - a unique montane forest ecosystem in a country where just over two percent of land is still covered by closed canopy forest. Spanning of 160 km just north of Nairobi, the Aberdares provide invaluable services in support of the nation's economic development, human well-being and long-term environmental stability.  Impact of 20 years of conservation  In September 2011, Rhino Ark commissioned an independent study to assess the full impact of 20 years of conservation efforts in the Aberdares. The study's objectives were also to guide the future management of the Aberdare fence, as well as to provide an in-depth review of fencing as a tool to help sustainably manage a conservation area adjoining settlements, such as the Aberdare but als Mt. Kenya and other main water towers. The Environmental, Social and Economic Assessment of the Fencing of the Aberdare Conservation Area was funded by the Rhino Ark, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Kenya Forests Working Group and supported by the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Kenya Forest Service and the Green Belt Movement. The full report can be downloaded here: Aberdare Fence Assessment 2011  Importance of Kenya's Water Towers  Most of Kenya's forests are in mountain areas, in particular Mt. Kenya, Aberdares, Mau Complex, Cherangani Hills and Mount Elgon. These are known as the water towers of Kenya as they form the upper catchment of all but one of the main rivers in Kenya. Although these water towers cover less than 2% of the total land area in Kenya, they provide invaluable services to Kenya's inhabitants, economy and wildlife. They also support transboundary water bodies, underlining their regional and international importance.  Conserving Mount Eburu  The Eburu Forest Reserve comprises 8,715.3 hectares of prime indigenous forest area contained within the steep hills, deep valleys and rolling foothills of Mt. Eburu. In December 2010, Rhino Ark made a formal commitment to support the conservation of the Eburu ecosystem, with the construction of a comprehensive electric fence around the entire protected forest at the core of this support.  Conserving Mount Kenya  Mount Kenya, Africa's second highest mountain and Kenya's highest, sits on the equator - 180 km north of the capital Nairobi. The purpose of the Mt. Kenya Electric Fence, which will stretch 450 km in length, is to bring harmony between nature and the forest adjacent communities and to protect a natural asset of critical importance that supports economic development at national and local levels.  Public-Private Partnerships Cooperation between the public and private sectors is playing a vital role in the success of Rhino Ark's fencing projects. Rhino Ark builds relationships with local communities, private individuals and corporations along the Government of Kenya, Kenya Wildlife Service and Kenya Forest Service that help preserve Kenya's vital ecosystems and water towers. The Government of Kenya has provided funds for both the building of the Mount Kenya and Mau Mt. Eburu fences and is supporting the maintenance of the Aberdare fence through the establishment of the Aberdare Trust. Public-Private Partnerships are also crucial in the governance, implementation and monitoring of the fencing projects. Rhino Ark received the support of the Safaricom Foundation in 2012 when the Foundation granted the Trust KES 155 Million to assist a four-year conservation project of the Mau Eburu Forest and its wider ecosystem. The Safaricom Foundation was established in August 2003 and is a registered charity funded by Safaricom Limited and the Vodafone Group Foundation. The Foundation provides a formal process for charitable contributions to communities, community groups and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in Kenya who are key partners in responding to social and economic development issues in the country. In 2013, Rhino Ark signed a partnership MoU with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The MoU provides the framework for the collaboration in the area of conservation-based community forest livelihood initiatives; access to, and sustainable management of water resources; access to sustainable energy sources; community conservation education and awareness activities.  The Fundraising Event Rhino Charge  The Rhino Charge was conceived in 1989 to raise funds for the construction of the Aberdare Electric Fence. Rhino Ark founder Ken Kuhle, Rally Enthusiast Rob Combes and Brian Haworth mooted the idea of an off-road motorsport event to support the fencing project carried out by the recently established Rhino Ark Charitable Trust. On 4 February 1989, 31 competing vehicles entered the first event which was won by Travers Allison in a Suzuki jeep. Whilst the first Rhino Charge raised only KES 250,000, this amount increased tremendously over the years to reach over KES 90 Million (over USD 1 Million) in the 2013 event. A partner event, the UK Rhino Charge, is held every year in September in Pippingford Park, East Sussex in the United Kingdom. The event has been held every year since 1997, however it is neither as big nor as arduous as its big brother in Kenya but it does allow all types of 4x4 and entrants from enthusiastic novices to hardened experts to enjoy a very different type of day out in the country. All funds raised go towards Rhino Ark. In 2013, over £7.000 were raised.  Awards  Rhino Ark has received numerous awards by the Total S.A. Eco Challenge: * 2006 Special Award - for the special outreach programmes for tree nurseries for fence line communities; * 2009 Special Award - for conservation work specifically in the Aberdare ecosystem; * 2012 Special Award - for most exceptional and sustained commitment to conservation. * 2013 Special Award - for fundraising efforts towards the conservation of Kenya’s water towershttp://allafrica.com/stories/201307090179.html In 2013, the Facebook page of the Fundraising Event Rhino Charge was nominated for the OLX Kenya Social Media Awards in the category Best Use of Social Media - Corporate Responsibility.

New Qurna was designed and built in the late 1940s and early 1950s by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy to house people living in Qurna which is now uninhabited. New Qurna was added to the 2010 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites to bring attention to the site's importance to modern town planning and vernacular architecture due to the loss of much of the original form of the village since it was built. Historical use of the name Qurna The name Kurna signifies \\"a promontory\\" or \\"a point of a mountain\\".Edward William Lane, Description of Egypt - notes and views made during the years 1825-1828, The American University in Cairo Press, 2000 Émile Amélineau identifies it with ancient Pekolol (). The name Gourna is first mentioned by Protais and Charles François d'Orléans, two Capuchin missionary brothers travelling in Upper Egypt in 1668. Protais’ writing about their travel was published by Melchisédech Thévenot (Relations de divers voyages curieux, 1670s-1696 editions) and Johann Michael Vansleb (The Present State of Egypt, 1678). References to Qurna, Gurna, Kournou, Gourna, El-Ckoor’neh, Gourne, el Abouab, El-Goor’neh or many other variants in pre-1940s literature refers to a spread out urban sprawl of housings stretching from approximately the Ramesseum (Mortuary Temple of Ramesses II) to the Mortuary Temple of Seti I on the east side of the Theban Hills, including the current place names of Sheikh ‘Adb el-Qurna, el-Assasif, el- Khokha, Dra ’Abu el-Nage’ and Qurna. During the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, visitors and travelers to the area are rarely consistent in their use of the name and anything between Medinet Habu and the tombs of el-Tarif can at times be found referred to as part of a Qurna community. A reference to the \\"Temple of Gourna\\" or similar, is in most cases a reference to the Ramesseum, to a lesser degree the Temple of Seti I and rarely it is a reference to the all but destroyed Mortuary temples of Ramesses IV, Thutmose III or Thutmose IV.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London =New Qurna (or New Gourna)= Street in New Gourna Theater architectural drawing by Hassan Fathy New Qurna was built between 1946 and 1952 by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy midway between the Colossi of Memnon and el-Gezira on the Nile on the main road to the Theban Necropolis to house the residents of the Qurna. The design, which combined traditional materials and techniques with modern principles was never completed and much of the fabric of the village has since been lost; all what remains today of the original New Qurna is the mosque, market and a few houses. UNESCO World Heritage conservation wishes to safeguard this important architectural site. The World Monuments Fund included New Qurna in the 2010 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. =Qurna (or Old Gourna)= Temple of Seti I at Qurna. Qurna is an abandoned village about 100m to the east of the Temple of Seti I. Until the early 19th century the community included at least parts of the Temple of Seti I. Several travellers, including Richard Pococke or Sonnini de Manoncourt even name a Sheikh of Qurna.Richard Pococke, A Description of the East and Some other Countries, Vol.I: Observations on Egypt, W. Boyer, London, 1743Charles- Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt, Voyage dans la haute et basse Egypte, F. Buisson, Paris, an VII (1798) 4 vol. Edward William Lane relates in 1825 that the village was abandoned and not a single inhabitant lived there. Comments by Isabella Frances RomerIsabella Frances Romer, A Pilgrimage to the Temples and Tombs of Egypt, Nubia, and Palestine in 1845-46, Richard Bentley, London, 1846 2 vol. suggests that the resettling started in the late 1840s. Hassan Fathy alleges that the inhabitants of Qurna lived in poverty and thus were robbing ancient tombs as means of subsistence. In order to stop the looting the Department of Antiquities expropriated the land on which the Qurnis lived and decided to move them to a new settlement, to be designed and built by Hassan Fathy himself.Hassan Fathy, Architecture for the Poor, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London 1973, p.14ff New Qurna was built in the 1940s and early 1950 to house the then residents who strongly resisted the move. =Sheikh ‘Adb el-Qurna= A series of housing built in and around the mountain grottoes located about 200m north of the Ramesseum at Sheikh ‘Adb el-Qurna. The stretch of land has been the bitter battlefield between the original owners and the Egyptian government for the last 60 years, because it lay on top of an archeological area, part of the Tombs of the Nobles. Edward William Lane relates that the residents moved into these grottoes from the village of Qurna, which they abandoned, when the Mamluks retreated thought the area, following their defeat by Muhammad 'Alī's forces in the early 19th century.

He is primarily remembered for his studies of psychiatric conditions arising from damage to the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia.  Academic career  He was a native of Saaz, Bohemia, and in 1882 received his medical doctorate at Prague. In 1887 he traveled to Vienna in order to work with Theodor Meynert (1833–1892), who was to become an important influence to Anton's medical career. In 1891 he moved to Innsbruck, where he served as an associate professor of psychiatry and director of the university clinic. Later (1894), he relocated to the University of Graz as a full professor of psychiatry, and in 1905 succeeded Karl Wernicke (1848–1905) at the University of Halle.  Contributions  Anton is remembered for his pioneer contributions in the field of neurosurgery. In collaboration with surgeons Friedrich Gustav von Bramann (1854–1913) and Viktor Schmieden (1874–1945), he proposed new procedures for treatment of hydrocephalus. These included the \\"Balkenstich method\\" and the \\"suboccipital puncture\\".Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry 2005 Gabriel Anton’s (1858–1933) contribution to the history of neurosurgery Along with neurologist Joseph Babinski (1857–1932), the Anton–Babinski syndrome is named. Anton provided a detailed description and explanation of visual anosognosia and asomatoagnosia associated with the disorder.NCBI: Considerations on the work of the neuropsychiatrist Gabriel Anton (1858–1933) Asomatoagnosia is a rare phenomenon where a patient is in denial of a body part. With Paul Ferdinand Schilder (1886–1940), he performed investigations of movements in patients suffering from chorea and athetosis. In his research of chorea, he identified scars in the lenticular nuclei.

This device exceeds the accuracy of other current comparators around several orders of magnitude and is used in electrical metrology for highly precise comparative measurements of electric resistances or for the amplification and measurement of extremely small electric currents. The CCC principle goes back on Harvey and is based substantially on the properties of superconductors. CCCs make use of macroscopic quantum effects that occur in superconducting materials or circuits underneath their critical temperature of typically a few kelvins. The term “Cryogenic Current Comparator” stems from κρυος (Gr. frost, ice) and comparare (Lat. compare). The two quantum effects used in a CCC are the ideal diamagnetism of the superconductor, caused by the Meissner effect, and the macroscopic quantum interference of currents in a superconducting quantum sensor. For the comparison of two currents these are fed through two wires which are led through a superconducting tube. The Meissner effect induces a screening current on the inner surface of the tube, flowing opposite to and being exactly as large as the sum of the currents inside the tube. Thus, this shielding current exactly cancels the magnetic field inside the tube produced by the currents in the wires. The screening current flows back across the outer surface of the tube, giving rise to a magnetic field in the room outside of the tube. This field is detected by a highly sensitive magnetometer, acting as a null detector. The signal of this null detector thus is a measure for the equality of the currents; in particular it is zero if the two currents are of exactly equal magnitude. The important and crucial point characterizing the CCC is the fact that the magnitude of the screening current and its distribution on the surface of the superconducting screen are independent of the position and the path of the wires inside the tube. Typical for a CCC is the use of a SQUID magnetometer as null detector for the magnetic field (SQUID = Superconducting Quantum Interference Device). These are capable of detecting extremely small changes of the magnetic field corresponding to fractions of the magnetic flux quantum = h/2e ≈ 2×10−15 V·s (h is Planck's constant and e the elementary charge). The function principle of a SQUID is based on macroscopic quantum interferences of electric currents, arising in superconducting circuits (loops) with tunnel junctions. Resistance bridges based on CCCs are used for the comparison of electrical resistances, in particular if highest-precision measurements are required, as there is the traceability of the resistance unit to the quantum Hall effect (QHE). In this way, measurements connecting standard resistors ranging within 1 ohm up to 10 kΩ to a QHE resistor of 12.9 kΩ are performed at several national institutes of metrology as, for instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) or the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, D). Here, electrical resistance comparisons using CCCs are accomplished with relative measurement uncertainties of only about 10−9.

It has long since been covered over and put underground by the urbanisation of the area. History Originally this was an open stream that was one of the tributaries of the Waitemata River, now submerged by rising sea levels in the Waitematā Harbour. The Waihorotiu carved out the Queen Street valley millions of years ago. The upper part of that valley now forms Myers Park. The references to a spring feeding the stream in the area of the Baptist Tabernacle in Myers Park are problematic (no historical document references this and if a spring existed it is unlikely it would have been built over). The stream ran through a swampy area (now Aotea Square) and then northwards between Queen and Elliot Streets until the vicinity of Victoria Street, where, emerging behind the Courthouse, it flowed down into what is now the lower part of Queen Street. It entered the harbour at what is now called Fort Street but in the early colonial period was called Fore Street, a shortened form of Foreshore. The lower reaches of the stream above the Fort Street will have been tidal; doubtless pre-European Maori fished in this area. The swampy area now occupied by Aotea Square was probably used to trap birds and possibly eels. A side tributary (occupying the gully between Wellesley and Airedale Streets) possibly provided drinking water for both Maori villages and the first European colonists of Auckland, although the still existing Spring just to the north of Waterloo Quadrant (later utilised by the Grey & Menzies Mineral Water Company) may have been preferred as more reliable.Britomart location and heritage (Britomart Project History, Auckland City Council website. Retrieved 2007-12-01) The stream flowed into Horotiu Bay (called Commercial Bay after European settlement). In Maori mythology, the stream is the home of Horotiu, a taniwha (roughly speaking, a local nature spirit). Initially European settlement of the central area tended to be on the Shortland Street rise and the Albert Park Hill area. However, as the population grew the Queen Street valley began to fill up with buildings, partly due to a big fire in the Shortland Street area. An open stream in the centre of the road created problems especially in a period before any sewerage system was in operation. The sides of the stream crumbled in wet weather and there were only a few place to cross (sometimes just plank walkways). Periodically people and carriages tumbled into what had become little more than an open sewer. Around the middle of the century the Surveyor General Charles Ligar attempted to regulate the stream by building sound walls to constrict its waters (this was referred to as the Ligar Canal).Auckland WaterPark - Bradbury, Matthew; abstract, The Landscape Architect, IFLA Conference Papers, May 2006 This proved inadequate (being called \\"an abomination, a pestiferous ditch, and the receptacle of every imaginable filth\\")\\"Ligar canal long forgotten\\". Auckland's City Scene magazine, Sunday 25 June 2006 (originally from The New Zealand Herald, approximately 1870) and eventually the stream was bricked over in the form of a sewer - water percolating through the soil under Myers Park still runs into the old drain under Queen Street to the sea, discharging under the Ferry Building. In 2011, a local artist proposed that, as part of the Council's city centre masterplan, the stream be uncovered and become a centrepiece of a more people-friendly inner city.

History In 1896, residents of Rockingham petitioned to establish a road board, which they proposed be called \\"Clarence\\" which was the name of the failed settlement of Thomas Peel at Woodman Point. The area at the time fell within the responsibility of the Fremantle District Road Board. The name \\"Clarence\\" was declined by the Department of Lands and Surveys,Draper, Richard Rockingham – The Visions Unfold. City of Rockingham. 1997. and the Rockingham Road District was gazetted on 4 February 1897. The agricultural hall on the corner of Flinders Lane and Kent Street in Rockingham was used for the Roads Board's administration until an office was constructed for the Roads Board on the corner of Office Road and Mandurah Road in East Rockingham in 1905. In 1929 the Board resolved to relocate the administration to Rockingham Beach and the various buildings, including the Agricultural Hall and the vacated Rockingham Beach Primary School building on Kent Street, were used as the Board's offices. A new office was constructed for the Roads Board in 1946 on the corner of Flinders Lane and Kent Street. In February 1954 the Kwinana Road District was formed from the northern portion of the Rockingham Road District. On 1 July 1961, the Road District became the Shire of Rockingham following enactment of the Local Government Act 1960.WA Electoral Commission, Municipality Boundary Amendments Register (release 3.0), 31 May 2007. In 1971, the Shire relocated to new offices on Council Avenue on land donated by developers Rockingham Park Pty Ltd 2 km southeast of the traditional centre of Rockingham Beach, which was to become the new major centre of Rockingham and Kwinana. The Rockingham City Shopping Centre opened in the new centre in 1971. Despite the move to the new \\"city centre,\\" the community apparently considered Rockingham Beach to be the rightful civic heart of Rockingham, as evidenced by the Shire's decision to construct Flinders Hall on Flinders Lane, despite the new Council offices being constructed in the same year. The Rockingham council chambers On 12 November 1988 the Council attained City status. In 1994, the City relocated to new Council chambers and civic centre on Civic Boulevard.Rockingham Municipal Heritage Inventory Palassis Architects, April 2008 p.22 In 2008, the Council adopted a plan for the Rockingham Strategic Regional (or Primary) Centre which incorporated both the traditional centre at Rockingham Beach and the \\"City Centre\\" of the 1970s into a larger, encompassing centre. The plan seeks to increase the residential population within this new city centre envelope from 12,000 to 36,000 through the provision of transit-oriented development, which would in turn support the operation of light rail between the Rockingham Train Station and Rockingham Beach.Rockingham Strategic Regional Centre Wards The city has been divided into four wards.

It is widely regarded as one of the world's first best-sellers – partly due to an upheaval in the system British libraries used to purchase their books, and partly due to its popular appeal. Roundly condemned by contemporary literary critics for Corelli's moralistic and prosaic style, Brian Stableford, \\"Corelli, Marie\\" in St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers, ed. David Pringle, London, St. James Press, 1996, , (p. 129-31). it nonetheless had strong supporters, including Oscar Wilde and various members of royalty. Widely ignored in literary circles, it is increasingly regarded as an influential fin de siècle text. The book is occasionally subtitled \\"Or the Strange Experience of One Geoffrey Tempest, Millionaire\\". Plot summary On the surface the plot follows the story of a penniless, starving author called Geoffrey Tempest. So poor that he is behind on his rent and can barely afford light in his room, he receives three letters. The first is from a friend in Australia who has made his fortune and offers to introduce him to a good friend who might be able to lift him from poverty. The second is a note from a solicitor detailing that he has inherited a fortune from a deceased relative. The third is a letter of introduction from a foreign aristocrat called Lucio, who befriends him and proceeds to be his guide in how best to use his newfound wealth. Tempest remains blissfully unaware throughout the novel, despite warnings from people he meets, that Lucio is the earthly incarnation of the Devil. Over the course of the book, his wealth leads to misery. Eventually, when confronted with the true nature of his companion, he renounces evil and returns to society penniless but content with the chance to purify his soul. Although the plot follows Tempest's fall from grace and subsequent redemption, he is in many regards a secondary character to Lucio. Both the title of the work and much of its philosophical content relate to the supreme yearning within Satan to achieve salvation. The book's main contribution to Faustian literature is the introduction of the concept that above all other people it is Satan who most truly believes in the Gospel – and yet he is forbidden ever to partake of it. Major themes The novel is notable for its attempts to mix Christian thought with popular heterodox themes of the day, such as reincarnation and Theosophy or Blavatskyism. It is also a damning critique of the time's social structure – claiming both that Britain's elite are morally bankrupt and hinting an allegiance to ideals that soon gained in prominence after its publication (such as women's suffrage and the universal welfare state). It also touches on other issues, from the nature of appearance versus reality to the role of poverty in fostering true talent. Corelli is particularly scathing of literary critics (perhaps accounting for their dislike of the work) judging that the only true measure of a book's success is whether common people will buy and read it. Critical reception Horror critic R. S. Hadji placed The Sorrows of Satan at number one in his list of the worst horror novels ever written.R. S. Hadji, \\"13 Worst Stinkers of the Weird\\", in Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine, July–August 1983. TZ Publications, Inc. (pp. 86–87). Brian Stableford, discussing Corelli's \\"narcissistic\\" novels, described The Sorrows of Satan thus: \\"as delusions of grandeur and expressions of devout wish-fulfilment go, the fascination of the Devil was an unsurpassable masterstroke\\".

WYDA is broadcast to Dayton, its northern suburbs and the Upper Miami Valley region of Miami, Clark, Shelby, Champaign, Darke and surrounding counties in West Central Ohio with local offices are located on south Main in Dayton. History Originally WTRJ, which first signed-on with Satellite Music Network programming in the summer of 1991, then later switching from Adult Contemporary to gospel music. It was purchased in 1996 by Dayton-based Hawes-Saunders Broadcasting becoming WRNB, which continued satellite programming services using ABC Radio's \\"Solid Gold Soul\\" format as a sister to WROU-FM \\"U-92\\" licensed to West Carrollton. WRNB also aired the Tom Joyner Morning Show from ABC Radio. Financial difficulties forced Hawes-Saunders to sell WROU to Radio One and the Troy station WRNB to EMF Broadcasting in 2003 now airing K-LOVE programming as WOKL. In 2007, WOKL began low-power simulcasting on translators W231AZ 94.1 MHz northeast of Sidney, W244BR 96.7 in Springfield, and W269BP 101.7 MHz in Richmond, Indiana. (See complete list of translators below.) K-LOVE programming is also heard on WKLN 102.3 in Wilmington (the former WSWO-FM) serving the south Dayton and northern Cincinnati suburbs as well as WNLT 104.3 licensed to Harrison serving Fairfield and metropolitan Cincinnati. In addition, WOAR 88.3 located in the eastern Clark County community of South Vienna(And a translator in the SW Clark County village of Enon at 103.3) aired K-LOVE programming, but has since switched and now airs Air One Christian programming for Springfield, London, Urbana, Mechanicsburg, Marysville and Grove City as well as Fairborn, Medway, Donnelsville, and Yellow Springs. WVSO was formerly an affiliate of American Family Radio. The WSWO-LP calls have moved to a low power FM station in Huber Heights, Ohio with the WRNB calls transplanted to an FM station in the Philadelphia market which is also owned by Radio One. WOKL switches to Air 1 According to posts on the Cincinnati boards at Radio Discussions dot com, WOKL switched affiliation from K-LOVE to Air 1 during the week of December 3, 2012. This move was made after the transmitting tower of 30,000-watt WKCD (formerly WCDR 90.3 MHz in Cedarville) was moved from Cedarville to a new site in Dayton. Up to this point, Air-1 programming was heard on an FM translator at 88.3 MHz in South Vienna in eastern Clark County, Ohio. It has been speculated that the current translators of WOKL would follow suit in broadcasting the programming of Air 1. The WKCD (former WCDR) translator at 98.1 FM in Sidney has been sold to Muzzy Broadcasting, owners of WPTW in Piqua. On December 3, 2012, the station changed its call sign to the current WYDA.

The only proof offered for such an identification is a note appended to the manuscript of the letter to the effect that \\"the author afterward became a Christian\\". This note, not in another manuscript (\\"Cat. Leyden\\", pp. 276, 354), was probably added by a later copyist who was misled by the similarity of the names (see Joshua ben Joseph ibn Vives al-Lorqui). Joshua ha-Lorki was baptized before Vicente Ferrer delivered his proselytizing sermons in Lorca. Although not a rabbi, as Spanish chroniclers claim, he was well versed in the Talmud and in rabbinical literature. In order to show his zeal for the new faith he tried to win over to Christianity his former co-believers, and to throw suspicion on them and on their religion. For that reason he was called \\"megaddef\\" (\\"the blasphemer\\"), from the initial letters of his name, Maestro Geronimo de Santa Fé. He offered to prove from the Talmud that the Messiah had already come in the person of Jesus. For this purpose he induced Antipope Benedict XIII, whose physician he was, to arrange the Disputation of Tortosa with learned Jews. Either before or after the debate Hieronymus, at the request of Pope Benedict XIII, wrote two articles in which he heaped up accusations against the Jews and repeated old, apparently slanderous charges. One of these articles was Tractatus Contra Perfidiam Judæorum; the other, De Judæis Erroribus ex Talmuth; they were published together as Hebræomastix (Zurich, 1552; Frankfurt am Main, 1602; Hamburg, n. d.), printed in the Bibliotheca Magna Veterum Patrum, Lyons, vol. xxvi., and Cologne, 1618; they were also translated into Spanish under the title Azote de los Hebreos. Articles in response were written by Don Vidal Benveniste, with the title \\"Ḳodesh ha-Ḳodashim\\", and by Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus in his \\"Tokaḥat Mat'eh\\". Hieronymus had several sons. One of them, Pedro, was in special favor with Queen Maria. Another was assessor for the governor of Aragon and lived in Saragossa; this son of the \\"apostle of Tortosa\\", as De los Rios calls him (\\"Hist.\\" iii. 264), took part in the assassination of Pedro de Arbués, was arrested with other Marranos, and, in order to escape the disgrace of being publicly burned, killed himself in prison. His body was burned publicly on October 21–22, 1486. Other members of the Santa Fe family were burned as marranos in 1497 and 1499.

It is considered in danger of extinction.  Characteristics  Belgian Reds are primarily solid red with potentially a few white patches on head, dewlap, underline and legs, and udder or scrotum. They are generally long, large and heavy animals. This breed is primarily a dual purpose breed, being raised for both meat and milk. However, after 1980's selection for two separate strains (meat and milk or dual-purpose) were created by the breeders of this breed. * Bulls generally weigh 1,200 kg (~2200 lb) and are 153 cm (5 ft) tall at shoulder * Cow generally weigh 700 kg (~1500 lb) and are 138 cm (4.5 ft) tall at shoulder  Performance  The milk performance of cows in 2004 was about 5,000 kg milk with 4.27% milk fat content and 3.43% protein.  History and extension  The breed's original region is Flanders of France and West Flanders of Belgium. In the 19th century the new breed was developed out of the local breeds, Cassel and Veurne-Ambacht of the region. These original breeds nearly came into extinction during World War I in Belgium. After the war, the breeders came together in cooperation to form a new breed. In 1920 the first stud book was introduced. In 1986 there were still about 50,000 Belgian Red cattle left in the region, but the population decreased rapidly. In 2001 there were recorded to be less than 100 of the cattle left in the world.

The Azaps were also known as \\"the bachelors\\", they were volunteers who were paid only during campaigns and had the freedom to leave the army whenever they wanted. The Azaps were initially only Anatolian Turks, though by the late 16th century any Muslim from an Ottoman province could enlist as an Azap. The main role of Azaps was fighting as infantry archers, although they were often mounted as well. In addition to jobs in the military many also had jobs as guards. As volunteers the Azaps had a wide range of weaponry. These include pole arms, such as the tirpan and harba as well as balta (halberd). In addition to pole arms they were armed with a variety of maces, bows, sabers and to a rarer extent crossbows. Later on guns were adopted instead. Reforms The power and significance of the Azaps began to deteriorate as time went on. Despite once seen as rivals to the elite Janissary Ocak, by the 16th they were responsible for taking on smaller tasks such as carrying ammunition and sapping the enemy walls. In the late 16th century all Muslim men could enlist. From every 20-30 households 1 man would join whilst the others supported him. The standard weaponry of an Azap of this era was a matchlock and a sabre.

The author and date are unknown, and as is common with ballads of this type and period several versions exist. It was printed in James Maidment's anthology A North Country Garland in 1824. That version is reprinted in James Kinsley's The Oxford Book of Ballads, 1969. Although the lyrics were transcribed by Francis James Child, it is uncertain if the original melody has been retained. The earliest recordings are from the performances of Jimmy MacBeath in 1951 and later Ewan MacColl, a more recent version by Andrew Calhoun forms part of his border folk song anthology Telfer's Cows. The ballad describes a young woman being forcefully taken from her home by a man named Willie and his companions. Willie's goal is to force Eppie to marry him. She refuses: in some versions because she already has a suitor, and in others because she considers Willie to be unworthy of her. First, Willie takes her to a priest whom he tries to force at gunpoint to perform the marriage ceremony. When the priest refuses, Eppie is locked in a room with Willie, where he tries to rape her. After a prolonged struggle, Willie finally gives up. Eppie, having retained her virginity and avoided the forced marriage is rescued by the arrival of a band of armed men, led by John Forsyth. After being rescued Eppie triumphantly asks Willie to provide her with a horse to return home on. Placenames mentioned suggest that the events happened in Aberdeenshire. Lyrics of the ballad The following is the version of the lyrics of \\"Eppie Morrie\\", as related by Francis James Child (Version A): { valign=\\"top\\" :Four-and-twenty Highland men :Came a' from Carrie side :To steal awa Eppie Morrie, :Cause she would not be a bride. :Out it's came her mother, :It was a moonlight night, :She could not see her daughter, :Their swords they shin'd so bright. :Haud far awa frae me, mother, :Haud far awa frae me; :There's not a man in a' Strathdon :Shall wedded be with me.' :They have taken Eppie Morrie, :And horse back bound her on, :And then awa to the Minister, :As fast as horse could gang. :He's taken out a pistol, :And set it to the minister's breast: :Marry me, marry me, minister, :Or else I'll be your priest.' :Haud far awa frae me, good sir, :Haud far awa frae me; :For there's not a man in all Strathdon :That shall married be with me.' :Haud far awa frae me, Willie, :Haud far awa frae me; :For I darna avow to marry you, :Except she's as willing as ye.' :They have taken Eppie Morrie, :Since better could nae be, :And they're awa to Carrie side, :As fast as horse could flee. :When mass was sung, and bells were rung, :And all were bound for bed, :Then Willie an Eppie Morrie :In one bed they were laid. valign=\\"top\\" :Haud far awa frae me, Willie, :Haud far awa frae me; :Before I'll lose my maidenhead, :I'll try my strength with thee.' :She took the cap from off her head :And threw it to the way; :Said, Ere I lose my maidenhead, :I'll fight with you till day. :Then early in the morning, :Before her clothes were on, :In came the maiden of Scalletter, :Gown and shirt alone. :Get up, get up, young woman, :And drink the wine wi me;' :You might have called me maiden, :I'm sure as leal as thee.' :Wally fa you, Willie, :That ye could nae prove a man :And taen the lassie's maidenhead! :She would have hired your han.' :Haud far awa frae me, lady, :Haud far awa frae me; :There's not a man in a' Strathdon :The day shall wed wi me.' :Soon in there came Belbordlane, :With a pistol on every side: :Come awa hame, Eppie Morrie, :And there you'll be my bride.' :Go get to me a horse, Willie, :And get it like a man, :And send me back to my mother :A maiden as I cam. :The sun shines oer the westlin hills; :By the light lamp of the moon, :Just saddle your horse, young John Forsyth, :And whistle, and I'll come soon.' } Recordings *A list of recordings (up to the recent release (2008) of the 1970 recording by Fotheringay) is to be found here: Child Ballads#220–229 References *Child, F.

The club was founded in 1984 as a result of reorganization of FC Lokomotiv Chita which was excluded from the First Division. FC Chita was immediately admitted to the Second Division. Colours (Home) all red. (Away) all black. History =Before 1974= Chita was first represented in the Soviet league in 1937, when DKA played in Group D. After one more occasional appearance in 1946 (by Dynamo), the city was represented in the league since 1957. Many different names were used for the Chita team: *DKA before 1945 *Dynamo in 1946–1956 *OSK in 1957 *SKVO in 1957–1959 *SKA in 1960 and 1967–1973 *Zabaykalets in 1961–1966 The best league result was SKA's victory in zone 6 in 1967 and their 7th position in subsequent Class B final tournament. =Lokomotiv= In 1974 FC Lokomotiv Chita was founded. Sources disagree on whether Lokomotiv is a continuation of previous Chita clubs. Lokomotiv played in the Soviet Second League in 1974–1977 and in 1984–1991. After the dissolution of USSR, Lokomotiv entered the Russian First Division. They played there until 2005. Lokomotiv's best results were 3rd position in the Eastern zone in 1992 and 8th position in the nationwide league in 1995, 1997, and 2000. Lokomotiv were the only club which stayed in the First Division for the first 14 years of its existence. =2006 exclusion= On 14 February 2006 Lokomotiv and Alania Vladikavkaz were denied professional licences by Professional Football League and excluded from professional football for juridical irregularities. On 22 February PFL decided to replace Alania and Lokomotiv with Lada Togliatti and Mashuk-KMV Pyatigorsk, the runners-up in the Second Division. The Russian Football Union did not endorse the exclusion and on 28 February decided to keep Alania and Lokomotiv in the First Division, giving them another chance to fulfill the league requirements. Consequently, on 6 March PFL decided to extend the First Division from 22 to 24 clubs, including Alania, Lokomotiv, Lada, and Mashuk- KMV. However, on 20 March the Russian Football Union finally decided to exclude Alania and Lokomotiv from the league. This decision was announced by the Professional Football League on 21 March, five days before the start of the First Division. Lokomotiv underwent reorganization, were renamed FC Chita and on 4 April were admitted into the Russian Second Division. FC Chita won the East (Vostok) Zone of the Second Division in 2008 and played in the Russian First Division in 2009 season. However, FC Chita relegated again to Second Division after finishing First Division as 17th. At the end of the 2016–17 season, FC Chita secured the top spot in their zone of the Russian Professional Football League, but did not apply for the second-tier Russian Football National League license for the next season due to lack of financing, effectively refusing to be promoted.

At one time they were almost extinct, but today there are about 2,000 animals. Originally multipurpose, they are nowadays mainly used for beef production.  Characteristics  * Height: bulls 140–145 cm; cows 135–140 cm * Weight: bulls 1,000–1,200 kg; cows 600–750 kg An important breeding aim is the unicoloured yellowish fur.  History  The modern type of Glan multipurpose cattle was established by Duke Christian IV, Count palatine of Zweibrücken through an inspection decree of 12 September 1773 that demanded the improvement of the local small red breed through using Simmental and Berne Mountain bulls. By 1762 the import of Swiss cattle had already begun; this was the beginning of Glan cattle breeding. In Donnersberg and Glan, two different cattle breeds developed: the light, dairy \\"Glan cattle\\" and the heavy draught \\"Donnersberg cattle\\". In the 19th century the two breeds mixed and became the \\"Glan- Donnersberg cattle\\" that were exported to the Hunsrück, the Westerwald and the Eifel. The first breed associations were founded in 1880 in Meisenheim and Quirnbach, later followed in 1898 by the Glan-Donnersberg Breeding Association based in Kaiserslautern and in 1912 the revived Association of the Rhenish Glan Cattle Breeding Cooperatives (later Association of the Rhenish Glan Cattle Breeders). In the 1920s they began crossing with Gelbvieh. One decade later they changed the breeding aim: the draught performance, once one of the advantages, became less important. Since 1950 they crossed in Danish Red cattle that caused either the loss of milk performance or of beef performance. This was the beginning of the end of purebred Glan cattle. The crossing in of Gelbvieh, Danish Red cattle and Angeln cattle was continued. In 1967 the pure breed was abandoned, and in 1972 the Association of the Rhenish Glan Cattle Breeders closed. In 1984 or 1985 an Association for the Conservation and Promotion of the Glan Cattle was founded. In search of old type Glan cattle they discovered 25 cows, among them only 4 purebreds. No living purebred bulls were found, but they found frozen sperm of purebred bulls. For the conservation of the breed they also used bulls of related breeds like Gelbvieh. Many associations breed Glan cattle today, with the main focus on the beef performance. Noteworthy populations are in Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and North Rhine-Westphalia.

He is sometimes referred to as the \\"inventor\\" of the Latinized term Jehovah; however, this is really not accurate. The pronuntiation \\"Jehovah\\" occurred as a result of mixing the Tetragrammaton \\"YHWH\\" with the vowels of \\"Adonai,\\" which the Jewish Masoretes had added to the Hebrew text to remind readers NOT to pronounce the Holy Name of God \\"YHWH\\", but substitute, in reading, \\"Adonai\\" which means \\"Lord.\\" On the other hand see the article \\"Jehovah/Hebrew vowel points\\" for an accurate explanation of how the \\"Adonai in YHWH\\" is debunked. Biography Galatino was born at Galatina, in Apulia. He received the habit as early as 1480, studied Oriental languages in Rome and was appointed lector at the convent of Ara Coeli; he also held the office of provincial in the province of Bari, and that of penitentiary under Leo X. Galatino wrote his chief work De Arcanis Catholicae Veritatis, at the request of the pope, the emperor, and other dignitaries, in 1516, at which time, owing mainly to John Reuchlin's Augenspiegel, the famous controversy on the authority of the Jewish writings was assuming a very high-profile. Galatino took up Reuchlin's defence. Resolved to combat the Jews on their own ground, he turned the Cabbala against them, and sought to convince them that their own books yielded proof of the truth of the Christian religion, hence their opposition to it should be branded as obstinacy. He gave his work the form of a dialogue. The two conflicting Christian parties were represented by Capnio (Reuchlin) and the Inquisitor Jacob van Hoogstraaten, O.P. In conciliatory terms, Galatino responded to the queries and suggestions of the former, and refuted the objections of the latter. He had borrowed largely from the Pugio Fidei of the Dominican Raymond Martini, remodelling, however, the material and supplementing it with copious quotations from the Zohar and the Iggeret ha- sodot of the Jewish convert Pablo de Heredia. In a long letter to Paul III (MS. Vat. Libr., cod. Ottob. Lat. 2366, fol. 300-308) he vehemently defended himself and his party against the charge of having forged the last-named book, which he firmly held to be the work of Rabbenu ha-Kadosh. Galatino was aware, no less than his critics, that his De Arcanis had many shortcomings, both in matter and form, and he begged his readers to consider that he was compelled to finish it within the space of a year and a half. The work became very popular and ran through several editions. For the rest, Galatino's extensive knowledge and his thorough acquaintance with Greek, Hebrew, and Jewish Aramaic is fully borne out by his numerous other unpublished writings. In bold language he inveighs (or strongly protests) against the corruption among the clergy and discusses the question of reform. While engaged on his remarkable work De Vera Theologia his strength threatened to fail him by reason of his great age and infirmity, but, having taken a vow to defend in the course of this work the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, he instantly, so he tells us, recovered his strength and health (MSS. 52, 54, 60, St. Isidore's Coll.). In 1539, Paul III, in a special Bull, bequeathed Galatino's works, about thirty in number, to the convent of Ara Coeli and enjoined that special care be taken of them. The manuscripts are now preserved in various Roman archives. Galatino died in Rome. His grandnephew was Lorenzo Mongiò (1550–1630), bishop in Minervino, Auxiliary bishop in Salzburg and Valencia, archbishop in Lanciano and Pozzuoli.

The CMU is distinguished from a local, independent union of the same name which existed at the Clinton Creek mine in the Yukon.

The two unions fought for control, but in 1917 joined forces and formed the Amalgamated Mine Workers of Nova Scotia. The Amalgamated affiliated fully with UMWA a year later.

The pact was ratified by the union a few days later.Donham, \\"Bitter Strike Ends Bitterly,\\" Maclean's, October 19, 1981; MacKinnon, \\"Cape Breton Coal Unrest,\\" New Maritimes, February 1983; Wanamaker, \\"UMW Makes Important Gains,\\" New Maritimes, February 1983; Wanamaker, \\"A Relieved UMW Promises Reform,\\" New Maritimes, April 1983.Franklin, \\"Miners' President Receives Praise on Trip Promoting New Coal Pact,\\" New York Times, June 2, 1981.Plaskin, \\"Regional News,\\" United Press International, October 5, 1981. Seething over the international union's inability to fund the strike, dissident miners attempted to organize their own union with the help and support of the Confederation of Canadian Unions (CCU). Miner Archie Kennedy contacted CCU Secretary-Treasurer John Lang and asked for assistance. Lang dispatched organizers John St. Amand and Sue Vohanka to Cape Breton to organize a union.Boase, \\"Johnny Fought for the Underdog,\\" Hamilton Spectator, November 13, 2007. The attempt to decertify the United Mine Workers and replace it with a new organization was part of a larger movement among Canadian labour unions to split away from their parent American \\"international\\" unions. Widespread discontent existed over the amount of dues sent to union headquarters in the U.S. (many Canadian unions called them \\"profits\\") and the relatively minor attention given to the problems of Canadian workers in return.Martin, \\"A Canadian Split on Unions,\\" New York Times, March 12, 1984. The CCU founded the Canadian Mineworkers Union, and began an organizing campaign in late 1981. Roughly half the Cape Breton miners joined the CMU, forcing a federally supervised union election. The Cape Breton miners voted 1,750 to 1,393 in March 1983 against affiliating with the CMU. The election was seen as a victory for UMWA president Richard Trumka. Trumka had defeated incumbent Sam Church for the international union presidency in the fall of 1982, and observers felt Cape Breton miners wanted to give the international union a second chance. But the CCU and CMU continued their organizing efforts. Member anger over the level of service given by UMWA remained high, and CMU forced a second election in March 1984. The miners rejected CMU a second time by a vote of 1,795 to 1,242. CMU's support declined quickly thereafter, as miners became disenchanted with the constant campaigning for votes.\\"Canadian News Briefs,\\" United Press International, March 8, 1984.\\"Canadian News Briefs,\\" United Press International, March 10, 1983; \\"Canadian News Briefs,\\" United Press International, March 8, 1984.

Biography Plaque at her former home on St Stephens Square, Norwich She was born in Norwich to Elizabeth Lawrence and Daniel Bentley. The latter, a journeyman cordwainer who had himself received a good education, educated Elizabeth, his only child. The family faced financial difficulties after he suffered a stroke in 1777 and was unable to work at his usual trade. He died in 1783, when his daughter was sixteen. Two years later, Bentley reported a new-found desire to write poetry \\"which [she] had no thought or desire of being seen.\\"cite Donna Landry, \\"Bentley, Elizabeth (bap. 1767, died 1839).\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2004. 12 April 2007. Her first collection, Genuine Poetical Compositions (1791), had an impressive 1,935 subscribers, including literary notables Elizabeth Carter, Elizabeth Montagu, William Cowper, and Hester Chapone. As a labouring-class poet, Bentley—\\"content to be the last and lowest of the tuneful train\\"Genuine Poetical Compositions, lines 30–32.—adopted a humble stance towards her readers and let it be known that the venture was intended to establish an annuity for she and her mother. Both her collections, however, contained portraits of the author and accounts of her life; the account written in 1790 and published in the first volume is the source of most that is known of her. Her poetry celebrates the countryside and engages in public debates on topics such as abolitionism and cruelty to animals. Cowper compared her favourably with Mary Leapor, a labouring-class poet of the previous generation, citing her \\"strong natural genius.\\"Donna Landry, \\"Bentley, Elizabeth (bap. 1767, d. 1839).\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

After the publication of her first volume, Bentley kept a small boarding school and did not publish much—some poems for children; an ode on the Battle of Trafalgar (1805)—for three decades. This hiatus ended with the publication of her Poems in 1821. She died nine years later in an almshouse.

The lyrics were written in 1856 by Rev. Henry D. L. Webster, after a broken engagement. He wrote a long poem about his fiancée Ella Blocksom, but changed her name at first to \\"Bertha\\" and later to \\"Lorena\\", perhaps an adaptation of \\"Lenore\\" from Edgar Allan Poe's poem \\"The Raven.\\" Henry Webster's friend Joseph Philbrick Webster wrote the music, and the song was first published in Chicago in 1857. It became a favorite of soldiers of both sides during the American Civil War. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.  History  \\"Lorena\\" was based on the lyricist's love for a Zanesville, Ohio girl named Ella Blocksom. Her parents being deceased, Miss Blocksom lived with her brother-in-law and sister, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Blandy. The family attended the Universalist Church in Zanesville where the Rev. Henry DeLafayette Webster was the minister. Miss Blocksom caught the eye of the young preacher and his feelings became more than just pastoral. Henry Blandy and his brother Fred were co-owners of the Blandy foundry in Zanesville. As a wealthy and prominent member of the community he could not see his sister-in-law becoming romantically attached to a poor preacher and so stepped in to put an end to the relationship. Miss Blocksom told Webster that they must part and gave him a letter containing the line \\"If we try, we may forget,\\" which found its way into the song. The brokenhearted Mr. Webster resigned his pastorate and left Zanesville. In 1856, Webster met Joseph P. Webster (who later composed the music of \\"[In the] Sweet By-and-By\\"). J. P. Webster was looking for lyrics to a song he was writing and Henry Webster responded by writing a ballad about his lost love, changing her name from Ella to Bertha. The composer required a three-syllable name and Henry Webster changed the name again, this time to Lorena. The song was published in 1857 by Higgins Brothers of Chicago and soon was known across America. In 1854 Martha Ella Blocksom married William Wartenbee Johnson, Ohio Supreme Court justice from 1879 to 1886. She died in 1917 and is buried at Woodland Cemetery in Ironton, Ohio. Henry D.L. Webster also married, fathered four children, and eventually became the minister of a Unitarian church in Chicago, Illinois. He died in 1896, and is buried in Chicago. During the American Civil War, soldiers on both sides of the conflict thought of their wives and girlfriends back home when they heard the song \\"Lorena\\". One Confederate officer even attributed the South's defeat to the song. He reasoned that upon hearing the mournful ballad the soldiers grew so homesick that they lost their effectiveness as a fighting force.

Usage in more recent media  =Film= An instrumental version appears in the film Gone With The Wind (1939) when Scarlett O'Hara is manning the stall at the charity dance in her mourning outfit and Rhett Butler pursues her while she is trying to avoid him. The tune occurs in two John Ford films. The melody of \\"Lorena\\" was used by composer Max Steiner to represent homecoming in various scenes in the 1956 western The Searchers. Composer David Buttolph used the melody to represent bittersweet parting at the end of the 1959 western The Horse Soldiers. In the 1989 miniseries Lonesome Dove the tune is used in the background as Gus McCrae lies dying – ostensibly played on a whorehouse piano. The tune of the song is used in the saloon scene near the beginning of the 2012 film Cowboys & Aliens, played on fiddle. The saloon keeper tells the fiddler that it is too melancholy and asks him to play a different tune. Near the end of the movie, the piano player plays an upbeat version of the tune, and the crowd celebrates their victory over the aliens by dancing to it. Was featured in the 2017 Colin Farrell/Nicole Kidman film, The Beguiled. =Television= The melody features prominently in several episodes of the 1990 Ken Burn's documentary Civil War, and it is referred to as a tune which both Federal and Confederate soldiers particularly loved. The song features prominently in one subplot-line of the television series So Weird season 1 episode 4 - \\"Sacrifice\\". It was used as harmonica background music in the TV series Wagon Train, episode \\"The Clementine Jones Story\\" (1961), with Ann Blyth (as Clementine Jones) singing a rendition of the song. It was also used as background music in the PBS Civil War drama series Mercy Street, in a scene in which the characters Dr. Jedediah Foster (Josh Radnor) and Nurse Anne Hastings (Tara Summers) visit a Union encampment to treat an ill general. =Video Games= In the 2018 western-themed video game Red Dead Redemption 2, the character Karen Jones can be heard singing the song at a campfire.

He found the teaching there unsatisfactory, however and, after numerous unanswered petitions to the Academy, moved to Rome without permission. He arrived there only to discover that their \\"Academy\\" was really an association of artists with private students. Thanks to a recommendation from a Russian nobleman residing in Italy, he was able enter the classes of Pompeo Battoni.

It forms one pole of the North Atlantic oscillation, the other being the Icelandic Low. The system influences the weather and climatic patterns of vast areas of North Africa and southern Europe, and to a lesser extent, eastern North America. The aridity of the Sahara Desert and the summer drought of the Mediterranean Basin is due to the large-scale subsidence and sinking motion of air in the system. In its summer position (the Bermuda High), the high is centered near Bermuda, and creates a southwest flow of warm tropical air toward the East Coast of the United States. In summer, the Azores-Bermuda High is strongest. The central pressure hovers around 1024 mbar (hPa). This high-pressure block exhibits anticyclonic nature, circulating the air clockwise. Due to this direction of movement, African eastern waves are impelled along the southern periphery of the Azores High away from coastal West Africa towards the Caribbean, Central America, or the Bahamas, favouring tropical cyclogenesis, especially during the hurricane season. Tropical wave formation on the Atlantic Ocean. Variations Research into global warming suggests that it may be intensifying the Bermuda High in some years, independently of oscillations such as ENSO, leading to more precipitation extremes across the Southeastern United States. Latitudinal displacement of the ridge is also occurring, and computer models depict more westward expansion of the anticyclone in the future. However, during the winter of 2009-2010, the Azores High was smaller, displaced to the northeast and weaker than usual, allowing sea surface temperatures in the Central Atlantic to increase quickly.

Cartoons, UPA and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Levitow was born in Los Angeles, California. He began working as an in-betweener at Warner Brothers Studios in 1940. Levitow briefly left Warner Brothers when he was drafted during World War II, returning in 1945. He first received animation credit in 1953 while working under the direction of Chuck Jones. He worked steadily for Jones over the remainder of the 1950s, and directed several cartoons for release in 1959, including the Pepé Le Pew cartoon \\"Really Scent\\". While working under Jones, he made characters' joints more angular than most other animators. Those characters with fur (Wile E. Coyote, for example) looked especially shaggy in Levitow's scenes. Levitow joined UPA in 1958 to work on the Mr. Magoo feature 1001 Arabian Nights, staying behind even after the studio was sold to Henry G. Saperstein. In 1962, he directed the first feature-length animated television special, Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol. 1962 also saw the release of his theatrical feature Gay Purr-ee, with the voices of Robert Goulet, Judy Garland, and others. By 1965, he was working with Jones at MGM as an animator and a director in the Tom and Jerry series. He co-directed the feature film The Phantom Tollbooth with Chuck Jones at MGM. In addition, he worked with UPA on more Mr. Magoo cartoons, including The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo. He animated on the Chuck Jones-produced A Christmas Carol, directed by Richard Williams at Williams' London studio in 1971. His last completed project was B.C.: The First Thanksgiving in 1973. At the time of his death on May 8, 1975, Levitow was in line to direct the animated feature film Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. The project was taken over by Richard Williams when Levitow unexpectedly died during pre- production at the age of 52. Grampa Simpson on The Simpsons was named after both Levitow and creator Matt Groening's grandfather (unbeknownst to the writers).

Accessed 1 August 2009 was a comedian and theatrical producer, active in Australia. Biography Theatrical program cover for a performance by Bland Holt (1899) Holt was the son of Joseph Frederick Holt (known as Clarance) and his first wife Marie, née Brown. Holt was born at Norwich, England, came to Australia with his father, an actor/manager, in 1857, and made his first appearance on the stage when he was six years old. He was educated at the Church of England grammar school, Brighton, Victoria, and at the Otago boys' high school, Dunedin, New Zealand. Holt returned to England aged 14 years and became a professional actor. He had experience in England, the United States and New Zealand, before establishing himself in Australia in 1876. His first production was Paul Merritt's play New Babylon at the Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney, with Myra Kemble as the leading lady. The play started a six week Sydney season on 24 April 1880 before moving to the Theatre Royal Melbourne. For the next 30 years Holt continued to produce the principal melodramas of the period. Most of the time of his companies was divided between the Lyceum theatre, Sydney, and the Theatre Royal, Melbourne. Nothing was too realistic to be attempted; in one play there was a hunting scene with horses dogs and a stag; in another several horses finished a race across the stage; in another a circus ring was realistically presented with the regular acts being done. Holt introduced the first motor car on stage. Holt himself had been an excellent clown in pantomime, and he played comedy parts in melodrama with great ability. He was prudent and successful in management and retired in 1909, living at Sunninghill in Cotham Rd (building now stands but are offices) Kew, Victoria, a Melbourne suburb, for part of the year, and in summer spending his time at his seaside home at Sorrento, Victoria. There he would entertain every year a party of veteran members of the profession. Holt wrote the play The Breaking of the Drought which was made into a filmThe Breaking of the Drought (1920) at imdb.com in 1920. Holt died at Kew on 28 June 1942 in his ninetieth year. He married in 1887 Florence, daughter of William Curling Anderson, who survived him. He had no children. Holt practically grew up in a theatre and knew exactly what suited his public. He personally supervised every detail of his productions, and was hard working. If Holt considered that a play needed revision or needed updating, he would write fresh dialogue for it himself. Holt's management style resulted in a harmonious theatrical company. Holt is buried in the Boroondara General Cemetery.mention of Holt's grave in Kew Cemetery accessed 1 August 2009 File:H2000 180 4NewBabylon.jpgthumbBland Holt's New Babylon (handbill) File:H2008.130 119MrsFlorenceHolt.jpgthumbMrs. Bland (Florence) Holt File:MS8827 13 PHO134Holt.jpgthumbActor Bland Holt with dog File:SLV VOYAGER3070878TheatreRoyalProgram1907.jpgthumbThe cotton king.

However, the Dark Knight does care for his lost progeny.Batman #658 After the events of Batman R.I.P. and Batman: Battle for the Cowl, he takes the role of Robin at ten years of age,Batman and Robin #2 becoming the fifth person to use the Robin persona. He first worked with Dick Grayson before going to work alongside his father, upon the original's return to the role of Batman. He continued to serve as Robin until 2013's Batman, Inc. #8, in which he is killed by the Heretic, an agent of his mother and his own clone of accelerated growth. In 2014's Batman and Robin vol. 2, #37, Batman resurrects Damian, and he returns to the role of Robin. Damian maintained the Robin mantle until Teen Titans Annual #2 in 2020, which saw Damian disown it following the death of Alfred Pennyworth. https://screenrant.com/damian-wayne-quits-robin-dc-comics/ In 2013, Damian Wayne placed 25th on IGN's Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics. Damian Wayne is ranked No 1 in IGN's Top Ten Best Robins and No 6 in Newsarama's 10 Most Popular Comic Book Characters Introduced in the Last 25 Years. Publication History The child from Son of the Demon was used as a backup character in various stories before appearing as Damian Wayne. In the Elseworlds story, The Brotherhood of the Bat (1995), a version named Tallant Wayne appears, who crusades against his grandfather Ra's al Ghul. Brotherhood of the Bat features a future in which Ra's al Ghul discovers the Batcave following Bruce Wayne's death, and outfits the League of Assassins in variant Batman costumes based on Wayne's rejected designs. Talia and Bruce's son join the Brotherhood in his father's costume, to destroy it from within. Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat In Kingdom Come (1996) by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, which functioned as a possible future to the canon of the time, the child of Batman and Talia is named Ibn al Xu'ffasch, literally \\"Son of the Bat\\", and a member of Lex Luthor's inner circle. He falls in love with Nightstar, the daughter of Dick Grayson and Starfire. He works as a double agent for Batman in Luthor's organization. In the Elliot S! Maggin novelization of Kingdom Come, al Xu'ffasch tells Bruce that his mother Talia is still alive and working as a Mother Superior in India, one of Mother Teresa's successors. al Xu'ffasch reappears in Waid's 1999 sequel The Kingdom. Ibn al Xu'ffasch holding Nightstar on the cover art of The Kingdom: Son of the Bat #1 (February 1999); art by Brian Apthorp The Kingdom: Son of the Bat shows flashbacks that shed new insights into Ibn al Xu'ffasch's history: that he was reared by Ra's al Ghul to be the heir to his empire, that he eventually murdered his grandfather (cutting off his head to prevent yet another regeneration), and that he sought therapy from psychiatrist Dr. Gibson. He was eventually recruited by Rip Hunter to try to stop a madman named Gog from altering his history. He works with several other heroes of his generation – Kid Flash, the daughter of the Flash (Wally West); Nightstar and Offspring, the son of Plastic Man. In League of Batmen (2001), the sequel to Brotherhood of the Bat, Tallant leads his own team of variant Batmen to combat the plague that was al Ghul's legacy. During the battle, Tallant discovers that his grandfather is the one who murdered his father and then cloned him. Ra's even sent the clone to murder his own daughter. Because of the deaths of his parents at Ra's's hands, Tallant has completed following his father's tragic path as Batman. The new Dark Knight desires justice for his parents along with trying to stop his grandfather while having to battle his father's murderous double. Grant Morrison's story titled Batman and Son (2006) expand upon the Son of the Demon storyline as part of a remodeling of Batman's personality after the events of Infinite Crisis. In Morrison's version, the child Damian Wayne is the result of a tryst between Batman and Talia, during which the Dark Knight claims he was drugged when they were at the Tropic of Cancer, though Morrison later admitted the claim of drugging was a canonical error on his part. Since then however in issues of the Morrison penned Batman Incorporated, the drugging is reaffirmed and is once again part of Damian's origin.Batman Incorporated Vol. 2 #2 (June 2012) The final issue of 52 (2008) designates the Kingdom Come alternate universe as Earth-22, thus making the Ibn al Xu'ffasch version part of the DC Multiverse and Damian Wayne's parallel universe counterpart. Justice Society of America vol. 3 #22 (2009) reveals that he would eventually marry Nightstar (Mar' i Grayson) with whom he would have a daughter and son.

Genetically perfected and grown in an artificial womb, Damian was intended to be a formidable warrior. He is raised by his mother Talia al Ghul and the League of Assassins. He becomes a talented martial artist before his teenage years, at which time Talia reveals Damian's existence to Bruce Wayne and leaves him in Batman's custody in an effort to disrupt Batman's work. Precocious, spoiled, and violent, Damian battles Tim Drake, whom he wants to replace as Robin, and sucker punches Tim off the stuffed Tyrannosaurus in the Batcave when Tim stops fighting to help him. Damian then escapes, dons a variant Robin costume made of Jason Todd's old tunic and mask and assorted League of Assassin gear, and gets into a fight with and decapitates the villainous Spook. Although misguided, Damian seems to genuinely want to aid Bruce's war on crime as he is Bruce's son and wants his approval. Unfortunately, because of how he was raised, Damian lacks any sort of common sense in regards to social behavior and believes that in order to be accepted by his father, he must kill any rivals, which included Tim Drake. This troubles his relationship with Batman, who vows never to kill. However, because of his possible paternity to Damian, Batman, on some levels, is optimistic about the chance of fatherhood. Eventually, Batman confronts Talia to confirm Damian's true identity, but both Talia and Damian are soon caught in an explosion. They survive the explosion. However, Damian's badly injured body requires transplants of harvested organs, which his mother orders her physicians to carry out. Damian makes a full recovery.Batman #665 =The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul= Beginning in Batman Annual #26 (\\"Head of the Demon\\"), Talia takes Damian to the Australian Outback, where he is tutored in the secret history of his grandfather Ra's al Ghul. Talia is unaware that a former servant of Ra's, named White Ghost, plans to use Damian as a shell for the soul of Ra's to return to Earth. This process would, of course, kill Damian. Talia is able to save her son from his fate at the last minute. Ra's is still able to return, but as a rotting, shambling undead corpse, still needing Damian to stabilize his form. Damian flees to alert Batman but is pursued by his evil grandfather. Upon entering Wayne Manor, Damian attempts to relay to Tim Drake the fact that Ra's has returned. Tim, suspicious of Damian's intentions, does not believe his story and begins a fistfight. Damian flees and encounters Alfred. Before he can effectively relay his news, he is attacked by Tim, who perceives Damian's attempt to help a tripping Alfred as an attack, and renews their battle. As they fight, members of the League of Assassins approach the manor with the intention of killing all others within and bringing Damian back to Ra's alive. Damian and Tim fight side by side against Ra's and his minions. Their collaboration is hindered by their very different philosophies of battle. Damian is willing to betray Tim at any moment for his own safety. Ra's captures the two and tells Batman that he will use one of them for his own body. Batman offers his own body instead. Ra's refuses the offer, feeling that he needs someone of a younger age. The choices are Tim or Damian. Batman offers a third alternative: \\"Fountain of Essence\\" which contains the qualities of a Lazarus Pit. Batman and Ra's go in search of the fountain, leaving Tim, Damian, Nightwing, Alfred Pennyworth, and Talia to battle the Sensei. Damian leaves his mother and Tim to an unknown fate, while he goes off to be with his father. He ends up captured by Ra's and nearly loses his life. Batman and the others manage to save him, and Talia takes her son and escapes. A subsequent conversation between Tim and Alfred implies that Batman has carried out a DNA test on Damian. Alfred says Bruce intended to tell him the results when the time was right. At this, Tim realizes that Damian is indeed Bruce's son, and exclaims \\"The son of Satan is my brother?\\"\\"Did he do a paternity test on Damian? You know, like a DNA test... He had to, right? Alfred? -Tim Drake \\"He insisted he would tell you the results himself when the time was right.\\" -Alfred \\"So you know. You both know and nobody is going to tell me?\\" -Tim Drake \\"It's not my place to say, young sir. Forgive me.\\" -Alfred \\"The son of Satan is my brother?\\" -Tim Drake. Dialogue post-midway through a comic book (\\"son of Satan\\" likely in reference to The Omen franchise). \\"Morrison, Grant. Batman #676. DC Comics, Inc., 2008 =Batman R.I.P.= Prior to the start of Grant Morrison's \\"Batman R.I.P.\\" story arc in Batman #675, Damian senses that someone is out to get Batman. In response to this, Talia begins formulating a plan involving Commissioner James Gordon, whom Talia and Damian rescue from a booby-trapped Wayne Manor while in search of Batman, who is insane and has gone missing. Damian and Alfred race to aid Batman against the Black Glove in a commandeered Batmobile. Damian, who is driving, knocks an ambulance off a bridge without any sign of remorse or even concern. When Alfred reprimands him, Damian retorts with a backhanded threat. The only occupant of the ambulance was the Joker. =Battle for the Cowl= In Nightwing #153 (2009), Damian is shown being left in the care of Alfred Pennyworth and trained by Dick Grayson (alias Nightwing). Upon the start of Batman: Battle for the Cowl, it appears that Damian is now residing in Gotham, and living under the command of Nightwing (to an extent). Where before Damian portrayed an arrogant and vicious personality, it appears the \\"death\\" of his father has regressed him to a more childlike mindset, as demonstrated when he takes the Batmobile joy-riding with an older girl. This is discovered by Oracle, who ejects the girl and takes control of the Batmobile, intent on taking Damian home. The car is blindsided by Killer Croc and Poison Ivy, who prepares to kill Damian. The older girl (Damian's companion) is later eaten by Killer Croc. Batman: Battle for the Cowl #1 (2009) Damian is saved by Nightwing who ends up being cornered by Black Mask's men until a murderous figure appears stating that he is Batman (later revealed to be Jason Todd). Although shot by Todd, Damian recovers and saves Tim Drake from falling to death inside Jason's Batcave. Batman: Battle for the Cowl #2 (2009) When Grayson hangs up his Nightwing mantle to become the newest Batman, he chooses Damian to assume the mantle of Robin by his side.Batman: Battle for the Cowl #3 (2009) =Batman: Reborn= Despite becoming Robin to Grayson's Batman, Damian reveals that he cares little for his older brother and has no respect for him as Batman and that the latter would have to earn it. In an act of defiance, Damian decides to make the Robin mantle independent from that of Batman and decides to stop Dr. Phosphorus from breaking into Project Cadmus, but fails miserably and is saved by Dick. Dick then begins to train Damian as to how to properly become the new Robin and the two develop their own unique crime-fighting style. Damian then begins to mock Tim Drake for not being chosen as Robin, causing Tim to severely beat Damian, only to be stopped by Dick. After Tim leaves, Damian starts engaging in chess games with Hush, visiting him secretly against Dick's orders. When Elliot asked why Damian is visiting him behind the Bat-family's back, Damian shrugs it off as a desire to keep Elliot company. Elliot surmises that Damian is rather using the resemblance to Bruce to \\"spend time with [his] old man\\". Dick and Damian then encounter a villain called Professor Pyg, who has created an army called Dollotrons. Dick and Damian take the entire army down and begin to form a brotherly relationship. Damian blames himself for being unable to save a single Dollotron, a girl named Sasha, but unbeknownst to him, the girl is taken in by Jason Todd, who had shot Damian, Batman & Robin vol.3 #3 (2009) thereby becoming the new Robin's opposite number in Red Hood's no-holds-barred war against crime (Red Hood's maxim is \\"let the punishment fit the crime\\"). Batman & Robin vol. 3 #4 (2009) Damian and Dick then attack Firefly, who is attempting to kill Black Mask. Victor Zsasz defeats Robin and rescues Black Mask while Dick takes down Firefly. These events cause Hush to escape, causing Damian to grow a further hatred for the criminal. Damian is present when Dick is inducted into the JLA, upon hearing, Damian demands to be inducted along with Dick, but his demands are promptly ignored. Damian is once again saved by Dick, with the assistance of Azrael, after a man named Amon tries to sacrifice him. Sasha, now dubbed Scarlet by Todd, returns and attacks Robin, as Jason attacks Dick, the two duos battle it out until the arrival of the Flamingo, who temporarily paralyzes Damian. Talia fixes Damian's spine but puts in a monitor connected to his brain allowing her to control his every movement. As Dick and Damian go through various events together, such as against the Black Mask, the Blackest Night, and a rogue Batman clone-corpse, the two bond, even more, prompting Talia to give over control of the monitor to Deathstroke who tries to use it to kill Dick. Working together, Dick and Damian manage to stop Deathstroke. As Dick cares little for the financial problems of Wayne Enterprises, despite inheriting it from Bruce along with Tim, Damian decides to involve himself and manages to impress the board of directors. While he does not file a lawsuit against Dick, due to Grayson not being named the heir of Wayne Enterprises, but rather a high-ranking member, he does against Tim, who was named the heir to Wayne Enterprises.Batman & Robin vol. 3 #10 (March 2010) =Red Robin= Damian's second year as Robin begins with a bang, as he chooses this time to pick a fight against his predecessor Red Robin. Tim, who has been keeping a hit list of criminals and tasks, attracts Damian's fury when the latter hacks the hit list and discovers a hidden layer of allies to the bat family considered potential threats by Tim, including Damian. During a stakeout mission, Damian slices off Tim's line, causing him to fall from a great height. He survives, and Tim pulls Damian into an all-out brawl that begins with their quarry escaping, and ending in front of the theater where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. The two are stopped by Batman, who chastises them both for fighting in front of the theater where Batman was born. The two then enter into a grudging truce for the remainder of Damian's appearances in the series. Dick suggests changing the hit list password to cousin Oliver, as Damian has little to no interest in pop culture references and would never guess it. Dick noted that his name is not on the list and Tim asserts it's because Dick is the only one who Tim trusts implicitly. =Blackest Night= After Bruce's skull was taken from his grave, Damian and Dick decide to bring the rest of his skeleton, along with those of Damian's paternal grandparents, to their base beneath Wayne Tower. Damian is quite shaken by the sight of the bones of his family. On the way to the cave, Dick's body is possessed by Deadman, at whom Damian lashes out in confusion. Deadman then possesses and leaves Damian's body, subsequently passing his knowledge of the attack of the Black Lanterns onto him. The two heroes then prepare for the Black Lanterns' assault on Gotham. Blackest Night: Batman #1 (August 2009) After raiding the Army Reserve National Guard Armory, Dick, Damian, and the arriving Tim Drake, are able to save Commissioner Gordon, Oracle, and the surviving police officers at Gotham Central from the reanimated versions of the original Dark Knight's deceased rogues gallery members. However, they then find themselves in a horrific encounter with the parents of Dick Grayson and Tim Drake reanimated as Black Lanterns. Blackest Night: Batman #2 (November 2009) Dick and Tim send Damian with the Gordons to their underground base while they battle the Black Lanterns. Dick eventually orders Damian through their comm-links to send one of his Wingers with Mr. Freeze's gun. Grayson uses the weapon to cryogenically suspend himself and Tim, forcing the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life of them. Deadman later revives the former Boy Wonders.Blackest Night: Batman #3 (December 2009) =Return of Bruce Wayne= Talia begins to clone Damian as she realizes that her son has completely sided with Dick Grayson and the Bat- Family. Damian finally stands up for his Robin mantle, telling Talia that being Robin was the best thing that he had ever done, and Talia does not need to save him from something he chooses to be. Talia then shows Damian a cloned version of himself, whom she sees as Damian's younger brother. Talia admits to Damian, that even though she loves him, she is too much of a perfectionist to admire him for choosing a path that defies her this blatantly, and he is therefore no longer welcome and will be considered an enemy of the House of al Ghul. Damian defiantly replies that he hopes to be a worthy one. Damian (as Robin) is then seen teaming up with Dick and Alfred to begin their own search for Bruce Wayne. Batman & Robin vol. 3 #12 (May 2010) During a confrontation with a returned minor villain the Getaway Genius, Damian is initially angry that Grayson failed to capture the foe – as well as the implication that his father failed as well during the Genius' original run back when Grayson was Robin – but when Dick explains to him that Bruce let the Genius go because he discovered that the Genius' robberies were only him stealing medicines that he needed so that he could live long enough to see his daughter grow up, Damian realizes that he never really knew his father as a person, and admits that there was more to him than Batman.Batman #703 After Grayson's confidant, Oberon Sexton is revealed to be the Joker in disguise, Damian tortures the villain by savagely beating him with a crowbar in order to get information, considering it to be self-defense since the Joker planned to attack him.Batman & Robin vol. 3 #13 (2010) However, the Clown Prince of Crime's apparent helplessness is revealed to be another ruse and he incapacitates Damian with his hidden Joker venom. The villain intends to use Damian and Dick in his fight against their common enemies: the Black Glove. Help arrives in the form of the original Batman. After Bruce Wayne helps Dick and Damian defeat the Black Glove and the Joker, Wayne accepts his son in addition to his role as Robin.Batman & Robin vol. 3 #16 (November 2010) Despite Bruce's parental responsibilities to Damian, he decides that he prefers Damian to continue working with Dick (who maintains the Batman mantle and whom Bruce sees as a positive role model for his son) rather than being with himself primarily, due to his plans with Batman Inc. Batman: The Return one-shot (Jan. 2011) =Teen Titans= Damian joins the Teen Titans when Dick Grayson concludes that the team needs a Robin, while also feeling that Damian would benefit from the friendship of other heroes, having progressed to the point where he can be trusted not to kill if left 'unsupervised'. Teen Titans vol. 3 #88 Although Wonder Girl objects to this decision, Grayson convinces her to let Damian stay on the team as he needs Damian to learn that he can trust others not to betray him, only for his temper to jeopardize his first mission with the team when he attacks an opponent just after Raven had convinced him to calm down, provoking their new foe into starting his wave of destruction again.Teen Titans vol. 3 #89 Robin eventually begins to develop a friendship with Ravager, who initially reaches out to Damian due to their similar upbringings (Ravager's father being the notorious assassin, Deathstroke).Teen Titans vol. 3 #91 Tim Drake eventually comes to the Titans for help after a robotic duplicate of the Calculator attempts to murder his close friend, Tam Fox, and decides to rejoin the team once the mission is completed. Damian chooses to leave the team upon Drake's return, reasoning that the Teen Titans do not need two Robins, and realizing that his teammates prefer to work with Tim. Upon returning to Gotham, Damian tells Dick that even though he had been brought to the Titans in order to find friends, he did not need to, as he already had one, Grayson himself.Teen Titans vol. 3 #92 When Blackbat, Stephanie Brown's predecessor, returns to Gotham, she and Damian are partnered together during a stake-out to catch the Architect, a new villain obsessed with destroying Gotham landmarks.

Art by Patrick Gleason. Following the \\"Flashpoint\\" story arc, Bruce Wayne was returned by writers as being the only Batman in 2011's the New 52 relaunch of DC Comics. Dick Grayson was returned to his previous role as Nightwing, and Damian still serves as his father's vigilante partner Robin. After reading the letter written by his father from an alternate timeline, the Dark Knight decides that it is time to take steps to put his past behind him. He tries to teach Damian the same values his parents have instilled within him as he finally assumes his role as a father. Batman and Robin vol. 2 #1 (September 2011) However, despite Bruce's attempts to build a relationship with his son, Damian remains distant from his father, which Alfred worries about. Although this relationship is further strained when Damian seemingly leaves Wayne Manor to join the villain Nobody, it turns out this was a ruse by Damian to bring down Nobody. Although Damian eventually kills Nobody in front of Bruce, they are able to work through the incident by beginning to actively understand and respect one another as father and son. Bruce goes so far as to conceal the event from Dick and Tim, leading Alfred to comment to Bruce that he has become \\"quite the overprotective parent\\". In Batman-related issues of the New 52 taking place after Batman issue #14 (the Joker's return to comics), Damian was portrayed as being very interested in fighting his father's arch-foe. He seemed to always be eager to take on the Joker and repeatedly assumes that bad things happening in Gotham are related to the Joker in some way, in hopeful anticipation of an encounter with him. In Batman and Robin vol. 2, #15, Damian defies his father's orders to remain in the Batcave and investigates Alfred's kidnapping. The investigation leads to Gotham Zoo where Damian is captured by Joker. Joker accuses Damian and the other members of Batman's family of being a burden that prevents Batman from being the best foe for Joker. Joker tells Damian that his and Batman's greatest fear is being responsible for the other's death. Joker then presents Damian with Batman in Joker makeup, and states that Damian must kill Batman before Batman kills him. Unwilling to kill his father, Damian chooses death, but the Joker kills Batman before he can deal a fatal blow. Damian passes out from Joker venom and Batman is revealed to be a fake; as Damian recovers from the toxin, the Joker presents him with a cloche. The Joker is eventually defeated by Batman, but the trust between Batman and the Batman Family is shattered. During the \\"Leviathan\\" story arc, when his mother Talia puts a price on his head and is targeted by the most dangerous and skilled assassins, Bruce faked Damian's death and secluded him in the Batcave in order to protect him while he goes undercover to confront Talia and her minions. But against his father's wishes, he escapes, donning a new costume under the name of Redbird.Batman: Incorporated #3 (September 2012) Along with the mysterious Wingman and most of the Bat-family, Damian manages to rescue his father and defeat most of the League of Shadows. However, Batman explains that the temporary defeat of the League will not stop a larger force to attack later and destroy the city, so he came to the extreme decision that the only solution possible is for Damian to return to his mother, a decision that caused an emotional reaction on Damian like never before. Death Damian is killed battling a brutal enemy, the Heretic (an adult Damian clone) in issue number 8 of the second volume of the Batman, Inc. comic book, which went on sale February 27, 2013. According to the story's writer, Grant Morrison: \\"He saves the world. He does his job as Robin. He dies an absolute hero\\". In the comic, Damian is fighting hordes of Leviathan henchmen in the lobby of Wayne Tower when Nightwing comes to rescue him. Behind cover, the two briefly reminisce about their time together as Batman and Robin before resuming the defense. When the Heretic arrives and knocks Nightwing out, Damian bravely fights him. However, the Heretic eventually gains the upper hand and impales Damian through the chest, the sword piercing Damian's heart and resulting in Damian dying almost instantly. Minutes after Damian's death, Batman arrives and sees Damian's dead body. Angered, he and a revived Nightwing battle the Heretic, but are eventually forced to retreat with Red Robin and Damian's body. After holding a private funeral for the fallen Boy Wonder, Bruce vows to avenge his son's death. The later storyline, Requiem, deals with the aftermath of Damian's death and Batman's thirst for revenge against Talia as well as his own increasingly unbalanced mental state resulting from this loss. He is buried next to Bruce Wayne's parents, Damian's paternal grandparents. Batman is also unwilling to accept his son's death, and begins seeking the means to resurrect Damian at the cost of his relationships with his friends and allies, and keeps his death a secret from the public in anticipation that his resurrection would succeed. Batman and Robin vol. 4 #19 (April 2013) Batman and Robin vol. 4 #20 (May 2013) Damian's absence has also been causing a conflict between his father and his acting instructor, Carrie Kelley, who is determined to find out what has happened to him, leading her to realize that the Waynes are harboring a secret.Batman and Robin vol. 2 #19 (April 2013) When Batman and Nightwing finally re-confront Heretic, they overpower him, and the clone suffers a brutal beating from both in retaliation for Damian's death. Batman, despite desiring to kill his son's murderer more than anything and Nightwing making no attempts of stopping his mentor, spares the villain's life after seeing his resemblance to Damian, realizing the clone is what is left of his son. However, Talia later kills the Heretic for his failure to kill Batman and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave. Batman, Incorporated vol. 2 #12 (July 2013) But Talia is killed following the duel by Kathy Webb, and it is later revealed that Damian's body was stolen from the Manor cemetery by the League of Assassins along with Talia's for plans against Batman in addition to making their resurrections.

Batman and Aquaman vol. 2 #29 (March 2014) Though Ra's attempts to resurrect Damian alongside Talia in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island, in addition, to brainwash his grandson into joining him afterward, instead Ra's discovers that it is a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit's former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra's flees with the bodies afterward.Batman and Wonder Woman vol. 2 #30 (April 2014) After Batman and Frankenstein locate Ra's and the bodies, they are too late as Ra's has successfully had them placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread of Damian's fate.

They later encounter Darkseid's elite member Glorious Godfrey, setting in motion the Robin Rises story arc.Batman and Ra's al Ghul vol. 2 #32 (June 2014) Return Later, Godfrey's reason for coming to Earth is revealed; to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian.

During the fight, Kalibak beats the team nearly to death, when suddenly Damian knocks out Kalibak with a powerful uppercut; discovering that due to the Chaos Shard he has gained superhuman abilities. While Damian fights Kalibak, Batman remotely controls the Batwing and sends it crashing into Kalibak, sending him back through the Boom Tube and then closes the portal.

Returning to assist his fellow Robins as the crisis reaches its conclusion, Damian helps Dick, Jason and Tim regain confidence in themselves after Mother decimates their initial efforts against her by recalling a conversation he had with Bruce where Bruce noted that he is proud of how all three of the other Robins have different strengths, Bruce wanting his partners to find their own paths rather than blindly follow his own example.Batman & Robin Eternal #22 Damian is also a major player in the Robin War event, where he, Agent 37 (Dick Grayson), Red Hood, and Red Robin organize a street gang called \\"Robins\\" to defeat the Court of Owls with reluctant aid from Jim Gordon, who is now Batman.

Mara has been made leader of a group known as the Demon's Fist, which was originally supposed to be led by Damian, but became hers when he chose to leave the League. They, too, have chosen targets that they must hunt down in order to ascend to the League. Damian decides to collect the other Demon's Fist's targets in order to form the new Teen Titans; this includes Starfire, Beast Boy, Raven and Kid Flash. After the events of Justice League: No Justice, the Titans disband. In his subsequent struggle with organized crime in Gotham and a mysterious crime lord known as The Other, Damian assembles a new team of Titans, consisting of Kid Flash (the only old team member to join), Kid Flash's friend and kid genius Roundhouse, Red Arrow, Lobo's daughter Crush, and the immortal spirit creature Djinn.Teen Titans Special #1 (2018), Teen Titans #20 (July 2018) This new team faces initial difficulties because of Red Arrow's criticism and the individualistic tendencies of several members. During a case in which Gizmo nearly detonates a nuclear device, Robin uses the ring to which Djinn is bound to grant her the use of her full powers to avert the crisis, and returns it afterwards, refusing to assume mastery over her. This earns him Djinn's trust, which gradually begins to turn into a mutual romantic attraction.Teen Titans #21 (August 2018) However, what Damian does not tell his teammates is that a deep cellar of the Titans' headquarters, a former juvenile detention facility, serves him as a secret dungeon to lock away the most dangerous criminals he captures for good, including Deathstroke, Gizmo, Brother Blood, Black Mask, and Atomic Skull.Teen Titans #20 (July 2018) His teammates are also unaware that he is working with Jason Todd, who goes by the alias Outlaw.Lobdell, Scott (w), Woods, Pete (a), Peteri, Troy (let), Marie Javins, Rob Levin (ed). \\"Outlaw, Part One\\" Red Hood and the Outlaws 26 (November, 2018), New York: DC Comics Due to a miscommunication, Damian can no longer trust him, which ultimately leads them to cut ties.

The team returned in The Adventures of the Super-Sons, where they spend their summer pursuing justice against Rex Luthor, an alien child who imitates Lex Luthor and attempts to assemble his own team of child-villains modeled after famous Earth ones.

Instead, Damian decides to begin killing criminals to invoke true fear in his enemies. This decision, coupled with his recent actions with holding criminals against their will and wiping their memories, leads to Djinn leaving the Teen Titans, while Kid Flash, Red Arrow, Crush, and Roundhouse turn against him. Damian attempts to kill KGBeast, but only succeeds in cutting off his left arm before the Titans intervene and stop him. Batman then arrives, having learned of his son's actions, declaring that the Teen Titans are finished.

Red Arrow is injured and Deathstroke escapes. Batman tries to convince Robin to come home with him, but Damian attacks him, declaring that Wayne Manor is a coffin and that Batman's views are not enough to save Gotham. At the height of his anger and frustration, Damian rips the Robin insignia off his chest and gives it to Batman. Declaring himself free, Damian leaves for parts unknown. Skills and Abilities Having been trained by the League of Assassins since birth, Damian is already an expert in martial arts and in wielding a wide range of weaponry. Despite his age, Damian has taken on and bested trained fighters like Talia Al Ghul, Red Hood (Jason Todd), Red Robin (Tim Drake), and the Joker, amongst others. He was also trained in the disciplines of forensics, acrobatics, criminology, disguise and escapology. Damian is skilled in mimicking voices and speech patterns of others accurately, as he was able to imitate his father's and Tim Drake's voices in order to bypass the Batcave's voice-recognition security systems. Damian is shown to have highly advanced engineering skills, as he was able to complete his father's plans of building a flying Bat-mobile, the construction of which Alfred described as \\"being an endless source of frustration to Damian's father.\\" Damian is also a capable businessman despite his young age, being involved with Wayne Enterprises and its board members. He also has been trained in numerous weapons as shown in the Blackest Night event.Batman: Blackest Night vol 1 #2 Damian possessed superpowers similar to that of Superman following his resurrection, though this was short-lived. However, he is shown to possess healing abilities and powers in the future. Appearance Damian Wayne on Batman and Robin #1 (August 2009). Art by Frank Quitely. Concerning the character's artificial gestation in respect to the al Ghuls' notable idealization of Bruce Wayne as the optimal specimen in leading the League of Assassins, Damian Wayne is warranted to be notably depicted in bearing a stark resemblance to his father. After stealing Jason Todd's Robin tunic and mask from his memorial case, Damian's unofficial appearance as Robin was wearing them over his black and white League of Assassins bodysuit with a grayish hood and cape. He carried a pair of brass knuckles, which he incorporated as part of this costume, and would also carry a sword. After Dick Grayson officially sanctioned Damian's role as Robin, while a standard Robin tunic was retained, the bodysuit was replaced with a black survival suit, the grayish cape with a yellow \\"para-cape\\" which grants him a gliding capability, the black mask with a green one, a bulkier utility belt to carry more weapons and gadgetry, a black hood, and green gloves and flexible boots. As of age 13, Damian was short for his age and had few other markers of impending puberty. In Super Sons, it was a running joke that he was frequently mistaken as younger than ten-year-old Jonathan Kent.

It was formed in 1987 in East Berlin by singer and mastermind Rex Joswig and keyboard player Dr Totenhöfer. Completing the band were Alexander Istschenko (guitar), Hans \\"Tomato\\" Narva (bass) and Benno Verch (drums). The band was one of Die anderen Bands who openly expressed their social and political criticism in lyrics and music. The name was derived from a book of the same title by French author Boris Vian. Fearing copyright problems they only used the abbreviation \\"H.I.P.\\" in official correspondence. Their live shows featured a weird mix of Russian, Chinese and Eastern European influenced personality cult. The lyrics were sung partly in German, English and Russian. Shortly after the Tiananmen Square Massacre in Beijing in May 1989 they lost their licence to play. This was due to Joswig's appeal for a minute of silence for the victims of the massacre during a previous concert. The ban became irrelevant when East Germany collapsed in autumn the same year. The Herbst in Peking song \\"Bakschischrepublik\\" became the hymn of East Germany's Rock music scene during the Wende. The lyrics included the line \\"Schwarz-Rot-Gold ist das System - morgen wird es untergehen\\" (Black-red-golden is the system - tomorrow it will fall). Unusually (for an East German band at this time), the recording received airplay in the UK from Radio 1 DJ, John Peel. Peel had received a copy of the single in the post, and he played it on several occasions in the winter of 1989 and spring of 1990. During the 90s the musical style of the band changed considerably, and their punk rock songs were now heavily influenced by dub, electronic music and industrial; spoken word tracks appeared on their records too. From 1991 to 1998 band mastermind Rex Joswig presented a radio show called Grenzpunkt Null (Border Point Zero) at the East German radio station DT 64 (later MDR Sputnik). Herbst in Peking concerts became more and more rare while the band line-up changed too. The last official Herbst in Peking gig was performed by Rex Joswig in May 2006 in Berlin's club Kaffee Burger. Herbst in Peking reformed in autumn 2008 and are back in the studio and on the road.

He was born into a peasant family near Kursk and studied in the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow, matriculating in 1964. Klykov's bronze statues did not conform to the precepts of Socialist Realism. His playful sculptural decor for the Central Musical Theatre for Children (1979) made him famous. In the late 1980s Klykov turned to the Russian Orthodox Church for inspiration and support. His public statue of Sergius of Radonezh in Radonezh (1987) was the first memorial installed in the Soviet Union without permission from the authorities. Klykov's other high- profile commissions include the memorial and church on the Field of Prokhorovka (1995), the public statues of Sts. Cyril and Methodius on Slavyanskaya Square (1991) and Marshal Zhukov on Manege Square (1995). He was also responsible for the statue of St. Vladimir in Kherson (1993) and several monuments to Nicholas II, including the first one erected in Russia, in 1996, which was blown up by anti-monarchists on several occasions. In the 1990s, Klykov created and ran the International Fund of Slavonic Literature and Culture, a nationalist organization with close connections to the Pamyat, and (later) Rodina. In July 1991, Klykov signed the open letter A Word to the People, an anti-Perestroika publication. In 1990s, Klykov was close to the CPRF; on 21 November 2005, he was elected the chairman of the re-founded Union of the Russian People. In 2005, he signed the \\"letter of 500\\", a controversial appeal to the Prosecutor General to review all Jewish organizations in Russia for extremism. In 2005, a reports circulated that Klykov had unveiled a statue in the village of Kholki that depicted Sviatoslav I of Kiev trampling a Khazar warrior with a prominently displayed Star of David. The Press Center of the Belgorod Regional Administration issued a response stating that while plans for a monument were underway, none had yet been erected in the region thus far, and that the design of the monument would show \\"respect towards representatives of all nationalities and religions.\\" The statue was eventually unveiled and the response by the Press Center has been confirmed. The statue is in the village of Kholki, near Belgorod.

Sugar Kat is a supermodel and the most popular girl in the world. Rebecca is Sugar's brainy (and sometimes jealous) twin sister. Together (along with Rebecca's cat Yearbook) they are the Kat and Kat Detective Agency and their specialty is supernatural mysteries. Drawn and written in a style that mixes Betty and Veronica with Hellboy, the underlying themes are the criticism of the cult of celebrity and racial stereotyping, subverting pop culture icons and cultural figures in comedic ways. Where's It At, Sugar Kat? first appeared in the third issue of SugarBuzz! in 1998. Since then there has been a one-shot special crossover with Andi Watson's Skeleton Key and a three-issue miniseries, collected later in a trade paperback edition. A 32-page story appears in the 2004 SugarBuzz collection, SugarBuzz! Your Ticket to Happiness. Film and television Where's It At, Sugar Kat? was optioned by The Walt Disney Corporation in 2000 with Carney and Phoenix as consultants. It was in development for four years as a live action show and then using stop motion animation. Despite several scripts and production of test footage, no finished product resulted. It has since been optioned again by an independent production company. Characters * Sugar Kat Sugar is the most popular girl in the world, described as a combination of Britney Spears and Jesus, due to her magical powers of attractiveness. She is irresistible to every creature in the world except for evil people, ghosts and monsters. She doesn't really do anything with this power and is content to be fabulously wealthy as the world's most popular celebrity supermodel. * Rebecca Kat Rebecca is Sugar's twin sister. She is the only person in the world who is unaffected by Sugar's magical attractiveness and resents having to live in Sugar's shadow. An over- achiever who has mastered all martial arts and speaks a dozen languages while curing the common cold, Rebecca is a super-intelligent private eye who takes on cases that prove too weird for normal investigators. Originally working solo, Rebecca is dismayed when Sugar decides to join her in the Kat Detective Agency because once again she will be unable to control her life. However, Sugar's powers are often useful on cases. * Yearbook Yearbook is the girls' pet cat. He got his name because his hair sticks up just like Rebecca's did in her class of '81 yearbook photo. He is a scaredy cat who faints whenever there is trouble and must be revived by artificial respiration. His true heroic nature is shown in the Skeleton Key/Sugar Kat crossover where his spirit is revealed to be that of a black panther. * Mr and Mrs Kat Not much has been revealed about Mr and Mrs Kat so far. He looks like a groovy African-American male with an afro and a mustache reminiscent of The Mod Squad. She looks like Samantha from Bewitched, which might explain Sugar's magical powers of attraction.

Baratos Afins is an indie record label operating in São Paulo City, Brazil. It was founded by Luiz Calanca in 1978, first as a record shop and later as a label. The idea for the label came about when Arnaldo Baptista, ex-vocalist and bassist for Os Mutantes arranged with Calanca to release his second solo album independently. Thus Baratos Afins history became forever intertwined with the (hi)story of rock in São Paulo. From then on the label released seminal albums by São Paulo's best upcoming underground rock acts: Fellini, Kafka, Vultos, Akira S. e as Garotas que Erraram, Voluntários da Pátria, Gueto, Smack, 3 Hombres and Mercenárias. The compilation Não São Paulo brought together four new bands and was so well received that a second volume was put together. All these bands possessed a heavy post punk influence but Baratos (as lovingly referred to by most record buying fans) did not intend to associate itself with any crowd in particular, and soon released the first heavy metal albums produced in Brazil: SP Metal, Volumes one and two. These albums included bands such as Korzus, Salário Mínimo… The albums even caught the attention of an up-and-coming young band from Minas Gerais state: Sepultura. Re-releases The label also began a campaign to re-release albums by Os Mutantes (Arnaldo's old group and one of Kurt Cobain´s favorite bands) that were exchanging hands at exorbitant prices among collectors. The PolyGram label created all kinds of obstacles to dissuade Calanca from licensing the records for release, but, finally, in 1984, Baratos Afins received a batch of all five Mutantes´ albums, thus paving the way for a new generation of rockers (both Brazilian and international) to finally hear one Brazil's first and finest rock bands. Along with os Mutantes the label also re-released long out of print albums by Tom Zé (one of which was picked up by David Byrne in Brazil and taken back to the US and consequently responsible for Tom Zé's discovery in the worldwide music market and his rehabilitation in Brazil's music scene), and Itamar Assumpção (an Afro-Brazilian singer-composer who managed to mix samba, funk and rock and transform it into an intoxicating new urban sound). His work was originally released on another label but was re-released by Baratos, first in vinyl and then in CD. In the 90's Baratos began to slowly re-release its albums in CD form, thus reaching a new audience both inside and outside the country. The label also went back to releasing compilations, mainly the two volume Brazilian Pebbles which showcases garage bands worthy of inclusion in the Nuggets collections. The first volume of the series mainly includes bands from São Paulo City, but volume two presents bands from other states and is a feast for those needing a healthy fix of fuzz guitar. The collections proved to be a testing ground for a new underground rock scene in SP populated by bands brought up on a healthy diet of 60's pop rock and 70's punk. Some of these bands proved to be so good that they released their own CDs. Such is the case of Os Skywalkers, Mákina du Tempo, Pipodélica and Gasolines. In addition to these bands Baratos also released an exceptionally fine album by Mopho, from Alagoas state, located in the northeast of Brazil, and a strong contender for best Beatles sound alike band of all time, but with its own updated take on the classic pop sound. All these bands leave nothing to their American and British counterparts. One listen is all it takes for rock aficionados worldwide to agree. Jazz Incursion Baratos also released some rather tasty Brazilian jazz albums by trombonist Bocato (unfortunately still unavailable on CD) and is now releasing two CDs by Brazilian guitar legend Lanny Gordin. Lanny set standards for Brazilian rock guitar that have yet to be surpassed, mixing a heavy Jimi Hendrix influence with jazz and Brazilian music. His guitar playing was found on some of the most influential music coming out of Brazil in the late 60's and early 70's: the music of Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Jards Macalé, Tim Maia and Gal Costa. Together with Arnaldo Baptista, Lanny is one of Brazilian rock's casualties, but he is still capable of making good music which can now be heard on Baratos two new releases.

His music and that of the band however soon evolved in a completely different direction, and he almost completely abandoned synthesizers in favor of the acoustic piano. History Born in Lindau am Bodensee, Germany on 23 February 1944, Fricke started playing piano as a child. He studied piano, composition and directing at the Conservatories in Freiburg and Munich. It was in Munich that, at 18, he dedicated himself to new kinds of music like free jazz. He also filmed some short amateur films. (He would later become a movie and music critic for the German magazine Der Spiegel and the Swiss paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung). It was also in Munich that he met Gerhard Augustin, who for many years would be his producer. In 1967 he met German film director Werner Herzog and the two formed a lifelong friendship. Fricke played a role in his first movie Lebenszeichen (1968). Fricke was later responsible for the soundtracks of several of Herzog's movies, among them Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (with Klaus Kinski and Bruno Ganz), Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Heart of Glass.Music for Films by Werner Herzog from popolvuh.nl retrieved on December 5, 2008 Fricke also made a cameo appearance in Herzog's Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle (1974). Fricke was one of the first musicians to own and use a Moog III synthesizer, with which he recorded Popol Vuh's first two albums \\"Affenstunde\\" and \\"In den Gärten Pharaos\\". His recordings with the instruments left an indelible mark on German electronic music. However, he later significantly gave his Moog to fellow German musician Klaus Schulze and largely renounced electronic music in favor of often-acoustic tones. In 1970, together with Holger Truelzsch and Frank Fiedler, he founded the group Popol Vuh. The name is taken from a Mayan manuscript (see \\"Popol Vuh\\").The German group should not be confused with the homonymous rock band from Norway (see: Popol Ace) Fricke was the leader of the group until his death, almost always together with guitarist and drummer Daniel Fichelscher. Fricke also recorded an album of Mozart compositions. Besides working on his own music, Fricke collaborated with many German musicians. In 1972 he played on Tangerine Dream's Zeit double album and collaborated with Renate Knaup of Amon Düül II. Together with Fichelscher, from 1973 to 1974 he was a member of former Popol Vuh guitarist Connie Veit's band Gila. In 1992 he recorded an album of Mozart compositions. In the 1998 he organized audio/video installations, among them \\"Messa di Orfeo\\" in the Italian city of Molfetta. Beginning in the '70s, Fricke dedicated himself to musicotherapy. He also developed an original form of therapy called the \\"Alphabet of the Body\\".Das Alphabet des Körpers, interview with Fricke in popolvuh.nl retrieved on December 5, 2008 (in German) Together with former Popol Vuh member Frank Fiedler, who was a competent cameraman, Fricke produced a series of films of spiritual inspiration set in the Sinai desert, Israel, Lebanon, Mesopotamia, Morocco, Afghanistan, Tibet and Nepal.Florian Fricke's Filmography from popolvuh.nl, retrieved on December 5, 2008 Fricke died of a stroke in Munich in 2001, at the age of 57. In October 2003 Klaus Schulze wrote: :\\"Florian was and remains an important forerunner of contemporary ethnic and religious music. He chose electronic music and his big Moog to free himself from the restraints of traditional music, but soon discovered that he didn't get a lot out of it and opted for the acoustic path instead. Here, he went on to create a new world, which Werner Herzog loves so much, transforming the thought patterns of electronic music into the language of acoustic ethno music.\\"Klaus Schulze, Oldau, October 7, 2003: Booklet to CD re-issue of \\"Hosianna Mantra\\", SPV recordings, 2004 Florian Fricke solo albums *Die Erde und ich sind Eins (\\"The Earth and I Are One\\", 1983) – limited private pressing *Florian Fricke Plays Mozart (1992) – featuring Fricke on piano playing Mozart compositions For his albums with Popol Vuh, see Popol Vuh.

Established in 1951 as a woodworking and cabinetry firm, Matsumoku is remembered as a manufacturer of guitars and bass guitars, including some Epiphone and Aria guitars. (There is occasional confusion between \\"Matsumoku\\" and \\"Matsumoto\\". Matsumoto is a town in Japan's Nagano Prefecture, where FujiGen Gakki, Gotoh, and other musical instrument companies have manufacturing plants. Matsumoto Musical Instrument Manufacturers Association is also the name of a musical instrument manufacturing cooperative, headed by Gotoh). History In 1951, Matsumoku was founded as Matsumoto Mokko (\\"Matsumoto Woodworking Company\\") by Mr. Tsukada in Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan. It was a family-owned woodworking business that specialized in building tansu cabinets [In English: \\"[Sometime between 1946-1951,] When he [Harayama] had been subcontracted with Shinshu Mokko [Shinshu Woodworking Company], he and other two persons, Mr. Aoyama and Mr. Hosokawa, were together making furniture. ... Mr. Tsukada of Shinshu Mokko had often visited there [Sakae-machi ?] for preliminary inspection, and later that place became Matsumoto Mokko. / ... Mr. Tsukada had served as a factory director [of Shinshu Mokko] ... he left the company and founded Matsumoto Mokko in Sakae-machi [, Matsumoto city]. (Matsumoto Mokko was founded in February 1951, and relocated to Minami- Matsumoto in March 1960, and the guitar manufacturing was started in April 1963)\\"] and butsudan. Shortly after the World War II (1939-1945), the Singer Corporation had established a Japanese subsidiary, Singer Sewing Machine Company Japan, and set up production facilities in Nagoya. Singer contracted Matsumoku Industrial to build its sewing machine cabinets, and in 1951 Matsumoku became a partially owned subsidiary of Singer Japan. Matsumoku also branched out into building cabinets for manufacturers of televisions and \\"hi- fi\\" amplifiers. Production In the early 1960s (or mid-1950s), Matsumoku began to look into other woodworking markets when several subcontracts of Singer were moved to the Philippines [In English: (In 1963, subcontracted work making tables for Singer Sewing Machine had been moved to the Philippines, and so Matsumoku immediately faced the need for other work. \\"They [FujiGen] asked Matsumoku's managing director (later president) Tsukada to collaborate in the drying of its stock of wood. This, Tsukada later said, was an unexpected and good offer from the viewpoint of Matsumoku. Matsumoku therefore decided to collaborate with FujiGen on all wood processing, including the making of bodies and necks for FujiGen guitars. \\"] and, as it had on its staff several skilled luthiers, ventured into guitar and violin production in 1963. Modest classical guitars, small steel-stringed acoustic guitars, mandolins and violins were built and marketed in the mid-1960s. However, as other Japanese companies were producing similar instruments, Matsumoku set out to distinguish itself by producing high-quality acoustic and electric archtop guitars. Several of Matsumoku's early archtop guitars survive, most owing their basic designs to Hofner, Framus, and Gibson. By the early 1960s, Matsumoku had acquired new mills, lathes and specialized presses and began to increase musical-instrument production. This new equipment, operated by its staff of skilled craftsmen, enabled Matsumoku to realize the mass production of high-quality guitars. By the early 1970s, Matsumoku had begun using CNC (computer numerical controlled) mills, routers, and lathes, one of the first guitar makers to do so. This created a significant economy of scale, allowing the company to rely upon factory automation rather than skilled labor for rough shaping of components and basic assembly tasks. Even so, 60% of the construction process was still done by hand, including planing, fretting, joining, and assembly. This machine-cut yet hand-worked process offered improved profit margins at lower unit prices and yielded high quality instruments with unique character. Matsumoku produced guitars, or parts of guitars, for Vox, Guyatone, FujiGen Gakki, Kanda Shokai (Greco), Hoshino Gakki (Ibanez), Nippon Gakki (Yamaha), Hondo professional series (USA guitar company), Aria and Norlin (parent company of Gibson). American owned Unicord contracted Matsumoku to build most of its Univox and Westbury guitars. St. Louis Music imported Matsumoku-built Electra Guitars. J. C. Penney sold Matsumoku-built Skylark guitars through its catalog division. Matsumoku built many early Greco guitars as well as Memphis, Vantage, Westbury, Westminster, C.G.Winner, Cutler, Lyle and Fell. Washburn Guitars contracted with Matsumoku to build some of its electric guitars and basses from 1979 through 1984. Though the names above reflect Matsumoku's involvement, many of the names were later sold to other companies, which made guitars that were completely different in quality and sound. Although its name began appearing on neck-bolt plates, headstocks, and sound-hole labels in the 1970s, Matsumoku's role in the making of guitars under contract was largely unknown outside of Japan's guitar-making circles. Matsumoku's contract with St. Louis Music, which had marketed Matsumoku-made guitars under the Electra name, was taken over by Unicord, which owned the Westone name, and the guitars Matsumoku built during the resulting transitional phase bear the dual name Electra-Westone. Matsumoku's final phase as a maker of guitars under contract was making the Westbury, Westminster and Westone brands owned by American importer/marketer Unicord (which named those brands after the location of its headquarters in Westbury, Connecticut). In 1979, however, when its contract with Matsumoku came to an end, Unicord chose not to renew it but rather to cut costs by moving production to Korea. Thus, once again, Matsumoku found itself in need of work. This time, though, rather than seeking a new distributor, Matsumoku began to self-market its guitars under its own brand name: Vantage. Aria Shiro Arai founded Arai and Company in 1953 as an importer of classical guitars. In 1960, Arai contracted Guyatone to manufacture guitars. At the time, Guyatone was one of Japan's leading musical instrument manufacturers. However, when exported to the western United States, the drier American climates caused early Guyatone-produced guitars various problems: bindings became unglued, backs split, and necks broke just below the headstock. Guyatone could not meet Arai's production requirements, and in 1964, Arai and Company contracted for musical instrument manufacturing with Matsumoku. Arai addressed these issues early on with Matsumoku's management. The solution was to use wood that had been dried for at least two years, stronger glues with longer clamp times, and one feature that remained throughout Matsumoku's production: the 3-piece maple neck. Besides Matsumoku, Aria had two factories that produced guitars, one of which made classical guitars, and another that made medium-grade and specialty guitars. But the relationship between the two companies was both amicable and symbiotic. Aria focused on sales in both domestic and export markets and provided design development, while Matsumoku devoted its energies to engineering and building guitars and other stringed instruments. Throughout its 22-year business relationship, Aria remained Matsumoku's principal client. Matsumoku often preferred using Aria as its business agent, and many of Matsumoku's contracts were written by Aria with Matsumoku stated or implied as sub-contracted manufacturer. Arai and Company guitars were briefly labeled Arai, but switched to the familiar Aria around 1966. From the 1975 arrival of design engineer Nobuaki Hayashi currently with Atlansia) onward, however, all Aria guitars were labeled Aria Pro II. Hayashi's pseudonym, \\"H. Noble\\", appeared on many of the Aria Pro II instruments he designed. Aria's guitars that followed showed remarkable design innovation and a definitive move away from Gibson and Fender formats. Hayashi is best known as the designer of the Aria Pro II, SB-1000 bass and the Aria Pro II PE-series guitars. Some of these were made with maple bodies, but higher-end models such as the PE1000 with Protomatic pickups and the PE1500 with DiMarzio pickups, had ash bodies. These ash-bodied guitars were produced only in relatively small numbers for the domestic market; most, however, had maple bodies. Some guitars were produced with the urushi finish and, again, these, in both red and brown urushi lacquer, were produced mostly for the domestic market. The vast majority of these have ash bodies, whereas the export models were made mainly of maple. Matsumoku also manufactured drum kits under the Aria name, initially under licence from Remo, which had identified a gap in the market for low-cost drum kits in the compact 5-piece \\"rock\\" configuration as innovated by the Rogers PowerTone range in the early 1970s. Epiphone Gibson decided to move Epiphone production to Japan in the early 1970s and chose Aria as its contractor. As a subcontractor to Aria, Matsumoku manufactured most electric Epiphones made in Japan from 1970 through 1986 (a few solid body electrics were made by other Japanese manufacturers and at least one model was made in Taiwan). Models include the solid body ET series (Crestwood) the SC series (Scroll) and the Model 1140 (Flying V) as well as Epiphone's archtop electric guitars: 5102T/EA-250, Sheraton, Riviera, Casino, and Emperor. Early Matsumoku made Epiphone archtops and hollow-body basses had four-point bolt on necks. As production costs of bolt on neck guitars were less, some guitarists regarded them as inferior instruments. However, it was not the neck construction that was inferior (as described below, many Matsumoku-built necks were of premium quality). Rather, it was the lack of reinforcement in the neck pocket area, which could enable, that area to act like a hinge, causing future problems with high action due to tension on the body's neck pocket from the strings. Collectors of Matsumoku guitars from this period have often solved this problem by fabricating and installing permanent custom neck shims. Set neck archtop guitars followed in late 1975. Specifications on Epiphone archtops changed throughout the Matsumoku era. Gibson changed the look and sound of Epiphone's best selling archtop, the Casino, when production shifted to Japan. Upon its introduction in 1964, the Casino was a strong seller with rock guitarists, but sales stalled in the late 1960s. Gibson decided to remarket it toward jazz players and changed the tailpiece to one from a Riviera, and the pickups to mini-humbuckers. The result was a Casino that looked more like a short scale Riviera. The Casino was restored to its 1965 specifications around 1975, about the same time Matsumoku began production of set neck archtops. Distinguishing characteristics Back of an Aria Pro II, CSB-400 showing 3 piece maple neck Many Matsumoku built guitars, including Epiphone archtops, utilized a 3 piece maple neck with the center section's grain-oriented 90 degrees from the side wood. This created a very strong neck not prone to splitting or warping. An often used variation of this is the 5 piece neck with two thin trim strips of walnut or ebony separating the 3 sections. Matsumoku made many neck-through- body solid-body electric guitars and basses, most with 5 piece necks. Matsumoku often utilized the Nisshin Onpa company (who own the Maxon Effects brand) as a subcontractor for its pickups. Some Maxon pickups have Maxon's \\"M\\" logo stamped on the back. The name Matsumoku appeared on the neck bolt plate of some guitars they built. Early Grecos and some 1980s Aria Pro IIs have Matsumoku on the neck bolt plate. Other neck plates were blank or simply had the word \\"Japan\\" stamped on them. Many Matsumoku set-neck guitars and basses have the inspector's hon (name stamp) stamped inside the neck pick-up cavity. End of production 1983 Epiphone Casino, Hon (Name Stamp) \\"Kuro\\" - likely the name of the inspector. \\"78\\" is production number and not year. Gibson restructured after being sold by Norlin and began to move its Epiphone production to other Japanese manufacturers and to Korea. By 1986, the home sewing machine market was in heavy decline and Singer was nearly bankrupt. Matsumoku could not afford to buy itself out of Singer and in 1987, closed down. After Matsumoku ceased operations, Aria continued production of Aria Pro II guitars and basses through its own factories and other manufactures. Some top line and special edition guitars are still manufactured in Japan, however, most Aria guitars are now produced in Korea and China. Information about Matsumoku's contribution to guitar making is better known now due in large part to the Internet. Matsumoku's products enjoy a strong following among devoted enthusiasts.

Biography  Rocaberti was born into a noble family at Perelada, in Catalonia. Educated at Girona, he entered the Dominican convent there, receiving the habit in 1640. His success in theological studies at the convent of Valencia secured for him the chair of theology in the University of Valencia. In 1666 he was chosen provincial of Aragon, and in 1670 the General Chapter elected him general of the order. The celebrated Dominican Vincent Contenson dedicated to him his Theologia mentis et cordis. In 1676 he was appointed by Carlos II of Spain first Archbishop of Valencia, and then governor of that province. In 1695 he was made inquisitor- general of Spain. He obtained the canonization of Sts. Louis Bertrand and Rose of Lima, the solemn beatification of Pius V, and the annual celebration in the order of the feast of Bl. Albert the Great and others. Historian John Langdon- Davies described Rocaberti as a \\"fanatical ascetic, he never wore linen or silk, he only ate vegetables and fish, his bed was more like a martyr's rack than a high ecclesiastic's resting place.\\"Langdon-Davies, John.

A worker-priest was any priest who was \\"freed from parochial work by his bishop, lived only by full- time labor in a factory or other place of work, and was indistinguishable in appearance from an ordinary workingman\\". Although the movement did spread to many other countries such as Belgium and Italy, the French were always the most prominent. The movement was an attempt to \\"rediscover the masses\\" of industrial class workers who had become largely disaffected with the church.Siefer, 1964, p. 4. History Father Jacques Loew, who began working in the docks of Marseilles in 1941, effectively started the worker-priest movement.Corley, Felix. 1999, February 27. \\"Fr. Jacques Loew: Spawned the Worker-Priest Movement.\\" The Catholic - Labor Network. Loew had been sent by his Dominican Father Lebret to \\"study the condition of the working classes\\" but not to actually join the workers. In 1944, the first worker-priest missions were set up in Paris under Emmanuel Célestin Suhard, and then later in Lyons and Marseille. The Church hoped, by \\"putting young priests into secular clothes and letting them work in factories, to regain the confidence of the French working class, which [had] almost completely abandoned the Catholic faith.\\"Time. 1953, December 14. \\"Urbi et Orbi\\". = Gradual suppression = In 1945, Pope Pius XII \\"approved (reluctantly) the daring social experiment of the French worker-priests.\\" However, in the early 1950s, the worker-priest movement fell out of favor with the Vatican due to their role in left-wing politics and perceived abandonment of the traditional priesthood. The Worker-Priest movement was \\"severely constrained by a series of measures taken by the church in the 1950s\\". In 1950, Pius XII in an apostolic exhortation on the priestly life expressed \\"reservations and suspicions of the worker-priests …\\"Holmes, J. Derek, and Bernard W. Bickers. A Short History of the Catholic Church. London: Burns and Oates, 1983. 281. Loew's May 1951 report defending the movement, written to Giovanni Montini (future Pope Paul VI), the assistant Cardinal Secretary of State, was not well received. Many of the priests joined in campaigns for improved pay and conditions and the movement became prominent in the industrial unrest of 1952 and 1953. This resulted in the factory owners complaining to the Catholic Church that the priests were being divisive by supporting the unions. The French bishops informed the worker-priests that they must return to their parishes. About 50, however, chose to stay on at their work.Collins, Peter. \\"The Demise of the Worker Priests.\\" Uniya Newsletter (autumn 1995): 12. http://home.vicnet.net.au/~cardoner/uniya/un5au12.txt. Moreover, by 1953, of some 90 priests, 10 had married, and about 15 were working with the communists. \\"the Pope sent verbal orders that the movement be suppressed, but the French cardinals managed to persuade the Pope to allow the worker-priests to continue 'in principle,' after some major changes in the setup.\\" In November 1953, all worker priests were recalled and required to leave their work and unions.Fr. Jacques Loew: Spawned the Worker-Priest Movement, By: Felix Corley In 1954, Loew acquiesced to the Vatican and quit his job; he then established the Saints Peter and Paul Mission to Workers, which trained priests from among the working class. Loew then travelled to Africa, then worked in the favelas of São Paulo, Brazil from 1964 to 1969, and then established the School of Faith in Fribourg, Switzerland. The theology of the Worker-Priest is in part contained within Loew's publications: Les dockers de Marseille (1944), En mission prolétarienne (1946), Les Cieux ouverts: chronique de la mission Saints Pierre et Paul (1971), and Face to Face with God: the Bible's Way to Prayer (1977). In 1963, priests were allowed to return to the industrial workplaces, and in the 1990s there were about 2,000 priests of the workers mission in France, although they were aging in line with the wider population of Catholic priests in that country. Later influence However, the worker priests had gained certain insights about the alienation of the Church from the modern world and the poor from their experience as workers. These had been shared with many others including the Bishops by means of letters, newsletters, books and meetings and the then Papal Nuncio to France, Archbishop Angelo Roncalli. When Roncalli became Pope John XXIII in 1958, he called the Second Vatican Council, at least partly as a result of what the worker priests had revealed. During that Council, the French and Belgian Bishops in particular were very influential in shaping its direction towards renewal and engagement with the modern world. On the advice of his mentor Cardinal Sapieha, Karol Wojtyla (future Pope John Paul II) and a fellow Polish priest studying in Italy, Stanislaw Starowieyski, travelled to France and Belgium to acquaint themselves with the worker-priest movement.Cornwell, John. 2004. The Pope In Winter. Viking. . pp. 25-26. Wojtyla, who had also performed hard labor during his time as a seminarian, reportedly admired the worker-priests. On his return in 1947, Wojtyla wrote a piece on the worker- priests for the Tygodnik Powszechny.Cornwell, 2004, p. 33. Wojtyla wrote: \\"Father Loew came to the conclusion that the [Dominican] white habit by itself does not say anything any more today.\\" A similar movement emerged in the Church of England in the 1960s.Bonn and Doyle, 1974, p. 327. Current practice It is somewhat common, though not the rule or norm, for religious brothers and sisters, and for some religious order priests, even some in contemplative life, to have learned and to practice, to a greater or lesser degree, some trade or profession besides the sacred sciences like philosophy or theology (such as education, medicine, law, nursing, farming, accounting, business, lab sciences). Some diocesan (secular, or non-religious) priests in the West and East also do this, either full-time or part-time. Any such training and work is carried out with the advice of the spiritual director and confessor, and with the consent and advice, or, if applicable, the command or request, of the pastor and the Ordinary (the Bishops or their equivalents as diocesan superiors in church law), or the local male or female religious order superior. If the religious or the cleric is still in formation, the rector and the vocation director would normally need to give their consent, as well. The place where the individual is to go for admittance and their training, and the place of employment, must also consent.

It was developed by Winter Wolves and was released as shareware for the Macintosh and Windows platforms. Gameplay The game plays like a sandlot game where the player creates their druid and then explores randomly generated dungeons to gain experience, fight in a tournament or play the \\"Quest Mode\\". The initial druid creation, similarly to the classic “Character Creation” present in many RPGs, is the first step in playing a game in Aravorn. The creation is rather simple, and consists of choosing a starting magic school, a gender and a character \\"background\\". The player's druid initially starts at level 1, and is quite powerless. The player needs to gain experience to obtain higher levels (and thus more power). This can be done in 3 different ways: Gather Artifacts - If the player chooses this option, they can roam freely throughout the entire kingdom of Aravorn in search of interesting places like abandoned temples, enchanted forests, cursed islands, and so on. Each of these special places has hidden treasures: whether a magic formula, an amulet, a rune, or something else, each of these objects will increase the druid's power, as well as experience, thus helping to increase a character's level. Challenge Druid - The second option leads the player to the Black Tower, the place where the druids challenge one other to duels every year. There will be 16 different druids in the tournament and the player will challenge them to a duel. Play proceeds to the death, until the winners are announced. Quest Mode - This new playing mode introduces the player to various quests, each with its own custom story and new avatars. The player can also use new creatures from the realm of Life and Spirit Magic, and as well new unique neutral creatures and/or characters. New quest will be released periodically every 3–4 months free of charge for registered users. The main gameplay occurs on the battle screen, where the player can place their Avatars (cards) in two rows. The first one can do both melee (close) and long-range attacks, while the second one can do only long-range attacks. There are over 20 player-controlled avatars and over 40 \\"neutral\\" ones that occasionally can be controlled by the player itself during the Quest Mode. The game plays like a classic turn-based game, with each side attacking/defending. The player can also cast spells that they have acquired to empower their avatars or weaken their enemies. Druids also have inventories of items, each one with particular properties, that can be worn during battles to help them defeat opponents.

She was ordered in 1918 and completed in 1923. She served in the Second World War first as the armed merchant cruiser HMS Mooltan (F75) and then as a troop ship. She was retired from P&O; service in 1953 and scrapped in 1954. Mooltan was unusual in combining both quadruple-expansion steam engines and turbo-electric transmission. When completed in 1923 she had only her quadruple-expansion engines, but in 1929 turbo generators and electric propulsion motors were added alongside them to increase her speed. Building P&O; ordered Mooltan and her sister from Harland and Wolff Ltd on 29 November 1918. Mooltan was given yard number 587. She was launched on 15 January 1923, completed on 22 September 1923, undertook sea trials and was handed over to her owners on 21 September 1923. She was named Mooltan after the city of Multan in the Punjab, and an earlier \\"RMS Mooltan (1905–1917)\\", that was lost to enemy action in 1917, which was in turn named after a still earlier \\"SS Mooltan (1861–1884)\\", a Peninsular and Oriental Company's screw steamer whose maiden voyage was from Southampton in 1861. This ship was withdrawn from service in 1874 and laid up in London. In 1880, she was sold to Messrs Elles & Co of Liverpool, and again to J. J. Wallace of London. In 1884 she was sold again, this time to J. Pedley of London, and renamed the \\"Eleanor Margaret\\" and underwent conversion to a four masted barque. In 1888 sold yet again to J. D. Bischoff of Bremen. In 1891, she sailed from Newcastle upon Tyne for Valparaiso, and was reported missing in the North Atlantic. Last known position being 45°N, 25°W.SS Mooltan 1861–1884 T G Dutton The new Mooltan was the first P&O; ship to exceed 20,000 tons. She had 56 corrugated furnaces heating six double-ended and two single-ended boilers that had a combined heating surface of . These supplied steam at 215 lbf/in2 to her two four-cylinder inverted direct acting quadruple-expansion steam engines. Mooltan had broad decks and gained a reputation for great steadiness, but her speed was sacrificed for reliability and comfort. She had a small rudder that impaired handling. She had two funnels, but the second was a dummy that served as an engine room ventilator rather than a smokestack. Mooltan was finished in P&O;'s traditional colours: her hull black with a white band, her boot topping red, her upper works and lifeboats buff, her large vents black, her small vents buff and her two funnels black. Pre-war service Mooltan started her maiden voyage on 5 October 1923. She left the Port of Tilbury, sailed via Suez canal and called at Colombo, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Melbourne before reaching Sydney, Australia on 21 December 1923. In 1929 Mooltans engines were supplemented with British Thomson-Houston exhaust-driven turbo generators powering electric propulsion motors. The addition of turbo-electric power alongside her original quadruple- expansion engines increased her total installed power to 2,878 NHP and raised her top speed to . Her accommodation was also revised. In 1931 all her accommodation was again revised and improved. In 1933 Mooltan carried Douglas Jardine's MCC cricket test team home to England after the controversial \\"Bodyline\\" Test Series. In 1938 she was altered to allow her to carry chilled beef. War service On 6 September 1939, just after the outbreak of the Second World War, Mooltan was requisitioned to be an armed merchant cruiser. Her conversion included removing her dummy second funnel to improve the arc of her anti-aircraft guns. Later on in the war the funnel was replaced but in a shorter form. On 15 October 1939 she was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Mooltan (F75). Her naval service was divided between the South Atlantic Station (October 1939 – April 1940 and June – July 1940) and the Freetown Escort Force (May 1940 and August 1940 – January 1941). Mooltan did not lose any of the merchant vessels that she escorted. On 31 July 1940 she was in the Western Approaches en route from Plymouth to Freetown when a German reconnaissance aircraft attacked her, but she survived intact. On 20 January 1941 Mooltan was returned for conversion to a Ministry of War Transport troop ship. The work was started by R&H; Green and Silley Weir Ltd in Tilbury and completed at Newcastle upon Tyne by May 1941. In 1941 she carried troops out to the Middle East. In October – November 1942 Mooltan took part in Operation Torch. She carried US Army troops from Britain to land at Arzew, about east of Oran in French Algeria. The troops embarked at Bristol, England, and on 22 October 1942 they were joined by a few USAAF Twelfth Air Force anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) officers commanded by a Colonel Franklin K. Fagan, who was ordered to organise the ship's air defence for the voyage. The only gunners aboard were two British Royal Marines, so Fagan selected 174 men from the US 815th Engineer Battalion and got the two Royal Marines to train them all. The Marines then served as pointers for Mooltans two six-inch guns. Mooltan sailed to the landing fleet's rendezvous in the Firth of Clyde, where more US troops embarked including the 439th Signal Battalion. The fleet departed from the Clyde on 26 October, with Mooltan stationed on the port rear flank of the convoy. The convoy was not attacked, but Mooltan used her exposed position to give her improvised gun crews plenty of firing practice. The Operation Torch landings started at 0400 hrs on 8 November. At 0800 hrs Mooltan entered the Gulf of Arzew and dropped anchor, and Royal Navy landing craft immediately took her US troops ashore to \\"Z\\" Beach. Mooltan was returned to P&O; after the war on 16 July 1947. Post-war service Brisbane After her return in 1947, P&O; had Mooltan completely reconditioned before returning her to commercial use. On 26 August 1948 she returned to service; now she was and carried 1,030 tourist class passengers. Most of the outward traffic was Ministry of Transport emigration work, carrying \\"Ten Pound Poms\\" to Australia under an assisted passage scheme established and run by the Australian government. The return trips were filled with P&O;'s own passengers. In April 1949 the Mooltan arrived at Tilbury the day after a passenger, 69-year-old Richard Allen, had died. The cause was smallpox, but the passenger list gave his cause of death as chickenpox. For the next three days Mooltan was quarantined before any of her passengers or crew could disembark. In this time five more passengers died. On 18 November 1953 SS Mooltan left Brisbane, Australia, on her last voyage, reaching Tilbury on 7 January 1954. Her mainly Asian crew joined the brand new RMS Arcadia three weeks later. On 23 January 1954 P&O; sold Mooltan for £150,000 to the British Iron & Steel Corporation and she was taken to Metal Industries Ltd at Faslane in Scotland, where she was broken up.

M., Bentz, S. E., and Douglass L. W. (2005). Evaluation of 19 American Elm Clones for Tolerance to Dutch Elm Disease .Journal of Environmental Horticulture, March 2005, Horticultural Research Institute, Washington, D.C. The Liberty elm is reportedly suitable for street planting, being tolerant of de-icing salts and air pollution. However, examples included in 10-year trials at Atherton, California to evaluate replacements for Californian elms lost to disease did not perform well. The late Professor Eugene Smalley summarized 'American Liberty' as \\"not as resistant as the Asian hybrids, but it still has the look of a classic American Elm\\" Description Generally similar to the species. Pests and diseases The six clones which comprise this series vary considerably in their level of resistance to Dutch elm disease, and none is immune, but some evidence suggests that at least one of the six clones may have a fairly high degree of DED-resistance . It is claimed, controversially, by ERI that fewer than 180 American Liberty elm trees have been known to succumb to DED since the planting began in the early 1980s. This figure is surprising in the light of Townsend & Douglass's work,Townsend A. M. & Douglass, L. W. (2001). Variation among American Elm Clones in Long-term Dieback, Survival, and Growth Response to Ophiostoma Inoculation. Journal of Environmental Horticulture, June 2001. 150-154., Horticultural Research Institute, Washington, D.C. which found that the Liberty elms exhibited only an 18% survival rate four years after inoculation, compared with 96% for both 'Valley Forge' and 'Princeton', and 100% for the Japanese elm clone 'Prospector'. The 'American Liberty' elms also sustained wind damage in winter, and high levels of injury from the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola. Accordingly, the cultivar was deemed \\"highly questionable as a replacement\\".Costello, L. R. (2004). A 10 -year evaluation of the performance of four elm cultivars in California, U. S.

Cultivation Promoted exclusively by the Elm Research Institute (ERI) since 1983, these trees have been planted across the United States in numbers the organization claims to be in excess of 250,000.

Most of the texts preserved are in Middle Irish or in early Modern Irish, however, even though the manuscripts were very plentiful, very few have been published. It is considered a period of great literary stability due to the formalised literary language that changed very little. Background According to the Uraicecht Becc in Old Irish Law, bards and filid were distinct groups: filid involved themselves with law, language, lore and court poetry, whereas bards were verifiers. However, in time, these terms came to be used interchangeably. With the arrival of Christianity, the poets were still giving a high rank in society, equal to that of a bishop, but even the highest-ranked poet, the ollamh was now only 'the shadow of a high-ranking pagan priest or druid.' The bards memorized and preserved the history and traditions of clan and country, as well as the technical requirements of the various poetic forms, such as the dán díreach (a syllabic form which uses assonance, half rhyme and alliteration). Much of their work consists of extended genealogies and almost journalistic accounts of the deeds of their lords and ancestors: the Irish bard was not necessarily an inspired poet, but rather a professor of literature and letters, highly trained in the use of a polished literary medium, belonging to a hereditary caste of high prestige in a conservative, aristocratic society, and holding an official position therein by virtue of extensive training and knowledge. Role in Irish and Scottish society As officials of the court of king or chieftain, they performed a number of official roles, such as chroniclers and satirists. Effectively, their job was to praise their employers and curse those who crossed them. Their approach to official duties was very traditional and drawn from precedent. However, even though many bardic poets were traditional in their approach, there were also some who added personal feelings into their poems and also had the ability to adapt with changing situations although conservative. While they were employed by kings and other powerful figures in Irish society, bards also acted independently and were highly respected individuals for their own power. Irish society focused largely on a fame or shame mentality. Which one you received largely depended on if the bard liked you or not, therefore, many people would go out of their way to please the bards in the hopes that they would get a song or poem composed about them. The Irish people had no illusions about death, knowing that everything eventually died, but they believed the way into immortality was through a great story that only a bard could compose. This led the bards to have great power among the Irish because the ability to provide great fame or great shame to any individual. The bardic tradition was incredibly important to Irish society and even infatuated many outsiders. This sparked a tradition of founding bardic schools which often only would teach to people that had a bard in their family history. Other requirements included being skilled at reading and having a good memory. In these schools the fundamentals of being a bard were taught and often students would have to compose overnight so as to not be able to write things down, therefore keeping the oral tradition alive. The next morning they would be allowed to write them down, perform them, and critique their compositions. Overall, these schools were at least partly responsible for keeping the bardic tradition alive into the modern era. Example The following is an example of a bardic poem from the translations of Osborn Bergin: > Consolations > > Filled with sharp dart-like pens > Limber tipped and firm, newly trimmed > Paper cushioned under my hand > Percolating upon the smooth slope > The leaf a fine and uniform script > A book of verse in ennobling Goidelic. > > I learnt the roots of each tale, branch > Of valour and the fair knowledge, > That I may recite in learned lays > Of clear kindred stock and each person's > Family tree, exploits of wonder > Travel and musical branch > Soft voiced, sweet and slumberous > A lullaby to the heart. > > Grant me the gladsome gyre, loud > Brilliant, passionate and polished > Rushing in swift frenzy, like a blue edged > Bright, sharp-pointed spear > In a sheath tightly corded; > The cause itself worthy to contain. > > Anonymous An example of a bardic poet can also be seen in the novel The Year of the French (1979) by Thomas Flanagan. In this book, a character by the name of Owen MacCarthy is a bard known for his training with the native language as well as English. He is turned to write specific, important letters by a group named the \\"Whiteboys\\". They are in need of someone skilled with writing letters, such as a bard like MacCarthy.

He was born in Cork, sixth child and eldest son of Osborn Roberts Bergin and Sarah Reddin, and was educated at Queen's College Cork (now University College Cork). He then went to Germany for advanced studies in Celtic languages, working with Heinrich Zimmer at the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin (now the Humboldt University of Berlin) and later with Rudolf Thurneysen at the University of Freiburg, where he wrote his dissertation on palatalization in 1906. He then returned to Ireland and taught at the School of Irish Learning and at University College Dublin. Within one year of becoming Director of the School of Irish Studies in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Bergin resigned both the senior professorship and his office of director. The reason for his resignation was never made public. He died in a nursing-home in Dublin at the age of 76, having never married. Bergin, who never used the name Joseph except when signing with his initials, did not seem to have felt the need of institutional religion, and during his lifetime, he rarely attended religious services. He developed Irish nationalist sympathies and remained a firm nationalist all his life but without party affiliations. From the number of Irish-speakers living in Cork, Bergin quickly mastered the spoken Irish of West Munster. By 1897, his knowledge of spoken and literary Modern Irish was so strong that he was appointed lecturer in Celtic in Queen's College, Cork. It was during this time that he became an active member of the Gaelic League. He published extensively in the journal for Irish scholarship, Ériu. He is best known for his discovery of Bergin's Law, which states that while the normal order of a sentence in Old Irish is verb-subject-object, it is permissible for the verb, in the conjunct form, to be placed at the end of the sentence.Collinge, N.E. The Laws of Indo-European John Benjamins Publishing Co 1985 p.230 His friend Frank O'Connor wrote humorously that while he discovered the law \\"he never really believed in it\\".O'Connor, Frank, My Father's Son, Macmillan and Co, London 1968. He wrote poetry in Irish and made a number of well-received translations of Old Irish love poetry.

(2012) The Barnsley Coal Railway was a short railway which, when fully opened, ran between Stairfoot Junction, on the Mexborough to Barnsley line of the South Yorkshire Railway (SYR) and a triangular junction at Nostell on the line of the West Riding and Grimsby Railway (WR&GR;). The railway rights were purchased by the SYR in July 1863, just one year before that company was absorbed into the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Scheduled passenger services on the lined ended in 1930, and goods services in 1961. History Railway Clearing House diagram of 1911 showing the line In the parliamentary session of 1860/1 an act was applied for to incorporate a company, and construct a line from a junction with the South Yorkshire Railway (SYR) west of Ardsley railway station to Crigglestone. An act was passed in 1861, allowing the creation of the Barnsley Coal Railway, with £40,000 of capital allowed to be raised by share issue, and £13,000 by loans. The first permitted section of line was from Stairfoot (west of Ardsley in Darfield) to Applehaigh (in Notton), long.Ordnance Survey Sheets 274SE, 274NE, 262SE In 1863 an act was passed allowing the South Yorkshire Railway, which had subscribed £10,000 of the railway's capital, to take over the company. In 1864 an act was obtained allowing a short extension to the Midland Railway's line near Barnsley; the new chord would have enabled the South Yorkshire company to take advantage of their recently acquired running powers to Wakefield and Leeds over the Midland's lines. This connecting line was not built.See Ordnance Survey Sheets 274NE The first section line served Rosa Colliery, and opened to traffic in January 1870. In the session of 1873/4 the SYR's successor the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) obtained powers to build an extension from near the 1860s terminus at Notton, to a two way junction with the West Riding and Grimsby Railway north- west of Nostel station; also sought were powers for a junction from the line to the Midland's line near to the Barnsley Canal;North-west of Royston and Notton railway station, and at the site of the (future) Royston junction. and a second junction from Coal railway to SYR's Barnsley line, creating an extended triangular junction to that line. The second section was opened for goods traffic in August 1882. This section ran from Applehaigh to a triangular junction with the West Riding and Grimsby Railway (WR&GR;) at Nostell. The line included passenger stations at Staincross and Mapplewell, Notton and Royston and Ryhill, later renamed Ryhill and Wintersett. A passenger service commenced on 1 September 1882. Regular passenger services were withdrawn in 1930, goods services in 1961. =Train services= The passenger service on the line was part of a Leeds (Central) / Barnsley (Court House) service via Wakefield (Westgate). The July 1922 issue of Bradshaw's Railway Guide shows 5 trains in each direction on Mondays to Fridays, 6 trains on Saturday from Barnsley to Leeds and 7 on Saturday from Leeds to Barnsley. There was no Sunday service.

The two handsets share a number of features, such as Bluetooth, IR and USB connectivity, a 2 Megapixel camera, media player and FM radio abilities. The Z710i/Z710c mobile phone is mainly targeted at business users whereas the W710i phone is mainly targeted at youth/sport markets. Although both phones feature many similar features the W710i adds a number of extra features such as an improved 'Walkman' MP3 player, pedometer functions, flash menus and it also includes a larger memory card (512MB on W710i vs. 64MB on z710i) and an improved stereo headset. The Z710i is available in black (Twilight Black) or gold (Metallic Sand) colours with a blue on white external LCD display and the W710i is available in purple or grey colours with an orange on white external display.

At various times the phone will randomly stop logging all call activity in the phone's call history. This includes the stoppage of all calls logged as \\"Answered\\" by the phone owner, \\"Dialed\\" by the phone owner, and calls \\"Missed\\" by the phone owner. Sony Ericsson seems readily knowledgeable about the problem as their telephone tech support agents will readily give customers an answer which is the only current remedy so far. The remedy from Sony Ericsson is for the phone's owner to activate the phone's built in software Master reset, and to flash the phone back to the original factory settings every time the random error occurs. Upon doing so, any and all contacts not saved to the SIM card are lost, all customizations of themes and backgrounds are lost, non-saved text or picture messages are lost, plus any downloaded Java applets or ringtones that are not saved to the M2 Micro memory card are also lost as well. Another possible remedy discovered by some customers is to delete all calls logged in the call history to date until the call history is empty. The call history will then begin to log all calls again.

Plot The gang travels to Hawaii on a free trip from a surf-and-beachwear company called \\"Goha Aloha\\" thanks to Daphne, whom the company wants to design some new swimwear for them. The gang also goes there to see the Big Kahuna of Hanahuna Surfing Contest. However, the contest used to only be open for the natives and not for mainlanders, but now the mayor has made it open for everybody. Many locals are angry because of this, especially Manu Tuiama, a beefcake local surfer, and his friend, Little Jim. Just a few days before the contest, the demons of the evil Wiki-Tiki spirit attacked the village and kidnapped Manu's girlfriend, Snookie. This drives away most of the tourists and surfers, and the locals believe the spirit is angry that the surfing contest is open to anybody, and also that a new resort, Coconut Beach Condominiums, is being built on supposedly sacred ground by local real estate agent Ruben Laluna. When the gang meets Jared Moon, a representative from the Goha Aloha-company in Hanahuna, he's selling tiki charms that are supposed to ward off evil demons. The mayor refuses to postpone the contest, even after the Tiki demons attack again at a feast. The gang wants to get to the bottom of the mystery, and go to Auntie Mahina, a local shawoman who lives deep in the jungle. On the way there, Manu seemingly gets kidnapped by the Wiki-Tiki. Auntie Mahina tells them the Wiki-Tiki is angry at the mainlanders; the surfing contest is hinted by her to be a Hawaiian ritual and that the winner has to be of Hawaiian descent. She says they need to go to the cave where the monster lives to get rid of it, or Snookie and Manu will be sacrificed in the volcano. She also gives Fred a necklace which should keep the monster away. The necklace is filled with an extract from a sacred root called bola gawana, which she claims that the ancients used to repel away evil spirits. The gang goes to the cave, and get chased by bats and the little demons, until they lose them and find Snookie, who tries to lead them out before getting recaptured by the Wiki- Tiki, who is seemingly unaffected by the necklace. The gang then find themselves in a snake pit cave, but are able to get out of it because of music by Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. After escaping, the gang does some searching and stumbles upon a cave within the volcano, during which they discover that the volcano is in fact still dormant and that the Wiki-Tiki and its demons are not really ancient spirits. The little demons turn out to just be remote- controlled robots. After looking at a picture of the Wiki-Tiki when it was out surfing, the gang notices that the (supposedly) 10,000-year-old spirit its using a Goha Aloha-brand surfboard. Back at the island, it is only one day until the contest, and the locals are really scared something bad will happen. Little Jim blames the mayor for Snookie and Manu's disappearances, and says that whatever happens during the contest will be her fault as well. The following day, Daphne enters the contest in hopes of drawing out the Wiki- Tiki, whom they are sure will show up. Sure enough, it comes and scares the surfers and chases Shaggy and Scooby, until it was washed up by a wave. The gang unmasks the Wiki-Tiki as Manu and after Snookie runs over to him, it turns out that the couple were the culprits behind the Wiki-Tiki scheme. The gang explains that Manu and Snookie wanted to scare off both the locals and the tourists so they could buy up all the real estate in the area and then sell it back to the original owners at a huge profit—and all the places bought by Manu and Snookie were put under the name of \\"Pamela Waeawa,\\" which is Snookie's real name. Velma also reveals that Snookie's an expert in both rocket science and robotics, and was the one who created the so-called \\"demons.\\" The mayor ultimately announces Scooby as the winner of the surfing contest (for the way he and Shaggy were surfing while battling Manu), making him the new \\"Big Kahuna of Hanahuna.\\" Manu expresses shock and anger at losing to a dog as he and Snookie are arrested and taken to jail. Later that night, a big luau is held in celebration at the hotel that the gang was staying at. Everyone thanks the gang for solving mystery and Ruben Laluna reveals that all the real estate bought by Manu and Snookie will be returned to the original owners. Jared Moon comes by to tell that Goha Aloha loved her swimsuit designs and wants to buy them (and he gives her a free tiki charm). After Auntie Mahina thanks the gang for what they did, the mini-tikis come to the party and advance—but instead of attacking people, they start dancing. It's revealed that Scooby has the remote control for them and he's the one making them dance. Everyone laughs while Scooby says his catchphrase before saying \\"Aloha!\\".

According to a 2005 UNESCO World Report, the rise in the 21st century of a global information society has resulted in the emergence of knowledge as a valuable resource, increasingly determining who has access to power and profit.UNESCO World Report: Toward Knowledge Societies (Paris: UNESCO, 2005), 158-159. The rapid dissemination of information on a potentially global scale as a result of new information mediaUNESCO 2005, 160. and the globally uneven ability to assimilate knowledge and information has resulted in potentially expanding gaps in knowledge between individuals and nations.Joseph Stiglitz, \\"Knowledge as a Global Public Good,\\" in Global Public Goods: International Cooperation in the 21st Century, ed. I. Kahl et al. (Oxford University Press, 1999), 318. The digital divide is an extension of the knowledge divide, dividing people who have access to the internet and those who do not. The knowledge divide also represents the inequalities of knowledge among different identities, including but nor limited to race, economic status, and gender. Overview In the 21st century, the emergence of the knowledge society becomes pervasive.UNESCO World Report (2005): Towards Knowledge Societies; retrieved from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001418/141843e.pdf The transformations of world's economy and of each society have a fast pace. Together with information and communication technologies (ICT), these new paradigms have the power to reshape the global economy.Information Society Commission (2002). Building the Knowledge Society - Report to Government, December 2002 retrieved from http://www.isc.ie/downloads/know.pdf In order to keep pace with innovations, to come up with new ideas, people need to produce and manage knowledge. This is why knowledge has become essential for all societies. While knowledge has become essential for all societies due to the growth of new technologies, the increase of mass media information continues to facilitate the knowledge divide between those with educational differences. Between nations According to UNESCO and the World Bank,World Bank World Development Report: Knowledge for Development (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999). knowledge gaps between nations may occur due to the varying degrees by which individual nations incorporate the following elements: * Human rights and fundamental freedoms: An absence of freedom within a society can diminish or delay the ability of its members to acquire, debate, and transmit knowledge. Vital to the spread of knowledge and information between nations are such freedoms as freedom of expression, an absence of censorship, free circulation of information, and freedom of the press.UNESCO 2005, 28. * Democracy * Plurality of knowledge and information: This includes a diverse mediaUNESCO 2005, 28. and the acceptance of diverse forms of knowledge.UNESCO 2005, 60. * Quality infrastructure: For instance, a poor electrical grid makes the existence of computer networks or of higher education institutions less attainable. * Effective communication system: This will affect the dissemination of knowledge or movement of ideas within and between nations.Stiglitz, 317-318. * Effective education system: Gaps in knowledge between nations can exist when individual countries invest too little in primary school education, which acts as the base for the entire education system.Stiglitz, 317. According to UNESCO, in order for a nation to become a knowledge society, primary education must focus on basic literacy and must be universally accessible.UNESCO 2005, 72. However, as others have pointed out, higher education may be equally important for closing knowledge gaps between nations, particularly between newly industrialized nations, such as the Republic of Korea, and more advanced industrial societies.Stiglitz, 317. For the former, higher education can play an important role in bridging knowledge gaps, but must benefit more than a small elite portion of the population and must be taught at international standards.Stiglitz, 317. The poor development of educational institutions from a society affects the creativity of people belonging to that society. * Focus on Research and Innovation: As the World Bank suggests, Research & Development within a nation can enable it to follow current developments in global knowledge and also to understand how to adapt external knowledge and technology to meet its needs.World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36. In nations with low degrees of R&D;, government funding can provide a significant portion of support that can later be taken over by private investment.World Bank World Development Report, 1999, 36. Closely tied to effective education systems is the need for a nation to allow for academic freedom.UNESCO 2005, 96. Because higher educational institutions are significant contributors to R&D;,World Bank World Development Report 1999, 36. these institutions must be granted freedom to create and disseminate knowledge.UNESCO 2005, 28. An environment supportive of research and innovation may also help stem the \\"brain drain\\" of educated individuals from knowledge-poor nations to knowledge-rich nations.UNESCO 2005, 160. * Intellectual Property Rights: Closely connected to a focus on research and innovation are national and international Intellectual Property Rights. Within a nation, Intellectual Property Rights can spawn research and innovation by providing economic incentives for investing in new knowledge development.Stiglitz, 311. However, as stated by the World Bank, by protecting innovations, intellectual property rights may also inhibit knowledge-sharing and may prevent developing nations from benefitting from knowledge produced in other countries.World Bank World Development Report 1999, 34. The knowledge divide in gender, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status First, it was noticed that a great difference exists between the North and the South (rich countries vs. poor countries). The development of knowledge depends on spreading Internet and computer technology and also on the development of education in these countries. If a country has attained a higher literacy level then this will result in a higher level of knowledge. Indeed, UNESCO's report details many social issues in knowledge divide related to globalization. There was noticed a knowledge divide with respect to * Gender: Socio-cultural inequalities between men and women, such as unequal access to education and technology, create the conditions for unequal access to knowledge. This can cause significant knowledge gaps both within and between nations, the latter resulting from individual nations' underutilization of their full knowledge workforce.UNESCO World Report 2005, 167-168. A gap in the use of the internet has been discovered as well. Women are more likely to use the internet for communication, while men are more likely to use it for commerce, information, and entertainment. *Race: Studies have shown that although gaps in access to IT has diminished over the decades, there is still a large gap in IT use between African Americans and other racial groups. These studies have shown that there is a difference in the ways African American use the internet in comparison with other American racial groups. *Socioeconomic: Based on the 2008-2009 American National Election Studies panel data, research has found that socioeconomic status is most closely related to informational use of the internet than access to the internet, and the differential use of the internet between socioeconomic groups is associated with a larger knowledge gap.  Closing the knowledge divide  Scholars have made similar possibilities in closing or minimizing the knowledge divide between individuals, communities, and nations. Providing access to computers and other technologies that disseminate knowledge is not enough to bridge the digital divide, rather importance must be out on developing digital literacy to bridge the gap. Addressing the digital divide will not be enough to close the knowledge divide, disseminating relevant knowledge also depends on training and cognitive skills.UNESCO 2005, 22.

The estate takes its name from a larger plot of land which formed an outlying part of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate. As discussed below, the farm was put up for sale in September, 2020, pursuant to a multi-phase arrangement by then-AHS Chair Eric Vietenheimer, who first arranged a merger with the American Public Gardens Association, then resigned his AHS position because of an appearance of a conflict of interest due to legal fees charged by his firm.Cody Mello- Klein, \\"For sale: River Farm\\", Alexandria Times, vol. 16, no. 38, pp. 1, 8-9, hence \\"For sale\\" History Map showing River Farm as part of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate The River Farm property was established in 1653–54 by Giles Brent and his wife, Mary Kittamaquund, a princess of the Piscataway tribe. Brent received a grant of named Piscataway Neck. In 1739 his successor George Brent transferred the property to his brother-in-law William Clifton, who renamed the property Clifton's Neck. In 1757 Clifton completed the brick house that now serves as AHS headquarters. Following financial difficulties, Clifton sold the land to neighbor, founding father George Washington, who obtained the property for £1,210 through a bankruptcy sale in 1760. Washington changed the name of Clifton's Neck to River Farm and leased the property to tenant farmers. River Farm was passed down through two immediate generations of Washingtons and later sold with 652 acres of Washington's original land to the Snowden brothers of New Jersey. This included the houses known as \\"Wellington,\\" \\"Waynewood,\\" and \\"Collingwood.\\" The property was home to numerous owners including Malcolm Matheson, who bought the property in 1919. Matheson placed the property on the market in 1971 and received an offer from the Soviet Embassy who planned to use the land as a retreat or dacha for its staff.AHS website.For sale, p. 9 =Acquisition by AHS= After Matheson took his land off the market to avoid the Soviet sale and vocal public opposition, Enid Annenberg Haupt, philanthropist, gardener, and member of the AHS Board of Directors took interest in the property. Haupt donated the purchasing funds needed for the property to AHS in the early 1970s, conditioning the purchase that the grounds be kept open to the public.For sale, p. 9 In 1973, AHS relocated its headquarters from the city of Alexandria to nearby River Farm. The property was renamed River Farm in honor of President George Washington, one of the many land owners. Washington at River Farm Today's smaller River Farm is located on the northernmost division of Washington's original property. River Farm features the estate house (enlarged and remodeled) with naturalistic and formal garden areas. It still preserves several historical associations with Washington. Its Kentucky coffeetrees are descendants of those first introduced to Virginia upon Washington's return from surveys in the Ohio River Valley. The estate's oldest tree is a large Osage-orange (Maclura pomifera), believed to be the largest in the United States. An old, incorrect, tale claimed it was a gift from Thomas Jefferson to the Washington family, and grown from seedlings of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–06. Horticultural landmark In 2004, River Farm was designated a Horticultural Landmark by the American Society for Horticultural Science. This recognition was due to the ability to retain its historic character while at the same time showcasing the best and most environmentally responsible gardening practices. Horticultural Landmark features include vistas stretching down to the Potomac River as well as its artful blend of naturalistic and formal gardens that offer year-round delight to visitors of all ages. In addition, there are extensive and creative play areas for children, demonstration gardens for both edible and ornamental plants, a four-acre meadow, and scenic resting places for picnickers, artists, and romantics. Other highlights include two small buildings with planted \\"living\\" roofs, one of the largest Osage-orange trees in the nation, an orchard, a grove of rare Franklinia trees, and frequent sightings of bald eagles, bluebirds, foxes, and other wildlife. Visiting River Farm is located at 7931 East Boulevard Drive, Alexandria, Virginia. River Farm's gardens are open to the public year-round Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., excluding national holidays. Due to the Covid epidemic, it has not resumed its summertime Saturday hours, and closed its buildings (including restrooms) to the public.sign on property River Farm is closed on national holidays. Admission is free (except for special events), but donations are appreciated to help support the stewardship of River Farm. The AHS Garden Shop is open Tuesdays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Features The farm's gardens include: * André Bluemel Meadow (4 acres/1.6 ha) – naturalistic area with native grasses and wildflowers. Two large black walnut trees (Juglans nigra) probably date to George Washington's ownership. * Children's Garden – more than a dozen small gardens for children. * Estate House plantings – native shrubs and trees, including Allegheny serviceberry (Amelanchier laevis), fringe tree (Chionanthus virginicus), dwarf fothergilla (Fothergilla gardenii), and Carolina silverbell (Halesia carolina), as well as a hedge of English boxwood (Buxus sempervirens 'Suffruticosa') with specimens nearly 100 years old. * Garden Calm – shrubs, trees, and perennials for shade, with the large Osage-orange. * George Harding Memorial Azalea Garden – hundreds of azalea species, varieties, and cultivars, plus small ornamental trees including river birch (Betula nigra 'Heritage'), dogwoods (Cornus sp.), dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), and dove trees (Davidia involucrata). * Growing Connection Demonstration Garden – vegetables and herbs. * Orchard – apple, pear, cherry, plum, and Japanese persimmon trees. * Perennial Border – plants selected for resistance to diseases and pests. * White House Gates – first installed at the White House in 1819, in the reconstruction after the War of 1812, and used for more than 120 years at the White House's northeast entrance. * Wildlife Garden – a small pond with frogs, goldfish, tilapia and turtles, surrounded by blueberry and northern bayberry shrubs, grasses, junipers, and holly. Development controversy Developers continued to express interest in the property over the decades. On September 4, 2020, AHS announced that it was putting the property up for sale because of concerns over the organization's long-term viability. The real estate listing estimated the property's value as between $15 and $30 million, and prompted expressions of concern by both AHS members and community members, particularly as options such as a merger or sale with the National Park Service or state or local parks organizations had not been explored. Concerns were also expressed about the lack of transparency, as no signs concerning the sale are visible on the property. In late June, the AHS board had voted to merge with the American Public Gardens Association at the urging of its Chair, Eric Vietenheimer (also a lawyer at Cooley LLP), and Vice Chair Mary Pat Matheson (of the Atlanta Botanic Garden), both of whom resigned from AHS shortly after the public real estate listing.For Sale pp. 8-9 Cooley LLP had been overseeing the merger between AHS and APGA, under which AHS would cease to exist and the proceeds from the sale would become an endowment for the APGA.For Sale, p. 9 Vietenheimer's successor as Board Chair, Terry Hayes, directed all communication through Kornet Marketing Communications, a public relations firm now representing AHS.For sale, p. 9 State senators Scott Surovell and Adam Ebbin, as well as U.S. Senator Mark Warner and Congressmen Don Beyer all hoped for a solution which would keep River Farm open to the public.For sale, p. 9  See also  * List of botanical gardens in the United States  External links  * River Farm Category:Botanical gardens in Virginia Category:Protected areas of Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Washington family residences Category:Tourist attractions in Fairfax County, Virginia ","title":"River Farm"},{"id":"7983733","text":"Aegilops umbellulata (syn.

The building is the property of the comune (municipality) of the city. History The church was built in response to an alleged miracle, occurring in 1596, associated with a local votive image of the Madonna which had been painted by Lelio Orsi. The image soon became a place of pilgrimage, and the offerings of the faithful led to the construction of a new temple into which the votive fresco was moved. The cornerstone was laid on June 6, 1597 by the bishop Claudio Rangone, in the presence of Duke Alfonso II d'Este and Duchess Margherita Gonzaga. Part of the former convent and church were demolished in order to make way for the new structure. The plan was by the local architect and sculptor Francesco Pacchioni, who also designed the dome and the interior stuccoes. The church was consecrated on May 12, 1619. Interior of the dome Overview The plan of the church is on the Greek cross, with, at the centre, a dome surmounted by a lantern. Four smaller domes, not visible from outside, are at the inner angle of the cross. The façade has Doric columns on the lower part and Ionic columns on the upper one. It is built of laterite, with white Veronese marble insets. The central portal has a marble bas-relief portraying the Vergine della Ghiara, (1642). The side portals were executed in 1631. The interior is in Late Renaissance style, with rich decorations in gold, marbles, as well as large frescoes of the Carracci school covering the domes and the vaults. These depicts stories of women of the Old Testament. The ceiling painted by Alessandro Tiarini is considered his masterwork. The dome frescoes are by Lionello Spada (1616). The church has a nearly central plan. The arm of the church constituting the entry has ceiling frescoes (1645-1646) depicting Gentleness (Mansuetudine), Faith, Adam and Eve evicted from Paradise, Abraham served by Angels, Rebecca and Eleazar by Luca Ferrari. The walls have canvases depicting the Miracle of Domenico Crotti by Pier Martire Armani and the Miracle of Domenico Carattieri by Pietro Desani. The first chapel on the right has cupola frescoes (1629-1630) depicting the eight virtues, and saints showing devotion to God.

The school caters for children from ages four to seven (Reception to Year 2). Children join the school as \\"Rising Fives\\" and there is a three-term intake with a maximum of around 150 children on roll each year. Wescott holds the prestigious Artsmark Gold Award from the Arts Council, and in 2003 it was awarded a DFES School Achievement Award. The school has also been awarded Healthy Schools status. History The school was founded in 1828 as a National School for boys and girls, and was originally located in Rose Street, Wokingham, behind the existing houses at numbers 9 and 11.The Wokingham Society. Wokingham: A Chronology, 1978. By 1901, the population of the town had increased threefold and as there was no room for expansion on the Rose Street site it was decided to build a new school in Goodchild Road. The new school opened on 8 January 1906. It was known as the Wescott Road Council School, and was named after Thomas Manley Wescott, the first Mayor of Wokingham. The school was built by W. Watson, builders of Ascot, at a cost of £6,000. The architect was Edmund Fisher, who was also responsible for the design of a number of other Berkshire schools. The school was intended to accommodate 400 children but the attendance was mixed and averaged 240 pupils a day during its early years.Hosking R. A brief history of the Wescott Road/Seaford Road Area. The Wokingham Historian, Number 6, June 1993. The school originally catered for boys and girls from five through to 14, which was then the school leaving age. The first headmaster was a Mr George Manoah Ebenezer Fryer. There were 11 other teachers and 222 children on the register in the first month. A further building, known as the annexe, was erected in 1911 for woodwork, cookery, and the evening continuation classes.Wyatt, B. Wokingham in Old Photographs. Stroud, Gloucestershire: Budding Books, 1995. . The secondary-age pupils moved out in the 1950s to join the newly built St Crispin's School. In 1974, with the opening of Westende Junior School, Wescott became an infant school, educating children up to the age of seven. Wescott School was designated as a Grade II listed building on 24 June 1998 by English Heritage, who describe it as a \\"well-designed and executed early-C20 school in the Arts and Crafts style\\". The adjacent school annexe, which was originally the technology block but now houses a nursery school, is also a Grade II listed building. The school celebrated its centennial in 2006. Her Royal Highness Princess Anne visited the school on 28 March 2006 as part of the centennial celebrations to unveil a commemorative plaque.Princess Anne join's [sic] school's 100th birthday celebrations She was entertained with a short musical performance by the children, followed by the first public performance of The Wescott School song, commissioned by the school from Luke Bedford, a former pupil and winner of the BBC’s Young Composer of the Year award (2004).Royal Visit To Mark The 100th Brithday [sic] Of Wescott Infant School Facilities The annexe to Wescott School, now used by Wokingham Day Nursery The school has a central hall surrounded by six classrooms, each of which has its own computer facilities. Wescott was selected as one of the pilot sites for the National Grid for Learning. The school hall is used by the local community for a variety of activities including: Rainbows, Brownies, fitness classes and football training. There is a private day nursery located within the playground which has an informal link with the school. Most of the children from Westcott move on to Westende Junior School. The two schools work closely together and have a joint Parent Teachers' Association. Westende School has a heated outdoor swimming pool, and Wescott pupils have swimming lessons at the pool during the summer months. Parents and pupils who belong to the school Swimming Association can also use the swimming pool after school and during the summer holidays.

He has been posthumously referred to as the Vasari of Lombardy, for his prolific Mannerist fresco decoration. Born in Bologna, he was the son of the painter Ercole Procaccini the Elder, and older brother to Giulio Cesare and Carlo Antonio, both painters. Works In 1587 he distinguished in the fresco decoration of the Basilica della Ghiara in Reggio Emilia. In the late 1580s he moved to Milan, where count Camillo Visconti Borromeo commissioned him the decoration of his villa in Lainate. The organ shutters for the Cathedral of Milan were painted after 1590 by Camillo, Giuseppe Meda (died 1599), and Ambrogio Figino. He painted the frescoes of the nave and the apse of the Cathedral of Piacenza in collaboration with Ludovico Carracci (1605–1609), and the vault and choir in San Barnaba of Milan. He painted a Nativity in the Sacro Monte d'Orta. He is known for a Martyrdom of St. Agnes painted in fresco in the sacristy of the Milan cathedral; a Madonna and Child painted for the church of Santa Maria del Carmine; an 'Adoration of the Shepherds found in the Brera; and the ceiling of the church of Padri Zoccolanti, representing the Assumption of the Virgin. He frescoed a large Last Judgment in the apse of the church of San Prospero at Reggio; He painted a St. Roch administering the Sacrament to the Plague-stricken. Among his pupils was the painter Giovanni Battista Discepoli.Camillo Procaccini in the RKD Another pupil was Lorenzo Franchi (c. 1563 - c. 1630).Gli artisti italiani e stranieri negli stati estensi catalogo storico ...

The club played in navy blue. History The club were established in 1881 from an athletics club, in an era when the shipbuilding industry in the area was expanding rapidly with thousands moving into the area. They were founder members of the Scottish Football Alliance in the 1891–92 season, and were the league's first champions.Linthouse Historical Football Kits In 1894, Linthouse moved north from Langlands Park on the southern edge of GovanOS 25 inch Scotland, 1892-1905 (Langlands), Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) to Govandale Park in the centre of town.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p191 They joined the Scottish Football League in 1895–96, when they were admitted to Division Two. Their first season in the League was not a successful one, with the club finishing bottom of the ten-club division, and only surviving re-election after a third ballot in which they defeated Wishaw Athletic. However, their first season in the league saw a record 10,000 attend their Glasgow Cup game against Celtic in September 1895 (a 7–1 defeat).Glasgow Cup–First Round, The Glasgow Herald, 23 September 1895 The club spent five seasons in Division Two without much success, their highest finish being fifth in season 1897–98. Arguably their best achievements were in the Glasgow Cup, where they reached the semi-finals three times (in the 1891–92, 1896–97 and 1899–1900 seasons), losing to Rangers or Celtic each time. Even then, examination of their progress indicates they had fortunate draws against obscure teams on those occasions, while typically losing to the better-known opponents.Glasgow FA Cup 1887-1989, Scottish Football Historical Archive The main exception to this was a 3–1 win in October 1896 over Partick Thistle who were something of a local rival, the clubs being based about a mile apart in competing burghs on opposite banks of the River Clyde,OS 25 inch Scotland, 1892-1905 (Partick and Govan), Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) meeting frequently in the Alliance and SFL Division Two, and occasionally in the Scottish Qualifying Cup.1896-97 Second Division Champions, Partick Thistle - The Early Years In 1899–1900 the club finished bottom of the division, and struggling with low attendances due to competition from nearby Rangers, they decided not to seek re-election to the league. Linthouse entered the Scottish Cup the following season and progressed to the second round as their first round opponents Clydebank forfeited the tie. However Linthouse themselves forfeited their second round tie with Motherwell and the football side was discontinued.

David Vandevoorde first introduced the acronym SFINAE to describe related programming techniques. Specifically, when creating a candidate set for overload resolution, some (or all) candidates of that set may be the result of instantiated templates with (potentially deduced) template arguments substituted for the corresponding template parameters. If an error occurs during the substitution of a set of arguments for any given template, the compiler removes the potential overload from the candidate set instead of stopping with a compilation error, provided the substitution error is one the C++ standard grants such treatment.International Organization for Standardization. \\"ISO/IEC 14882:2003, Programming languages -- C++\\", § 14.8.2. If one or more candidates remain and overload resolution succeeds, the invocation is well-formed. Example The following example illustrates a basic instance of SFINAE: struct Test { typedef int foo; }; template void f(typename T::foo) {} // Definition #1 template void f(T) {} // Definition #2 int main() { f(10); // Call #1. f(10); // Call #2. Without error (even though there is no int::foo) // thanks to SFINAE. } Here, attempting to use a non- class type in a qualified name (\`T::foo\`) results in a deduction failure for \`f\` because \`int\` has no nested type named \`foo\`, but the program is well- formed because a valid function remains in the set of candidate functions. Although SFINAE was initially introduced to avoid creating ill-formed programs when unrelated template declarations were visible (e.g., through the inclusion of a header file), many developers later found the behavior useful for compile-time introspection. Specifically, it allows a template to determine certain properties of its template arguments at instantiation time. For example, SFINAE can be used to determine if a type contains a certain typedef: #include template struct has_typedef_foobar { // Types \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" are guaranteed to have different sizes, // specifically sizeof(yes)  1 and sizeof(no)  2. typedef char yes[1]; typedef char no[2]; template static yes& test(typename C::foobar*); template static no& test(...); // If the \\"sizeof\\" of the result of calling test(nullptr) is equal to // sizeof(yes), the first overload worked and T has a nested type named // foobar. static const bool value = sizeof(test(nullptr))  sizeof(yes); }; struct foo { typedef float foobar; }; int main() { std::cout << std::boolalpha; std::cout << has_typedef_foobar::value << std::endl; // Prints false std::cout << has_typedef_foobar::value << std::endl; // Prints true } When \`T\` has the nested type \`foobar\` defined, the instantiation of the first \`test\` works and the null pointer constant is successfully passed. (And the resulting type of the expression is \`yes\`.) If it does not work, the only available function is the second \`test\`, and the resulting type of the expression is \`no\`. An ellipsis is used not only because it will accept any argument, but also because its conversion rank is lowest, so a call to the first function will be preferred if it is possible; this removes ambiguity.  C++11 simplification  In C++11, the above code could be simplified to: #include #include template using void_t = void; template struct has_typedef_foobar : std::false_type {}; template struct has_typedef_foobar> : std::true_type {}; struct foo { using foobar = float; }; int main() { std::cout << std::boolalpha; std::cout << has_typedef_foobar::value << std::endl; std::cout << has_typedef_foobar::value << std::endl; } With the standardisation of the detection idiom in the Library fundamental v2 (n4562) proposal, the above code could be re-written as follows: #include #include template using has_typedef_foobar_t = typename T::foobar; struct foo { using foobar = float; }; int main() { std::cout << std::boolalpha; std::cout << std::is_detected::value << std::endl; std::cout << std::is_detected::value << std::endl; } The developers of Boost used SFINAE in boost::enable_ifBoost Enable If and in other ways.

The head is mostly white, the remainder of the coat being pied light yellow to dark red-brown. Having been bred to cope with extreme conditions, such as cold winters, steep pastures and a frugal diet, they are well adapted to the Alpine climate. They are used for both beef and milk production and are noted for their thriftiness, longevity and lack of calving difficulties. These qualities have led to a significant rise in the number of Hinterwald cows in the Swiss Alps since the introduction of a breeding programme initiated by Pro Specie Rara, a non-profit organisation dedicated to the preservation of endangered domestic species.

Correlations are also called reciprocities or reciprocal transformations. In two dimensions In the real projective plane, points and lines are dual to each other. As expressed by Coxeter, :A correlation is a point-to-line and a line-to-point transformation that preserves the relation of incidence in accordance with the principle of duality. Thus it transforms ranges into pencils, pencils into ranges, quadrangles into quadrilaterals, and so on.H. S. M. Coxeter (1974) Projective Geometry, second edition, page 57, University of Toronto Press Given a line m and P a point not on m, an elementary correlation is obtained as follows: for every Q on m form the line PQ. The inverse correlation starts with the pencil on P: for any line q in this pencil take the point . The composition of two correlations that share the same pencil is a perspectivity. In three dimensions In a 3-dimensional projective space a correlation maps a point to a plane. As stated in one textbook:J. G. Semple and G. T. Kneebone (1952) Algebraic Projective Geometry, p 360, Clarendon Press :If κ is such a correlation, every point P is transformed by it into a plane , and conversely, every point P arises from a unique plane π′ by the inverse transformation κ−1. Three-dimensional correlations also transform lines into lines, so they may be considered to be collineations of the two spaces. In higher dimensions In general n-dimensional projective space, a correlation takes a point to a hyperplane. This context was described by Paul Yale: :A correlation of the projective space P(V) is an inclusion-reversing permutation of the proper subspaces of P(V).Paul B. Yale (1968, 1988. 2004) Geometry and Symmetry, chapter 6.9 Correlations and semi-bilinear forms, Dover Publications He proves a theorem stating that a correlation φ interchanges joins and intersections, and for any projective subspace W of P(V), the dimension of the image of W under φ is , where n is the dimension of the vector space V used to produce the projective space P(V). Existence of correlations Correlations can exist only if the space is self-dual. For dimensions 3 and higher, self- duality is easy to test: A coordinatizing skewfield exists and self-duality fails if and only if the skewfield is not isomorphic to its opposite. Special types of correlations =Polarity= If a correlation φ is an involution (that is, two applications of the correlation equals the identity: for all points P) then it is called a polarity. Polarities of projective spaces lead to polar spaces, which are defined by taking the collection of all subspace which are contained in their image under the polarity. =Natural correlation= There is a natural correlation induced between a projective space P(V) and its dual P(V∗) by the natural pairing between the underlying vector spaces V and its dual V∗, where every subspace W of V∗ is mapped to its orthogonal complement W⊥ in V, defined as Composing this natural correlation with an isomorphism of projective spaces induced by a semilinear map produces a correlation of P(V) to itself. In this way, every nondegenerate semilinear map induces a correlation of a projective space to itself.

It began in 1981 in Wichita, Kansas, and is the largest grass-roots fundraising movement for the Special Olympics. LETR is run by police officers, sheriff's deputies, correction officers, support staff, police volunteers and other law enforcement professionals from around the world. Close to 97,000 police professionals in over 45 countries participate in this worldwide effort to raise money and awareness for Special Olympics. Participants in the LETR help spread the word about the benefits of Special Olympics and how the program helps define the brave participants of these programs as athletes, and not define them by their disabilities. Since its inception in 1981, LETR has raised $619,187,626. Similar in many ways to the Olympic Torch Relay, the Law Enforcement Torch Run consists of scheduled relay events, usually held in conjunction and coordination with Special Olympics functions (like the Special Olympics Summer and Winter Games). While carrying the flame, officers and athletes are referred to as \\"Guardians of the Flame\\". In the broader sense, the LETR is used to define all of the special events, and fundraising activities that law enforcement conducts to contribute to this campaign. This includes (but is not limited to), tip-a-cop events, car washes, Polar Plunges, roof sits, motorcycle runs, online fundraising, T-shirt and hat sales, media events, and more. Every two years, the Special Olympics World Games are held. This brings about a special torch run called the Final Leg Run, during which, law enforcement, together with Special Olympic athletes, run the Flame of Hope throughout the host country for the games, spreading awareness for Special Olympics. This culminates with the lighting of the cauldron for the Flame of Hope at the opening ceremonies for the Special Olympics World Games. Every year, members of the LETR converge at the International LETR conference to exchange ideas, and network about Special Olympics awareness and fundraising techniques.

The Azad became Dhaka's first daily newspaper. The newspaper, while based in Dhaka, played an important role during the Bengali Language Movement for its advocacy of Bengali.  History  The newspaper was founded in Kolkata on 31 October 1936. The first editor of the daily was Maulana Mohammad Akram Khan. In its early days, the daily supported the Muslim League in both Bengal and Assam languages. In the 1940s, the editor was Mohammad Modabber; he published The Azad with his son. Mohammed Sadrul Anam Khan and Nazir Ahmed were also associated during that time. The daily regularly published Dhaka- based and regional news from reporter Khairul Kabir. After the partition of India, The Azad was transferred to Dhaka on 19 October 1948. It became the first newspaper to move to Dhaka. Abul Kalam Shamsuddin was nominated editor at that time. Khairul Kabir acted as news editor. Mujibur Rahman Khan and Abu Jafar Shamsuddin worked in the editorial section. Soon afterward, the daily became the leading newspaper in East Pakistan. =Bengali Language Movement= The publication of The Azad was prohibited in 1949 when editorial content turned against the government, which responded by prohibiting advertisements in the paper. The Azad supported the Bengali Language Movement and defied the government's threats. When the killing of February 21 took place, The Azad released a special edition on 22 February. The editor of the newspaper, Abul Kalam Shamsuddin, who was also member of the Legislative Assembly, resigned from the assembly in protest. Despite being a right wing newspaper which previously supported the Muslim League, it published week-long investigative reports on the incidents of February 21. However, after 1 March 1952 they succumbed to government pressure and could not remain impartial.Al Helal, Bashir, Bhasha Andoloner Itihas. pp-513 During the autocratic regime of General Ayub Khan, the daily again stood up under the leadership of Akram Khan's youngest son, Mohammed Quamrul Anam Khan to protest against corruption and unjust rule. It also played an important role in the toppling of the Ayub Khan government and the Agartala Conspiracy Case. =Decline= The daily quickly lost its appeal after Maulana Mohammad Akram Khan died and ownership controversies arose. It lost readership from competition with Ittefaq which became increasingly popular. After the independence of Bangladesh, the daily lost government financial aid. Later, the daily was given to its legal owner and managing director, Mohammad Quamrul Anam Khan to be run under private administration. Due to lack of financial support and government policies, The Azad was shut down in 1990.

Pondus' family = Pondus = Pondus (real name Patrick) is a living football encyclopedia in his mid thirties (once quoted to be 35), and an avid fan of Liverpool F.C. and AC/DC (he claims his favorite song is Shoot to thrill). He is married to Beate, and father to their two children, Påsan and Sneipen. He actively plays football at \\"old-boys\\" level, giving him opportunity to play hard and occasionally perform like the player he dreams he is. He has both seriously injured others, and been seriously injured himself. When it comes to knowledge about British football, he has nearly idiot savant expertise, about teams and players down to the obscure Lower Leagues. He worked for several years as a bus driver, but did at one point get too much exposure to \\"the freaks that use public transportation\\", and as pub-owner Turid-Laila was leaving for a transglobal sailing trip, Pondus quit his old job and bought her pub. At this establishment, he and his best friend Jokke were already spending a great deal of time. = Beate = Beate (English: Linda) is Pondus' reasonably wise wife and mother of Påsan and Sneipen. She works as a nurse at the local hospital. Some of the characters at the hospital are characters from a previous comic that Øverli did, Riskhospitalet (The Risk Hospital, a pun on Rikshospitalet, National Hospital). She has been with Pondus since they were teenagers, but is a far more conventionally normal person than he is. She does not share his love for football, but much prefers to watch soap operas on TV. The only thing she will never forgive about their wedding day, is the fact that he got married in his soccer shoes (and tuxedo). Her taste in music is offensive to Pondus, as she likes to listen to Michael Bolton, Modern Talking, Ricky Martin etc. Her best friend is Selma. = Kevin = Kevin (English: Junior) usually called Påsan, is the pubescent son of the Pondus household. He has, since the start of the series, grown from being a typical child in elementary school, to a puberty- stricken teenager. He has inherited his father's love for football and rock music. He plays football for a local club in a manner that reflects his father's style of playing. He also plays guitar with a group of friends in a band named Fotsopp (English: Athlete's foot), a twist on the name of the Norwegian band Röyksopp. His best friend is Kjakan. Recently it has been revealed that Påsan has stopped playing guitar and is now more a hip-hop fan. Påsan isn't the smartest boy in the class, but if it was a class where you needed to make up histories (as where Stalin came from and went) he would get straight A's. = Frida = Frida was over several years called Sneipen (English: Rugrat), but her proper name was revealed in the May issue of 2007. She is a girl toddler who has yet to develop into a speaking character, although her thoughts are apparent to the reader. Her vocabulary is limited to very few words, one of which is Dommerjævel (English: bastard referee), which doesn't please her mother but gives her father some satisfaction. Frida attends kindergarten, (Soppen barnehage - The Mushroom Kindergarten) and has during the strip's run grown to look a bit older. She is sometimes shown praying to God before going to bed, for instance asking God to make Liverpool FC play better, as that would make her father happy. She is also capable of impressive drawings for her age, but often she thinks higher of her works than what they truly are. Frida also has a very close and friendly relationship with the various night-time monsters in her closet and under her bed. = Bjarne = Bjarne is the Pondus household family dog, of unnamed breed, and most likely a mutt blend of several indeterminable races, but at the very least \\"thought to be dog breeds\\" or of extraterrestrial origins (as he has no navel/belly button). At a veterinarian checkup it was revealed that he had 26 more teeth than normal dogs, of which all seemed to have been thrown into his mouth from a great distance. Many of Bjarne's appearances revolve around the tasks of bathing and toenail-clipping, both of which are events Bjarne dreads, and dangerous to the person attempting the task. All appearances of this dog confirm the idea that Bjarne is exceptionally unintelligent. There is only one known exception, in a comic strip where Pondus wonders about what Bjarne is thinking. At the end of the strip, you see Bjarne thinking: \\"E=mc2\\". In a later strip, he is seen walking right into a tree during a stroll. When Pondus and Beate were getting a dog, they actually got 200 NOK (about 30 USD), to take Bjarne home. Bjarne is also \\"called\\" Rex by Påsan/Kevin, but that is only to get the hang of the girls. One of Kevin\`s pastimes is experimenting with Bjarne and various items, once sending him from a cliff in a parachute. More recently, Bjarne was attached to a motorized hang-glider, because Kevin wanted to get away from the chore of follow the dog on his regular rounds. The contraption worked by remote control, with a limited range. Kevin and Pondus watched helplessly as the dog drifted away overseas, being spotted at a Norwegian oil rig, and then over Shetland, before turning up in Washington D.C., where he collided with president Barack Obama during his annual Christmas speech. The dog was returned by CIA, presumed to be a weird act of terrorism. The story was published as a Christmas special, by the way pointing out that Pondus and his family lives in Bergen, or at least in the western parts of Norway. Jokke's family = Jokke = Jokke (real name Joachim Jacobsen, English: Raymond) used to be a notorious flirt with the very ugliest women to be found, due to some internal code that no opportunity should ever be left unattempted. Very often this would lead him to get severely beaten up. He is of the same age as Pondus, and sees himself as his equal in every way, not least in terms of strength which they occasionally measure, always ending in a tie. Jokke is also Pondus' equal in terms of football fanhood, but his less fortunate destiny is supporting Leeds United, a club doomed to poor results of recent years. He also plays Old Boys football with Pondus, as goalkeeper, but he is not very good. His favourite band is KISS which also is in conflict to Pondus' AC/DC. Until recently, Jokke had never done an honest day's work and was very proud of this. For a while he lived at home with his mother Else and his stepfather Günther, but moved out when their sexual escapades became too much to bear, to share an apartment with Turid-Laila. Recent events have however improved Jokke's life drastically. He reunited with his long-lost, ex-criminal father and opened a vintage record store with him, and he met Camilla who is several leagues above the sort of girls pursued in the past. Jokke and Camilla then moved in together, and had a baby in 2006. But in 2008 Camilla fell in love with chess-fanatic Tor-Ivar and left Jokke to live with him, making Jokke single again. Eventually, the couple got back together, after a period on parole. = Camilla = Camilla is Jokke's girlfriend, and the mother of their child. An entirely normal and healthy woman that works as a teacher, and plays football athletically, her selection of Jokke as a partner is her only freak factor. Jokke and Camilla met during a football match in which Pondus' and Jokke's team faced off against Camilla's team, Middlesbjørg. Camilla is an avid supporter of Manchester United (and hence a historic enemy of the less fortunate Leeds) which leads to some conflict. Recently it was discovered that Camilla had an affair with one of her colleagues, chess fanatic Tor-Ivar, something that causes Jokke and Camilla to break up. It becomes clear that they get joint custody of their son Gordon, and Jokke moves out of their apartment and into a new one above his father's record store. Camilla recently left Tor-Ivar because of his fanatical devotion to chess, something she at first thought to be cute, but later found irritating to the point of murderous rage. She asked Jokke if there was any chance for getting back together, but Jokke would not take the chance of getting that hurt again, making them just friends. Eventually Jokke and Camilla moved together again, after Camillas numerous attempts, and after Jokke realized that he would only meet severely ugly women. Their reunion is delayed one day because Camilla has to view the TV series \\"Greys Anatomy\\", which Jokke can't bear watching. = Gordon = Gordon was over a period simply known as \\"Jokke's unnamed baby son\\". After suggestions such as \\"Jokke den andre\\" (English: Jokke the second) it was decided upon Gordon, a compromise between Jokke and Camilla, in honour of Gordon Strachan who played for both Manchester United and Leeds. The parents are in an eternal quarrel over the football teams on his behalf, but there is a hint that Gordon himself is going for Queens Park Rangers because of their colours. = Else = Else (English: Elsa) is Jokke's mother and married to Günther. Together they share some unusual sexual interests, including German porn, bondage and costumes. While Günther fantasizes about Dolly Parton, Else dreams of Derrick. Else also runs a massage parlor out of her own home, and sometimes causes serious injury to her clients. Inexplicably, she is frequently mistaken for a prostitute. She also has an eternal relationship with her bathroom scale, and as a quite overweight woman, these have a tendency to break. Sometimes, all she has to do is cast a shadow. She has started taking driving lessons, and revealed herself as an exceedingly poor driving student, and a hazard in traffic. The strips featuring these events indicate she will never improve. In a 2006 strip, she was shown taking the drivers test for the 250th time, and her driving instructor has told her that her lessons alone will fund the summer home he's building in Spain. = Günther = Günther, Jokke's bald, German midget stepfather. Most of his time is spent at home with his wife, sitting in an easy chair while wearing a fez and silk pajamas, sipping a brandy, and making sure he doesn't insult his wife's weight. If he unfortunately does, he is thrown into the bathroom sink, in which he snugly fits. His father was a fighter pilot during the second world war and was shot down and killed over Norway. He was born not long after his father's death. He is an occasional transvestite. Günther also has a secret identity - Güntherman. As Güntherman, Günther sets out to fight crime. His attempts at stopping crime are usually unsuccessful, he once actually offered some robbers help to carry the famous paintings The Scream and Madonna into a van, although he has recently been inducted, after a painful initiation process, into a brotherhood of dubious superheroes. = Jacobsen = Jacobsen, Jokke's father, used to be a bank robber and jailbird during Jokke's youth, and has therefore been long-time absent. This suddenly changed when Jokke decided to contact his father, which eventually shed some light on the reasons behind Jokke's notorious taste in women and repertoire of one-liners. Together they have opened up an Antiques&Vinyl; shop, consisting mostly of items acquired by Jokke's father during his long life of crime, sold for irrationally high prices due to fake statements and facts, such as a cheap little cabinet bought at IKEA a few years back was sold as antique. The reunion of the two have apparently improved their lives a great deal. Other characters = Turid-Laila = Turid-Laila (English: Tammy-Sue) is a desirable blonde who works as a bartender at the local pub, which Pondus and Jokke have frequented since the beginning of the strip. Her manner of dealing with slobbering drunks and gawking creeps is quite impressive. She is also a source of calculated punchlines, affirming that she is no dumb blonde. Jokke was for a while roommates with Turid-Laila, and several times sabotaged her romantic life, until he got together with Camilla and moved in with her. Turid-Laila recently acquired a girlfriend named Mai-Linn, whom she met on Ibiza during the summer. She stated that this relationship probably was \\"the real thing\\", leading to the decision to go on a transglobal sailing journey with her, and selling her pub to Pondus. The love did not last very long, however, and she returned. She again works at the pub, but now with Pondus as her boss. = Kjakan = Kjakan (real name Kjell-Kristian, also called KK) is Påsan's best friend. Has a problem with acne outbreaks and obesity, and is far from the most popular boy in school. Many times he has been the victim of severe intimidation by girls from the class. Kjakan is the drummer in Påsan's band Fotsopp. = Harold & Selma = Harold and Selma are longtime friends of Beate, and depicted as a dull old couple. Selma makes most decisions in their house, and Harold is lucky if he's allowed to go outside. Harold has an obsession with his aquarium fish and golf, and is also shown as a whisky-drinker who buys good quality brands, but blends with cola (prompting Pondus to steal the bottle from him, reasoning that the only decent action is to adopt it). Selma does not approve of her husband's drinking, though, and it is also implied that Harold has a very low tolerance. On a rare night out with Pondus and Jokke (he comments that the last time he set foot in a bar, Ronald Reagan was U.S. president) he becomes intoxicated after one sip of whisky. = Hugo & Ivar = Hugo and Ivar are two of Pondus' (now former) colleagues from public transportation. Both are eternal bachelors who share the strange obsession of collecting bottle- caps. In recent strips, the duo have replaced Jokke's former role as pathetic pursuers of the world's ugliest women. They usually make a classical comedy duo (the thin one and the fat one). In this case, Hugo makes a sensible foil to Ivar´s antics. Ivar developed a unibrow in recent years. Of the two, it is Ivar who ends up ostensibly drunk and gets the occasional beating (in those stories he acts alone). = Ponny-Petra = Ponny-Petra is perhaps the most notorious and long-lasting of Jokke's acquaintances. She has a strong fascination with country music, (especially Bjøro Håland and Hank Williams), and horses, hence her name. She used to terrorize Jokke, believing herself to be his girlfriend, but fell into a coma after listening to Jokke's music (which he claimed was banned in 108 countries with the volume set to 'hairdryer'). She is an extremely strong woman, as demonstrated when she punches Jokke so hard, a space shuttle spots his hat and some of his teeth in space. Occasionally, Petra has woken up from coma. At one point, she was beaten back by Turid-Laila, and was kept in \\"suspension\\" at the local hospital (nursed by Beate among others). The last time she woke up, it was revealed that the nurses were ready to give her \\"usual treatment\\" (holding a baseball bat, to keep her in coma). At this point, dr Zimmerknaben suggested therapy, and Petra was released from hospital, only to meet a piano dropped from a plane. She is expected to be perpetually in coma from this point. = Reidar = Reidar is the local car mechanic, who has virtually no sense of ethics. He would cheat his own grandmother with absolutely no remorse (the punchline of a strip), and creatively charge for opening the hood of the car and then relaxing for a while, billing it as motor-airing. For the most of the time, he charges for replacement of fictional car parts, exploiting people who knows little about cars. However, a bottle of Jack Daniels might force him to tell the truth. Alternatively holding a very large wrench over his testicles while he lies down under the car works just as well. Only on one occasion has he been unable to find any fault in a car to exploit for profit, namely a Fiat 509 belonging to Gaston Lagaffe who made a silhouetted cameo in a strip, Reidar conceding defeat while thinking, \\"They just don't make them like that anymore..\\". = Roger = Roger is a creator of comics and cartoon strips of the poorest sort. Everything he produces is rejected by an editor in awe of the level of awful quality. Of unbreakable resolve, Roger is confident success will come to him eventually. His work has often led him to experiment with highly original variations of the superhero concepts, but more recently he has taken to copy already successful characters and place them together. He shows his strips to Pondus at the bar, but never takes any discouragement from his surly comments. Examples of Roger's series are: Tanga Trond, Kaptein Kølle(Captain Cock), Roy the boy toy, Sergeant Shitface, Dirty Duck, Nicky Buttface, Karaoke Kid, Mikke Snus og Kjøttbein (Mickey Snuff & Meaty) and Kaptein Dynetrekk (Captain Bedspread). When making fun of Pondus and Frode Øverli, other artists (most prominently Mads Eriksen) make a point in stating that Roger is the real creator of Pondus, working as a slave in the dungeon of Frode\`s immense mansion. The same meta-storyline accuses Frode of being the \\"real\\" creator of Roger\`s horrible cartoon characters. = Dr. Zimmerknaben = Dr. Zimmerknaben is Jokke's psychiatrist. Zimmerknaben often resorts to pills when seeing patients, no less when listening to Jokke's terrible dating experiences. In one strip, it reached the point of Zimmerknaben and Jokke's roles being reversed. After Jokke met Camilla, Zimmerknaben has been less used, but still shows up with random characters and their problems. = Zlatan = Zlatan is a pale, skinny black metal-guy that is employed at Jokke's store, having been a customer for a long while. Despite his intimidating appearance, snaggletoothed and corpse-like features, he has quite a gentle and innocent personality, singing Stevie Wonder and sleeping in Care-Bear pyjamas. He suffers from lack of vitamins, which caused him to be knocked over by a friendly pat on the shoulders.

The modern industry, based around firms or fashion houses run by individual designers, started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth who, beginning in 1858, was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created. Elisabeth of Austria painted by Franz Xaver Winterhalter Fashion started when humans began wearing clothes. These clothes were typically made from plants, animal skins and bone.Before the mid-19th century the division between haute couture and ready-to-wear did not really exist. All but the most basic pieces of female clothing were made-to- measure by dressmakers and seamstresses dealing directly with the client. Most often, clothing was patterned, sewn and tailored in the household. When storefronts appeared selling ready-to-wear clothing, this need was removed from the domestic workload. The design of these clothes became increasing based on printed designs, especially from Paris, which were circulated around Europe, and eagerly anticipated in the provinces. Seamstresses would then interpret these patterns as best they could. The origin of the designs was the clothes devised by the most fashionable figures, normally those at court, together with their seamstresses and tailors. Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles, followed by fashion magazines such as Cabinet des Modes. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variations became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.Laver, James: The Concise History of Costume and Fashion, Abrams, 1979, p. 62; Fernand Braudel, Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Centuries, Vol 1: The Structures of Everyday Life, p317, William Collins & Sons, London 1981 In the early 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs and became even more influential. Throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought-after and had a profound effect on public taste. Talented illustrators - among them Paul Iribe, Georges Lepape, Erté, and George Barbier - drew attractive fashion plates for these publications, which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was La Gazette du Bon Ton which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925. Before 1900: Couture beginnings During the early 18th-century, the first fashion designers came to the fore as the leaders of fashion. In the 1720s, the queen's dressmaker Françoise Leclerc became sought-after by the women of the French aristocracy,Roche, Daniel, The culture of clothing: dress and fashion in the ancien regime, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996[1994] and in the mid century, Marie Madeleine Duchapt, Mademoiselle Alexandre and Le Sieur Beaulard all gained national recognition and expanded their customer base from the French aristocracy to foreign aristocracy.Clare Haru Crowston, Credit, Fashion, Sex: Economies of Regard in Old Regime France, 2013 However, Rose Bertin is generally regarded as the first internationally famous fashion designer. Rose Bertin (July 2, 1747 – September 22, 1813), dubbed the 'Minister of Fashion', was the dressmaker to Marie Antoinette, Queen of France from 1770–1793. Bertin opened a shop in Paris and had a considerable influence on Parisian style, until the French Revolution forced her into exile in London. An outsider in the French Court, Marie Antoinette relied on Bertin's meticulous designs to help her \\"combat her enemies with style\\". Marie Antoinette's unique fashion preferences such as masculine riding breeches or simple muslin shift dresses, contrasted sharply with elaborate gowns as the Queen attempted to create a persona that would allow the citizens of France to connect with her and her lifestyle. Although Marie Antoinette's attempts were largely unsuccessful, the way in which Bertin helped the Queen express herself through fashion were groundbreaking and set a precedent for the monarchs who followed, and their designers, such as Louis Hippolyte Leroy. And by the early 19th century, designers such as Ann Margaret Lanchester and Mary Ann Bell were expanding their businesses, and publishing their own designs in fashion magazines Ashelford, Jane, The art of dress: clothes and society, 1500-1914, National Trust, London, 1996. In the first half of the 19th-century fashionable Parisian designers, such as Madame Vignon, Madame Victorine and Madame Palmyre, normally did not independently design a product which their clients could choose to buy, but rather created the product in collaboration with their clients wishes, to produce something unique.Valerie Steele: Women of Fashion: Twentieth-century Designers, Rizzoli International, 1991 An Englishman living in Paris, Charles Frederick Worth (1825 - 1905) is regarded as the first designer in the modern sense of the term, with a large business employing many largely anonymous tailors and seamstresses. A former draper, Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate what customers should wear. Launched into the spotlight as the Empress Eugénie's primary designer, Worth used his royal connections to gain recognition and clients. The proclamation on February 1, 1853 by Napoleon III that no visitors would be received to his court without formal dress meant that the popularity of Worth- style gowns became overwhelming. Ornately decorated and constructed from the finest materials, Worth's gowns are well known for their crinolines (cage-like metal structures that held the dress out in a stylish shape). Throughout the early decades of the 20th century, high fashion originated in Paris and, to a lesser extent, London. Fashion magazines from other countries sent editors to the Paris fashion shows. Department stores also sent buyers to the Paris shows, where they purchased garments to copy (and openly stole the style lines and trim details of others). Both made-to-measure salons and ready-to-wear departments featured the latest Paris trends, adapted to the stores' assumptions about the lifestyles and pocket books of their targeted customers. 1900s Fashionable lady of the era: portrait by Giovanni Boldini (1845-1931) showing Elizabeth Wharton Drexel in 1905. The outfits worn by fashionable women of during the Belle Époque (1871-1914) were strikingly similar to those worn in the heyday of the fashion pioneer Charles Worth. By the end of the 19th century, the horizons of the fashion industry had broadened, due to the more stable and independent lifestyles of well-off women and the practical clothes they demanded. However, the fashions of the Belle Époque still retained the elaborate, upholstered style of the 19th century. The changing of fashion was unthinkable, so the use of different trimmings was all that distinguished clothing from one season to the next. Conspicuous waste and conspicuous consumption defined the fashions of the decade and the outfits of the couturiers of the time were extravagant, ornate, and painstakingly made. The curvaceous S-Bend silhouette dominated fashion up until around 1908. The S-Bend corset thrust the chest forward into the mono-bosom, and, with the aid of padding, judicious placement of trim in clothing, and, most especially, a particular posture entirely independent of the corset, created the illusion of an \\"S\\" silhouette. Toward the end of the decade Paul Poiret introduced designs that did not include a petticoat or a corset, taking the S shape out of fashion. This was a big change, as women's waists had been shaped by corsets since the Renaissance. The Maison Redfern, founded by the English tailor John Redfern (1820-1895), was the first fashion house to offer women sportswear and tailored suits based on their male counterparts, and his practical and soberly elegant garments soon became indispensable to the wardrobes of well-dressed women. 1910s During the early years of the 1910s the fashionable silhouette became much more lithe and fluid, and softer than in the 19th century. When the Ballets Russes performed Scheherazade in Paris in 1910, a craze for Orientalism ensued. The couturier Paul Poiret was one of the first designers to translate this into the fashion world. Poiret's clients were at once transformed into harem girls in flowing pantaloons, turbans, and vivid colors and geishas in exotic kimono. Poiret also devised the first outfit which women could put on without the help of a maid. The Art Deco movement began to emerge at this time and its influence was evident in the designs of many couturiers of the time. Simple felt hats, turbans, and clouds of tulle replaced the styles of headgear popular in the 19th century. It is also notable that the first real fashion shows were organized during this period, by Jeanne Paquin, one of the first female couturiers, who was also the first Parisian couturier to open foreign branches in London, Buenos Aires, and Madrid. Two of the most influential fashion designers of the time were Jacques Doucet and Mariano Fortuny. Doucet excelled in layering pastel colors and his elaborate gossamer dresses suggested the Impressionist shimmers of reflected light. His distinguished customers never lost a taste for his fluid lines and flimsy, diaphanous materials. While obeying imperatives that left little to the imagination of the couturier, Doucet was nonetheless a designer of immense taste and discrimination, a role many have tried since, but rarely with Doucet's level of success. The Venice-based designer Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo, was a curious figure, with very few parallels in any age. For his dress designs he conceived a special pleating process and new dyeing techniques. He gave the name Delphos to his long clinging sheath dresses that undulated with color. Each garment was made of a single piece of the finest silk, its unique color acquired by repeated immersions in dyes whose shades were suggestive of moonlight or of the watery reflections of the Venetian lagoon. Breton straw, Mexican cochineal, and indigo from the Far East were among the ingredients that Fortuny used. Among his many devotees were Eleonora Duse, Isadora Duncan, Cléo de Mérode, the Marchesa Casati, Émilienne d’Alençon, and Liane de Pougy. Changes in dress during World War I were dictated more by necessity than fashion. As more and more women were forced to work, they demanded clothes that were better suited to their new activities. Social events had to be postponed in favor of more pressing work and the need to mourn the increasing numbers of dead, visits to the wounded, and the general gravity of the time meant that darker colors became the norm. A new monochrome look emerged that was unfamiliar to young women in comfortable circumstances. By 1915 fashionable skirts had risen above the ankle and, by 1920, to mid-calf. Golden age of French fashion  The period between the two World Wars, often considered to be the Golden Age of French fashion, was one of great change and reformation. Haute couture found new clients in the ranks of film actresses, American heiresses, and the wives and daughters of wealthy industrialists. =1920s= Fashionable Hollywood actress Louise Brooks After the First World War, a radical change came about in fashion. Bouffant coiffures gave way to short bobs, dresses with long trains gave way to above-the-knee pinafores. Corsets were abandoned and women borrowed their clothes from the male wardrobe and chose to dress like boys. Although, at first, many couturiers were reluctant to adopt the new androgynous style, they embraced them wholeheartedly from around 1925. A bustless, waistless silhouette emerged and aggressive dressing-down was mitigated by feather boas, embroidery, and showy accessories. The flapper style (known to the French as the 'garçonne' look) became very popular among young women. The cloche hat was widely worn and sportswear became popular with both men and women, with designers like Jean Patou and Coco Chanel popularizing the sporty and athletic look. The great couturière Coco Chanel was a major figure in fashion at the time, known as much for her magnetic personality as for her chic and progressive designs. Chanel helped popularize the bob hairstyle, the little black dress, and the use of jersey knit for women's clothing; she also elevated the status of costume jewelry and knitwear. Two other prominent French designers of the 1920s were Jeanne Lanvin and Jean Patou. Jeanne Lanvin, who began her career as a milliner, made such beautiful outfits for her young daughter Marguerite that people started to ask for copies. Lanvin's name appears in the fashion yearbook from about 1901, however it was in the 1920s that she reached the peak of her success. The Lanvin style embraced the look of the time, with its skillful use of complex trimmings, dazzling embroideries, and beaded decorations in light, clear, floral colors that eventually became a Lanvin trademark. By 1925 Lanvin produced many different products, including sportswear, furs, lingerie, men's fashion, and interior designs. Her global approach to fashion foreshadowed the schemes that all the large contemporary fashion houses would later adopt in their efforts to diversify. The style of Jean Patou was never mainstream, but full of originality and characterized by a studied simplicity which was to win him fame, particularly in the American markets. Many of his garments, with their clean lines, geometric and Cubist motifs, and mixture of luxury and practicality, were designed to satisfy the new vogue for the outdoor life, and bore a remarkable similarity to modern sportswear. The most famous advocate of his style was Suzanne Lenglen, the legendary tennis champion. In menswear there was a growing mood of informality, among the Americans especially, which was mirrored in fashions that emphasized youthfulness and relaxation. In the past, there was a special outfit for every event in the well-dressed gentleman's day, but young men in the 1920s, no longer afraid to show their youthfulness, began to wear the same soft wool suit all day long. Short suit jackets replaced the old long jackets of the past which were now only worn for formal occasions. Men had a variety of sport clothes available to them, including sweaters and short pants, commonly known as knickers. For evening wear a short tuxedo was more fashionable than the tail-coat, which was now seen as somewhat old-fashioned. The London cut, with its slim lines, loose- fitting sleeves, and padded shoulders, perfected by the English tailor Scholte, was very popular. Fair Isle patterns became very popular for both sexes. Heels, at the time, were often over two inches high and helped popularize the two-tone shoe. Salvatore Ferragamo and André Perugia were two of the most influential and respected designers in footwear. Many stars of the [silent film]s had a significant impact on fashion during the 1920s, including Louise Brooks, Gloria Swanson, and Colleen Moore. The lighthearted, forward- looking fashions of the 1920s gradually came to halt after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and succumbed to a more conservative style. While the flapper look persisted into 1930, it quickly disappeared afterwards, although bell- shaped hats lasted through 1933. =1930s= In the 1930s, as the public began to feel the effects of the Great Depression, many designers found that crises were not the time for experimentation. Fashion became more compromising, aspiring to preserve feminism's victories while rediscovering a subtle and reassuring elegance and sophistication. Overall, 1930s clothing was somber and modest, reflecting the difficult social and economic situation of the decade. Women's fashions moved away from the brash, daring style of the 1920s towards a more romantic, feminine silhouette. The waistline was restored, hemlines dropped to nearly ankle-length, there was renewed appreciation of the bust, and backless evening gowns, and soft, slim-fitting day dresses became popular. The female body was remodeled into a more neo-classical shape, and slim, toned, and athletic bodies came into vogue. The fashion for outdoor activities stimulated couturiers to manufacture what would today be referred to as \\"sportswear.\\" The term \\"ready-to-wear\\" was not yet widely in use, but the boutiques described such clothes as being \\"for sport\\". In place of the bobbed flapper haircut, the standard women's hairstyle of the 1930s was a modest, short perm. Two of the most prominent and influential fashion designers of the 1930s were Elsa Schiaparelli and Madeleine Vionnet. Elsa Schiaparelli showed her first collection in 1929 and was immediately hailed by the press as 'one of the rare innovators' of the day. With her exciting and inventive designs, Schiaparelli did not so much revolutionize fashion as shatter its foundations. The first pullover she displayed in her windows created a sensation: it was knitted in black with a trompe-l'œil white bow. Schiaparelli was a close friend of Christian Bérard, Jean Cocteau, and Salvador Dalí, who designed embroidery motifs for her and supplied inspiration for models like the desk suit with drawers for pockets, the shoe-shaped hat, the silk dresses painted with flies or lobsters. All of Paris thronged to her salon at 21 Place Vendôme as collection succeeded collection. Madeleine Vionnet found her inspiration in ancient statues, creating timeless and beautiful gowns that would not look out of place on a Greek frieze. Queen of the bias cut (cutting diagonally across the fabric's lengthwise threads), she produced evening dresses that fitted the body without excessive elaboration or dissimulation, employing a flowing and elegant line. Her perfect draping of chiffon, silk, and Moroccan crêpe created a marvelously poised and sensual effect. The unparalleled success of Vionnet's cuts guaranteed her reputation right up to her retirement in 1939. Mainbocher, the first American designer to live and work in Paris, was also influential, with his plain yet supremely elegant designs, often employing the bias cut pioneered by Vionnet. The luxury goods manufacturer Hermès began to sell handmade printed silk square scarves in the early 1930s, in addition to popularizing the zipper and many other practical innovations. Toward the end of the decade, women's fashions took on a somewhat more imposing and broad- shouldered silhouette, possibly influenced by Elsa Schiaparelli. Men's fashions continued the informal, practical trend that had dominated since the end of the First World War. Mid-twentieth century After World War II, Paris's reputation as the global center of fashion began to crumble. A new youth style emerged in the 1950s, changing the focus of fashion. In the West, the traditional divide between high society and the working class was challenged. In particular, a new young generation wanted to reap the benefits of a booming consumer society. Privilege became less blatantly advertised than in the past and differences were more glossed over. As the ancient European hierarchies were overturned, the external marks of distinction faded. By the time the first rockets were launched into space, Europe was more than ready to adopt a quality ready-to-wear garment along American lines—something to occupy the middle ground between off-the-peg and couture. This need was all the more pressing because increases in overhead and raw material costs were beginning to relegate handmade fashion to the sidelines. Meanwhile, rapidly developing new technologies made it increasingly easy to manufacture an ever-improving, high-quality product. Faced with the threat of a factory-made, fashion-based product, Parisian fashion couture mounted its defenses, but to little effect. While the old world was taking its final bow, the changes in fashion were one of the most visible manifestations of the general shake-up in society. Before long, classes of women hitherto restricted to inferior substitutes to haute couture would enjoy a greatly enlarged freedom of choice. Dealing in far larger quantities, production cycles were longer than those of couture workshops, which meant that stylists planning their lines for the twice-yearly collections had to try to guess more than a year in advance what their customers would want. A new authority had taken over—that of the street, constituting a further threat to the dictatorship of couture. =1940s= Many fashion houses closed during the occupation of Paris during World War II, including the Maison Vionnet and the Maison Chanel. Several designers, including Mainbocher, permanently relocated to New York. In the enormous moral and intellectual re-education program undertaken by the French state, couture was not spared. In contrast to the stylish, liberated Parisienne, the Vichy regime promoted the model of the wife and mother—a robust, athletic young woman—a figure much more consistent with the new regime's political agenda. Meanwhile, Germany was taking possession of over half of what France produced, including high fashion, and was considering relocating French haute couture to Berlin and Vienna. The archives of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture were seized, including, most consequentially, the client list. The point of all this was to break up a monopoly that supposedly threatened the dominance of the Third Reich. Due to difficult times, hemlines crept upward in both evening wear and day wear, the latter of which was made using substitute materials whenever possible. From 1940 onward, fabric was needed for military personnel; to everyone else, it was rationed, with an allowance of no more than four meters (thirteen feet) of cloth was permitted to be used for a coat and a little over one meter (three feet) for a blouse. No belt could be over 3 centimetres (one and a half inches) wide. Everyone, from housewives to designers, were forced to re-use of old fabric or create new styles out of old garments. Haute couture did its best to keep its flag flying. Humor and frivolity became a popstar way of defying the occupying powers and couture survived. Although some have argued that the reason it endured was due to the patronage of the wives of wealthy Nazis, records reveal that, aside from the usual wealthy Parisiennes, it was an eclectic mix of the wives of foreign ambassadors, clients from the black market, and miscellaneous other patrons of the salons (among whom German women were but a minority) that kept the doors open at fashion houses such as Jacques Fath, Maggy Rouff, Marcel Rochas, Jeanne Lafaurie, Nina Ricci, and Madeleine Vramant. Permed hairstyles remained standard, although during the '40s, this evolved into a bobbed roll along the lower part of the hairline. During the Occupation, the only true way for a woman to flaunt her extravagance or add color to a drab outfit was to wear a hat. In this period, hats were often made of scraps of material that would otherwise have been thrown away, including bits of paper and wood shavings. Among the most innovative milliners of the time were Pauline Adam, Simone Naudet, Rose Valois, and Le Monnier. Paris's isolated situation in the 1940s enabled Americans to fully utilize the ingenuity and creativity of their own designers. During the Second World War, Vera Maxwell presented outfits constituted of plain, simply cut co-ordinates, and introduced innovations to men's work clothes. Bonnie Cashin transformed boots into a major fashion accessory, and, in 1944, began the production of original and imaginative sportswear. Claire McCardell, Anne Klein, and Cashin formed a remarkable trio of women who laid the foundations of American sportswear, ensuring that ready- to-wear was not considered a mere second best, but an elegant and comfortable way for modern women to dress. In the War Years, the zoot suit (and in France the zazou suit) became popular among young men. Many actresses of the time, including Rita Hayworth, Katharine Hepburn, and Marlene Dietrich, had a significant impact on popular fashion. The couturier Christian Dior created a tidal wave with his first collection in February 1947. The collection contained dresses with accentuated busts, tiny (or \\"wasp\\") waists, and extravagantly full skirts, emphasizing the feminine hourglass figure in a manner very similar to the style of the Belle Époque. The lavish use of fabric and the feminine elegance of the designs appealed to post-war clientele, and ensured Dior's meteoric rise to fame. The sheer sophistication of the style incited the all-powerful editor of the American Harper's Bazaar, Carmel Snow, to exclaim 'This is a new look!'. =1950s= Flying in the face of continuity, support and logic, and erudite sociological predictions, fashion in the 1950s, far from being revolutionary and progressive, used more from the previous decade. A whole society which, in the 1920s and 1930s, had greatly believed in progress, was now much more circumspect. Despite the fact that women had the right to vote, to work, and to drive their own cars, they chose to wear dresses made of opulent materials, with corseted waists and swirling skirts to mid-calf. As fashion looked to the past, haute couture experienced something of a revival and spawned a myriad of star designers who profited hugely from the rapid growth of the media. Throughout the 1950s, although it would be for the last time, women around the world continued to submit to the trends of Parisian haute couture. Three of the most prominent of the Parisian couturiers of the time were Cristóbal Balenciaga, Hubert de Givenchy, and Pierre Balmain. The frugal prince of luxury, Cristóbal Balenciaga Esagri made his fashion debut in the late 1930s. However, it was not until the post-war years that the full scale of the inventiveness of this highly original designer became evident. In 1951, he totally transformed the silhouette, broadening the shoulders and removing the waist. In 1955, he designed the tunic dress, which later developed into the chemise dress of 1957. And eventually, in 1959, his work culminated in the Empire line, with high-waisted dresses and coats cut like kimonos. His mastery of fabric design and creation defied belief. Balenciaga is also notable as one of the few couturiers in fashion history who could use their own hands to design, cut, and sew the models which symbolized the height of his artistry. Hubert de Givenchy opened his first couture house in 1952 and created a sensation with his separates, which could be mixed and matched at will. Most renowned was his Bettina blouse made from shirting, which was named after his top model. Soon, boutiques were opened in Rome, Zurich, and Buenos Aires. A man of immense taste and discrimination, he was, perhaps more than any other designer of the period, an integral part of the world whose understated elegance he helped to define. Pierre Balmain opened his own salon in 1945. It was in a series of collections named 'Jolie Madame' that he experienced his greatest success, from 1952 onwards. Balmain's vision of the elegantly dressed woman was particularly Parisian and was typified by the tailored glamour of the \\"New Look\\", with its ample bust, narrow waist, and full skirts, by mastery of cut and imaginative assemblies of fabrics in subtle color combinations. His sophisticated clientele was equally at home with luxurious elegance, simple tailoring, and a more natural look. Along with his haute couture work, the talented businessman pioneered a ready-to-wear range called Florilege and also launched a number of highly successful perfumes. Also notable is the return of Coco Chanel (who detested the \\"New Look\\") to the fashion world. Following the closure of her salons in the war years, in 1954, aged over seventy, she staged a comeback and on February 5 she presented a collection which contained a whole range of ideas that would be adopted and copied by women all over the world: her famous little braided suit with gold chains, shiny costume jewelry, silk blouses in colors that matched the suit linings, sleek tweeds, monogrammed buttons, flat black silk bows, boaters, quilted bags on chains, and evening dresses and furs that were marvels of simplicity. Despite being a high fashion designer, American born Mainbocher also designed military and civilian service uniforms. In 1952, he redesigned the Women Marines service uniform combining femininity with functionality. Previous redesigns include uniforms for the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) in 1942, and uniform designs for the Girl Scouts of the USA and the American Red Cross in 1948. Dior's \\"New Look\\" (that premiered in 1947) revived the popularity of girdles and the all-in-one corselettes. In the early 1950s, many couture houses used the interest in \\"foundationwear\\" to launch their own lines, soon after many lingerie manufacturers began to build their own brands. In 1957, Jane Russell wore the \\"Cantilever\\" bra that was scientifically designed by Howard Hughes to maximize a voluptuous look. The invention of Lycra (originally called \\"Fibre K\\") in 1959 revolutionized the underwear industry and was quickly incorporated into every aspect of lingerie. After the war, the American look (which consisted of broad shoulders, floral ties, straight-legged pants, and shirts with long pointed collars, often worn hanging out rather than tucked in) became very popular among men in Europe. Certain London manufacturers ushered in a revival of Edwardian elegance in men's fashion, adopting a tight-fitting retro style that was intended to appeal to traditionalists. This look, originally aimed at the respectable young man about town, was translated into popular fashion as the Teddy boy style. The Italian look, popularized by Caraceni, Brioni, and Cifonelli, was taken up by an entire generation of elegant young lovers, on both sides of the Atlantic. Plaid was very common in 1950s men's fashion, both for shirts and suits, along with the \\"ducktail\\" haircut, which was often viewed as a symbol of teenage rebellion and banned in schools. During the second half of the 1950s, there was a general move towards less formal clothing, especially among men's fashion. The fedora and Homburg hat, as well as trench coats, disappeared from widespread use (this trend had already begun some years earlier on the more informal West Coast of the US) after having been standard parts of menswear since the 1920s. The designers of Hollywood created a particular type of glamour for the stars of American film, and outfits worn by the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, or Grace Kelly were widely copied. Quantitatively speaking, a costume worn by an actress in a Hollywood movie would have a much bigger audience than the photograph of a dress designed by a couturier illustrated in a magazine read by no more than a few thousand people. Without even trying to keep track of all the Paris styles, its costume designers focused on their own version of classicism, which was meant to be timeless, flattering, and photogenic. Using apparently luxurious materials, such as sequins, chiffon, and fur, the clothes were very simply cut, often including some memorable detail, such as a low-cut back to a dress which was only revealed when the actress turned her back from the camera or some particularly stunning accessory. The most influential and respected designers of Hollywood from the 1930s to the 1950s were Edith Head, Orry- Kelly, William Travilla, Jean Louis, Travis Banton, and Gilbert Adrian. Everyday women's clothing during the decade consisted of long coats, hats with small veils, and leather gloves. Knee-length dresses combined with pearl necklaces, which were made instantly popular by First Lady Mamie Eisenhower. Short, permed hair was the standard women's hairstyle of the period. By the end of the decade mass-manufactured, off-the-peg clothing had become much more popular than in the past, granting the general public unprecedented access to fashionable styles. =1960s= Until the 1960s, Paris was considered to be the center of fashion throughout the world. However, between 1960 and 1969 a radical shake-up occurred in the fundamental structure of fashion. From the 1960s onward, there would never be just one single, prevailing trend or fashion but a great plethora of possibilities, indivisibly linked to all the various influences in other areas of people's lives. Prosperity and the emergence of a distinct teenager culture, combined with the counterculture movement, would all have major effects on fashion. After 30 years of conservative clothing styles, the '60s saw a kind of throwback to the 1920s with women once again adopting a childlike look with bobbed haircuts and progressively less modest clothing. At the start of the decade skirts were knee-length, but steadily became shorter and shorter until the mini-skirt emerged in 1965. By the end of the decade they had shot well above the stocking top, making the transition to tights inevitable. Many of the radical changes in fashion developed in the streets of London, with such gifted designers as Mary Quant (known for launching the mini skirt) and Barbara Hulanicki (the founder of the legendary boutique Biba). Paris also had its share of new and revolutionary designers, including Pierre Cardin (known for his visionary and skillfully cut designs), André Courrèges (known for his futuristic outfits and for launching the mini skirt along with Mary Quant), Yves Saint Laurent (known for his revolutionary yet elegant fashions), and Emanuel Ungaro (known for his imaginative use of color and bold baroque contrasts). In the United States, Rudi Gernreich (known for his avant-garde and futuristic designs) and James Galanos (known for his luxurious ready-to- wear) were also reaching a young audience. The main outlets for these new young fashion designers were small boutiques, selling outfits that were not exactly 'one-offs', but were made in small quantities in a limited range of sizes and colors. However, not all designers took well to the new style and mood. In 1965, Coco Chanel mounted a rearguard action against the exposure of the knee and Balenciaga resolutely continued to produce feminine and conservative designs. The basic shape and style of the time was simple, neat, trim, and colorful. Hats had already begun their decline in the previous decade and were now almost completely extinct except for special occasions. Lower kitten heels were a pretty substitute to stilettos. Pointed toes gave way to chisel shaped toes in 1961 and to an almond toe in 1963. Flat boots also became popular with very short dresses in 1965 and eventually they rose up the leg and reached the knee. The '60s for the first time saw a widespread assortment of popular hairstyles, including bobs, pageboy cuts, and beehives. Two notable and influential designers in the 1960s were Emilio Pucci and Paco Rabanne. Emilio Pucci's sportswear designs and prints inspired by Op art, psychedelia, and medieval heraldic banners earned him a reputation that extended far beyond the circles of high society. His sleek shift dresses, tunics, and beachwear, created a 'Puccimania' that was all part of a movement to liberate the female form and his designs are today synonymous with the 1960s. Francisco Rabaneda Cuervo (later Paco Rabanne) opened his first couture house in 1966 and, from the start, produced resolutely modern designs. Rather than using conventional dress materials, he created garments from aluminum, Rhodoid, and pieces of scrap metal. His designs, as well as being experimental, were also closely in tune with what modern adventurous young women wanted to wear. Among his innovations are the seamless dress made, after much experiment, by spraying vinyl chloride on to a mold, and the low-budget disposable dress made of paper and nylon thread. Rabanne was also the first fashion designer to use black models, which very nearly resulted in his dismissal from the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. The success of his perfume Calandre helped support the less profitable areas of his work, while his utopianism assured him a unique position in the conservative world of haute couture. The principal change in menswear in the 1960s was in the weight of the fabric used. The choice of materials and the method of manufacture produced a suit that, because it was lighter in weight, had a totally different look, with a line that was closer to the natural shape of the body, causing men to look at their figures more critically. The spread of jeans served to accelerate a radical change in the male wardrobe. Young men grew their hair down to their collars and added a touch of color, and even floral motifs, to their shirts. The polo neck never succeeded in replacing the tie, but the adoption of the workman's jacket in rough corduroy, and especially the mao jacket proved to be more than simply a political statement. A few futuristic rumblings were set off by Pierre Cardin and Andre Courrèges, but the three-piece suit still survived intact. In the early 1960s there were influential 'partnerships' of celebrities and high-fashion designers, most famously Audrey Hepburn with Givenchy, and Jackie Kennedy with Oleg Cassini. Also, many models had a very profound effect on fashion, most notably Twiggy, Veruschka, Jean Shrimpton. Early in the decade, culottes were in style and the bikini finally came into fashion in 1963. The hippie and psychedelic movements late in the decade also had a strong influence on clothing styles, including bell-bottom jeans (designed by the English tailor Tommy Nutter, from his Savoy store), tie-dye and batik fabrics, as well as paisley prints. =1970s= Nicknamed the 'me' decade; 'please yourself' was the catchphrase of the 1970s. Some saw it as the end of good taste. The decade began with a continuation of the hippie look of the late 1960s, with kaftans, Indian scarves, and floral- print tunics. Jeans remained frayed and bell-bottomed, tie dye was still popular, and the fashion for unisex mushroomed. An immense movement claiming civil rights for blacks combined with the influence of soul music from the USA created a nostalgia for Africa and African culture. A radical chic emerged, influenced by the likes of James Brown, Diana Ross, Angela Davis, and the Black Panthers, in everything from afro hairstyles to platform soles. During the 1970s brands greatly increased their share of the international market. Hems began dropping in 1974 to below the knee, until finally reaching the lower mid calf in 1977 and shoulderlines were dropped. After 1975, fashions came to be dominated by the \\"disco look\\" which included feathered women's haircuts and on men, the three-piece leisure suit. Bell-bottomed pants would remain popular through the entire decade. Perhaps the two most innovative fashion designers in 1970s France were Kenzo Takada and Sonia Rykiel. The undisputed star of Parisian fashion in the 1970s, Kenzo drew his inspiration from all over the world, mixing Western and Oriental folk influences with a fantastic joie de vivre and an instinctive understanding of what his young customers wanted. With his fluid lines, unusual prints, clever accessories, and finery that was hitherto unprecedented in ready-to-wear, he very much turned the fashion world upside down. The queen of figure-hugging knits, in 1974, Sonia Rykiel designed her first pullovers with reversed seams. However, more than that, she created a whole range of clothes that were extremely individual and yet could be worn almost anywhere. The Rykiel style, dominated by fluid knitted garments, dark blacks, rhinestones, long boa-like scarves, and little crocheted hats, conquered the American market, and even to this day Rykiel is considered by many Americans as the true successor of Chanel. Because of punk, London retained a considerable degree of influence over fashion, most significantly in the boutiques of the King's Road, where Vivienne Westwood's boutique, SEX, which opened in 1971, blew with the prevailing wind. This temple of British iconoclasm centered on fetishistic accessories and ranges of clothing in which black rubber and steel studs were the external signs of an underlying sadism. Postmodernist and iconoclastic in essence the punk movement was a direct reaction to the economic situation during the economic depression of the period, the vehicle for a hatred that was more visceral than political. Punk had at its heart a manifesto of creation through disorder. With their ripped T-shirts, Native American hairstyles, Doc Martens, bondage trousers, and chains, the punks exported an overall feeling of disgust around the globe. Another popular British style was the resolutely unmodern, feminine, countrified style of clothing popularized by Laura Ashley, which consisted of long flounced skirts and high-necked blouses in traditional floral prints, worn with crocheted shawls. Laura Ashley started out running a small business in Wales in the mid-1960s and the company continued to expand until the accidental death of its owner in 1985. Laura Ashley was not the only designer to look nostalgically to the past. Fashions based on the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and 50s were popular throughout much of the decade, with Hollywood films like The Godfather and The Great Gatsby, and numerous exhibitions on costume history at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York increasing their popularity. In Japan, the boutiques of Tokyo's fashionable Harajuku district sold many reworked versions of traditional British and American looks. In the United States, the general trend in fashion was towards simplification and longer skirts, although many women reacted negatively to the midi-length, which they felt to be aging. Pants, on the other hand, earned unanimous approval. Jeans profited most from becoming an accepted part of the American fashion scene in the 1970s, their new-found respectability deriving from their inclusion in collections under the heading of sportswear. The new stars of American ready-to-wear adapted the best of what they learned from Europe to the massive American clothing industry. Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren rose from anonymity more or less simultaneously to tackle the question of designing clothes for the men and women of a new world. Two opposing movements dominated fashion in the U.S during the 1970s. On one hand, there was the tailored, unisex look; on the other hand, a fluid, unstructured style with a strong feeling of 1930s glamor. The most influential American designer of the time, Roy Halston Frowick (known simply as Halston), belonged to the latter category. Acquiring celebrity status on the New York scene, his particular talent was in reconciling the made-to-measure garment for the special occasion with concepts of comfort, naturalness, and relaxation. With his kaftans, shirtwaisters, djellabas, ultra-lightweight shift dresses, and tunics worn over shorts and wide-legged pants, he was an icon of the era, and a regular visitor at the VIP room of the Studio 54 after its opening in 1977. Geoffrey Beene, praised for his elegant and sophisticated cuts and his use of black and white, was at his most successful in the radically simplified designs at which he excelled. His smart little dresses and well-cut suits in jersey, flannel, and wool were instrumental in discouraging American women from over-accessorizing. Bill Blass, who launched his own range in 1962, developed the habit of traveling all over the United States in order to hear for himself what his customers desired. One of the most popular designers of the time, he was almost too successful in fulfilling his customers wishes. His disciplined style and workmanship was particularly favored by businesswomen and the wives of senior executives. Betsey Johnson started out designing for the boutique Paraphernalia. Using vinyl and metallic fabrics and putting emphasis on wit, imagination, and independence, she brought an unprecedented spirit of irreverence to New York in the 1970s. In popular fashion the glam rock style of clothing, worn by such rock performers as David Bowie and Marc Bolan, was very influential, particularly in the United Kingdom. The designer Elio Fiorucci had a very similar look. His boutique in Milan sold such things as brightly colored rubber boots, plastic daisy sandals, fake fur, and Pop Art-inspired jackets. During the 1970s a new generation of menswear boutiques sprang up, aiming to change the decor, rituals, and customer base of a traditionally 'difficult' trade. To sell fashionable clothes to a young man at the end of the 1960s was still, in many circles, tantamount to questioning his masculinity. Men's appearance changed more in the 1970s than it had done in a whole century. Many of the fashion designers who revolutionized the male look owed a lot of their innovations to Pierre Cardin: narrow shoulders, tight-fitting lines, no tie, no interfacing, zip-up boiler suits, waisted jackets or tunics, sometimes no shirt. Work clothes supplied inspiration for a less formal style, encouraging designers to look beyond the traditional suit and, for example, adopt a unisex look or investigate the massive supply of second-hand clothes. Sometimes this kind of male dressing-down, often denounced as 'hippie', gained formal recognition as a deliberate look. At certain other times, as part of a retro movement, designers introduced a revival of 1930s elegance. The unearthing of old military clothing, preferably khaki and from the United States; English-style shoes; Oxford shirts; immaculate T-shirts; tweed jackets with padded shoulders; brightly colored V-neck sweaters; cashmere-printed scarves draped around the neck all imposed a certain uniformity on the casual beatnik look of the male wardrobe at the end of the 1970s. Also significant are the developments in Italian fashion that happened during the period. In the course of the 1970s, as a result of its ready-to-wear industry, Milan confirmed its status as second only to Paris as a center of international fashion. The 'alta moda' preferred Rome, the base of the couturiers Valentino, Capucci, and Schön. Capitalizing on the dominant trend of anti-fashion Italy offered a glamor that had nothing to do with the dictates of Parisian haute couture. While profiting from a clearly defined style, Italian fashion was luxurious and easy to wear. The two most influential Italian fashion designers of the time were probably Giorgio Armani and Nino Cerruti. Giorgio Armani produced his first collection for women in 1975. From the outset, the line was dynamic, urban, and understated, androgynous in inspiration. Armani offered a restrained style that greatly appealed to the increasing population of women who now had access to the world of work and occupied progressively more senior positions within it. This was only the beginning of a tremendous career, which came to fruition in 1981 when Emporio Armani was launched. In 1957 Nino Cerruti opened the menswear boutique Hitman in Milan. A man of taste and discernment, in 1976 he presented his first collection for women. Two years later, he launched his first perfume. In linking the career of a successful industrialist with that of a high-quality designer, Cerruti occupied a unique position in Italian ready-to-wear. Late twentieth century During the late 20th century, fashions began to criss-cross international boundaries with rapidity. Popular Western styles were adopted all over the world, and many designers from outside of the West had a profound impact on fashion. Synthetic materials such as Lycra/spandex, and viscose became widely used, and fashion, after two decades of looking to the future, once again turned to the past for inspiration. =1980s= The society of the 1980s no longer criticized itself as consumerist, but was, instead, interested in 'the spectacle'. The self- conscious image of the decade was very good for the fashion industry, which had never been quite so à la mode. Fashion shows were transfigured into media- saturated spectaculars and frequently televised, taking high priority in the social calendar. Appearance was related to performance, which was of supreme importance to a whole generation of young urban professionals, whose desire to look the part related to a craving for power. The way in which men and women associated with the latest styles was no more a matter of passive submission but disco music rapidly fell out of favor as the decade began, along with its associated clothing styles. By 1982, the last traces of 1970s fashion were gone. During the 1980s, the mullet became the standard men's haircut and women sported large, square-cut perms although there were many variations of both. Jumpsuits became a popular element of female clothing and on men, skinny neckties and wraparound sunglasses. Also during the '80s, aerobics were in vogue and so brought into style Spandex leggings and headbands. The two French fashion designers who best defined the look of the period were a man and Azzedine Alaia. Strongly influenced by his early career in the theater, Thierry Mugler produced fashion designs that combined Hollywood retro and futurism, with rounded hips, sharply accentuated shoulders, and a slight hint of the galactic heroine. Mugler's glamorous dresses were a remarkable success, and signified the complete end of the hippy era and its unstructured silhouette. Known for his awe-inspiring combinations, Azzedine Alaia greatly influenced the silhouette of the woman of the 1980s. The master of all kinds of techniques that had previously been known only to haute couture, he experimented with many new and underused materials, such as spandex and viscose. The finish, simplicity, and sheer sexiness of Alaia's look made women of every generation identify with his seductive style, and during the 1980s he achieved a certain glory and was held in high regard by members of his own profession. Also creating designs very typical of the era were Claude Montana, whose imposing, broad-shouldered designs, often made of leather, would not have looked out of place in the futuristic universe of Thierry Mugler, and Christian Lacroix, who sent shock waves through the world of haute couture, with his flounced skirts, embroidered corselets, bustles, and polka-dotted crinolines which evoked the rhythms of flamenco. A number of promising newcomers entered the fashion scene in the 1980s. Angelo Tarlazzi, an extraordinary technician who once worked for Patou, bewitched both the press and his customers with his 'handkerchief' dresses. Made of squares of fabric, they transpired, when you came to put them on, to be far more complicated than at first appeared. Many a Parisian soirée of the 1980s was enlivened by his dresses, all in a fluid and original style, in which cutting and sewing were kept to a minimum. Chantal Thomas, the queen of sexy stockings and lace, won a devoted following for her seductive underwear and for evening gowns that looked like nightdresses and vice versa. Guy Paulin was one of the first designers to promote a severe, plain, and uncluttered look. His garments were classical in their proportions and made for comfort and simplicity, with their harmonious lines reinforced by a subtle palette of colors and fine materials. Under his own name, Joseph designed luxurious knitwear along classic lines, creating loose, sexy garments in neutral colors. Carolina Herrera, long regarded as one of the most elegant members of the jet set, in 1981 launched a series of collections aimed at women like herself, featuring impeccably cut clothes of high quality and attractive evening dresses. Japanese designers such as Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto offered a look which marked a total break with the prevailing fashion image of the time. Flat shoes, no make-up, reserve, modesty, and secrecy were the hallmarks of this modern look. Eventually, it began to include details from the fashions of the past, as Europe's ancient sites were revisited by these anarchists of fashion, whose influence on shape of clothes, at the end of the 20th-century, became legendary. In American fashion the seductive, clinging style of Donna Karan and the casual sophistication of Ralph Lauren were very influential. A star of the New York social scene, Donna Karan brought a very personal and feminine approach to the severe, sober-colored, casual look that dominated American ready-to-wear. Setting up her own label in 1984, her designs won instant popularity among active urban women who greatly appreciated the understated luxury of her clothes. In 1971 Ralph Lauren opened a boutique for both men and women in Beverly Hills. His aristocratic style at prices the average American could afford created a sensation. For an elite faced with all kinds of avant- garde fashions, it represented a rallying point, endorsing a classic look that had been adopted for an active life. The number one of American ready-to-wear, Lauren was equally successful with his sportswear and jeans, which allowed him to reach the widest possible range of social classes and age groups. Central to the success of a new wave of American sportswear was the Perry Ellis label, established in 1978, which used color and natural fibers to great advantage in its elegant variations on the basics. Norma Kamali, with her short skirts made of sweatshirting, leotards, headbands, and leg warmers, made jogging look fashionable. Kamali also created the popular 'rah-rah skirt'. Also notable is the extreme popularity of the Adidas sports label, which achieved an incredible level of street cred in the 1980s, inciting the hip hop group Run DMC to release the single 'My Adidas' in 1986. The legendary shoe designer Manolo Blahnik also rose to fame during the 1980s. The multiplicity of trends that bloomed during the 80s were curtailed by the economic recession that set in at the beginning of the 1990s, largely destroying the optimistic mood that is so advantageous to the fashion industry. =1990s= In the 1990s it was no longer the done thing to follow fashion slavishly, a sharp contrast to the highly a la mode 1970s and 1980s. The phobia of being underdressed was finally completely displaced by the fear of overdressing. Fashion in the 1990s united around a new standard, minimalism, and styles of stark simplicity became the vogue. Despite the best efforts of a few designers to keep the flag for pretty dresses flying, by the end of the decade the notion of ostentatious finery had virtually disappeared. As well as the styling of the product, its promotion in the media became crucial to its success and image. The financial pressures of the decade had a devastating effect on the development of new talent and lessened the autonomy enjoyed by more established designers. Fashion at the end of the 20th century tackled themes that fashion had not previously embraced. These themes included rape, disability, religious violence, death, and body modification. There was a dramatic move away from the sexy styles aimed at the glamorous femme fatale of the 1980s, and many designers, taken with a vision of romantic poverty, adopted the style of the poverty-stricken waif, dressed in a stark, perversely sober palette, with a face devoid of make-up. Clothes by ready-to-wear retailers such as The Gap, Banana Republic, and Eddie Bauer came to the forefront of fashion, managing to tap into the needs of women who simply wanted comfortable, wearable clothes. Retro clothing inspired by the 1960s and 1970s was popular for much of the 1990s. The famous Italian fashion house, Gucci was created in 1921, by Guccio Gucci and was originally a firm that sold luxury leather goods. Under Guccio Gucci's children, by the end of the 1960s the label had expanded to include a plethora of products with a distinctly Latin glamor. However, only in the 1990s, when the Gucci heirs gave up control of the company to Invest Corp., who planned to turn the business around, did it truly begin to enjoy the kind of success it enjoys in the present day. Employing an unknown designer, Tom Ford, as design director in 1994, the fashion house was endowed with a great prestige, as Ford triggered a tidal wave with his chic and shocking collections, perfumes for men and women, revamped boutiques, and advertising campaigns. In 1998 Gucci is named \\"European Company of the year\\" by European Business Press Federation. Today it is the second biggest-selling fashion brand (after LVMH) worldwide with US$7 billion worldwide of revenue in 2006 according to BusinessWeek magazine. In the 1990s the designer label Prada became a true creative force in the fashion industry. The Milanese company was first established in 1923, two years after Gucci, and like Gucci, it was a firm that sold high-quality shoes and leather. It was until the 1980s that Miuccia Prada, the niece of the company's founder, began to produce ready-to-wear fashion, gaining fame for her subtle, streamlined, yet unquestionably luxurious style, that catered for the privileged young woman who prefers understatement to flamboyant extravagance. In America three of the most influential fashion designers of the time were Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs, and Calvin Klein. Michael Kors set up his own business in 1980. However, it was not until the 1990s that the designer reached the peak of his popularity. His knowledge and consciousness of trends enabled him to produce simple well-cut garments, whose sophistication and elegance appealed to a whole new breed of wealthy American customers drawn to the new vogue for minimalist chic. Marc Jacobs is one of the most notable American designers of the period in that, unlike many American fashion designers in the past, he was not so much the co-ordinator of a mass-produced garment as a designer in the European sense of the word. One of the most promising talents in the fashion industry at the time, the LVMH (Louis Vuitton-Moet Henessy) group offered him the job of designing a line of ready-to-wear to complement the de-luxe products of luggage specialist Louis Vuitton in the late 1990s. One of the first fashion designers to anticipate the globalization of world markets, the already well-known designer Calvin Klein started to market his fashions, perfumes, and accessories not only right across the US, but also in Europe and Asia, achieving an unequaled success. A brilliant artistic director, Klein used carefully constructed advertisements containing images tinted with eroticism to promote his sophisticatedly functional mass-produced designs, which won massive popularity among the urban youth of the 1990s. The group of designers known as the 'Antwerp Six' (so named because all of them were graduates of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp), who first emerged in the 1980s, came to prominence in the 1990s. Three of the most influential of the group were Ann Demeulemeester, Dries van Noten, and Walter Van Beirendonck. Ann Demeulemeester, from her first collection in 1991, demonstrated a great deal of confidence and inventiveness. Naturally inclined to understatement, she built her designs on contradictions, introducing contrasting elements into her fluid and streamlined fashions, which appealed to women who dressed, above all, to please themselves. The work of Dries van Noten was founded on a solid mastery of the art of tailoring, to which the young designer added discreet touches of fantasy in a highly personal style. Managing to be both classical and original, his fashions appealed to those who preferred to express their individuality rather than slavishly follow trends. Walter Van Beirendonck, who erupted onto the fashion scene in 1995, produced decidedly futuristic designs under his label W & LT (Wild and Lethal Trash). Deliberately using fabrics developed by the very latest technologies, in violently contrasting colors, he produced clothes that were full of erotic and sadomasochistic references, touched with a caustic adolescent humor. His highly distinctive approach related to a resurgence of anti-fashion, but this time an anti-fashion with nothing in the least ethnic about its origins, instead based on science fiction that provided the inspiration for displays of such high-spirited provocation. In Italy, Gianni Versace, with his brilliant, sexy, and colorful designs, and Dolce & Gabbana, with their superfeminine and fantastical style, broke away from the serious and sober-minded fashions that dominated during much of the 1990s. The British designer Vivienne Westwood produced many influential and popular collections in the early 1990s, which included outfits inspired by 18th-century courtesans and the Marquis de Sade, with rounded hips, corsets, and platform heels. The London-based designer Rifat Ozbek was also popular, particularly in New York and Milan. His youthful style, which mixed references to India, Africa, and his native Turkey with clever takes on historical clothing, was reminiscent of hippest nightclubs and the more outrageous street fashions of the time. Rap music was a prominent influence on popular and street fashion during the early and mid-1990s. Followers of hip hop adopted huge baggy jeans, similar to those worn in American prisons, with big patterned shirts and heavy black shoes. The sports label Nike had great popularity and materials such as Lycra/spandex were increasingly used for sportswear. Increasing eco-awareness and animal rights made even top couture houses such as Chanel introduce fake fur and natural fibers into their collections.

Early life Hashim was born in a lord family in the village of Kashiara in Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal. He graduated from Burdwan Raj College in 1928, which was then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, and earned a law degree in 1931 from the same university. Then he started his law practice at the court of Burdwan. He was the father of Bangladeshi leftist politician and writer Badruddin Umar. Political career He took part in the election to the Bengal Legislative Council in 1936, and participated in the All India Muslim League conference at Allahabad in 1938. He also participated in Muslim League's Lahore conference in 1940. Hashem, a clandestine leftist successfully infiltrated into the Indian Muslim League and, using his family connections, got elected as the general secretary of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League in 1943. In his memoirs, Hashim mentions that at the meeting where he was elected to the post, he was clad in a dhoti. He opposed the creation of Jinnah's vision of East Pakistan, the modern day Bangladesh.The success of the Muslim League soon came through in the 1946 election. He maintained a political proximity with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and was active in Pakistan Movement. =United Bengal movement= But, he participated in the United Bengal movement in 1947, and on 12 May 1947 he together with Sarat Bose met Mahatma Gandhi to discuss the United Bengal scheme and received his blessings. But the day after, on 13 May 1947, the president of the Indian National Congress, J. B. Kripalani, dismissed any notions to \\"save the unity of Bengal\\". In reply to the plea, made by Ashrafuddin Chowdhury, a Muslim nationalist and peasant leader from Tippera, Kripalini wrote: \\"All that the Congress seeks to do today is to rescue as many areas as possible from the threatened domination of the League and Pakistan. It wants to save as much territory for a Free Indian Union as is possible under the circumstances. It therefore insists upon the division of Bengal and Punjab into areas for Hindustan and Pakistan respectively.\\" After the partition of India, Hashim became the parliamentary leader of the opposition in West Bengal Provincial Assembly. In 1950 Hashim decided to move to East Pakistan and settled in Dhaka. Later life and death In 1940, Hashim began to experience problems with his eyesight, and his condition worsened in 1950 when he became completely blind. Despite this problem, he continued his work in politics, and in 1960, he became the Director of the Islamic Academy. Books Abul Hashim wrote several books in English and Bengali.

Mórahalom is famous for its thermal spa. Mórahalom is a developing town located far from Szeged, only from the western exit of the M5 motorway, along the main road 55. The name of the town originates from the sand dune of “Móra Halma”, which was first mentioned in 1729. The exact area of Móra is unknown, however, it is known that its eponym was the family Móra who come from Szeged-Lower Town. Since the founding of the town, it has developed incredibly due to the hard work and strong will of its inhabitants. The local farmers of the Sand Ridge taming the “golden eyed” sand enriched their settlement, which gained town rank in 1989. The whole administrative area of the town is 8,311 ha, its outside urban area is 7.857 ha, its urban area is 454 ha with a population of 6,035. 1,587 of these inhabitants live in outside urban areas (farms). The first industrial park of the Southern Great Plain was established here, the first qualified producing and selling union was organised here, more and more industrial workplaces are being created through small- and medium enterprise development programmes, the service sector is developing at a small regional level, and based on medical tourism a spa town has been established on the Sand Ridge region within an arm’s length from Szeged. Who visits Mórahalom can admire several interesting sights, not only in the local region but in the neighbouring regions as well. The “Aranyszöm” Programme Centre is situated in the heart of Mórahalom, including a theatre hall with seats for 300 visitors, a ceremonial hall for 80 visitors and ball room for 150 visitors. Next to the summer entrance of the Saint Elizabeth Spa, the recently opened Doll Collection can be found. On the Road of Zákányszék, the guests have the opportunity to visit the Strudel House including a workshop for strudel-making, as well as an open-air exhibition and visitor area behind the building complex, where the guests can enjoy the evening with musical performances in the summer. In the outskirts of Mórahalom, the recently renewed Wine House is situated where visitors can take part in wine-tastings, have a look at exhibition halls and galleries and enjoy their time in the covered terrace and the play ground. Some kilometres away from Mórahalom visitors can admire the Lake Nagyszéksós, where they can have a look at the bull herd, or even they can have a boat ride, and those ones who would prefer hiking can visit the Green Community House and Forest School, where they can choose from many routes and possibilities. Visitors can also have a look at the Bird Garden in Zákányszék located far from Mórahalom, where hundreds of specimens of approximately 80 species can be seen in a lovely park. The lovers of equestrian sports can visit the “Futó-Dobó” Horse Centre, where they have the opportunity to try pony riding and lunge line riding, class riding and cross-country riding at beginner and advanced level. Those who prefer museums can visit the Sand Ridge Memorial House next to the Strudel House, where the guests can admire the memorial room displaying the works of Klebersberg Kunó and the collection of objects collected by the inhabitants of Mórahalom. It is worth visiting the Old House Farm Museum or the Paprika Park in Röszke, where the origins of spice pepper, its traditional and modern uses and values are shown. The town has been said to have been at one point an epicenter of the European migrant crisis prior to further restrictions being put in place on migrants passing through.

Ms. Fair was the daughter of the wealthy mining magnate James Graham Fair. In 1899, she married William Kissam Vanderbilt II of the prominent Vanderbilt family of New York City who in 1920 inherited the Haras du Quesnay Thoroughbred breeding farm and racing stable near Deauville in France's famous horse region of Lower Normandy. Interested in horse racing, but separated from her husband, Virginia Graham Fair established her own racing stable. Fair Stable employed future Hall of Fame trainer Max Hirsch until 1928 when Alex Gordon took over. They won a number of important Graded stakes races including the 1923, 1927, and 1931 Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park. The stable had only one horse run in the Kentucky Derby with Chicatie finishing 14th in the 1929 edition. By far the most famous horse owed by Fair Stable was Sarazen, a gelding acquired in 1923 who would earn back-to-back U.S. Horse of the Year honors in 1924 and 1925 and who was posthumously inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Her full title was Amnirense qore li kdwe li (\\"Ameniras, qore and kandake\\"). Amanirenas is one of the most famous kandakes, because of her role leading Kushite armies against the Romans in a war that lasted five years, from 27 BC to 22 BC. After an initial victory when the Kushites attacked Roman Egypt, they were driven out of Egypt by Gaius Petronius and the Romans established a new frontier at Hiere Sycaminos (Maharraqa). Amanirenas was described as brave, and blind in one eye. Meroitic inscriptions give Amanirenas the title of qore as well as kandake suggesting that she was a ruling queen. She is usually considered to be the queen referred to as \\"Candace\\" in Strabo's account of the Meroitic war against the Roman Empire. Her name is associated with those of Teriteqas and Akinidad, but the precise relationship between these three is not clear in the historical record. Roman conflict =First battles= When Aelius Gallus, the Prefect, or chief magistrate, of Egypt, was absent on a campaign in Arabia in 24 BC, the Kushites launched an attack on Lower Nubia. Amanirenas and Akinidad defeated Roman forces at Syene and Philae. Neil MacGregor refers to Strabo's account of a \\"fierce one-eyed queen Candace\\" capturing a series of Roman forts in southern 25 BC Egypt. Her army returned with a bronze depiction of Augustus' head, taken from a statue of the Roman emperor. She then \\"buried the severed head of the glorious Augustus beneath the steps of a temple dedicated to victory.\\" The head, found in Meroë in 1912, now resides in the British Museum after a British archaeological team excavated it. =Petronius' Nubian campaign= The Kushites were driven out of Syene later in the year by Gaius Petronius, who now held the office of Roman Prefect in Egypt. According to a detailed report made by Strabo (17: 53–54), the Roman troops advanced far into Kush, and finally reached Napata. Although they withdrew again to the north they left behind a garrison in Qasr Ibrim (Primis), which now became the border of the Roman Empire. The Kushites made a renewed attempt to seize Primis, but Petronius forestalled this attempt. Following this event, negotiations began. The Meroites sent mediators to Augustus, who was then in Samos, and in the year 21/20 BC a peace treaty was concluded. It was strikingly favorable to the Meroites in that the southern part of the Thirty- Mile Strip, including Primis, was evacuated by the Romans, and the Meroites were exempted from having to pay tribute to the Emperor. On the other hand, the Romans continued to occupy the Dodekashoinos (\\"Twelve-Mile Lands\\") as a military border zone, so the frontier now lay near Hiere Sycaminos (Maharraqa). This arrangement continued until the end of the third century AD, with relations between Meroe and Roman Egypt remaining generally peaceful during this time (F. Hintze 1978:100). However, the kingdom of Kush had begun to fade as a power by the first or second century AD.

It covers an area of between the southeastern part of the Tisza River and Maros River and in 2009 had a population of 2,084. The village was first mentioned in records dating from 1214. Only one document survives mentioning the mediaeval town of Leléről, believed to have been named by Deac Lazăr around 1521. The village was put on a formal footing in 1872 after the etymology seems to be a romanian village as such name is not present in Hungarian language. The Roman Catholic Church, built in 1902, lies in the village square. It was donated by Bishop Sándor Dessewffy (b. 1931). The villagers drilled a well to supply water, and the main square is named the Heroes' Well. Today, it is just an artifact; the water has all been used up.  Infrastructure  Maroslele has all the features of a modern Western European community. It is connected to the water, gas, electricity and telephone networks and has broadband internet. The Hungarian government's plans focus mainly on education and entrepreneurship, innovation, culture, sports and recreation, and target the current regeneration of the town. The local library holds around ten thousand books and has space for exhibitions and conferences, as well as providing resources for historical research. It also provides computers for internet access. Geography Maroslele lies between the Körös River and the Maros River (). The estuary of the Maros lies very close to village. Before the river was controlled, the area was very swampy and reedy. The floodplain of the Körös- Maros National Park conservation area is nearby. The subsoil of the village is of clay, which can make for hard living: it is prone to flood in rainy seasons, and can become very muddy. Transport The village is accessible from Makó from the west, about from Szeged. By ferry it is about and from Hódmezővásárhely it is about . In 2011, the Hungarian motorway M43 (under completion) made a connexion to the village. Public transport is provided by Tisza Volán. History The first known record of the village is in 1274 as \\"Lele\\". The origin of \\"Maroslele\\" is not clear; the first part obviously comes from the Maros River but the second part of the name (\\"Lele\\") possibly comes from the Hungarian word for soul (). In 1596, the Ottoman Empire razed the village. After the Ottoman reign, the town of Makó used the land for grazing until the end of the 18th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, peasant farmers moved to the village and started to grow tobacco. Not much later the village became part of the Diocese of Csanád County. In 1873 Maroslele becomes an official settlement. From the beginning of the 20th century the residents started to buy out the lands from the bishop. The bishop helped to build a church and a school and the residents changed the name of the village to (\\"Bishopsoul\\") as an honour. They raised a stone cross in front of the church in remembrance of him. During the World Wars many people lost their lives in the village. The Russians took occupation at the end of the Second World War, and they changed its name to Maroslele, in 1950.

Barcode systems are used to automate data collection where hand recording is neither timely or cost effective. Barcoding systems are not radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems even though the companies that provide barcode equipment will often also provide RFID equipment and many companies use both technologies as part of larger resource management systems. UPC invented by George J. Laurer (example is EAN13 format) History In 1948, Bernard Silver was a graduate student at Drexel Institute of Technology in Philadelphia. A local food chain store owner had made an inquiry to the Drexel Institute asking about research into a method of automatically reading product information during checkout. Silver joined together with fellow graduate student Norman Joseph Woodland to work on a solution. Woodland's first idea was to use ultraviolet light sensitive ink. The team built a working prototype but decided that the system was too unstable and expensive. They went back to the drawing board. On October 20, 1949, Woodland and Silver filed their patent application for the \\"Classifying Apparatus and Method\\", describing their invention as \\"article classification… through the medium of identifying patterns\\". The first commercially successful barcode reading system was patented in November 1969 by John F. Keidel for the General Atronics Corp. It was soon realized that there would have to be some sort of industry standard set. In 1970, the Universal Grocery Products Identification Code or UGPIC was written by a company called Logicon Inc. The first company to produce bar code equipment for retail trade use (using UGPIC) was the American company Monarch Marking in 1970, and for industrial use, the British company Plessey Telecommunications was also first in 1970. UGPIC evolved into the U.P.C. symbol set or Universal Product Code, which is still used in the United States. George J. Laurer is considered the inventor of U.P.C. or Uniform Product Code, which was invented in 1973. In June 1974, the first U.P.C. scanner was installed at a Marsh's supermarket in Troy, Ohio. The first product to have a barcode included was a packet of Wrigley's Gum. Hardware There is a wide range of hardware that is manufactured today for use in Barcode Systems. The best known brand of handheld scanners and mobile computers is Symbol, which is now a division of Motorola. Other manufacturers include Intermec, HHP (Hand Held Products), Microscan Systems, Unitech, Metrologic, PSC and PANMOBIL. Software While there is a range of hardware on the market, software is more difficult to find from the hardware manufacturers. Some ERP, MRP, and other inventory management software have built in support for barcode reading and some even allow the software to run directly on a mobile computer. Besides full management software, there are more than a few software development kits on the market that allow the developer to easily produce custom mobile interfaces and that handle the connect to the database. One such software is RFgen another is PeopleVox. Then there is always the option of developing a custom software solution, using a language such as C++, C#, Java, Visual Basic.NET, and many others. Often developing a custom interface using software such as RFgen or developing new, personalized software is the most effective method since it allows the individual to have a solution that is fitted to their exact needs. Typical system A typical barcode system consist of some infrastructure, either wired or wireless that connects some number of mobile computers, handheld scanners, and printers to one or many databases that store and analyze the data collected by the system. At some level there must be some software to manage the system. The software may be as simple as code that manages the connection between the hardware and the database or as complex as an ERP, MRP, or some other inventory management software.

Independents elected from this ticket consist of: * Nick Xenophon, barrister and anti-gambling campaigner, elected in 1997 on 2.9 percent with preferences and again in 2006 on 20.5 percent * Ann Bressington, anti-drugs campaigner, elected in 2006 as Xenophon's first of two running mates * John Darley, former valuer-general, third running mate in 2006 was appointed on 21 November 2007 to replace outgoing MP Nick Xenophon, re-elected in 2014 Xenophon's vote at the election came approximately equally from Labor and Liberal party voters. Federal politics Xenophon resigned from the South Australian Legislative Council in early October 2007 to stand for the Australian Senate as an independent at the 2007 federal election in which he was successful, on a primary vote of 14.78 percent. ABC election analyst Antony Green had stated prior to the election that Xenophon would win a seat, while Centrebet speculated his odds would start on a favourable $1.50 for and $2.70 against. Nick Minchin \\"urged people not to vote for Mr Xenophon\\", with the Liberal Party's 2006 upper house vote only 5.5 percent higher, and polled lower than Xenophon in some booths. Xenophon's federal platform consists of anti- gambling, pro-consumer protection, attention to the water crisis, ratifying Kyoto, opposition against what he calls a decrease in state rights, and opposition to WorkChoices. Xenophon shared the balance of power with the Greens and Family First during the 2008–11 Senate parliamentary session, with the Greens holding the sole balance of power since July 2011. Xenophon has been reported in the media as \\"left-of-centre\\", whilst Hansard reveals that Xenophon and the Greens have found common ground on a number of issues.

Background In January 1979, a group of fifteen workers from the shipyards in the Danube port of Drobeta-Turnu Severin approached Ionel Cană, a physician who had worked in Olt County amongst workers and had recently moved to Bucharest; Cană, who had already helped workers draw up petitions complaining about labour conditions, agreed to the men's proposal to set up a union.Deletant, Ceausescu..., p.100, Occidentul...; Frunză, p.526; Popescu Creation The founding declaration, signed by 20 persons,ILO reports was broadcast by Noël Bernard over Radio Free Europe on March 4, 1979.Deletant, Occidentul. ..; Popescu; Sturmthal, et al., p.80 The names of the 20 founder members of SLOMR, with their occupations and addresses, were appended to the text. The document stated that the organisation, legally established under Romanian law, was affiliated to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.Sturmthal, et al., p.80 Pointing at the declining work and living conditions and at the difficulties workers had in expressing themselves freely and defend their interests, the declaration indicated that the new labour organization was not backed by any political force, and that its objects were to ensure justice in the social and labour areas.Frunză, p.526 The intention of the new trade union was to enter the struggle against unemployment, for better working conditions, for safety and health in the factories, for the revision of the wage system and the pension system, for the reduction of the weekly work period and the suppression of unpaid overtime, etc. The new union, insisting on the legality of the steps it had taken, requested a frank dialogue with the authorities for the settlement of these claims.Frunză, p.526; ILO reports; Popescu Soon, about 2,400 of workers from various localities such as Bucharest, Ploieşti, Constanţa, Târgu Mureş and Timișoara joined the new union,Deletant, Ceausescu. .., p.100, Occidentul. ..; Sturmthal, et al., p.80 which also added to its programme more general claims such as freedom for all workers, including peasants, to change their place of work, the right to a decent wage for peasants and the right to freely sell their products and the suppression of terror and internment in psychiatric hospitals of those who demanded that their rights be respected. The dissident Romanian Orthodox Church priest Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa offered to be a spiritual adviser.Deletant, Ceausescu. .., p.100; Sturmthal, et al., p.80 The new trade union was also supported by the writer and dissident Paul Goma. An additional manifesto calling for the legalization of unofficial trade unions and observance of the right to free association was also released. Repression The SLOMR's establishment and the issue of its constituent statement were almost immediately followed by a wave of repression against the body and its members -- it included massive arrests, involuntary commitment in psychiatric hospitals, exile, systematic harassment, beatings, as well as a summary trial and prison sentence passed on the SLOMR founder and other leading members.Ilieșu; ILO reports; Sturmthal, et al., p.80 Thus, the 20 founders have been arrested and sentenced to prison, Ion Cană being condemned to a 7 years term for \\"disseminating fascist propaganda\\".ILO reports; Popescu; Sturmthal, et al., p.80 Another trade union leader, Gheorghe Brașoveanu, was confined to a psychiatric institution while the prominent opponent Vasile Paraschiv underwent harsh psychiatric treatment.ILO reports; Sturmthal, et al., p.80 In April the SLOMR, in an open letter to Ceaușescu, protested against the arrest of its members, among them Cană and Brașoveanu (the two were eventually released in 1980).Deletant, Ceausescu..., p.100; ILO reports Cană's successor as chairman, Nicolae Dascălu, was sentenced in June to 18 months in prison for allegedly passing state secrets to Amnesty International.Deletant, Ceausescu..., p.100 In Timișoara Carl Gibson, Erwin Ludwig, Prof. Dr. Fenelon Sacerdoțeanu and other 20 persons formed -- after personal talks with Dascălu and other dissidents from Bucharest -- the regional SLOMR of Timișoara. Gibson and Ludwig were arrested on April 4, accused of having created an \\"anarchistic organisation\\" and sentenced to six months in prison. A further 153 leaders of the union, among them Virgil Chender from Sighişoara, were arrested on charges of \\"parasitism\\" and \\"hooliganism\\", and placed under house arrest, interned in psychiatric hospitals, deported, imprisoned or expelled from the country after serving their sentences. Father Calciu-Dumitreasa was sentenced to ten years in prison. A number of trade unionists were also obliged to sign statements disclaiming the existence of the SLOMR. At the same time, the authorities launched a campaign of slander and harsh threats designed to destroy the union. After he arrived in Germany, Gibson became the speaker of the SLOMR in the West. Together with a group of Romanian dissidents from France and Switzerland, he informed the World Confederation of Labour in Brussels and the United Nations' International Labour Organization about the free trade union movement in Romania and about the human rights violations. The support group was able to convince both organisations to post a complaint against the regime in Bucharest.Frank; ILO reports After the initial arrest of the leaders of the union, others took over the task of organising the union but a month later they were arrested as well and the remainder were subjected to permanent harassment. In a last and successful attempt to dismantle the entire organization, in June several hundred union members were arrested throughout the country at the same time. The communist Romanian regime alleged not to have any knowledge of the new union.

Early life and education Hertzka was born in Budapest. He studied chemistry and music at the University of Vienna. Publishing career In 1901 he joined the Vienna-based music publishing house Universal Edition, which had only just been founded. In 1907 he became its Director and remained in that position until his death. It was due to Hertzka's efforts that UE came increasingly to concentrate upon the publication of new music, and his voluminous correspondence with many of Europe's leading composers is a valuable resource for modern scholars. By the time of his death in Vienna in 1932, UE's catalogue comprised almost 10.000 items, including works by Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schönberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Alexander Zemlinsky, Franz Schreker, Alfredo Casella, Leoš Janáček, Karol Szymanowski, Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler, Ernst Krenek, Darius Milhaud, and Gian Francesco Malipiero. Between 1932 and 1938, the Emil Hertzka Foundation offered an annual Composition Prize. This was first awarded in 1933, when it was shared between five composers, namely Roberto Gerhard, Norbert von Hannenheim, Julius Schloss, Ludwing Zenk and Leopold Spinner. The prize went to Joseph Matthias Hauer in 1934; to Viktor Ullmann in 1936, to Hans Erich Apostel in 1937 and to Karl Amadeus Hartmann in 1938.

It is a generalization to random vectors of the Student's t-distribution, which is a distribution applicable to univariate random variables. While the case of a random matrix could be treated within this structure, the matrix t-distribution is distinct and makes particular use of the matrix structure. Definition One common method of construction of a multivariate t-distribution, for the case of p dimensions, is based on the observation that if \\\\mathbf y and u are independent and distributed as {\\\\mathcal N}({\\\\mathbf 0},{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma}) and \\\\chi^2_ u (i.e. multivariate normal and chi- squared distributions) respectively, the matrix \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}\\\\, is a p × p matrix, and {\\\\mathbf y}/\\\\sqrt{u/ u}={\\\\mathbf x}-{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\mu}, then {\\\\mathbf x} has the density : \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\left[( u+p)/2\\\\right]}{\\\\Gamma( u/2) u^{p/2}\\\\pi^{p/2}\\\\left{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma}\\\\right^{1/2}}\\\\left[1+\\\\frac{1}{ u}({\\\\mathbf x}-{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\mu})^T{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma}^{-1}({\\\\mathbf x}-{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\mu})\\\\right]^{-( u+p)/2} and is said to be distributed as a multivariate t-distribution with parameters {\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma},{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\mu}, u. Note that \\\\mathbf\\\\Sigma is not the covariance matrix since the covariance is given by u/( u-2)\\\\mathbf\\\\Sigma (for u>2). In the special case u=1, the distribution is a multivariate Cauchy distribution. Derivation There are in fact many candidates for the multivariate generalization of Student's t-distribution. An extensive survey of the field has been given by Kotz and Nadarajah (2004). The essential issue is to define a probability density function of several variables that is the appropriate generalization of the formula for the univariate case. In one dimension (p=1), with t=x-\\\\mu and \\\\Sigma=1, we have the probability density function :f(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma[( u+1)/2]}{\\\\sqrt{ u\\\\pi\\\\,}\\\\,\\\\Gamma[ u/2]} (1+t^2/ u)^{-( u+1)/2} and one approach is to write down a corresponding function of several variables. This is the basic idea of elliptical distribution theory, where one writes down a corresponding function of p variables t_i that replaces t^2 by a quadratic function of all the t_i. It is clear that this only makes sense when all the marginal distributions have the same degrees of freedom u. With \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma^{-1}, one has a simple choice of multivariate density function :f(\\\\mathbf t) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(( u+p)/2)\\\\left\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right^{1/2}}{\\\\sqrt{ u^p\\\\pi^p\\\\,}\\\\,\\\\Gamma( u/2)} \\\\left(1+\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^{p,p} A_{ij} t_i t_j/ u\\\\right)^{-( u+p)/2} which is the standard but not the only choice. An important special case is the standard bivariate t-distribution, p = 2: :f(t_1,t_2) = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right^{1/2}}{2\\\\pi} \\\\left(1+\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^{2,2} A_{ij} t_i t_j/ u\\\\right)^{-( u+2)/2} Note that \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{ u +2}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\pi \\\\ u \\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{ u }{2}\\\\right)}= \\\\frac {1} {2\\\\pi}. Now, if \\\\mathbf{A} is the identity matrix, the density is :f(t_1,t_2) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\left(1+(t_1^2 + t_2^2)/ u\\\\right)^{-( u+2)/2}. The difficulty with the standard representation is revealed by this formula, which does not factorize into the product of the marginal one-dimensional distributions. When \\\\Sigma is diagonal the standard representation can be shown to have zero correlation but the marginal distributions do not agree with statistical independence. = Cumulative distribution function = The definition of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) in one dimension can be extended to multiple dimensions by defining the following probability (here \\\\mathbf{x} is a real vector): : F(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\leq \\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\quad \\\\textrm{where}\\\\;\\\\; \\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim t_ u(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\mu,\\\\boldsymbol\\\\Sigma). There is no simple formula for F(\\\\mathbf{x}), but it can be approximated numerically via Monte Carlo integration. Copulas based on the multivariate t The use of such distributions is enjoying renewed interest due to applications in mathematical finance, especially through the use of the Student's t copula. Related concepts In univariate statistics, the Student's t-test makes use of Student's t-distribution. Hotelling's T-squared distribution is a distribution that arises in multivariate statistics. The matrix t-distribution is a distribution for random variables arranged in a matrix structure.

It focuses mainly on the explanation of the physics of traffic breakdown and resulting congested traffic on highways. Kerner describes three phases of traffic, while the classical theories based on the fundamental diagram of traffic flow have two phases: free flow and congested traffic. Kerner’s theory divides congested traffic into two distinct phases, synchronized flow and wide moving jam, bringing the total number of phases to three: Synchronized flow Jam # Free flow (F) # Synchronized flow (S) # Wide moving jam (J) The word \\"wide\\" is used even though it is the length of the traffic jam that is being referred to. A phase is defined as a state in space and time.  Free flow (F)  In free traffic flow, empirical data show a positive correlation between the flow rate q (in vehicles per unit time) and vehicle density k (in vehicles per unit distance). This relationship stops at the maximum free flow q_{\\\\max} with a corresponding critical density k_\\\\text{crit}. (See Figure 1.) Figure 1: Measured flow rate versus vehicle density in free flow (fictitious data)  Congested traffic  Data show a weaker relationship between flow and density in congested conditions. Therefore, Kerner argues that the fundamental diagram, as used in classical traffic theory, cannot adequately describe the complex dynamics of vehicular traffic. He instead divides congestion into synchronized flow and wide moving jams. In congested traffic, the vehicle speed is lower than the lowest vehicle speed v^{\\\\min}_\\\\text{free} encountered in free flow, i.e., the line with the slope of the minimal speed v^\\\\min_\\\\text{free} = \\\\frac{q_\\\\max}{k_\\\\text{crit}} in free flow (dotted line in Figure 2) divides the empirical data on the flow- density plane into two regions: on the left side data points of free flow and on the right side data points corresponding to congested traffic. Figure 2: Flow rate versus vehicle density in free flow and congested traffic (fictitious data)  Definitions [J] and [S] of the phases J and S in congested traffic  In Kerner's theory, the phases J and S in congested traffic are observed outcomes in universal spatial-temporal features of real traffic data. The phases J and S are defined through the definitions [J] and [S] as follows: Figure 3: Measured data of speed in time and space (a) and its representation on the time-space plane (b) = The \\"wide moving jam\\" phase [J] = A so-called \\"wide moving jam\\" moves upstream through any highway bottlenecks. While doing so, the mean velocity of the downstream front v_g is maintained. This is the characteristic feature of the wide moving jam that defines the phase J. The term wide moving jam is meant to reflect the characteristic feature of the jam to propagate through any other state of traffic flow and through any bottleneck while maintaining the velocity of the downstream jam front. The phrase moving jam reflects the jam propagation as a whole localized structure on a road. To distinguish wide moving jams from other moving jams, which do not characteristically maintain the mean velocity of the downstream jam front, Kerner used the term wide. The term wide reflects the fact that if a moving jam has a width (in the longitudinal road direction) considerably greater than the widths of the jam fronts, and if the vehicle speed inside the jam is zero, the jam always exhibits the characteristic feature of maintaining the velocity of the downstream jam front (see Sec. 7.6.5 of the bookB.S. Kerner, The Physics of Traffic, Springer, Berlin, New York 2004). Thus the term wide has nothing to do with the width across the jam, but actually refers to its length being considerably more than the transition zones at its head and tail. Historically, Kerner used the term wide from a qualitative analogy of a wide moving jam in traffic flow with wide autosolitons occurring in many systems of natural science (like gas plasma, electron-hole plasma in semiconductors, biological systems, and chemical reactions): Both the wide moving jam and a wide autosoliton exhibit some characteristic features, which do not depend on initial conditions at which these localized patterns have occurred. = The \\"synchronized flow\\" phase [S] = In \\"synchronized flow\\", the downstream front, where the vehicles accelerate to free flow, does not show this characteristic feature of the wide moving jam. Specifically, the downstream front of synchronized flow is often fixed at a bottleneck. The term \\"synchronized flow\\" is meant to reflect the following features of this traffic phase: (i) It is a continuous traffic flow with no significant stoppage, as often occurs inside a wide moving jam. The term \\"flow\\" reflects this feature. (ii) There is a tendency towards synchronization of vehicle speeds across different lanes on a multilane road in this flow. In addition, there is a tendency towards synchronization of vehicle speeds in each of the road lanes (bunching of vehicles) in synchronized flow. This is due to a relatively low probability of passing. The term \\"synchronized\\" reflects this speed synchronization effect. = Explanation of the traffic phase definitions based on measured traffic data = Measured data of averaged vehicle speeds (Figure 3 (a)) illustrate the phase definitions [J] and [S]. There are two spatial-temporal patterns of congested traffic with low vehicle speeds in Figure 3 (a). One pattern propagates upstream with almost constant velocity of the downstream front, moving straight through the freeway bottleneck. According to the definition [J], this pattern of congestion belongs to the \\"wide moving jam\\" phase. In contrast, the downstream front of the other pattern is fixed at a bottleneck. According to the definition [S], this pattern belongs to the \\"synchronized flow\\" phase (Figure 3 (a) and (b)). Other empirical examples of the validation of the traffic phase definitions [J] and [S] can be found in the books and,B.S.

Schäfer et al, \\"A study of TomTom’s probe vehicle data with three-phase traffic theory\\". Traffic Engineering and Control, Vol 52, No 5, Pages 225–231, 2011 (floating car data is also called probe vehicle data). = Traffic phase definition based on empirical single- vehicle data = In Sec. 6.1 of the book has been shown that the traffic phase definitions [S] and [J] are the origin of most hypotheses of three-phase theory and related three-phase microscopic traffic flow models. The traffic phase definitions [J] and [S] are non-local macroscopic ones and they are applicable only after macroscopic data has been measured in space and time, i.e., in an \\"off-line\\" study. This is because for the definitive distinction of the phases J and S through the definitions [J] and [S] a study of the propagation of traffic congestion through a bottleneck is necessary. This is often considered as a drawback of the traffic phase definitions [S] and [J]. However, there are local microscopic criteria for the distinction between the phases J and S without a study of the propagation of congested traffic through a bottleneck. The microscopic criteria are as follows (see Sec. 2.6 in the book): If in single-vehicle (microscopic) data related to congested traffic the \\"flow-interruption interval\\", i.e., a time headway between two vehicles following each other is observed, which is much longer than the mean time delay in vehicle acceleration from a wide moving jam (the latter is about 1.3–2.1 s), then the related flow-interruption interval corresponds to the wide moving jam phase. After all wide moving jams have been found through this criterion in congested traffic, all remaining congested states are related to the synchronized flow phase.  Kerner’s hypothesis about two-dimensional (2D) states of traffic flow  = Steady states of synchronized flow = Homogeneous synchronized flow is a hypothetical state of synchronized flow of identical vehicles and drivers in which all vehicles move with the same time- independent speed and have the same space gaps (a space gap is the distance between one vehicle and the one behind it), i.e., this synchronized flow is homogeneous in time and space. Kerner’s hypothesis is that homogeneous synchronized flow can occur anywhere in a two-dimensional region (2D) of the flow-density plane (2D-region S in Figure 4(a)). The set of possible free flow states (F) overlaps in vehicle density the set of possible states of homogeneous synchronized flow. The free flow states on a multi-lane road and states of homogeneous synchronized flow are separated by a gap in the flow rate and, therefore, by a gap in the speed at a given density: at each given density the synchronized flow speed is lower than the free flow speed. In accordance with this hypothesis of Kerner’s three-phase theory, at a given speed in synchronized flow, the driver can make an arbitrary choice as to the space gap to the preceding vehicle, within the range associated with the 2D region of homogeneous synchronized flow (Figure 4(b)): the driver accepts different space gaps at different times and does not use some one unique gap. Figure 4: Hypothesis of Kerner’ three-phase traffic theory about 2D region of steady states of synchronized flow in the flow—density plane: (a) Qualitative representation of free flow states (F) and 2D region of homogeneous synchronized flow (dashed region S) on a multi-lane road in the flow-density plane. (b) A part of the 2D-region of homogeneous synchronized flow shown in (a) in the space gap-speed plane (dashed region S). In (b), G and g_\\\\text{safe}, are respectively a synchronization space gap and safe space gap between two vehicles following each other. The hypothesis of Kerner’s three- phase traffic theory about 2D region of steady states of synchronized flow is contrary to the hypothesis of earlier traffic flow theories involving the fundamental diagram of traffic flow, which suppose a one-dimensional relationship between vehicle density and flow rate.  Car following in three- phase traffic theory  In Kerner’s three-phase theory, a vehicle accelerates when the space gap g to the preceding vehicle is greater than a synchronization space gap G, i.e., at g>G (labelled by acceleration in Figure 5); the vehicle decelerates when the gap g is smaller than a safe space gap g_\\\\text{safe}, i.e., at g (labelled by deceleration in Figure 5). Figure 5: Qualitative explanation of car-following in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory: A vehicle accelerates at a space gap g>G and decelerates at space gaps g, whereas under condition g_\\\\text{safe} \\\\leq g \\\\leq G the vehicle adapts its speed to the speed of the preceding vehicle without caring what the precise space gap is. The dashed region of synchronized flow is taken from Figure 4(b). If the gap is less than G, the driver tends to adapt his speed to the speed of the preceding vehicle without caring what the precise gap is, so long as this gap is not smaller than the safe space gap g_\\\\text{safe} (labelled by speed adaptation in Figure 5). Thus the space gap g in car following in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase theory can be any space gap within the space gap range g_\\\\text{safe} \\\\leq g \\\\leq G . = Autonomous driving in framework of three-phase traffic theory = In the framework of the three-phase theory the hypothesis about 2D regions of states of synchronized flow has also been applied for the development of a model of autonomous driving vehicle (called also automated driving, self-driving or autonomous vehicle).  Traffic breakdown – a F → S phase transition  In measured data, congested traffic most often occurs in the vicinity of highway bottlenecks, e.g., on-ramps, off-ramps, or roadwork. A transition from free flow to congested traffic is known as traffic breakdown. In Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory traffic breakdown is explained by a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (called as F →S phase transition). This explanation is supported by available measurements, because in measured traffic data after a traffic breakdown at a bottleneck the downstream front of the congested traffic is fixed at the bottleneck. Therefore, the resulting congested traffic after a traffic breakdown satisfies the definition [S] of the \\"synchronized flow\\" phase. = Empirical spontaneous and induced F → S transitions = Kerner notes using empirical data that synchronized flow can form in free flow spontaneously (spontaneous F →S phase transition) or can be externally induced (induced F → S phase transition). A spontaneous F →S phase transition means that the breakdown occurs when there has previously been free flow at the bottleneck as well as both up- and downstream of the bottleneck. This implies that a spontaneous F → S phase transition occurs through the growth of an internal disturbance in free flow in a neighbourhood of a bottleneck. In contrast, an induced F → S phase transition occurs through a region of congested traffic that initially emerged at a different road location downstream from the bottleneck location. Normally, this is in connection with the upstream propagation of a synchronized flow region or a wide moving jam. An empirical example of an induced breakdown at a bottleneck leading to synchronized flow can be seen in Figure 3: synchronized flow emerges through the upstream propagation of a wide moving jam. The existence of empirical induced traffic breakdown (i.e., empirical induced F →S phase transition) means that a F → S phase transition occurs in a metastable state of free flow at a highway bottleneck. The term metastable free flow means that when small perturbations occur in free flow, the state of free flow is still stable, i.e., free flow persists at the bottleneck. However, when larger perturbations occur in free flow in a neighborhood of the bottleneck, the free flow is unstable and synchronized flow will emerge at the bottleneck. = Physical explanation of traffic breakdown in three-phase theory = Figure 6: Explanation of traffic breakdown by a Z-like non-linear interrupted function of the probability of overtaking in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory. The dotted curve illustrates the critical probability of overtaking as function of traffic density. Kerner explains the nature of the F → S phase transitions by a competition of \\"speed adaptation\\" and \\"over-acceleration\\". Speed adaptation is defined as the vehicle deceleration to the speed of a slower moving preceding vehicle. Over-acceleration is defined as the vehicle acceleration occurring even if the preceding vehicle does not drive faster than the vehicle and the preceding vehicle additionally does not accelerate. In Kerner’s theory, the probability of over-acceleration is a discontinuous function of the vehicle speed: At the same vehicle density, probability of over- acceleration in free flow is greater than in synchronized flow. When within a local speed disturbance speed adaptation is stronger than over-acceleration, an F → S phase transition occurs. Otherwise, when over-acceleration is stronger than speed adaptation the initial disturbance decays over time. Within a region of synchronized flow, a strong over-acceleration is responsible for a return transition from synchronized flow to free flow (S → F transition). There can be several mechanisms of vehicle over-acceleration. It can be assumed that on a multi-lane road the most probable mechanism of over- acceleration is lane changing to a faster lane. In this case, the F → S phase transitions are explained by an interplay of acceleration while overtaking a slower vehicle (over-acceleration) and deceleration to the speed of a slower- moving vehicle ahead (speed adaptation). Overtaking supports the maintenance of free flow. \\"Speed adaptation\\" on the other hand leads to synchronized flow. Speed adaptation will occur if overtaking is not possible. Kerner states that the probability of overtaking is an interrupted function of the vehicle density (Figure 6): at a given vehicle density, the probability of overtaking in free flow is much higher than in synchronized flow. = Discussion of Kerner’s explanation of traffic breakdown = Kerner’s explanation of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck by the F → S phase transition in a metastable free flow is associated with the following fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at the bottleneck found in real measured data: (i) Spontaneous traffic breakdown in an initial free flow at the bottleneck leads to the emergence of congested traffic whose downstream front is fixed at the bottleneck (at least during some time interval), i.e., this congested traffic satisfies the definition [S] for the synchronized flow phase. In other words, spontaneous traffic breakdown is always an F → S phase transition. (ii) Probability of this spontaneous traffic breakdown is an increasing function of the flow rates at the bottleneck. (iii) At the same bottleneck, traffic breakdown can be either spontaneous or induced (see empirical examples for these fundamental features of traffic breakdown in Secs. 2.2.3 and 3.1 of the book); for this reason, the F → S phase transition occurs in a metastable free flow at a highway bottleneck. As explained above, the sense of the term metastable free flow is as follows. Small enough disturbances in metastable free flow decay. However, when a large enough disturbance occurs at the bottleneck, an F → S phase transition does occur. Such a disturbance that initiates the F → S phase transition in metastable free flow at the bottleneck can be called a nucleus for traffic breakdown. In other words, real traffic breakdown (F → S phase transition) at a highway bottleneck exhibits the nucleation nature. Kerner considers the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S phase transition) at a road bottleneck as the empirical fundamental of traffic and transportation science. = The reason for Kerner’s theory and his criticism of classical traffic flow theories = The empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks cannot be explained by classical traffic theories and models. The search for explanation of the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S phase transition) at a highway bottleneck has been the reason for the development of Kerner’s three-phase theory. In particular, in two-phase traffic flow models in which traffic breakdown is associated with free flow instability, this model instability leads to the F → J phase transition, i.e. in these traffic flow models traffic breakdown is governed by spontaneous emergence of a wide moving jam(s) in an initial free flow (see Kerner’s criticism on such two- phase models as well as on other classical traffic flow models and theories in Chapter 10 of the book as well as in critical reviews,). = The main prediction of Kerner’s three-phase theory = Kerner developed the three-phase theory as an explanation of the empirical nature of traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks: a random (probabilistic) F → S phase transition that occurs in metastable state of free flow. Herewith Kerner explained the main prediction, that this metastability of free flow with respect to the F → S phase transition is governed by the nucleation nature of an instability of synchronized flow. The explanation is a large enough local increase in speed in synchronized flow (called a S → F instability), that is a growing speed wave of a local increase in speed in synchronized flow at the bottleneck. The development of the S → F instability leads to a local phase transition from synchronized flow to free flow at the bottleneck (S → F transition). To explain this phenomenon Kerner developed a microscopic theory of the S → F instability. None of the classical traffic flow theories and models incorporate the S → F instability of the three-phase theory. The basic result of the three-phase theory about the nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S transition) shows that the three-phase theory is incommensurable with all earlier traffic flow theories and models (see explanations below). As mentioned, the main reason of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory is the explanation of the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S transition) at the bottleneck. To reach this goal, in congested traffic a new traffic phase called synchronized flow has been introduced. The basic feature of the synchronized flow traffic phase formulated in the three-phase traffic theory leads to the nucleation nature of the F → S transition. In this sense, Kerner’s synchronized flow traffic phase that ensures the nucleation nature of the F → S transition at a highway bottleneck and Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory can be considered synonyms. Initially developed for highway traffic, Kerner expanded the three phase theory for the description of city traffic in 2011–2014.  Range of highway capacities  In three-phase traffic theory, traffic breakdown is explained by the F → S transition occurring in a metastable free flow. Probably the most important consequence of that is the existence of a range of highway capacities between some maximum and minimum capacities. = Maximum and minimum highway capacities = Spontaneous traffic breakdown, i.e., a spontaneous F → S phase transition, may occur in a wide range of flow rates in free flow. Kerner states, based on empirical data, that because of the possibility of spontaneous or induced traffic breakdowns at the same freeway bottleneck at any time instant there is a range of highway capacities at a bottleneck. This range of freeway capacities is between a minimum capacity C_{\\\\min} and a maximum capacity C_{\\\\max} of free flow (Figure 7). Figure 7: Maximum and minimum highway capacities in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory = Highway capacities and metastability of free flow = There is a maximum highway capacity C_{\\\\max}: If the flow rate is close to the maximum capacity C_{\\\\max}, then even small disturbances in free flow at a bottleneck will lead to a spontaneous F → S phase transition. On the other hand, only very large disturbances in free flow at the bottleneck will lead to a spontaneous F → S phase transition, if the flow rate is close to a minimum capacity C_{\\\\min} (see, for example, Sec. 17.2.2 of the book). The probability of a smaller disturbance in free flow is much higher than that of a larger disturbance. Therefore, the higher the flow rate in free flow at a bottleneck, the higher the probability of the spontaneous F → S phase transition. If the flow rate in free flow is lower than the minimum capacity C_{\\\\min}, there will be no traffic breakdown (no F →S phase transition) at the bottleneck. The infinite number of highway capacities at a bottleneck can be illustrated by the meta-stability of free flow at flow rates q with C_{\\\\min} \\\\leq q < C_{\\\\max}. Metastability of free flow means that for small disturbances free flow remains stable (free flow persists), but with larger disturbances the flow becomes unstable and a F → S phase transition to synchronized flow occurs. = Discussion of capacity definitions = Thus the basic theoretical result of three phase theory about the understanding of stochastic capacity of free flow at a bottleneck is as follows: At any time instant, there is the infinite number of highway capacities of free flow at the bottleneck. The infinite number of the flow rates, at which traffic breakdown can be induced at the bottleneck, are the infinite number of highway capacities. These capacities are within the flow rate range between a minimum capacity and a maximum capacity (Figure 7). The range of highway capacities at a bottleneck in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory contradicts fundamentally the classical understanding of stochastic highway capacity as well as traffic theories and methods for traffic management and traffic control which at any time assume the existence of a particular highway capacity. In contrast, in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory at any time there is a range of highway capacities, which are between the minimum capacity C_{\\\\min} and maximum capacity C_{\\\\max}. The values C_{\\\\min} and C_{\\\\max} can depend considerably on traffic parameters (the percentage of long vehicles in traffic flow, weather, bottleneck characteristics, etc.). The existence at any time instant of a range of highway capacities in Kerner’s theory changes crucially methodologies for traffic control, dynamic traffic assignment, and traffic management. In particular, to satisfy the nucleation nature of traffic breakdown, Kerner introduced breakdown minimization principle (BM principle) for the optimization and control of vehicular traffic networks.  Wide moving jams (J)  A moving jam will be called \\"wide\\" if its length (in direction of the flow) clearly exceeds the lengths of the jam fronts. The average vehicle speed within wide moving jams is much lower than the average speed in free flow. At the downstream front the vehicles accelerate to the free flow speed. At the upstream jam front the vehicles come from free flow or synchronized flow and must reduce their speed. According to the definition [J] the wide moving jam always has the same mean velocity of the downstream front v_g, even if the jam propagates through other traffic phases or bottlenecks. The flow rate is sharply reduced within a wide moving jam. = Characteristic parameters of wide moving jams = Kerner’s empirical results show that some characteristic features of wide moving jams are independent of the traffic volume and bottleneck features (e.g. where and when the jam formed). However, these characteristic features are dependent on weather conditions, road conditions, vehicle technology, percentage of long vehicles, etc.. The velocity of the downstream front of a wide moving jam v_g (in the upstream direction) is a characteristic parameter, as is the flow rate just downstream of the jam q_\\\\text{out} (with free flow at this location, see Figure 8). This means that many wide moving jams have similar features under similar conditions. These parameters are relatively predictable. The movement of the downstream jam front can be illustrated in the flow-density plane by a line, which is called \\"Line J\\" (Line J in Figure 8). The slope of the Line J is the velocity of the downstream jam front v_g. Figure 8: Three traffic phases on the flow-density plane in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory = Minimum highway capacity and outflow from wide moving jam = Kerner emphasizes that the minimum capacity C_{\\\\min} and the outflow of a wide moving jam q_\\\\text{out} describe two qualitatively different features of free flow: the minimum capacity C_{\\\\min} characterizes an F → S phase transition at a bottleneck, i.e., a traffic breakdown. In contrast, the outflow of a wide moving jam q_\\\\text{out} determines a condition for the existence of the wide moving jam, i.e., the traffic phase J while the jam propagates in free flow: Indeed, if the jam propagates through free flow (i.e., both upstream and downstream of the jam free flows occur), then a wide moving jam can persist, only when the jam inflow q_\\\\text{in} is equal to or larger than the jam outflow q_\\\\text{out}; otherwise, the jam dissolves over time. Depending on traffic parameters like weather, percentage of long vehicles, et cetera, and characteristics of the bottleneck where the F → S phase transition can occur, the minimum capacity C_{\\\\min} might be smaller (as in Figure 8), or greater than the jam’s outflow q_\\\\text{out}.  Synchronized flow phase (S)  In contrast to wide moving jams, both the flow rate and vehicle speed may vary significantly in the synchronized flow phase. The downstream front of synchronized flow is often spatially fixed (see definition [S]), normally at a bottleneck at a certain road location. The flow rate in this phase could remain similar to the one in free flow, even if the vehicle speeds are sharply reduced. Because the synchronized flow phase does not have the characteristic features of the wide moving jam phase J, Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory assumes that the hypothetical homogeneous states of synchronized flow cover a two-dimensional region in the flow-density plane (dashed regions in Figure 8).  S → J phase transition  Wide moving jams do not emerge spontaneously in free flow, but they can emerge in regions of synchronized flow. This phase transition is called a S → J phase transition. = \\"Jam without obvious reason\\" – F → S → J phase transitions = Figure 9: Empirical example of cascade of F → S → J phase transitions in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory: (a) The phase transitions occurring in space and time. (b) The representation of the same phase transitions as those in (a) in the speed-density plane (arrows S → F, J → S, and J → F show possible phase transitions). In 1998, Kerner found out that in real field traffic data the emergence of a wide moving jam in free flow is observed as a cascade of F → S → J phase transitions (Figure 9): first, a region of synchronized flow emerges in a region of free flow. As explained above, such an F → S phase transition occurs mostly at a bottleneck. Within the synchronized flow phase a further \\"self-compression\\" occurs and vehicle density increases while vehicle speed decreases. This self-compression is called \\"pinch effect\\". In \\"pinch\\" regions of synchronized flow, narrow moving jams emerge. If these narrow moving jams grow, wide moving jams will emerge labeled by S → J in Figure 9). Thus, wide moving jams emerge later than traffic breakdown (F → S transition) has occurred and at another road location upstream of the bottleneck. Therefore, when Kerner’s F → S → J phase transitions occurring in real traffic (Figure 9 (a)) are presented in the speed-density plane (Figure 9 (b)) (or speed-flow, or else flow-density planes), one should remember that states of synchronized flow and low speed state within a wide moving jam are measured at different road locations. Kerner notes that the frequency of the emergence of wide moving jams increases if the density in synchronized flow increases. The wide moving jams propagate further upstream, even if they propagate through regions of synchronized flow or bottlenecks. Obviously, any combination of return phase transitions (S → F, J → S, and J → F transitions shown in Figure 9) is also possible. = The physics of S → J transition = To further illustrate S → J phase transitions: in Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory the Line J divides the homogeneous states of synchronized flow in two (Figure 8). States of homogeneous synchronized flow above Line J are meta-stable. States of homogeneous synchronized flow below Line J are stable states in which no S → J phase transition can occur. Metastable homogeneous synchronized flow means that for small disturbances, the traffic state remains stable. However, when larger disturbances occur, synchronized flow becomes unstable, and a S → J phase transition occurs.  Traffic patterns of S and J  Very complex congested patterns can be observed, caused by F → S and S → J phase transitions. = Classification of synchronized flow traffic patterns (SP) = A congestion pattern of synchronized flow (Synchronized Flow Pattern (SP)) with a fixed downstream and a not continuously propagating upstream front is called Localised Synchronized Flow Pattern (LSP). Frequently the upstream front of a SP propagates upstream. If only the upstream front propagates upstream, the related SP is called Widening Synchronised Flow Pattern (WSP). The downstream front remains at the bottleneck location and the width of the SP increases. It is possible that both upstream and downstream front propagate upstream. The downstream front is no longer located at the bottleneck. This pattern has been called Moving Synchronised Flow Pattern (MSP). = Catch effect of synchronized flow at a highway bottleneck = The difference between the SP and the wide moving jam becomes visible in that when a WSP or MSP reaches an upstream bottleneck the so-called \\"catch-effect\\" can occur. The SP will be caught at the bottleneck and as a result a new congested pattern emerges. A wide moving jam will not be caught at a bottleneck and moves further upstream. In contrast to wide moving jams, the synchronized flow, even if it moves as an MSP, has no characteristic parameters. As an example, the velocity of the downstream front of the MSP might vary significantly and can be different for different MSPs. These features of SP and wide moving jams are consequences of the phase definitions [S] and [J]. = General congested traffic pattern (GP) = An often occurring congestion pattern is one that contains both congested phases, [S] and [J]. Such a pattern with [S] and [J] is called General Pattern (GP). An empirical example of GP is shown in Figure 9 (a). Figure 10: Measured EGP at three bottlenecks B_1, B_2, and B_3 In many freeway infrastructures bottlenecks are very close one to another. A congestion pattern whose synchronized flow covers two or more bottlenecks is called an Expanded Pattern (EP). An EP could contain synchronized flow only (called ESP: Expanded Synchronized Flow Pattern)), but normally wide moving jams form in the synchronized flow. In those cases the EP is called EGP (Expanded General Pattern) (see Figure 10).  Applications of three-phase traffic theory in transportation engineering  Figure 11: Traffic patterns in the ASDA/FOTO application in three countries One of the applications of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory is the methods called ASDA/FOTO (Automatische StauDynamikAnalyse (Automatic tracking of wide moving jams) and Forecasting Of Traffic Objects). ASDA/FOTO is a software tool able to process large traffic data volumes quickly and efficiently on freeway networks (see examples from three countries, Figure 11). ASDA/FOTO works in an online traffic management system based on measured traffic data. Recognition, tracking and prediction of [S] and [J] are performed using the features of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory. Further applications of the theory are seen in the development of traffic simulation models, a ramp metering system (ANCONA), collective traffic control, traffic assistance, autonomous driving and traffic state detection, as described in the books by Kerner.  Mathematical models of traffic flow in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory  Rather than a mathematical model of traffic flow, Kerner’s three-phase theory is a qualitative traffic flow theory that consists of several hypotheses. The hypotheses of Kerner’s three-phase theory should qualitatively explain spatiotemporal traffic phenomena in traffic networks found out in real field traffic data, which was measured over years on a variety of highways in different countries. Some of the hypotheses of Kerner’s theory have been considered above. It can be expected that a diverse variety of different mathematical models of traffic flow can be developed in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase theory. The first mathematical model of traffic flow in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase theory that mathematical simulations can show and explain traffic breakdown by an F → S phase transition in the metastable free flow at the bottleneck was the Kerner-Klenov model introduced in 2002. The Kerner–Klenov model is a microscopic stochastic model in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory. In the Kerner-Klenov model, vehicles move in accordance with stochastic rules of vehicle motion that can be individually chosen for each of the vehicles. Some months later, Kerner, Klenov, and Wolf developed a cellular automaton (CA) traffic flow model in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase theory. The Kerner-Klenov stochastic three- phase traffic flow model in the framework of Kerner’s theory has further been developed for different applications, in particular to simulate on-ramp metering, speed limit control, dynamic traffic assignment in traffic and transportation networks, traffic at heavy bottlenecks and on moving bottlenecks, features of heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of different vehicles and drivers, jam warning methods, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication for cooperative driving, the performance of self-driving vehicles in mixture traffic flow, traffic breakdown at signals in city traffic, over-saturated city traffic, vehicle fuel consumption in traffic networks (see references in Sec. 1.7 of a review). Over time several scientific groups have developed new mathematical models in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase theory. In particular, new mathematical models in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase theory have been introduced in the works by Jiang, Wu, Gao, et al., Davis, Lee, Barlovich, Schreckenberg, and Kim (see other references to mathematical models in the framework of Kerner’s three- phase traffic theory and results of their investigations in Sec. 1.7 of a review).  Criticism of the theory  The theory has been criticized for two primary reasons. First, the theory is almost completely based on measurements on the Bundesautobahn 5 in Germany. It may be that this road has this pattern, but other roads in other countries have other characteristics. Future research must show the validity of the theory on other roads in other countries around the world. Second, it is not clear how the data was interpolated. Kerner uses fixed point measurements (loop detectors), but draws his conclusions on vehicle trajectories, which span the whole length of the road under investigation. These trajectories can only be measured directly if floating car data is used, but as said, only loop detector measurements are used. How the data in between was gathered or interpolated, is not clear. The above criticism has been responded to in a recent study of data measured in the US and the United Kingdom, which confirms conclusions made based on measurements on the Bundesautobahn 5 in Germany. Moreover, there is a recent validation of the theory based on floating car data. In this article one can also find methods for spatial-temporal interpolations of data measured at road detectors (see article’s appendixes). Other criticisms have been made, such as that the notion of phases has not been well defined and that so-called two-phase models also succeed in simulating the essential features described by Kerner. This criticism has been responded to in a review as follows. The most important feature of Kerner’s theory is the explanation of the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown at a road bottleneck by the F → S transition. The empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown cannot be explained with earlier traffic flow theories including two-phase traffic flow models studied in.  Incommensurability of three-phase traffic theory and classical traffic- flow theories  The explanation of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck by a F → S transition in a metastable free flow at the bottleneck is the basic assumption of Kerner’s three-phase theory. However, none of earlier traffic- flow theories incorporates a F→S transition in a metastable free flow at the bottleneck. Therefore, none of the classical traffic flow theories is consistent with the empirical nucleation nature of real traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck. The F→S phase transition in metastable free flow at highway bottleneck does explain the empirical evidence of the induced transition from free flow to synchronized flow together with the flow-rate dependence of the breakdown probability. In accordance with the classical book by Kuhn,T.S. Kuhn, \\"The structure of scientific revolutions\\". Fourth edition. (The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, London 2012) this shows the incommensurability of three-phase theory and the classical traffic-flow theories (for more details, see): The minimum highway capacity C_{\\\\min}, at which the F→S phase transition can still be induced at a highway bottleneck as stated in Kerner’s theory, has no sense for other traffic flow theories and models. The existence of these two phases F and S at the same flow rate does not result from the stochastic nature of traffic: Even if there were no stochastic processes in vehicular traffic, the states F and S do exist at the same flow rate. However, classical stochastic approaches to traffic control do not assume a possibility of an F→S phase transition in metastable free flow. For this reason, these stochastic approaches cannot resolve the problem of the inconsistence of classical theories with the nucleation nature of real traffic breakdown. According to Kerner, this inconsistence can explain why network optimization and control approaches based on these fundamentals and methodologies have failed by their applications in the real world. Even several decades of a very intensive effort to improve and validate network optimization models have no success. Indeed, there can be found no examples where on-line implementations of the network optimization models based on these fundamentals and methodologies could reduce congestion in real traffic and transportation networks. This is due to the fact that the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks have been understood only during last 20 years. In contrast, the generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of traffic and transportation theory have been introduced in the 50s–60s. Examples of this classical traffic flow theories are the Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) model, General Motors (GM) traffic- flow model of Herman, Gazis, Montroll, Potts, and Rothery, as well as Wardrop’s principles for optimization of transportation networks. Thus the scientists whose ideas led to these classical fundamentals and methodologies of traffic and transportation theory could not know the nucleation nature of real traffic breakdown. Many of the diverse driver behavioral characteristics related to real traffic as well as some of the mathematical approaches to traffic flow modeling, which have been discovered in classical approaches to traffic flow theory, are also used in three-phase traffic theory and associated microscopic traffic flow models (for more details, see Sec. 11 of a review).  Paradigm shift in traffic and transportation science  The term \\"incommensurability\\" mentioned above has been introduced by Kuhn in his classical book to explain a paradigm shift in a scientific field. The paradigm shift in traffic and transportation science is the fundamental change in the meaning of stochastic highway capacity because the meaning of highway capacity is the basis for the development of any method for traffic control, management, and organization of a traffic network as well as applications of intelligent transportation systemsA. D. May, Traffic Flow Fundamentals, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, 1990N.H. Gartner, C.J. Messer, A. Rathi (eds) Traffic flow theory: a state-of-the-art report. Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, 2001 Highway Capacity Manual, Sixth Edition, National research council. Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, 2016R.P. Roess, E.S. Prassas, The highway capacity manual: a conceptual and research history, Springer, Berlin, 2014L. Elefteriadou, An introduction to traffic flow theory. Springer optimization and its applications, vol 84. Springer, Berlin, 2014. The paradigm of standard traffic and transportation theories is that at any time instant there is a value of stochastic highway capacity. When the flow rate at a bottleneck exceeds the capacity value at this time instant, traffic breakdown must occur at the bottleneck. The new paradigm of traffic and transportation science following from the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S transition) and Kerner's three-phase traffic theory changes fundamentally the meaning of stochastic highway capacity as followsB.S. Kerner (Ed.), Complex Dynamics of Traffic Management, Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science Series, Springer, Berlin, New York 2019B.S. Kerner, \\"Complex Dynamics of Management: Introduction\\", Springer Science+Business Media LLC, R.A. Meyers (ed.), Encyclopedia of Complexity and Systems Science, Springer, Berlin (2019). doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-27737-5_78-3. At any time instant there is a range of highway capacity values between a minimum and a maximum highway capacity, which are themselves stochastic values. When the flow rate at a bottleneck is inside this capacity range related to this time instant, traffic breakdown can occur at the bottleneck only with some probability, i.e., in some cases traffic breakdown occurs, in other cases it does not occur.

The award is presented to those who perform humanitarian service in a foreign country, in particular those working in dangerous environments or conditions or during a humanitarian crisis. The award was introduced by letters patent on 16 April 1999, following a review of the Australian honours and awards system beginning in 1995. Potential recipients have to prove they worked for a minimum of 30 days in the location depicted by the clasp, during a period of time set in the award criteria. In addition, potential recipients have to be working for an aid organisation recognised by the criteria or with a United Nations taskforce during that timeframe. In 2005, special criteria were established for people working during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake or the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, with a maximum time period of 7 or 14 days depending on the time frame. The medal was originally intended as a civilian award, in parallel with the Australian Service Medal and the Police Overseas Service Medal, and until 2005 the Australian Defence Force had never been declared an eligible organisation. This is because, in most cases, the Australian Service Medal is already available to military personnel serving alongside humanitarian relief operations. However, defence personnel on leave of absence and serving an eligible organisation could qualify for the medal. The declaration of eligible organisations for the Indian Ocean clasp was the first time the Australian Defence Force was declared an eligible organisation, as Operation Sumatra Assist was purely a disaster relief operation and did not attract any military operational service award. The Australian Defence Force was again declared an eligible organisation for the participation of its personnel in Operation Pakistan Assist, part of the Australian humanitarian response to 8 October 2005 Pakistan earthquake. Description * The Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal is a circular medal. The obverse features a stylised eucalyptus tree in the centre, with its branches reaching to the edge of the medal. A pattern of gumnuts rings the eucalyptus. * The reverse has the same pattern of gumnuts around the rim, with the name of the recipient engraved. * The ribbon is eucalyptus green, divided vertically by a gold stripe. These colours are associative with the green and gold, the national colours of Australia, while continuing with the eucalyptus theming; symbolising hope and regeneration after the disaster.

Reilly. It follows Brennan (Ferrell) and Dale (Reilly), two grown men who are forced to live together as brothers after their single parents, with whom they still live, marry each other. Richard Jenkins, Mary Steenburgen, Adam Scott, and Kathryn Hahn also star. The film was released by Sony Pictures Releasing on July 25, 2008, two years after Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Both films feature the same main actors, as well as the same producing and writing team. It grossed $128.1 million and received mixed reviews. Plot Brennan Huff and Dale Doback are immature adults still living at home. Brennan lives with his divorced mother, Nancy, and Dale lives with his widowed father, Robert. Robert and Nancy meet, fall in love, and get married, forcing Brennan and Dale to live with each other as step brothers. Brennan and Dale despise each other for interfering with each other's lifestyles. Dale warns Brennan not to touch his drum kit, which Brennan later does anyway and is confronted by Dale. The argument over the drum kit erupts into a violent brawl between them. They are grounded with no television for a week following the incident and told they must find jobs within a month, or they will be evicted from the house. When Brennan's younger and more successful brother Derek, a helicopter leasing agent, comes to visit with his family, he openly ridicules them for their lack of ambition, enticing Dale to punch him in the face. Brennan is awed that Dale stood up to Derek, while Derek's wife Alice finds Dale's courage attractive, attempting to begin a sexual affair between the two. Brennan and Dale discover their shared interests and develop a brotherly friendship. Robert schedules several job interviews for Brennan and Dale, in which they perform poorly. Robert and Nancy reveal their plans, with help from Derek, to sell the house, retire and sail the world on Robert's boat. They also demand that Brennan and Dale attend therapy and find other living arrangements. Dale and Brennan start an entertainment company, \\"Prestige Worldwide\\". They present their first music video, which they filmed on Robert's boat, at Derek's birthday party. The presentation backfires when the video shows the boat crashing, shattering Robert and Nancy's sailing dreams. Robert is furious and refuses to make an investment, prompting Brennan to berate Robert as Nancy attempts to calm him down. On Christmas Day, Robert announces he wants to divorce Nancy, causing Brennan and Dale to break down. Blaming each other for the divorce, Brennan and Dale fight, then decide to go their separate ways. Brennan works for Derek's helicopter leasing firm and Dale works for a catering company. Weeks later, Brennan and Dale are living independently as functioning adults and are doing well at their new jobs. Wanting to reunite the family, Brennan volunteers to oversee a prestigious event, the Catalina Wine Mixer, for Derek's company and invites Robert and Nancy. They hire the catering company that employs Dale. The party is a success until the lead singer of the hired band loses his temper and is ejected. With the stage empty, Derek fires Brennan, blaming him for the debacle, and Robert ultimately encourages Brennan and Dale to be their eccentric child-at-heart selves again. Brennan and Dale take the stage and perform \\"Por Ti Volaré\\". Derek is so moved by the performance that he and Brennan make amends. Dale ends his relationship with Alice, to her dismay. Six months later, Robert and Nancy are back together living in their old house, while Brennan and Dale have turned \\"Prestige Worldwide\\" into a successful entertainment company that hosts karaoke events. Robert has his boat turned into a treehouse in the backyard. In a surprise ending, Brennan and Dale fight the school kids for revenge for tormenting them earlier on.

The film generated sales of an estimated 3.87 million units in DVD and Blu-ray, totaling $63.7 million. For the home video release, Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, and Adam McKay recorded a commentary track mostly in song, accompanied by Jon Brion; the track covers \\"the movie-making process [and] their characters' offscreen lives\\" in remarks that range \\"from the inspired to the irritatingly prolonged, but when Ferrell and Reilly really get into a good groove, they're actually funnier than the main feature\\". Reception =Box office= Step Brothers opened in 3,094 theaters and grossed $30.9 million. It grossed $100,468,793 domestically and $27,638,849 internationally for a total of $128,107,642. =Critical reception= Step Brothers received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 55% based on 204 reviews, with an average rating of 5.58/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Step Brothers indulges in a cheerfully relentless immaturity that will quickly turn off viewers unamused by Ferrell and Reilly -- and delight those who find their antics hilarious.\\" At the website Metacritic, which utilizes a normalized rating system, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film 1-1/2 out of 4 stars and stated, \\"When did comedies get so mean? Step Brothers has a premise that might have produced a good time at the movies, but when I left, I felt a little unclean\\". = Cultural and political reception = In the movie, Dale and Brennan make a video investment pitch to both Robert and Derek about investing in Prestige Worldwide. To do so, they shot a music video for a song titled \\"Boats 'N' Hoes\\"; since the release of the film, \\"Boats 'N' Hoes\\" has contributed to the success of the movie with over a million hits on YouTube and merchandise that references the song. Politically, there was a political action committee (PAC) known as the \\"Boats 'N' Hoes PAC\\". It was registered by Shaun Nowacki with the Texas Ethics Commission in 2014. Nowacki's firm was hired by multiple Republicans in Texas such as current Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Dan Patrick, who was running for Lieutenant Governor, and Donna Campbell, who was campaigning for State Senator. The purpose of the PAC was never shared and was criticized by Lisa Paul who served as the Texas Democratic Party Deputy Communications Director who said, \\"Texas Republicans say they want to reach out to women, to be more inclusive, but actions like this reinforce a pattern of disrespect... Their contempt towards women is simply unforgivable.\\" The Catalina Wine Mixer mentioned in the film was not a real event that existed before or during the creation of the film. The event has since been created and hosted on Catalina Island on Descanso Beach. Rap album McKay announced on Twitter in 2011 that production of a Step Brothers rap album featuring Ferrell and Reilly had begun, but later said that the rap album fell apart and will not be released. Possible sequel Ferrell and Reilly have talked about a sequel. Reilly had the idea. McKay was also interviewed about the possible sequel: He added that Ferrell and Reilly's characters would be mature and have jobs. \\"One of them's married and has a kid. They're still kind of goofballs but they've taken three or four steps. Then we have an idea for something happens that knocks him back to square one, and one of the brothers, John C. Reilly sort of instigates it, like 'we can't take this anymore.' And things go really bad, their lives kind of fall apart. They have to pull it back together is sort of the basic structure.\\" McKay has also said that ideas that were not used in the first film may be used in the sequel. McKay spoke to Empire in February 2014 and appeared to rule out a sequel to Anchorman 2 or Step Brothers saying, \\"No, that's the last sequel we're gonna do. There's nothing more fun to me than new characters and a new world. And now we're releasing this alt version, we're totally satisfied. No Anchorman 3.\\" However, in an interview with Collider posted on October 21, 2014, McKay indicated the door was still open for a Step Brothers sequel at some point, while making clear it wasn't a short term development priority, stating: In February 2017, Ferrell said in an interview with Rolling Stone that there are currently no plans for a sequel to Step Brothers.

The genus was erected by Ferdinand Ochsenheimer in 1816. A number of the species of this genus are extinct. Description Its eyes are naked and without lashes. The proboscis is well developed. Palpi obliquely porrect (extending forward), where the second joint evenly scaled and third joint prominent. Thorax and abdomen without tufts. Abdomen somewhat flattened. Tibia very strongly spined. Forewings with non-crenulate outer margin. Hindwings with veins 3 and 4 from cell. Ecology Many of the species are of great importance as cutworms, major agricultural pests whose larvae hide by day and emerge at night to feed. The name cutworm refers to the habit of the larvae, of cutting down and partly eating garden and crop plants, especially seedlings.Smit, Bernard, \\"Insects in South Africa: How to Control Them\\", Pub: Oxford University Press, Cape Town, 1964. Not all cutworms are in the genus Agrotis, though it may well be the genus that includes the largest number of cutworm species, and the most agriculturally important cutworm species. The bogong moth, itself a cutworm, also has been of importance as a seasonal food for humans, valued by indigenous Australians.

The film was directed by Kent Alterman and stars Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, André Benjamin and Maura Tierney. The film was shot in Los Angeles near Dodger Stadium (in the gym of the Los Angeles City Fire Department Training Center), in Detroit, and in Flint, Michigan. Released in theaters on February 19, 2008 and released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 3, 2008, it was the last film from New Line Cinema before they were absorbed by Warner Bros. Pictures.  Plot  In 1976, Jackie Moon is a singer who used the profits from his one-hit wonder, \\"Love Me Sexy\\", to buy a basketball team in the American Basketball Association (ABA), the Flint Tropics, becoming the owner, head coach, starting power forward, and pre-game announcer. The ABA Commissioner announces a plan to merge the league with the National Basketball Association (NBA), but only four teams will move to the more established league. The Tropics, the worst team in the league, are in danger of dissolving. Jackie argues that the teams with the four best records should be merged and the Commissioner accepts. Jackie trades the team's washing machine to the Kentucky Colonels for Ed Monix, a backup point guard who won an NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics, but did not play during the playoffs. The Commissioner reveals that in addition to finishing in the top four, the Tropics will also need at least 2,000 fans at every remaining home game. Jackie begins to stage extremely desperate stunts in order to boost attendance, like wrestling a bear named Dewey, as well as the increased intensity of Clarence Withers, the Tropics' best player. Monix takes over as offensive and defensive coordinator and starting point guard, leaving Jackie as the head coach. Monix trains the team rigorously with a play he calls the \\"Puke\\", as the players are to run it until they literally throw up. From Monix's training, the Tropics go on a winning run, moving from last to fifth. Jackie gets a visit from the Commissioner. The NBA does not think that Flint has a large enough media market and will not allow the Tropics into the league even if they beat the first place San Antonio Spurs in the last game of the season. Jackie admits that he stole \\"Love Me Sexy\\" from a napkin his mother wrote on three weeks before she died. Realizing that all his assets are basically stolen, Jackie trades Withers to the Spurs so that he may realize his dream of playing in the NBA. Monix inspires the team to leave everything on the court, while they may not be able to continue the franchise after this season, they have come very far and still have a lot to prove. Going into the Spurs game, which Jackie declares the \\"MegaBowl\\", the Tropics are in fifth place and with a win they would make it into fourth, even though they won't be allowed into the NBA. The Tropics fall behind quickly, and Jackie is knocked unconscious when fouled hard at the end of the first half. Withers decides he has seen enough and rejoins the Tropics in their locker room, destroying his chance at the NBA with the Spurs. An unconscious Jackie imagines that he is in heaven with his mother. He apologizes for stealing her song and she gives him a weapon in order to win. Starting the second half, the Tropics reveal their new weapon: the alley-oop. With the return of Withers, the alley-oop is very effective, but the referee initially calls the play a foul. After some persuasion by Jackie and Monix, the referee is convinced that it is a legitimate play. With seconds left, the have closed to within two points, 117–115, when the Spurs execute a defence against the Alley-Oop. Monix calls a time-out and tells them to run the \\"Puke\\", executing multiple razzle-dazzle passes ending with the ball in Jackie's hands under the netbut he gets fouled hard again with two seconds left, giving him 2 free throws. Shooting granny style, Jackie sinks the first basket. The second bounces off the rim but Monix tips it in right at the buzzer for two points to win, sparking a wild celebration in the arena and the streets of Flint. The Spurs' coach offers Withers his position back, while the now-former ABA Commissioner offers Jackie a position on the staff of the NBA Assistant Commissioner, as a marketing director. Cast =Cameos= In addition, former American Basketball Association players, Artis Gilmore and George Gervin, appear in uncredited roles as customers in a restaurant, while the already extensive list of Saturday Night Live cast members includes Jerry Minor, in the uncredited role of DJ at the nightclub. =Dewie the Bear= The 5-year-old, , male grizzly bear named Rocky appeared in the film in a scene where Will Ferrell's character wrestles him to promote his basketball team. Stuntman and trainer Randy Miller doubled for Ferrell during the wrestling match with the bear. On April 22, 2008, seven weeks after the Semi-Pro entered wide release, the bear bit 39-year-old Stephan Miller (Randy Miller's cousin and fellow trainer) on the neck, killing him. Marketing *A number is shown in the teaser trailer 1-800-TROPICS, when called played a recorded message of Jackie Moon talking about season ticket packages for the 1976 season *Several ads for Anheuser-Busch were filmed featuring Will Ferrell in character as Jackie Moon that were aired during Super Bowl XLII.

Reception =Critical reception= Semi-Pro received negative reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval score of 22% based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Semi-Pro is an intermittently funny, half-hearted attempt at sports satire, and one of Will Ferrell's weaker cinematic efforts.\\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 47 out of 100, based on 29 reviews. Matt Zoeller Seitz of New York Times said, \\"Semi-Pro finds the sweet spot between sports melodrama and parody, and hammers it for 90 diverting minutes.\\" Peter Travers writing for Rolling Stone stated, \\"when the script, by Scott Armstrong, shoots air balls, Ferrell is a slam-dunk.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today said, \\"Although not exactly a slam dunk, Semi-Pro is definitely more than semi-funny.\\" In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Wilonsky gave the film 2 stars of a possible 4 and wrote that director Kent Alterman, \\"valiantly tries to tweak the formula by adding a dash more sincerity and humanity to the froth but doesn't get too adventurous. But in the end, it's comedy comfort food, something powdered poured from a box.\\" =Box office performance= In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15 million in 3,121 theaters in the United States and Canada, holding the number one position at the box office. Alicia Chang of the Associated Press described the opening as \\"lackluster\\" compared to Ferrell's previous sports spoofs Talladega Nights, which opened with $47 million, and Blades of Glory, which opened with $33 million. The basketball film went on to gross $33,479,698 domestically and $10,405,206 internationally, for a total of $43,884,904 worldwide. =Awards= 2008 ESPY Awards # Best Sports Movie ESPY Award 2008 Teen Choice Awards # Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie - Comedy (Nominated) Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 3, 2008.

The strategic aim is to achieve a balanced and sustainable spatial development strategy.  Key concepts  With the aim to provide an integrated, multi-sectoral and indicative strategy for the spatial development, the key ideas of ESDP are: * an integrated approach - Not just to look at specific sectors of development activity (e.g. environment, economic development, or transport), but to recognise that they all affect each other; * spatial development - a much wider view of the development, vital for integrative approach; * strategic aspects - interlinked actions to achieve balanced and sustainable territorial development; * indicative views - the responsibility lies with the developed regions and territories to implement the development principals. * Inclusive growth - regional approach to address disparities.  Spatial policy guidelines  # Development of a polycentric and balanced urban system, and strengthening of the partnership between urban and rural areas, so as to create a new urban-rural relationship. # Promotion of integrated transport and communication concepts, which support the polycentric development of the EU territory, so that there is gradual progress towards parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge. # Wise management of the natural and cultural heritage, which will help conserve regional identities and cultural diversity in the face of globalisation.

Chambéry University) is a university in the region of Savoy, with one campus in Annecy and two around Chambéry. Campuses The university was officially founded in 1979 from several colleges founded in the 1960s and 1970s. To avoid a straight choice between the two biggest towns of the Savoie/Haute-Savoie region, the authorities decided to set up a campus in each city for different areas of study. The university has three campuses: * The Annecy-le-Vieux campus (near Annecy) is the university's \\"technology institute\\" (IUT), and teaches engineering-related subjects and business and administration related subjects. There is either the faculty of economics and management (IMUS, Institut de Management de l'Université de Savoie). * Jacob-Bellecombette (1.5 km south of Chambéry) is the campus for students of languages, literature, social sciences, law and economics. It has a library, sports hall and one cafeteria. Chambéry is the home of the university's presidence and administrative buildings. * The Technolac campus at Bourget-du-Lac (12 km north of Chambéry) teaches science. History * Between 1295 and 1563, Chambéry was the capital of Savoy. The University of Turin was founded in 1404, and Chambéry was the home of an école préparatoire, a school preparing students to go there. But there was no university in Chambéry in this period, and Turin took over from Chambéry as Savoy's capital in 1563. * The annexation of Savoy by France after the unification of Italy meant that Chambéry had an académie between 1860 and 1920, but not a university. * During the movement creating new universities in the 1960s, a Savoy Collège Scientifique Universitaire (CSU) was created, then a Collège Littéraire Universitaire (CLU) in 1963. These colleges were merged, creating the Centre Universitaire de Savoie (CUS), at Chambéry, on 9 May 1969. In 1973, Annecy's technical and business college, the Institut Universitaire Technologique (IUT), was founded, and from 27 June 1979, the CUS was officially classed as a university.

Most notable, (Arminius) was the unifier of the early Germanic tribes against the Roman Empire. In lower German the name is Hermann; in upper German it is Harman. Its early name relationship to Arminius who was German born and educated in Rome was discovered by Martin Luther. Arminius himself is said to have descended from the lower german tribes on coastal Germany who many originated as fisherman from the British isles. The name, possibly one of the oldest known surnames, has seen many variations in spelling and is found in over 40 languages. Spelling variations also include Hardman, Hartman, Hartmande, Hermande, Hartmann, Herman, Larmande, Armande, Arman, Armmand, Hermman, Larmand, Ehrman and Armand. Additional Phonetic variations exist. The term \\"Army\\" is also thought to be derived from the name. This is not surprising as Arminius unified the german tribes and drove the Roman army into submission.

(Away) all white with blue shorts. History The club was founded in 1931 by GPU officer Filaret Adamovich. The team initially consisted of players from Baku and Smolensk and played in the Western Oblast league. Dynamo was among the leading teams of the region until 1936, when Bryansk became part of Oryol Oblast and Adamovich left the city. After World War II Dynamo returned to leading roles, now in the newly formed Bryansk Oblast. In 1949 and 1952 the club played in the RSFSR league, and in 1959 they won the Bryansk Oblast championship. The success of 1959 allowed Dynamo to enter the national Class B in 1960. In 1967, they finished first in their zone and qualified for the semi-finals, where they were fifth. In 1968 Dynamo were first in the zone again, but also managed to finish first in the semi-finals and fourth in the finals, securing promotion to Class A, Second Group. Dynamo managed to stay at that level for two years, being relegated in 1970. In 1971–1991 they played in the Soviet Second League, their highest achievement being the league championship in 1989. After the dissolution of USSR Dynamo played in the Russian Second League in 1992–1993, Third League in 1994–1997 and Second Division in 1998–2003. In 2003 Dynamo finished at the top of the Second Division Centre zone, level on points with FC Oryol. In the championship playoff Oryol won the promotion to the First Division, however, after the exclusion of Dynamo SPb, Dynamo Bryansk were also granted promotion. In 2006–07 season Dynamo qualified for the semi-finals of Russian Cup, where they were defeated by FC Moscow in 2 matches series (1:1, 0:1). In 2009, the club came second in its Russian Second Division zone but was not promoted. However, in early 2010, FC Moscow dropped out from the Russian Premier League for financial reasons, FC Alania Vladikavkaz were promoted from the First Division to the Premier League, and Dynamo Bryansk took Alania's spot in the Russian First Division, where they played in 2010.Первый дивизион - 2010 At the end of the 2010 season, Dynamo officially changed their mascot to the Bryansk wolf. In 2012 the club had lost its professional status and left First division. It was promoted to the third-tier professional level (now called Russian Professional Football League) for the 2013-14 season. On 15 May 2020, the 2019–20 PFL season was abandoned due to COVID-19 pandemic in Russia. As Dynamo was leading in their PFL zone at the time, they were promoted to the second-tier FNL for the 2020–21 season.

The park includes the Gouldsboro Lake. Gouldsboro State Park is located very close to Tobyhanna State Park and Pennsylvania State Game Lands 127 and 312. It is on Pennsylvania Route 507 near the small village of Gouldsboro. History Gouldsboro State Park is named for Gouldsboro, which was in turn named for Jay Gould (1836 - 1892). Gould, a native of New York, acquired an immense fortune during the Industrial Revolution, part of which included ownership of ten percent of all the rail tracks in the United States at the time of his death. One of his railroads passed by what is now the eastern boundary of the park. Gould was also the co-owner of a tannery in nearby Thornhurst. Raw hides were shipped from the western United States and Australia on the railroads owned by Gould to Gouldsboro. The hides were then sent to Thornhurst by way of wagons traversing a plank road. Note: Histories of both state parks As of 2006, this rail line forms the dividing line between Gouldsboro State Park and Tobyhanna State Park in Monroe County, and is owned by the Lackawanna County Railroad Authority and operated by the Delaware- Lackawanna Railroad Co. Inc. Tourist excursions on this line are operated by Steamtown National Historic Site, and run from Steamtown's yard in Scranton to Tobyhanna. (shows owners and operators) A dam and spillway were built on an existing lake in 1895 by the North Jersey & Pocono Mountain Ice Company. The new dam allowed more ice to be harvested from the lake in winter. In 1956 the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission took over ownership of the dam. The park opened in 1958 and the dam was transferred to the DCNR in 2003. Inspections on the dam in 1979 revealed \\"the dam’s drain gate was inoperable and its spillway was deteriorating\\". The lake was partially drained in 1985 and 1995 for repairs to the dam and spillway, and completely drained in January 2005. Repairs included removing debris, installing a culvert, fence and erosion control measures, and replacing the spillway. Repairs were completed and the lake was refilled in January 2008. Recreation =Gouldsboro Lake= Gouldsboro Lake Gouldsboro Lake is a man made lake. It is open to boating, swimming, fishing and ice fishing. Gas powered boats are prohibited on Gouldsboro Lake. Electric powered and non powered boats must have current registration from any state, or a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. A beach at the lake is open from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. The beach does not have lifeguards. Gouldsboro Lake is a warm water fishery. The common game fish are pickerel, yellow perch, bass, walleye, sunfish, muskellunge, and catfish. Gouldsboro Lake is also a popular ice fishing destination, however the thickness of the ice is not monitored by the park staff so visitors are asked to use caution when venturing out onto the ice. =Hunting and trapping= Hunting is permitted at Gouldsboro State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are squirrels, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, black bear, and snowshoe hare. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. The trapping of muskrats, raccoons, beaver, mink, fox, and coyote is permitted with the proper license. =Picnics= Gouldsboro State Park has five picnic areas with about 300 picnic tables. All five picnic areas are shaded and open year-round. There is one pavilion with an electric hook-up. =Trails= *Old Route 611 is a \\"easy\\" trail that is flat and wide and runs parallel to Interstate 380 on the western edge of the park.

The footballers of VfB, playing as Karlsruher FC Südstadt sometime early in the club's history, are notable as founding members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association) in Leipzig in 1900. History Original logo of VfB Karlsruhe.In the late 1890s and early 1900s the club played as a member of the KFB (Karlsruher Fußball-Bund or Karlsruhe Football Federation). Little is known about the league and certain of its member teams included Südstadt, Karlsruher FV 1891, FC Phönix 1894 Karlsruhe, FC Germania 1898 Karlsruhe, FC Franconia 1895 Karlsruhe and FC Alemannia 1897 Karlsruhe. The league is believed to have been formed in the spring or summer of 1899 and to have led a short tumultuous existence. Friedrich Wilhelm Nohe, chairman of Karlsruher FV, also acted as chairman of the league and of the VSFV (Verband Süddeutscher Fußball-Vereine or Federation of South German Football Associations). Nohe found himself in conflict with the leadership of several of the KFB's clubs as well as with Walther Bensemann, chairman of a committee established to organize matches between German and foreign clubs. These conflicts led to the collapse of the KFB after only a single season. Some FV players left for other clubs, while Südstadt and Germania pulled out of the league. Südstadt and Phönix went on to join the DFB. The club left the DFB in 1924 to become part of the ATSB (Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund or Workers' Sports Association), one of several national sports associations active in Germany at the time. Following the rise of the Nazis the ATSB and other sports organizations were broken up in 1933 as politically unpalatable to the regime. VfB and many similar such clubs saw their memberships dispersed or forced into mergers with other more ideologically acceptable sides. VfB was reestablished after World War II and the current-day club has several other sporting departments in addition to its football side and focuses on recreational sport and wellness. The footballers most recently played in the Landesliga Mittelbaden from where they were relegated at the end of the 2015–16 season.

Software architects use architectural models to communicate with others and seek peer feedback. An architectural model is an expression of a viewpoint in software architecture. Some key elements in software architectural model are: *rich: for the viewpoint in question, there should be sufficient information to describe the area in detail. The information should not be lacking or vague. The goal is to minimize misunderstandings, not perpetuate them. See notes below on 'primary concern.' * rigorous: the architect has applied a specific methodology to create this particular model, and the resulting model 'looks' a particular way. Here's the test of rigorousness: If two architects, in different cities, were describing the same thing, the resulting diagrams would be nearly identical (with the possible exception of visual layout, to a point). * diagram: in general, a model may refer to any abstraction that simplifies something for the sake of addressing a particular viewpoint. This definition specifically subclasses 'architectural models' to the subset of model descriptions that are represented as diagrams. *standards: standards work when everyone knows them and everyone uses them. This allows a level of communication that cannot be achieved when each diagram is substantially different from another. UML is the most often quoted standard. * primary concern: it is easy to be too detailed by including many different needs in a single diagram. This should be avoided. It is better to draw multiple diagrams, one for each viewpoint, than to draw a 'mega diagram' that is so rich in content that it requires a two-year course of study to understand it. Remember this: when building houses, the architect delivers many different diagrams. Each is used differently. Frequently the final package of plans will include diagrams with the floor plan many times: framing plan, electrical plan, heating plan, plumbing, etc. They don't just say: it's a floor plan so 100% of the information that CAN go on a floor plan should be put there. The plumbing subcontractor doesn't need the details that the electrician cares about. * illustrate: the idea behind creating a model is to communicate and seek valuable feedback. The goal of the diagram should be to answer a specific question and to share that answer with others to (a) see if they agree, and (b) guide their work. Rule of thumb: know what it is you want to say, and whose work you intend to influence with it. * specific set of tradeoffs: the architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) methodology describes a process whereby software architecture can be peer-reviewed for appropriateness. ATAM does this by starting with a basic notion: there is no such thing as a 'one-size-fits-all' design. We can create a generic design, but then we need to alter it to specific situations based on the business requirements. In effect, we make tradeoffs. The diagram should make those specific tradeoffs visible. Therefore, before an architect creates a diagram, he or she should be prepared to describe, in words, which tradeoffs they are attempting to illustrate in this model. * tradeoffs inherent in the structure and design: a component is not a tradeoff. Tradeoffs rarely translate into an image on the diagram. Tradeoffs are the first principles that produced the design models. When an architect wishes to describe or defend a particular tradeoff, the diagram can be used to defend the position. * system or ecosystem: modeling in general can be done at different levels of abstraction. It is useful to model the architecture of a specific application, complete with components and interactions. It is also reasonable to model the systems of applications needed to deliver a complete business process (like order-to- cash). It is not commonly useful, however, to view the model of a single component and its classes as software architecture. At that level, the model, while valuable in its own right, illustrates design much more so than architecture.

During its brief tenure, the Menshevik government of Georgia came across significant problems with ethnic Ossetians who largely sympathized with the Bolsheviks and Soviet Russia. The reasons behind the conflict were complicated. An overdue land reform and agrarian disturbances in the poor Ossetian-populated areas intermingled with an ethnic discord and the struggle for power in the Caucasus. 1917–18 After the 1917 February Revolution that resulted in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the Ossetians set up a National Council of Ossetians which convened in Java in June 1917 and advocated the creation of organs of self-rule in Ossetian-inhabited areas on the both sides of the Caucasus. The Council was internally divided along the ideological lines and soon became dominated by the Bolsheviks who called for the unification of North and South Ossetias and the incorporation of South Ossetia into Soviet Russia. Already in February 1918, there were numerous outbreaks of disobedience among the Ossetian peasants who refused to pay taxes to the Tiflis-based Transcaucasian government. On March 15, 1918, the Ossetian peasants rose in rebellion and managed to hold off an offensive by a Georgian People's Guard punitive detachment commanded by an ethnic Ossetian officer, Kosta Kaziev. The fighting culminated in the town of Tskhinvali which was occupied by the rebels on March 19, 1918.http://geo.1september.ru/view_article.php?id=200402803 Республика Южная Осетия, Д.В. ЗАЯЦ, журнал \\"География\\" The Georgian People's Guard regained the control of Tskhinvali on March 22. The uprising was finally suppressed and harsh repressive measures established in the region, generating resentment against the Mensheviks, being now equated, in the eyes of the Ossetians, with Georgians.Cornell, p. 141. This also opened the way for strong pro-Bolshevik sentiments among the Ossetians. Valiko Jugheli spoke about the Ossetians saying, \\"Our worst and most relentless enemies\\" and, \\"These traitors should be cruelly punished. There is no other way.\\" 1919 In October 1919, revolts against the Mensheviks broke out again in several areas. On October 23, rebels in the Roki area proclaimed the establishment of Soviet power and began advancing toward Tskhinvali, but suffered defeat and retreated to the Soviet- controlled Terek district. The year 1919 also saw a series of fruitless discussions concerning the status and governance of the region. Ossetians demanded a degree of autonomy comparable with the one granted to the Abkhazians and Muslim Georgians in Adjara. However, no final decision was made, and the Georgian government outlawed the National Council of South Ossetia, a Bolshevik-dominated body, and refused any grant of autonomy. Bolsheviks fully exploited the tensions and the Menshevik mistakes to further strengthen their influence among the Ossetians.Lang, p. 228. 1920 In 1920, a much larger Ossetian uprising took place, which was supported by the regional committee of the Bolshevik Russian Communist Party, which had gathered a military force in Vladikavkaz, the capital of modern-day North Ossetia-Alania, Russia. Despite assurance of respecting Georgia's territorial integrity in the Treaty of Moscow of May 7, 1920, Soviet Russia demanded Georgia call back its troops from Ossetia.Cornell, p. 188 On May 8, the Ossetians declared a Soviet republic in the Roki area on the Russian-Georgian border. A Bolshevik force from Vladikavkaz crossed into Georgia and helped the local rebels to defeat a Georgian force in the Java district. The rebellious areas were effectively incorporated into Soviet Russia. However, Vladimir Lenin’s desire to keep peace with Georgia at that time and eventual military failures of the rebels forced the Bolsheviks to distance themselves from the Ossetian struggle. The Georgian People's Guard under Valiko Jugheli crushed the revolt with great violence, defeating the insurgents in a series of hard- fought battles. Several villages were burned down and some 3,000 to 7,000 people were killed during the hostilities, amongst them 4,812 to 5,279 Ossetians of whom some 4,143 died as a result of hunger and disease.http://iratta.com/2007/04/27/1920.html About 20,000 Ossetians were forced to seek refuge in Soviet Russia. Aftermath In February 1921, many Ossetians joined the advancing Red Army which brought Georgia's independence to an end. In April 1922, newly established Soviet Georgian government rewarded the Ossetian service with the establishment of the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast which included not only Ossetian and mixed Georgian- Ossetian, but also purely Georgian villages and had Tskhinvali, where the Ossetians were in minority at that time,Cornell, p. 144 as its capital. However, an area populated by the Ossetians equal to what became the Ossetian Autonomous Oblast was left out inside Georgia. These included great pockets of Ossetian ethnic territories south of Gori and along the spine of Mount Caucasus, east of South Ossetia to the borders of Azerbaijan Assessment Despite the bloody conflict and painful memories left by it,The events were described by a number of authors, eyewitnesses and participants of the conflicts. Among them are the Ossetian writers, Arsen Kotsoyev and Tsomak Gadiev, as well as the Georgian Bolshevik Filipp Makharadze, the Menshevik Valiko Jugheli and several Georgian political émigrés to Europe. the relations between Georgians and Ossetians remained peaceful throughout the Soviet period in contrast to Georgia's other ethnic troublespot, Abkhazia, where ethnic discord was much more profound and potentially inflammable. With the rising of ethnic tensions in South Ossetia in the late 1980s, the 1918–1920 thematic surfaced again, with conflicting narratives and interpretations of the conflict. The South Ossetians consider those events as part of their struggle for self-determination and claim that the Georgian reaction to the uprisings was genocide. According to their version, 387 men, 172 women, and 110 children were killed in action or massacred; 1206 men, 1203 women, and 1732 children died during flight. The total fatalities amounted to 4812 or 5279 by another source, i.e., 6-8% of the region's total Ossetian population. The depopulated Ossetian villages were allegedly occupied by their Georgian neighbors from the Dusheti and K'azbegi districts.After the Sovietization of Georgia, however, many Ossetian refugees returned to their homes. The rest refugees mingled with the North Ossetian population. The Soviet authorities also pursued an active urbanization policy which helped to make Tskhinvali a largely Ossetian town. Cornell, p. 145. On September 20, 1990, People's Deputies' Council of South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast characterized conflict as Ossetian Genocide by the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Similar resolutions have been made by North Ossetia and some other republics of Russia's Northern Caucasus. Парламент Южной Осетии дал политическую оценку событий 1918–1920 годов. On 2 November 2006, the People's Assembly of Abkhazia unanimously passed a resolution recognizing the Georgian actions of 1918—1920 and 1989—1992 as a genocide under the 1948 convention.

Included in the pamphlet is the report of the Icelandic delegation. It was published in 1875 in Washington and re-published on February 26, 2005 by Project Gutenberg. The report has high hopes and dreams of a future world where Icelandic will surpass English in the world following the founding of the colony and years of rapidly populating it. The report includes a calculation where 10 thousand Icelanders would form the colony and then double their numbers every 25 years, so that in three to four centuries they would number 100 million, covering the area from Hudson Bay to the Pacific Ocean. From there Icelandic could spread south, replacing the degenerate English tongue, as it is put. The author's youssef disdain for English is more evident as he describes it as \\"being a prostitute who has laid with every language of savages and idiots\\". The nature and weather of Alaska is detailed for the benefit of future settlers. Although the proposal for colonization of Alaska never materialized, the report was cited in Alaskan government reports as late as 1904.

The fallfish is the largest minnow species native to Eastern North America.  Description Average specimens generally measure about in length, but individuals occasionally grow to with exceptional specimens of more than having been recorded. Juvenile fallfish have a dark stripe that runs down the center of their body. They are a silvery shade on the top and sides of the body, but have a white shading on the belly. Breeding males develop a pinkish tone on the opercular region, although the species does not develop bright breeding colors. Spawning males build stone nests, known as a redd, which form a prominent part of the bottom on many streams throughout the northeast. Spawning is communal with both males and females joining the nest builder. Distribution and habitat They are found in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, where it inhabits clear streams, lakes, and ponds. They predominately prefer swift currents, however they can also be found in well oxygenated pools. As their name suggests they are often found at the base of waterfalls. Before the introduction of fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and brown trout the Fallfish was the apex predator in many streams.  Diet and predation  Juvenile and young fallfish primarily consume chironomids and zooplankton. Once they reach 100mm their diet transitions to small fish (including their own young) and prey of opportunity such as fish eggs and terrestrial insects. There is little overlap between the diets of juvenile and adult Fallfish.  Angling  Fallfish are often encountered when fishing for more desirable species, but their large size, dogged fighting style, powerful runs on light tackle, and willingness to strike make them a worthy quarry in their own right. They will readily take bait, lures, and flies, and have been known to strike lures almost as large as themselves. The IGFA All Tackle World Record for Fallfish is 3lb 9oz caught by Jonathan McNamara in the Susquehanna River near Owego, New York, USA in April 2009. Previous records come from New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.

The Museum endeavours to preserve and enrich the cultural life and heritage of the Valley. Located on the largest green space in the city of Winchester, the MSV is a regional cultural center including a museum designed by Driehaus Prize winner Michael Graves, seven acres of formal gardens, and the Glen Burnie House dating to the 18th century. The MSV complex consists of three main components: House The Glen Burnie Historic House The Glen Burnie Historic House traces its history to surveyor James Wood (?-1759), who settled this land in the early 18th century and donated portions of his land to establish the city of Winchester, Virginia in 1744. His son Robert Wood constructed the central portion of the Glen Burnie Historic House in the 1790s. The house’s ownership passed through several generations of Wood and then Glass families until Julian Wood Glass Jr. (1910–1992), acquired it in 1955. Julian Wood Glass Jr. was the last descendant of James Wood to own the Glen Burnie Historic House. Beginning in 1959, and aided by his partner R. Lee Taylor, Glass transformed the house into a country estate, and the couple designed the Glen Burnie Gardens. Glass created the Glass-Glen Burnie Foundation prior to his death in 1992, and entrusted the Foundation to open the site to the public as a museum. The Glen Burnie Historic House & Gardens opened to the public in 1998. Today, interpretive panels tell the story of those who lived in the house from 1796 to 1992 and exhibitions are presented annually in the Drawing Room. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register. Gardens The Japanese Water Gardens The gardens surrounding the Glen Burnie Historic House were created beginning in 1956 and evolved over the latter half of the 20th century. Built for formal entertaining, the gardens include sculpture, fountains, and folly buildings. Highlights include rose, statue, vegetable, Asian, and perennial gardens. The pond in the Water Garden is stocked with golden trout. Museum The Shenandoah Valley Gallery The Museum of the Shenandoah Valley was designed by architect Michael Graves and opened to the public in 2005. The Museum contains four main galleries: =Shenandoah Valley Gallery= The broad sweep of Valley prehistory and history is explored in the museum's large Shenandoah Valley Gallery. A number of different exhibition techniques are used here, including multi-media presentations, interactive elements, images, maps, dioramas, and display of decorative arts. Objects on display include furniture, fraktur, silver and other metals, baskets, textiles, paintings, folk art, long rifles, and ceramics, for which the Valley is famous. =Founders Gallery= Presents changing exhibitions including, or relating to, the private collection of MSV benefactor, Julian Wood Glass Jr. =R.

Lee Taylor (1924–2000), who lived at Glen Burnie from the late 1950s until his death. At the time of his death, Taylor had assembled fourteen completely furnished rooms and houses. On display are five houses and four rooms by R. Lee Taylor showcasing the work of more than seventy-five miniatures artisans.

The daughter of an accomplished female singer, she was born in Amstetten, Lower Austria. Already as a child she was learning the organ, and within a few years was permitted to participate in church services as organist. Maria Hofer’s later musical education took place at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, where she studied piano teaching. She also began an organ study, but soon resigned because she did not get along with her teacher. According to Maria Hofer's Curriculum Vitae written in 1966/1967 and other auto/biographical documents her tutors included Franz Schmidt, Hermann Graedener, Ernst Ludwig, and Richard Stöhr. Her ability to improvise at the organ was fostered by the organist of St. Stephan's Cathedral, Victor Boschetti; she began to compose in earnest during the First World War. One of Maria Hofer's non-performing roles was to advise the Viennese publishing-house Universal Edition about organ works; she herself described the post as important for her musical development, since it brought her into contact with many prominent artistic figures, including Maurice Ravel, Alexander Zemlinsky, Darius Milhaud, Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Alfredo Casella, Alma Mahler, Franz Werfel, and Stefan Zweig. Universal Edition also published some of her compositions, including the 'Toccata für Orgel' (1937). This work was dedicated to the composer's long-time friend, Yella Hertzka, the wife of UE's director Emil Hertzka and an active feminist. Between 1926 and 1938, in fact, Maria Hofer lived in the house of the Hertzkas. Yella Hertzka was also a leading member of the Austrian branch and the international executive committee of the 'Women's International League for Peace and Freedom' (WILPF), which Maria Hofer joined at Friederike Zweig-Winternitz's suggestion, and for which she created a 'peace anthem' in 1925. After Emil Hetzka's death in 1932, Yella Hertzka joined the board of directors of the public company Universal Edition and continued to support Maria Hofer's career. After the National- socialists came into power in Austria both women had to leave Vienna. Yella Hertzka gained a Czech passport by marrying Egdar Taussig in order to emigrate to England, while Maria Hofer made her home in Kitzbühel after having been expelled from England as citizen of the German Reich. Along with her friend Elsa Welwart, Maria Hofer was arrested due to the denunciation of a neighbour in July 1941. The following month she was transferred to the prison in Innsbruck being accused of 'insulting the Fuehrer', 'listening to forbidden foreign broadcast stations' and 'food stockpiling'. When she was released eight months later, she returned home to find that several manuscripts of her compositions, together with important correspondence from Franz Werfel, Stefan Zweig, Arnold Schönberg, and others had disappeared. Maria Hofer resumed her concert-giving activities, mostly performing her own compositions, already before 1945. After the end of war, she once more tried to restart her career as a composer, with contract compositions, concerts, radio broadcasts and publications. Among her works from this time are several liturgical compositions. Thanks partly to her efforts, an active musical life developed in Kitzbühel during the two decades after 1945. This success was not sustained, however, and Maria Hofer died impoverished and disappointed; shortly before her death she destroyed many of her compositions. Among the unpublished works that were thus lost to posterity was a 'Passacaglia' for organ which had once prompted a reviewer to write: 'If Maria Hofer had written only this Passacaglia, her name should be never forgotten in organ literature'. The loss of such a large proportion of her output makes modern evaluation of her compositional abilities difficult.

He died suddenly in his atelier on September 18, 1954.  Paintings  An erudite researcher of the laws of sight and a master of drawing, F. Vagnetti painted principally oil and pastel pictures. After an early period when he flanked the chromatic researches of Emile Claus and Georges Seurat, he experienced a personal pointillism in which the stroke's refinement and chromatic science join to an astonishing depictive capability. Some of his principal works are monumental landscapes (\\"Tra le querce\\" 1915, \\"Tramonto al Palatino\\"1924), portraits of a deep psychological sharpness (\\"Giovanni Giolitti\\" 1928, only existing portrait of this statesman; \\"Anima mite\\" 1923; \\"L’ingegnere Dino Chiaraviglio\\" 1938, \\"La mia Mamma cieca\\" 1938), large compositions of familiar or social characters (\\"Moti proletari\\" 1904, \\"Dolore antico\\" 1921, \\"Sosta dolorosa\\" 1948). In 1922 he painted three monumental portraits of the Italian Sovereigns for the Governmental Palace of Zara; in 1923 he carried out a \\"Trittico francescano\\" in the Church of S. Polo near La Verna (in Tuscany). In 1943, on Vatican commission, he painted a portrait of Pope Pius XII in the Church of SS. Pietro e Paolo in EUR at Rome and, in 1944, for the Board Office of the Italian Socialist Party, he painted the portraits of Bruno Buozzi, Giacomo Matteotti and Filippo Turati.  Exhibitions  Portrait of Rosalia From 1907 to 1930 Fausto Vagnetti was present in Italian artistic life taking part in twenty collective exhibitions. In the following fifteen years, because of his manifest aversion to Fascism, he was kept off the stage of pictorial art only to reappear in the Rome \\"Quadriennali\\" of 1945 and 1948. In 2004 two anthological exhibitions were opened in Anghiari, his native town, and in Rome, accommodated by the Ministero dei Beni ambientali e culturali (Ministry of Culture) in the San Michele a Ripa's Institute.  Writings  In 1928 he won the \\"Concorso Nazionale Poletti\\" (National Poletti Contest) publicized by San Luca Academy for an essay about the causes of the decline of the art of painting (\\"Qual siano le cause che possano apportare decadimento all’Arte della Pittura – 1933, Edizioni Castaldi). On commission for the Ministry of Education in 1943 he wrote \\"La regia Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma\\" (The Royal Academy of Arts) edited by Le Monnier, Florence. In the same year he published \\"Il disegno nelle scuole d’Italia\\" Metodo per gli Istituti magistrali\\" (Draftsmanship in Italian schools, a method for teacher's colleges). Main following works are the \\"Trattato di Prospettiva lineare e Teoria delle ombre\\" (1945–48, edizioni Mediterranee) and, in 1950 the \\"Trattato di Proiezioni ortogonali\\" (Edizioni Mediterranee, Roma). He left a diary made by several notebooks about painting and autobiographical events, which is stored and accessible at the Archivio diaristico nazionale in Pieve Santo Stefano, where it has been finalist in the competition 2016 of the Premio Pieve Saverio Tutino.Article assembled from Italian wikipedia entry.

United States, 547 U.S. 489 (2006), was a United States Supreme Court case involving the right to a speedy trial. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that a defendant cannot prospectively waive the protections of the Speedy Trial Act.18 U.S.C. 3161, et seq. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a partial concurrence, objecting to Alito's use of legislative history.  Background  Jacob Zedner was arrested in 1996 for attempting to open bank accounts with a fake $10 Million bond issued by the fictitious “Ministry of Finance of U.S.A.” He was indicted by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York for trying to pass counterfeit Treasury securities on April 4, 1996. The District Court granted a continuance until September 6, then granted another continuance until November 8. Due to difficulties in arranging a trial schedule, the judge suggested that the defendant waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act \\"for all time.\\" The defendant and his attorney agreed to do so. The case continued to languish for the next four years, during which time the defendant changed lawyers, was examined by a psychiatrist, and ultimately decided to proceed pro se. On March 7, 2001, while his competency to stand trial was being examined, the defendant moved to have the case dismissed for failure to comply with the Speedy Trial Act. The District Court denied his motion, and on April 7, 2003, the trial finally began. = Procedural history = On April 7, 2003, after a trial in the District Court, a jury found Zedner guilty and the judge sentenced him to 63 months imprisonment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the verdict, including the waiver of speedy trial rights, and noted that any error was harmless. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the waiver was effective. = Issue = The Speedy Trial Act requires that a trial begin within seventy days of the indictment, but provides for a variety of exceptions. If the trial does not begin on time, the defendant may move for dismissal, which the court must (under most circumstances) grant. = Parties' arguments = The government contended that the defendant could waive his rights under the Act. The defendant did so, but then contended that such a waiver was unlawful. The issue had not been addressed in earlier cases.See New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 117  Opinion of the Court  The Court unanimously held that the defendant was correct; one may not prospectively waive one's rights under the Speedy Trial Act. Justice Alito wrote that the purpose of the Act is not simply to protect the defendant's rights, but to protect the public's interest in a speedy trial. For that reason, the Act excludes certain delays even at the request of the defendant.See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3161(h)(8)(A). Alito next discussed the legislative history of the Act; this is the section in which Justice Scalia declined to concur.A discussion of this divergence may be found at Orin Kerr's blog. The history follows the explicit terms of the Act, stating that the public has an interest in quick resolutions to criminal charges. Alito went on to discuss the lack of a provision for prospective waiver in the statute. The Court then rejected the government's alternate theory of the case: that the defendant, having agreed to the waiver, is now estopped from challenging it. The Court declines to apply estoppel doctrines, stating that it would \\"entirely swallow the Act's no-waiver policy.\\" Furthermore, the Court found, since the district court requested the waiver, rather than the defendant, estoppel is not applicable. In addition, the harmless error doctrine does not apply to speedy trial violations. = Concurrence = Justice Scalia concurred in everything except Part III-A-2, the section on legislative history.

In 1992, Sodovik replaced Kauchuk, another team from Sterlitamak, in the newly formed Russian Second League. Kauchuk had played in the Soviet Class B in 1966–1969, and in the Soviet Second League B in 1990–1991. In 1994, Sodovik were moved to the Third League after restructuring of the leagues, and in 1996 they finished first in their zone to win promotion to the Second League. In 2001 and 2002 Sodovik were the runners-up in their Second Division zone. In 2004, Sodovik were on course to become the winners of their zone, but one of their players, Zviad Jeladze, was proved to have false Russian citizenship. Foreign players are not allowed to play in the Second Division, and all games in which Dzheladze had taken part were declared forfeited by Sodovik. As a result, Sodovik lost 57 points and moved from first position in the league to the last one. However, the team managed to escape the relegation. In 2005, Sodovik finished first in the Ural-Povolzhye zone and were promoted to the First Division. In 2006 the team finished sixth, recording the best result in history. They were then relegated to the Second Division from 21st place. Subsequently they were left without funding, and the team was abolished.

This is similar to Arabic, Icelandic, and Somali naming conventions. Traditionally for the Habesha peoples (Eritrean-Ethiopians), the lineage is traced paternally; legislation has been passed in Eritrea that allows for this to be done on the maternal side as well. In this convention, children are given a name at birth, by which name they will be known. To differentiate from others in the same generation with the same name, their father's first name and sometimes grandfather's first name is added. This may continue ad infinitum. Outside Ethiopia, this is often mistaken for a surname or middle name but unlike European names, different generations do not have the same second or third names. In marriage, unlike in some Western societies, women do not change their maiden name, as the second name is not a surname. Example Eritrean family tree explained below. Blue: male; red: female. In the example above, the progenitors, Feiven and Senai, may be differentiated from others in their generation by their father's name. In this example, Feiven's and Senai's fathers' first names are Tewolde and Abraham respectively. Feiven and Senai have a daughter and a son, each of whom is married and has a child. The first to have a child (a son) is their daughter, Yordanos Senai; she and her husband name the boy Ammanuel. The next sibling to have a child is Yordanos' brother, Zerezghi Senai; this child is also a son. As it is against custom to name a child after a living family member, his parents give him a different first name than his cousin: Afwerki. Ammanuel and Afwerki would each get their father's first name for their last. In contemporary post- independence Eritrea, a person's legal name consists of their given name, followed by the given name of one of the parents (equivalent to a \\"middle name\\" in Western naming conventions) then the given name of grandparent (equivalent to a \\"last name\\" in Western naming conventions). In modern Ethiopia, a person's legal name includes both the father's and grandfather's given names, so that the father's given name becomes the child's \\"middle name\\" and the grandfather's given name becomes the child's \\"last name\\". In Ethiopian and traditionally in Eritrea, the naming conventions follow the father's line of descent while certain exemptions can be made in Eritrea in which the family may choose to use the mother's line of descent. Usually in both countries the grandparent's name or \\"last name\\" equivalent of the person is omitted in a similar way to how the middle name is omitted in Western naming conventions excluding important legal documents. Some peoples in the diaspora, use the above mentioned conventions but omit the father's given name/the person's \\"middle name\\" and proceed to the grandfather's name/the person's \\"last name\\" in accordance with Western conventions on middle names while retaining the portions of the patronymic conventions. On the other hand other peoples in the diaspora, will not give their children middle names but would adopt the grandfather's given name (the father's \\"middle name\\" or \\"last name\\" depending on the previous naming convention used) as the last name of the child.

The highway connects with SR 10 just south of Elyria via highway interchange and separates from SR 301 and US 20\\\\. South of SR 10 the highway retains four lanes to its intersection with SR 82 where it narrows to a two-lane highway through the remainder of Lorain County and Medina County. As SR 57 traverses the rural communities of Medina County, it takes more of an east-southeast track as it joins and separates with SR 83 and SR 303\\\\. It then merges with SR 18 as it heads towards the city of Medina. SR 57 passes through Medina's town square and heads southeast as Wadsworth Road towards I-71 where it travels over the six-lane expressway en route to its southern terminus. SR 57 continues its path south passing through rural communities in Wayne County. It intersects with I-76 near Wadsworth and continues south past the Wadsworth Municipal Airport, through Orrville on its way to the terminus in Riceland where it meets US 30 in Wayne County. History Prior to the construction of the SR 2/Ohio Turnpike connector around 1976, I-90 traffic had to use SR 57 to access the Turnpike. In 2003 the loop from SR 57 southbound to I-90/SR 2 eastbound in this interchange was removed and replaced by a left turn to simplify traffic movements on SR 57, and the opposite loop had been removed by 2004 to make it a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. =Rebuilding and widening program= The improvement of the SR 57 corridor between the Ohio Turnpike and I-90 in Elyria is a long- awaited project to improve safety and reduce congestion in this heavily commercial area.State Route 57 Corridor Improvement This stretch of SR 57 contains a disorganized cluster of roads and exits and has been said to be a high-crash zone, according to city and Ohio Department of Transportation District 3 officials.ODOT and Elyria get Route 57 project on road This project will modify the existing SR 57 interchange with I-90 in Elyria as well as remove the existing 49th Street bridge over SR 57. SR 57 will be widened to six lanes between the Ohio Turnpike and I-90, and Midway Mall Boulevard will also be widened. The SR 57 and I-90 interchange will be converted to a full diamond interchange with signals.Northcentral Ohio Projects, State Route 57, Lorain County Major junctions References 057 Category:Transportation in Wayne County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Medina County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Lorain County, Ohio ","title":"Ohio State Route 57"},{"id":"7985368","text":"Stephanie Blake in 2013 Stéphanie Blake (born 1968 in Northfield, Minnesota) is an author of children's stories who lives in Paris.

While it is claimed to be endemic to Cagayan River and tributaries extending through the watersheds of Cagayan Valley and the Santa- Abra River Systems of Ilocos Sur and Abra in the Philippines, verifiable and reliable sources have listed Celebes, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, and Fiji as areas where the lobed river mullet may be found.ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/x2400e/x2400e02.pdf According to the BFAR, this fish is habituating in the deep pools of Addalem River in Aglipay, Quirino, and rapids of Didimpit in Lacab, Jones, Isabela. Description Ludong is herbivorous, eating only the filamentous algae that live on rocks and boulders in and near river rapids. A mature fish weighs from 0.25 kg to 2 kg and costs P4,000- P5,000 a kilo, making it the most expensive fish in the country. It commands a very high price in the market because it is seasonal and difficult to catch. This fish is known for its unique taste and peculiar aroma when cooked. In fact, its unique taste makes it one of the most sought- after ingredients in making delicious dishes. Reproduction This elusive fish is catadromous in nature; it migrates to the ocean to breed. It swims to salt water to spawn from October to December and returns to upstream ponds after. It undergoes upstream migration during December, January, and February, and this coincides with the “ipon-run phenomenon’ wherein different species of fish fry also undergo upstream migration. After the ludong had undergone downstream migration, it can be caught in Cagayan River and tributaries. Conservation Ludong is close to being an endangered species, considering its threatened state in the Northern Luzon waters. In fact, information gathered from fish vendors in Cagayan showed that the volume of ludong catch has been tremendously decreasing annually. It was also observed that over the years, the sizes of ludong being caught are getting smaller. According to a BFAR report, the catch of ludong in 1998 weighed 2.4 kg and has gone to 0.25 kg in 2001. Moreover, no ludong was reportedly caught in 2002 and 2003 proving its declining population. Owing to its scarcity and high value in the market, the desire to catch ludong increases causing overfishing and endangerment. This concern resulted in the issuance of Fisheries Administrative Order (FAO) No. 31 aimed at conserving the banak or ludong in Northern Luzon. Specifically, FAO 31 prohibits the capture, purchase, sale, preparation, and serving of ludong for private or public consumption during its seasonal migration (October to January). It also prohibits the use of tabukol (a cast net of large meshes), tabak (small drag seine for river fishing) or pateng (cylindrical fish pot for catching mullet) in the Cagayan River and its tributaries and in the Santa-Abra River System during these months. In 2006, BFAR launched Oplan Sagip Ludong, a wide fish-hunt in Aparri for 60 pieces of live ludong. The hunt was conducted during the first half of October because it provides the best opportunity to catch live ludong, which seasonally appears two to six times only in a year from October to November. At the moment, the only live ludong in captivity is at BFAR research center in Bonuan Binloc in Dagupan City caught five years ago in the Cagayan River in Aparri town. It weighs 1.5 kilograms. This provides the researchers to study further this species and its breeding habits. The fish hunt resulted in the identification of at least 30 more \\"probable species\\" of ludong which BFAR researchers are now studying. Moreover, the live ludong in captivity was recently joined in by 40 fingerlings of fish which are being cultured at BFAR, undergoing further morphological identification. The live ludong was donated in 2001 and the fingerlings in January 2006 by Dr. Lino Edralim Lim for further studies on their physical traits and DNA fingerprinting. The results of these studies will form the basis for other captured fish which might be just ludong look-alikes.

The abbreviation \\"PLC\\" and the term \\"Programmable Logic Controller\\" are registered trademarks of the Allen-Bradley Company (Rockwell Automation). PLCs are used in many industries and machines. Unlike general-purpose computers, the PLC is designed for multiple inputs and output arrangements, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory. A PLC is an example of a hard real time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result. - ** Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) - generally refers to industrial control systems (ICS): computer systems that monitor and control industrial, infrastructure, or facility-based processes, as described below:* Industrial processes include those of manufacturing, production, power generation, fabrication, and refining, and may run in continuous, batch, repetitive, or discrete modes. * Simulation#Engineering Technology simulation or Process simulation - Social movements  Automation-related social movement - a movement that advocates semi- or fully automatic systems to provide for human needs globally. For example, automation of farming and food distribution throughout the world so that no one will go hungry. One goal is to automate all mundane labor, to free humans to engage in more creative activities (or less work). * The Technocracy movement - social movement active from the Great Depression (1930s) to date that proposes replacing politicians and businesspeople with scientists and engineers who have the technical expertise to manage the economy. * The Zeitgeist Movement - movement advocating the replacement of the market economy with an economy in which all resources are equitably, commonly and sustainably shared.

Made from cow's milk, it is aged for at least four weeks. It ripens faster than other cheeses made in the Netherlands. Maasdam has internal voids, or holes, from the ripening process, and a smooth, yellow rind. Sometimes, it is waxed like Gouda is. The cheese was created to compete with Swiss Emmental cheeses by being less expensive and quicker to produce. In the process of making a cheese with the same general components as Swiss cheeses, the Dutch ended up with a cheese that is nutty and sweet, but softer than Emmental, due to a higher moisture content. The style was introduced in 1984 by the Baars company as the trademarked Leerdammer cheese, although it is now made by other Dutch companies under the name Maasdammer.

Baltar works in drawing, photography, performance, video, sculpture, and performance. She is interested in capturing the ephemeral in her artwork. At the end of the 1980s, she attended the Escola de Artes Visuais do Parque Lage in Rio de Janeiro. Baltar’s work is inspired by the Neo-Concrete Movement and fellow Brazilian artists Lygia Clark and Hélio Oiticica. Works Baltar's artistic career began in the 1990s and crosses many different mediums. Their work was featured in numerous exhibitions at key galleries and museums, including the Bergamin & Gomide and the Galeria Nara Roesler, São Paulo. Before being forced to leave her home in São Paulo, that home became the subject of many of her works. In Abrigo (1996), she carves the form of her body into the wall of her Brazilian home and then entered that space. She ground up many of the red bricks from that house and used that as the medium for future drawings and sculptures. Baltar strives to return to a pre- industrial, childlike and primitive narration.’ Baltar's artistic production began in the 1990s with the so-called small poetic gestures, developed in her studio-home in Botafogo, a neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro. In her work, Collecting Mist (1998–2004), which was shown at the New Museum, Baltar photographically captures herself in the Sisyphean task of trying to capture mist. Baltar has had her work exhibited at LAMB Arts in São Paulo, Casas Riegner in Bogota, Bergamin & Gomide in São Paulo, Drawing Room in London, the Embassy of Brazil in London, Spencer Brownstone Gallery in New York, and Carbono Galeria in São Paulo.

Crater counting is a method for estimating the age of a planet's surface. The method is based upon the assumptions that when a piece of planetary surface is new, then it has no impact craters; impact craters accumulate after that at a rate that is assumed known. Consequently, counting how many craters of various sizes there are in a given area allows determining how long they have accumulated and, consequently, how long ago the surface has formed. The method has been calibrated using the ages obtained by radiometric dating of samples returned from the Moon by the Luna and Apollo missions. It has been used to estimate the age of areas on Mars and other planets that were covered by lava flows, on the Moon of areas covered by giant mares, and how long ago areas on the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn flooded with new ice. Crater counting and secondary craters What one needs to count using the crater counting method are independent craters. However, not all craters on a given surface are independent: Secondary craters ('secondaries') are craters formed by material excavated by a primary impact that falls back to the surface seconds or minutes later. A way to distinguish primary and secondary craters is to consider their geometric arrangement; for example, large craters often have rays of secondary craters. Secondaries can sometimes also be recognized by their particular shape different from primary craters; this is due to the fact that the excavated material is slower and impacts at a lower angle than asteroids that arrive from space to create the primary crater. The accuracy of age estimates of geologically young surfaces based on crater counting on Mars has been questioned due to formation of large amounts of secondary craters. In one case, the impact that created Zunil crater produced about a hundred secondary craters, some more than 1000 km from the primary impact. If similar impacts also produced comparable amounts of secondaries, it would mean a particular crater-free area of Mars had not been \\"splattered by a large, infrequent primary crater\\", as opposed to suffering relatively few small primary impacts since its formation.

The northern terminus of State Route 221 is at State Route 125 in the western portion of Georgetown, the county seat of Brown County. Route description The entirety of State Route 221 is situated in the southwestern quadrant of Brown County. State Route 221 is included as a part of the National Highway System. History State Route 221 first appeared in 1924. At the time, it followed the routing of what is now the county-maintained Old U.S. 68 running between Ripley and Georgetown. Meanwhile, what is currently State Route 221 between Higginsport and Georgetown was at the time designated as a portion of State Route 53. In 1933, when U.S. Route 68 was extended into Ohio, the U.S. route replaced all of State Route 221 from Ripley to Georgetown. With all of State Route 53 from Georgetown north to Kenton replaced by U.S. Route 68, the State Route 221 designation, rather than be removed, was simply transposed onto the former routing of State Route 53 between Higginsport and Georgetown. Consequently, State Route 221 has utilized this alignment since 1933 without any significant changes.

It was inaugurated on November 13, 2006 and named Orinoquia Bridge. Prior to its construction, the only crossing of the Orinoco was the Angostura Bridge around 100 km further upstream at Ciudad Bolívar that was opened in 1967. At the site chosen for the bridge the Orinoco is three kilometres wide with two navigation channels separated by a small island that is revealed during the low water season. The average discharge of the river here varies between 66 000 m³/s and 85 000 m³/s, flowing at up to 2.6 m/s and with a seasonal variation in level of 12.5 m. The crossing is composed of approximately 4.5 km of structures and carries four lanes of road traffic separated into two carriageways by a single railway track in the centre. It consists of two cable stayed navigation spans each of 300 m with a south approach 1320 m long composed of 22 60 m spans and a north approach of 636 m composed of ten 60 m spans and one of 36 m. The two navigation spans have a clearance of 41 m above water level and are supported by four 120 m tall H-shaped pylons via two planes of cable stays. Unusually, these spans do not lead directly into each other as at other multi-span cable stayed bridges such as the Millau Viaduct, but are anchored at a fixed point on the mid-stream island. The bridge was built to complement the existing Angostura Bridge and to provide a more direct connection with the important industrial city of Ciudad Guayana. In particular, it was intended to provide for a future rail connection to allow the city's heavy industrial products to be transported to the ports of Venezuela's Caribbean coast. River transport on the Orinoco includes oceangoing ships, but because of its high sediment load the Orinoco has to be constantly dredged. In addition the crossing strengthens transport links between Venezuela and Brazil to the South which is important for Brazilian exports. This is one reason why President Lula da Silva of Brazil attended the inauguration together with Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Near the bridge, there is Orinoco powerline crossing, whose pylons are the tallest man-made structures in South America today.

The Centennial Chapel, located north of the present cathedral, was erected in 1917 to commemorate the church's centennial anniversary, and provides a setting for smaller worship services and concerts as well as a still space for individual prayer and meditation. It may have been designed by prominent Cincinnati architect Frederick W. Garber's firm. The 1835 building, deemed unsafe, was replaced in 1957 with the current building, designed in a bold modern style by David Briggs Maxfield. Although it incorporates features such as the stained glass windows from the original church erected in 1835, the building is in stark contrast to the older buildings in the cathedral complex. It was extensively remodeled in the 1980s and then again in the 1990s. On Palm Sunday 1993, Christ Church was consecrated the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Ohio, succeeding the former St. Paul Episcopal Cathedral, Cincinnati. The following year, the largest renovation project in the history of Christ Church began, involving the church and the entire church complex, and the cathedral was rededicated in 1998.  Christ Church Cathedral today  Cathedral from Sycamore Street before renovation Christ Church continues its history of service to the community that extends back over almost two centuries. The Very Rev. Gail Greenwell was named dean effective November 1, 2013. The current abstract sculpture in front of the cathedral, which honors longtime member (and former Cincinnati mayor Charles Phelps Taft II, may be moved in 2016. Renovation of Sycamore Commons (the garden/atrium area between the diocesan headquarters and cathedral), installation of a new organ, and other construction is scheduled to begin after Easter 2016. The current schedule calls for completion before Advent.

It runs from primary school level to secondary high school up to university level courses. History and founders Bhuwan Lal Joshi and Vijaynandan Joshi founded Vanasthali Vidyashram in 1951 jointly. This was housed in a two-storied mud building with tile roof at Balaju, six kilometers from downtown Kathmandu. The first batch of students came from the founders’ family to be followed by the children of the neighborhood. Classroom size grew gradually, though school education was considered a privilege of wealthy people. Late Marshal General Hari Sumsher J. B. Rana donated the land. To open a school itself was a great challenging task in those days when less than 1% people were literate in Nepal and the Rana autocracy was hostile to any academic activities. In spite of harassment, the late founders were not to be daunted. Late Mr. Bhowan Lal Joshi's quest for knowledge made him go for universities in the USA where he studied varied faculties of knowledge and become a professor later. In short time his versatile personality won fame, favor and love in the world of men of letters and passed away quietly. Another founder late Hon’ble Vijayanandan Joshi, a pedant and born-teacher remained a source of inspiration to fight the multifarious problems that school had been confronted with. He died of asthma and prostate gland. The school was virtually crippled by the demise of them. Thus the school was left at the mercy of the amateurs. Later, another sick school known as Siddhartha English Boarding School, got amalgamated with Vanasthali Vidyashram and rename it by joining the first names from each of them Siddhartha Vanasthali Secondary School. The amalgamation brought about nothing new but a new long name. The guards of Vanasthali Vidyasharm were chased away one after another. Appointing a new headmaster revitalized struggle for survival. But in three months, he too was chased away by the students and his followers. The coming and going of the new headmasters and the teachers had been a usual phenomenon of the school. Such a trend continued till the 12th successor, Mr. Laxman Rajbanshi, took over the school management in July 1973. He was threatened by the demoralizing situation in his own empire and hostile creditors outside. He was being overburdened by the public debt of Rs. 36,000 plus three months salary of the teachers. He mortgaged his personal image, peace and happiness. There was a lack of everything – teachers, furniture, classroom, stationary, etc. Above all, there was a lack of moral courage among his colleagues. Besides financial problems, the academic standard was too frustrating to attract the talented students, which precipitate the situation. The heightening of the teachers' moral was the most difficult task the school was most confronted with. A new scheme had been worked out in order to win over the support of the parents. Intelligent as well as poor students scholarship, financial incentives to the teachers and several other benefits were offered to revive the moribund condition of the teachers and the taught. The untiring efforts compounded with hard labor of all teaching staff, a new image of the school emerged in to light. In two years (1975) all the debt was cleared and successfully placed the students in the merit list in the nationally controlled School Graduation Examination (S.L.C.). To some extent the result regained the lost prestige. The new students began to pour in every year. Number of students raised from 78 to 5,300 from class one to ten within 12 years and the teacher's number (205) too swelled up considerably. In order to maintain its reputation as the one of the topmost schools for the last years on the basis of its SLC result, curricular activities and physical facilities, the management gradually went on cutting down the number of the students up to the manageable size. At present there are 3000 in school and 600 students in the college and 250 teaching and 150 non-teaching staff engaged in teaching learning exercise. With the opening of tertiary level classes (XI and XII) and Three Years bachelor's degree in commerce and management (BBS) it has been renamed Siddhartha Vanasthali Institute. Classes for MA are being planned, besides teaching pure science. The academic Council has been set up aiming at promoting research work in various fields in science, art and culture at its own investment by providing researchers incentives plus laboratory equipment and chemicals for their purposes.

The station is owned by Forever Broadcasting, LLC. It airs a Top 40 (CHR) music format. This station was assigned the WJHT call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on July 13, 2006. There is no relation with WWKL (\\"Hot 106.7\\") in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. However, the station is related to WWOT (\\"Hot 100\\") in Altoona, Pennsylvania, as they are also owned by Forever Broadcasting. History =As WARD-FM= This station first signed on August 16, 1948, as WARD-FM, sister to WARD at AM 1490, and WARD-TV. As FM radio was still burgeoning and not very popular, it served as a simulcast outlet of its AM sister. This arrangement continued until the stations were sold in 1971 to the Jonel Construction Company (dba Cover Broadcasting). Shortly afterwards, the call letters for the AM station and the TV station were changed to WJNL, and the new owners were granted a construction permit to move WARD-FM to 96.5, which allowed a power increase to 50,000 watts. For this to happen, WARD-FM at 92.1 had to be closed with a dark license until a new owner could be found, as licensees at that time were forbidden to own more than a single AM and a single FM in one market. WJNL-FM 96.5 then signed on the air in 1973, and 92.1 went silent in 1972. =As WAAT= The license for 92.1 was acquired in 1973 by Community Broadcasters, which signed the station back on in September of the following year under the call letters WAAT, and under a religion-based format. The station's facilities moved from Franklin Street to Locust Street in Johnstown. W. Ronald Smith served as the company's president. This incarnation of the station lasted less than two years. =As WFMM= WAAT was sold August 23, 1976 to William C. Bland, owner of the Bland Group, which also owned WNCC in Barnesboro, about a half hour north of Johnstown. The call letters were switched to WFMM and the studios moved to 634 Main Street, and an easy listening format was adopted. Ownership would change again by the end of the decade. =As WGLU= WFMM was sold again on August 29, 1980 to Conemaugh Communications Corporation, a local company headed by Fred Glosser, whose family owned the Gee Bee discount department store chain. The studios were moved to 516 Main Street, and the call letters were switched to WGLU, with the format moving from easy listening to album rock. The station began to call itself \\"Glu 92\\", increased its power and embarked on a heavy advertising campaign. Towards the mid-’80s, WGLU started including more Top 40 tracks in its music rotation. In August 1987, WGLU was sold to PAC Media, a company headed by Warren S. Diggins. One month later, the rock format was abandoned. Targeting younger listeners, WGLU became \\"Power 92\\", keeping the same call letters for the newly created Top 40 format. =Changes since 2000= On July 31, 2000, WGLU and sister station WQWK licensed out of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania swapped frequencies. WQWK prior to this flip was an active rock station programmed out of State College, Pennsylvania known as \\"QWK Rock\\". WQWK became \\"92.1 The Rock\\" and WGLU adjusted its name to include the entire frequency \\"Power 99.1\\" however still kept the heritage calls. In November 2000, Dame Broadcasting of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania acquired WSRA Central City, Pennsylvania and WYSN Somerset, Pennsylvania. WSRA soon stunted a format change with all-Christmas music through the new year. In January 2001 the call letters were traded for WCCL and the AC to Christmas format was switched for Oldies. WYSN continued with News/Talk as their format through the transition. In March 2005, Dame Broadcasting sold all four properties to 2510 Associates out of Pittsburgh. Changes quickly occurred for \\"Power 99.1\\" the following Monday morning (three business days after the sale closed) they went on the air as \\"Hot 99\\" with the same air staff and format. WPRR in Altoona, \\"Hot 100\\" at the time began a simulcast of the \\"Hot Morning Show\\" with Jonathan Reed & Amy Wright from \\"Hot 99\\" each morning from 5:30am to 9am. Both stations shortly after the sale gave up their calls for new call letters to fit the HOT moniker, WYOT, Johnstown & WWOT, Altoona. The WPRR call letters were salvaged for a sister 2510 Associate station. Within a few months WYOT \\"Hot 99\\" & WQWK \\"The Rock\\" were sold from 2510 Associates to Forever Broadcasting, Inc. WQWK forfeited its call letters and moniker \\"92.1 The Rock\\" to become WRKW \\"Rocky 92\\". After being under the rein of Forever Broadcasting for a few months WYOT and WRKW flipped frequencies yet again to become \\"Rocky 99\\" and \\"Hot 92\\" respectively. Within a few more months of that change WYOT \\"Hot 92\\" would go through another call letter switch, acquiring new calls from former Top 40 sister station in State College (that was taken off the air \\"Hot 103\\"). WJHT became the new call sign for \\"Hot 92\\". In the coming months WWOT lost a few employees and decided to extend the simulcast from just morning drive to cover most of the day, 5am to 6pm and most weekend shifts. This prompted the station to re-image itself as \\"Hot 92 & Hot 100\\". Nights remained separate shows hosted by Chad Bennett on WJHT and Rob Z on WWOT. In March 2008, Mitch Edwards, program director of WJHT for eight years and a staple to the station for more than a decade, left for sister station WFGI \\"Froggy 95\\" as co-host of the Morning Splash with Niki Wild. This move also encouraged Forever Broadcasting to make WJHT and WWOT a complete simulcast. Eliminating the dual night show split to being broadcast from the WJHT studio with Bennett as the host and replacing Edwards vacant position with Forever Broadcasting Altoona employee Paige Foxx. Hot 92 and Hot 100 end their simulcast The station went through a variety of DJ and programming changes until they split their simulcast in September 2014. Altoona DJs stayed on Hot 100 and Johnstown DJs stayed on Hot 92. The stations became two separate stations again. Streaming is also available online for both stations. The WJHT Callsign At one time, the WJHT callsign was used in Bayonne, New Jersey, and in State College, Pennsylvania, under two radio frequencies, the first under 107.9 under the moniker Hot 107.9 and the second under 103.1 under the moniker Hot 103.1.

Style Releases including \\"Para Vigo me voy\\" often label the song as a \\"conga\\", or occasionally a \\"rumba\\". Thus, it is considered an early example of a \\"salon conga\\" or \\"ballroom conga\\", in the same vein as the famous \\"ballroom rumbas\\" such as \\"The Peanut Vendor\\" (\\"El manisero\\"). According to musicologist Alberto Pérez Perazzo, \\"Para Vigo me voy\\" is one of the first popular songs with a true conga rhythm. Recordings One of the earliest recordings of \\"Para Vigo me voy\\" was made by Xavier Cugat and his orchestra featuring vocalist Desi Arnaz in December 1935 for Victor. Cugat re-recorded the song in 1945.

The western terminus of the route was at U.S. Route 127 approximately north of Greenville. Its eastern terminus was at a T-intersection with SR 121 adjacent to Darke County Airport about southwest of Versailles. Created in the middle of the 1920s, SR 242 ran through very flat farm country in the northeastern portion of Darke County. The highway abutted the western and northern edges of Darke County Airport along the way. The entire route was turned over to county and township control around 2013 in conjunction with a plan to extend the runway of the Darke County Airport. Route description SR 242 was nestled entirely within the northeastern quadrant of Darke County. The route was not inclusive in the National Highway System. The route began at the rural Richland Township intersection of US 127 and Reed Road. The vast majority of the state highway passed through farmland, with the occasional home appearing along the way. Heading due east from the U.S. Route 127 intersection, SR 242 immediately intersected Greenville-St. Marys Road, then proceeded among the vastness of crops, meeting Schroder Road and Younker Road en route before arriving at the Horner Road intersection. Here, SR 242 turned north onto the alignment of Horner Road, with the road continuing east from the intersection being Chase Road. As it headed northward, the route traveled along the western edge of Darke County Airport. The state route next arrived at its intersection with Plessinger Road. At this point, SR 242 turned east again, with the road heading north from this intersection becoming known as Shaffer Road. Running due east along the north side of the county airport, the route entered Wayne Township prior to arriving at its endpoint at its junction with SR 121, where the intersecting state highway forms the southern and eastern legs of the T-intersection. History SR 242 was first designated in 1924 replacing what was then designated SR 199. The highway was assigned to the routing that it occupied throughout its entire nine-decade history. The entire route was asphalt-paved by 1939. In 2012, the Darke County Airport proposed expanding its one runway to the west. With the expansion, the north-south segment of SR 242 would have to be removed. As one of the shortest state highways in the state, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) proposed abandoning the entire route with jurisdiction of the road being transferred to Darke County and the two townships through which the route traveled. Earlier proposals for the route included ODOT taking over the entire length of Chase Road (which runs along the southern edge of the airport) to SR 121. ODOT gave up control of the route in 2013 with the portion from US 127 to Horner Road becoming Darke County Route 242 and the remainder becoming maintained by Richland and Wayne Townships. For the maintenance of the road, ODOT also gave to the Darke County Engineer.

This plant has edible fruit, which are also used for biodiesel production. This plant is cited in Flora Brasiliensis by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. This species is native to the Amazonian region, possibly to the state of Pará, where it has its center of distribution, and reaches French Guiana and Suriname. It is a characteristic palm of terra firme, low vegetation cover, or even open fields. The tree is in height and regenerates easily by growing multiple stems. The tucumã palm is considered a pioneer plant of aggressive growth, has the ability to grow new shoots after a fire, and mainly inhabits secondary forests and pastures. Seeds take up to two years to germinate, the plants grow slowly in cultivation, and start to produce fruits after eight years. Its resistance to diseases and high productivity make this species an alternative for the production of biodiesel, since the operating costs of an orderly plantation is much less than that of the oil palm.Morais, Luiz Roberto Barbosa Química de oleaginosas : valorização da biodiversidade amazônica = Chemistry of vegetable oils : valorization of the amazon biodiversity. — Belém, PA : Ed. do Autor, 2012. — (Oleaginosas). CDD-633.850981 The seed is covered externally with an orange oily pulp. On average, the fruit weighs about ; 34% of this weight corresponds to the external pulp that has 14% to 16% of the oil when it is raw. A mature tree can produce up to of fruits per year, which corresponds to of pulp oil and of seed oil. In one hectare, 400 palm clusters can be planted, each cluster with three trunks. In total, this equals 1200 palm trunks and will result in 4.8 tons of fatty material per hectare. It forms clusters that do not need to be replanted. Oil The fruit is composed of a woody core almost black in color, containing a white almond paste, oilseed, very hard and covered with a yellow-orange pulp, little consistency and oily. Two types of oils are produced by this fruit: the oil of external pulp and almond oil.PESCE, Celestino. Oleaginosas da Amazônia. –Belém: Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, 2009.334 p.: il. (MPEG) e 978-85-60548-39-2 (MDA). Cuisine In French Guiana, at Easter, Guianans eat a traditional dish made with awara dough called Awara broth. The tucum ring The seed in the fruit is notably used by indigenous Amazonians to make black rings. In the 1800s, this ring was used as a symbol of marriage for the slaves and natives, who could not afford to purchase gold. In addition, the ring was also a symbol of friendship and of resistance to the established order – the freedom fighters. Now these rings are worn by Catholic missionaries as a symbol of solidarity with the poor and support in the struggle for equality, social justice and human rights.Story of the Tucum ring « Brazil 'O Anel De Tucum' (1994) Conrado Berning, 70 mins in Português,Verbo FilmesEneida Duarte Gaspar 'O Caminho da cruz' 2001 ()en.tucum.org - Ceará’s Community Tourism Network receives the To Do!

Norsborg consists of the residential areas Hallunda, Eriksberg and Slagsta. Norsborg and Hallunda are contiguous suburbs. History Norsborg was previously a country estate in the Botkyrka parish, situated on a bay of Vårbyfjärden and with some of the property facing Bornsjön, as well as Kärsby and Tomtberga with an area of 350 hectares. The area, which was originally called Borg and was part of the village of Hundhamra, but in the late 1700s the property was named Norsborg after the owner Count Johan Liljencrantz's wife Eleonora Stjernstedt. Liljencrantz also owned Sturehov, Slagsta farm and Fittja in the same parish and had Norsborg's manor built. From his time a significant part of the garden and the large English-style park originate with a gazebo by Olof Tempelman and a view tower that long adorned Norsborg. Norsborg was purchased in 1900 for SEK 185,000 by the City of Stockholm for its water pipeline from Bornsjön. The city built their the main station of the management, Norsborg waterworks, with filtration basins, pumping stations, electricity plants, residential buildings and more, and in 1912 the city council decided to place the entire water main plant there. The waterworks has a yearly capacity of 80,000,000 m³ of drinking water and is the largest fresh water plant serving Stockholm. Modern development The area consists largely of high-rise areas built under the Million Programme and several are located near the E4 / E20 motorway, but the development also includes a large area with townhouses and semi-detached houses, which are characterized by well-preserved nature areas. There are also several churches in the area. The population is about 17,000 people, of which 81.2 per cent with foreign background in 2017. According to police, Norsborg is a problem area from a crime point of view, which is classified as a particularly vulnerable area. Norsborg has the south-western terminus of the Stockholm metro system's red line. It was opened in 1975 and is the westernmost of all Stockholm metro stations.

Description Unlike other Japanese Elms, the growth habit of 'Discovery' is symmetrical, upright, and vase-shaped. The leaves are obovate to oval, and slightly smaller than is typical of the species, their colour dark green turning yellow in autumn. The tree grows to over 15 m in height, with a spread of much the same dimension. Pests and diseases The tree is resistant to Dutch elm disease and elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola. Cultivation 'Discovery' performed very poorly in government trials in Alberta, Canada, failing completely at five out of six sites. Moreover, the survivors developed a very poor branching pattern requiring pruning to strengthen crotches. 'Discovery' fared better in trials conducted by the University of Minnesota, which considered it \\"quite hardy\\", but the tree was criticized for its comparatively slow growth and need for continued crown thinning when young, the latter factor largely disqualifying it as a street tree.Giblin, C.

Early life Virginia was born on January 2, 1875, in San Francisco, California. She was the daughter of James Graham Fair (1831–1894) and his wife, Theresa Rooney (1838–1891). Her parents divorced when she was six. She was known throughout her life as \\"Birdie\\". She had three siblings, Theresa Fair Oelrichs, James Fair Jr. (1861–1892), and Charles Lewis Fair (1867–1902). Her father, James Graham Fair, was an Irish immigrant who made a fortune from mining the Comstock Lode and the Big Bonanza mine in Virginia City and Carson City, Nevada respectively. A United States Senator from Nevada from 1881 to 1887, James Graham Fair died in 1894, leaving his daughter a fortune. Society life In 1899, Birdie Vanderbilt and her sister Theresa \\"Tessie\\" Fair Oelrichs built the Rosecliff mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1902, the sisters began construction of the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco but sold their interests in 1906, days before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. However, following the death of her husband, Tessie Fair Oelrichs repurchased the property in 1908, retaining ownership until 1924. In 1910, Birdie set up the Virginia Fair Legacy Fund that rebuilt and endowed the Holy Family Day Home, a Roman Catholic school residence for children in San Francisco that had been damaged by the 1906 earthquake. Birdie Vanderbilt also spent considerable time in Paris, France, where tragedy struck in 1902 when her brother Charles and his wife were killed in an automobile accident. In 1920, her estranged husband, who also maintained a home in the Parisian suburb of Passy, inherited the Haras du Quesnay Thoroughbred breeding farm and racing stable near Deauville in France's famous horse region of Lower Normandy. Interested in horse racing herself, Birdie established her own racing stable in the United States. Named Fair Stable, she met with great success with the Thoroughbred Sarazen, who earned back-to-back U.S. Horse of the Year honors in 1924 and 1925 and would be inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In 1933, tragedy struck her family again when her 26-year-old son, William Kissam Vanderbilt III, was killed in an automobile accident in South Carolina while driving home to New York City from his father's Florida estate. Personal life Virginia wading in the water at Bailey's Beach On March 26, 1899, Virginia Graham Fair married William Kissam Vanderbilt II, a sportsman and president of the New York Central Railroad. They spent their honeymoon at the Idle Hour estate but disaster struck when fire broke out and the mansion burned to the ground. They settled in a mansion at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City and before their separation and divorce: * Muriel Vanderbilt (1900–1972), who married three times, the first in 1925 to Frederic Cameron Church, Jr. She later married Henry Delafield Phelps in 1931. They divorced in 1936, and in 1944 she married John Payson Adams. * Consuelo Vanderbilt (1903–2011), who first married Earl E. T. Smith (1903–1991), the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, in 1926. They divorced in 1935 and she was married to Henry Gassaway Davis III, who was recently divorced from her cousin, Grace Vanderbilt. They divorced in 1940 and she married William John Warburton in 1941. They divorced in 1946 and in 1951, she married Noble Clarkson Earl, Jr. (1900–1969). * William Kissam Vanderbilt III (1907–1933), who inherited his father's love of fast cars and exotic travel was killed in an automobile accident in South Carolina while driving home to New York City from his father's Florida estate. The couple separated around 1909, but because she was a devout Roman Catholic and they had been married by the Church, they did not formally divorce until 1927, when her husband wanted to remarry. After their separation, she continued to use the Vanderbilt name but also did much under her maiden name. She began dividing her time between homes in Manhattan, Jericho, Long Island, and in her native California. Her mansion at 60 East 93rd Street later became the Permanent Mission of Romania to the United Nations, then part of the Lycée Français de New York until 2000, when it was sold to be converted back to a private residence. She died in Manhattan from pneumonia on July 7, 1935. She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

Approaching the Darrtown Road intersection, SR 130 begins to trend more southeasterly. Beyond Darrtown Road, SR 130 continues as such through where it meets Morman Road. At Krucker Road, SR 130 starts to resume a more easterly path. The number of homes that appear along SR 130 starts to increase as the route passes by intersections with Boyle Road and Vizedom Road, and closes in on Hamilton. SR 130, now serving a primarily residential vicinity, rounds some gentle curves, but maintains a generally easterly path as it nears its terminus. Just barely sneaking into the northwestern corner of the City of Hamilton, SR 130 comes to an end as it meets SR 177 at a signalized intersection. History In 1923, what is now SR 130 was part of then SR 126, which included the entirety of the current SR 130 and the portion of the current US 27 from SR 130 to the Indiana state line at College Corner. In 1927, the SR 126 designation was moved to another routing farther south, and SR 130 came into being along the routing that it occupies today. The entire route was paved in 1932.

Description Astrocaryum is a genus of spiny palms with pinnately compound leaves–rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern. Some species are single-stemmed, while others grow in multi-stemmed (caespitose) clumps. They are pleonanthic—they flower repeatedly over the course of their lifespan—and monoecious, meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers.

Plass, James Rodger Fleming, and Gavin Schmidt, Carbon Dioxide and the Climate, American Scientist, 98(1) 58-62. An abridged reprint of Plass's 1959 Scientific American paper with commentary by Fleming and Schmidt Biography Plass worked most of his life as a physicist in the United States. He graduated from Harvard University in 1941 and earned a PhD in physics from Princeton University in 1947. He worked as an associate physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory (Manhattan District) of the University of Chicago from 1942 to 1945. He became an instructor of physics at Johns Hopkins University in 1946, and eventually became an associate professor there. In 1955, leaving academia, he held a job for a year as a staff scientist with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. He then joined the advanced research staff at the Aeronutronic division of the Ford Motor Company. In 1960, he became manager of the research lab at Ford’s theoretical physics department and a consulting editor of the journal Infrared Physics (now called Infrared Physics and Technology). In 1963, he accepted a position as the first professor of atmospheric and space science at the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (now The University of Texas at Dallas), where he remained for five years. In 1968, he arrived at Texas A&M; University, where he served as professor of physics and head of the department. =Carbon dioxide research= In 1953 Plass told Time magazine of his work on the effects of from industrial sources as a greenhouse gas, and the potential implications of an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for global warming. He said, \\"At its present rate of increase, the in the atmosphere will raise the earth's average temperature 1.5° Fahrenheit every 100 years. ... for centuries to come, if man's industrial growth continues, the earth's climate will continue to grow warmer.\\" The award-winning short film \\"Invisible Blanket\\" (2018) was based on Plass' article in Time. From 1956 onwards, Plass published a series of papers on the topic, partly based on advanced calculations of the absorption of infrared radiation, and he made use of early electronic computers. He predicted that a doubling of would warm the planet by 3.6 °C, that levels in 2000 would be 30% higher than in 1900 and that the planet would be about 1 °C warmer in 2000 than in 1900. In 2007 the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report estimated a climate sensitivity of 2 to 4.5 °C for doubling, a rise of 37% since pre-industrial times and a 1900-2000 warm-up of around 0.7 °C.Forum on Plass's predictions at Realclimate.org Nathaniel Rich recognizes Plass in his 2019 bestseller Losing Earth.Quotation (p. 189): In 1953, [...] Plass [..] had found that fossil fuels might already have warmed Earth by 1 degree Celsius. Worth was yet to come, Plass predicted. =Other work= Plass was an avid philatelist, and founded the United States Possessions Philatelic Society in 1978. He then served as the editor of their journal, Possessions, for 14 years. He also hosted a classical-music oriented radio program called Collector's Choice on KAMU-FM for many years.

The estate covers about of land. Following Escobar's death in 1993, many of the original buildings on the property were demolished or reconditioned for other uses. History Main entrance Popular waterslides at the amusement park Hacienda Nápoles private bullring The estate included a Spanish colonial house, a sculpture park, and a complete zoo that included many kinds of animals from different continents such as antelope, elephants, exotic birds, giraffes, hippopotamuses, ostriches, and ponies. The ranch also boasted a large collection of old and luxury cars and bikes, a private airport, a bullring, and even a kart-racing track. Mounted atop the hacienda's entrance gate is a replica of the Piper PA-18 Super Cub airplane (tail number HK-617-P) . After Escobar was shot and killed by Colombian police in 1993, his family entered a legal struggle with the Colombian government over the property. The government prevailed, and the neglected property is now managed by the Municipality of Puerto Triunfo. The cost of maintenance for the zoo and the animals was too expensive for the government, so it was decided that most of the animals would be donated to Colombian and international zoos. Other original features include dinosaur statues built with bones in a section of the estate, along with prehistoric animal statues (such as the mammoth) that children can climb and play on, as well as decommissioned military vehicles and a giant hand sculpture. By November 2006, ownership of the property had passed to the Colombian government and was valued at 5 billion Colombian pesos (approximately $2.23 million). The hacienda's zoo as of February 2019 hosts bison, a rare goat, one ostrich, and zebras. Escobar's hippopotamuses have escaped and become feral, living in at least four lakes in the area and spreading into neighbouring rivers. Contact between the hippos and local fishermen have led to calls for the hippo population to be culled. By 2011, there were at least 30 animals roaming wild in the countryside; the large number of hippos makes it difficult to find zoos into which they can be resettled. There are also reportedly 40 hippopotamuses living on the grounds of the hacienda itself; as of June 2014, the park's mascot, a live female hippo named Vanessa (who responds to her name), remains at the site. In 2014, a \\"Jurassic Park\\"-style African theme park was operating on the grounds, which have been rented by a private company. \\"Parque Temático Hacienda Nápoles\\" comes complete with a water park, a guided safari attraction, aquariums, and a replica of the caves in Colombia's Cueva de los Guácharos National Park. In December 2018, a day ticket to the park cost 42,000 pesos (around $15). The Escobar museum, his burned private car collection, and the abandoned \\"ruins\\" of his house are still publicly accessible, but are reported to have collapsed in February 2015.http://www.elcolombiano.com/antioquia/la-mansion-de-pablo- escobar-en-la-hacienda-napoles-se-desplomo-CX1220664 Escobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at Hacienda Nápoles. They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's death, and hence left on the untended estate. By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River. The National Geographic Channel produced a documentary about them titled Cocaine Hippos. A report published in a Yale student magazine noted that local environmentalists are campaigning to protect the animals, although there is no clear plan for what will happen to them. In 2018, National Geographic published another article on the hippos which found disagreement among environmentalists on whether they were having a positive or negative impact, but that conservationists and locals - particularly those in the tourism industry - were mostly in support of their continued presence.

(Top left button shows crazing resulting from button having been heated during washing.) Chemical reaction of two proteins (top) with formaldehyde (H2CO) – schematic presentation. Galalith (Erinoid in the United Kingdom) is a synthetic plastic material manufactured by the interaction of casein and formaldehyde. The commercial name is derived from the Greek words gala (milk) and lithos (stone). It is odourless, insoluble in water, biodegradable, non-allergenic, antistatic and virtually nonflammable. It was produced under other names such as aladdinite (in the US), Casolith (in the Netherlands) and lactoloid (in Japan). Discovery In 1893, French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde. In 1897, Wilhelm Krische, a printer from Hanover, was commissioned to develop white, non-flammable, erasable chalkboards. He had difficulty in making the casein adhere to the supporting cardboard, and asked German chemist (Friedrich) Adolph Spitteler (1846–1940) for help. The resultant horn-like plastic was unsuitable for the original purpose, but other applications were soon found. Production and usage Galalith could not be moulded once set, so it had to be produced in sheets, but it had the advantage that it was inexpensive to produce. It could be cut, drilled, embossed and dyed without difficulty, and its structure could be manipulated to create a range of effects. One limitation on the uses of Galalith was that when made into items above a certain size it tended to splinter or warp. No other plastic at the time could compete on price, however, and with ivory, horn and bone products becoming far more expensive, it found a natural home in the fashion industry. This new plastic was presented at Paris Universal Exhibition in 1900. In France, Galalith was distributed by the Compagnie Française de Galalithe located near Paris in Levallois-Perret. As a result, the Jura area became the first to use the material. Galalith was marketed in boards, pipes and rods. In 1913, thirty million litres (eight million US gallons) of milk were used to produce Galalith in Germany alone. In 1914, Syrolit Ltd gained the license for manufacture in the United Kingdom. Renaming itself Erinoid Ltd., it started manufacture in the former Lightpill wool mill in Dudbridge, Stroud, Gloucestershire. Casein from rennet produces a superior plastic to acid-precipitated casein. Galalith could produce gemstone imitations that looked strikingly real. In 1926, Gabrielle \\"Coco\\" Chanel published a picture of a short, simple black dress in Vogue. It was calf-length, straight, and decorated only by a few diagonal lines. Vogue called it \\"Chanel's Ford\\", as like the Model T, the little black dress was simple and accessible for women of all social classes. To accessorize the little black dress, Chanel revamped her designs, thus facilitating the breakthrough and mass popularity of costume jewelry. Galalith was used for striking Art Deco jewelry designs by artists such as Jacob Bengel and Auguste Bonaz, as well as for hair combs and accessories. By the 1930s, Galalith was also used for knitting needles, pens, umbrella handles, white piano keys (replacing natural ivory), and electrical goods, with world production at that time reaching 10,000 tons.  Modern use  Although Galalith was historically cheap, the fact it could not be moulded led to its demise by commercial end users. Production slowed as the restrictions of World War II led to a need for milk as a food, and due to new oil-derived wartime plastic developments. Production continued in Brazil until the 1960s. Nowadays Galalith still continues to be produced in small quantities, mainly for buttons.

Tea production  A tea garden A religious spot Tea production in Ilam (as Nepal tea) started as early as 1863, when the Chinese government offered then Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana tea saplings that were then planted in Ilam. In 1868, the Ilam tea factory was established, and tea plantations covered over 135 acres of land. In 2010, the tea factory was privatized, and is currently not under operation. However, tea production continues in Ilam in other forms. Many local people gets employment from this. In 2010, the total tea production of Nepal is 16.23 million kilograms per annum; a majority of this amount is produced in Ilam itself As well as the organic tea transport the foreign country Economy Chhurpi production in Ilam New Hotels are being opened in Ilam for tourism. Ilam is known for its six \\"A\\"s: are Alu (Potato), Alan (Milk), Alainchi (Cardamom), Aduwa (Ginger), Amriso (Broom Grass), and Akabare khursani (Round Chillies), etc. although tea, bamboo, flowers and silk are also produced in Ilam. Agricultural commodities helps to increase the Agricultural Gross Development Product. Beside these, the tourism sector also contributes in the economy of Ilam.

The river is bridged by Maine State Route 35 between Standish and Windham, near North Windham, by the North Gorham to Windham Center road between Gorham and Windham, by the Maine Central Railroad Mountain Division between North Windham and South Windham, and by U.S. Route 202 in South Windham. The river is bridged again by the Maine Central Mountain Division in Westbrook and by U.S. Route 302 at Riverton between Westbrook and Portland. In Falmouth the river is bridged by the former Interstate 495, (now route 295); concurrent Maine State Routes 26 and 100, Interstate 95, Maine State Route 9, the Maine Central Railroad, Interstate 295, the Grand Trunk Railway, and U.S. Route 1.DeLorme, p.5 Sources The Sebago Lake drainage basin includes the Crooked River draining Songo Pond south of Bethel, and the Bear River from Waterford through Long Lake. The basin is between the Saco River drainage basin to the west and the Androscoggin River drainage basin to the north and east. In addition to Sebago Lake's being its primary source, four significant tributaries of the river are the Pleasant River from Gray through Windham, the Little River from Buxton through Gorham, Mill Brook in Westbrook (which is an outlet of Highland Lake in Windham), and the Piscataqua River in Falmouth (which is an outlet of Forest Lake in Cumberland). An East Branch Piscataqua River flows separately into the Presumpscot main stem. The Presumpscot River drainage basin south of Sebago Lake is between the Royal River drainage basin to the east, and the Saco River and Stroudwater River drainage basins to the west and south, respectively. Little Sebago Lake originally drained westerly into Sebago Lake through Boody Meadow and Outlet Brook. An artificial outlet was constructed through a moraine at the south end of Little Sebago Lake as an early 19th-century water power diversion to the Pleasant River via Ditch Brook. On 4 June 1814, the diversion became enlarged by erosion as the lake level dropped within a few hours, draining great quantities of water into the Pleasant River. The resulting flood swept away two mills and six bridges along the Pleasant and Presumpscot rivers as far downstream as South Windham.Varney, George J. A Gazetteer of the State of Maine (1886) B.B. Russell, Boston The erosion scar is bridged today by Maine State Route 115 east of North Windham. The level of Little Sebago Lake was partially restored by construction of a dam which failed with similar downstream damage on 7 May 1861, and has been subsequently rebuilt.Smith, Thomas Lauren History - Town of Windham (1873) Hoyt & Fogg, Portland Early industrial development Sawmills were built on the river during the 1660s. The first Maine paper mill was built on the river at Falmouth in 1731 by General Samuel Waldo. Canal The river was an early transportation corridor between Casco Bay and Sebago Lake. A series of dams and locks were completed in 1830 to form the Cumberland and Oxford Canal.Ward, p.8 The canal operated until replaced by the Portland and Ogdensburg Railway in 1870. The canal lock system provided elevation control of the surface area of Sebago Lake as a reservoir for water-powered mills along the river. The S. D. Warren Paper Mill in Westbrook vied with the Oriental Powder Company in Gorham and Windham to control water flow after the canal ceased operation of the locks. The paper mill exercised control for more than half a century after the gunpowder factory closed in 1905. Dams There are eight dams impeding the flow of the river as it makes its way to the ocean, some of which produce hydroelectric power. These dams are the Eel Weir Dam, North Gorham Dam, Dundee Dam, Gambo Dam, Little Falls Dam, Mallison Dam, Sacarappa Dam, and Cumberland Mills Dam. Since the removal of the Smelt Hill Dam in Falmouth in 2002, the last of the river after the Cumberland Mills Dam now flow unimpeded to the ocean. Conservation The Presumpscot River Preserve, a 48-acre nature preserve, is located in North Deering alongside the Presumpscot River. It was purchased and preserved in 2001 by the Land for Maine's Future program as well as the City Land Bank Commission and Portland Trails. In August 2014, Portland Trails preserved 20 acres of land in the Presumpscot River estuary in Falmouth around Mile Pond.

The genus name Acanthocephala means \\"spiny head\\" and comes from the pointed tylus at the tip of the head. Acanthocephala femorata is found in the continental United States and Mexico. This insect is considered a pest, eating and causing damage to citrus and roses. The lower rear legs are wider than the upper legs, with serrations. This is especially pronounced in the male. It has long, slim, curving antennae with distinctive orange tips. The body is reddish brown to nearly black. They have a number of predators and therefore biological control is generally enough to prevent their populations from going out of control. Many do not make it past the larval stage; parasitic flies often lay their eggs within the developing larvae, paralyzing them. They are also eaten by birds and assassin bugs.

North Lake Park is on its southern side.  History  The lake area was once a large bowl-like valley that was used for farming. Construction on North Lake Dam began in 1956 and the dam was complete in August 1957. Many of the trees where the lake was to be built were cut down, although a few small structures still exist. The reservoir was designed as a cooling reservoir for a Dallas Power and Light Company electric power plant. At that time, the City of Dallas, Texas annexed the land around the power plant and the lake. In 1978, the lake began to be used for fishing as well. Fish did not survive well due to low nutrient levels, so in 1978 the Dallas Parks and Recreation Department began fertilizing the water and stocking it with bass. The City of Irving, Texas leased land south of the lake as a park in the 1980s and 1990s. North Lake Park was popular with personal watercraft enthusiasts and provided a runway for radio-controlled aircraft. The owner of the lake, power company TXU, turned down offers in 2000 to sell the land to the cities of Coppell, Texas or Irving, Texas. Irving and Coppell were not willing to fund permanent facilities for the park as TXU granted access to the land only on a short-term lease.Coppell City Manager Jim Witt, Coppell City Council meeting minutes, January 14, 2001 The park closed in 2000, ending all recreational use of the lake. The lake was thought to be closed because of a high concentration of amoebas from the temperature of the plant's water output. A small dock and personal watercraft holding area were present in the fifth cove down. Development Controversy The Billingsley Company, a Texas land developer, purchased land south of the lake in 2004. Lucy Billingsley, daughter of Trammell Crow, announced her intention to build up to 10,000 living units on the land. The area is officially in the city of Dallas but is part of the Coppell Independent School District. Officials in Coppell, Texas and Irving, Texas strongly opposed the plan due to increased automobile traffic and the costs of building and maintaining new schools. After three years of litigation, the parties reached a settlement in 2008 that will allow development on the land.http://www.ci.coppell.tx.us/c2/content.nsf/site/4%3BDepartments%20and%20Services%3BCity%20Manager's%20Office%3B%3BNorth%20Lake%20Development?opendocument Coppell residents approved a bond measure in 2007, part of which would be used to fund the construction of new schools. The Subprime mortgage crisis will likely postpone Billingsley's plans to develop the land until 2013.http://www.coppellisd.com/15161081771115433/site/default.asp? The lake is slowly being drained to about 13 feet deep, and the lake will be dredged as well as altered to meet the plan requirements if it is approved. Currently, the trees around the lake are being cut down. Dam and reservoir North Lake has an embankment dam, which overflows to a chute spillway. The dam had a leak in the North-east part of the dam, which was later patched. Coppell is lowering the water level, which will permanently stay at about 13 feet after 2012. Behind the dam is a low swamp area and a new residential development zone. Islands and water Several islands are located on the lake, however, most of them are submerged at the regular pool level. The largest island, which is above water, has a shoreline of about 325 feet. The bottom of the lake is generally sandy, with some occasional mud. When the park was opened, a large floating water ski ramp was placed in the center of the lake. Several no-ski buoys were placed in the south-west cove because the shallow depth of the cove presented a safety hazard. Some vegetation has been known to be present, although not enough to sustain fish. Coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum) was present at one time, but the sandy bottom made it hard for it to survive. The lake is fed by rain and run-off through the shallow valleys, but mostly by Grapevine Creek, a small stream nearly always flowing into the lake. The stream is located in the south-western cove. The only boat ramp on the lake is on a small road facing Belt Line Rd. The boat ramp had to be discontinued because of the uneven surface of ground it was on and the unstable ground around it.

This happened in a period of truce after the end of the Irish War of Independence (in July 1921) and before the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in June 1922. All the dead and missing were Protestants,Coogan, p. 359, Hart, pp. 282-85. which has led to the killings being described as sectarian. Six were killed as purported British informers and loyalists,Meda Ryan, pp. 211-13 while four others were relatives killed in the absence of the target. Three other men were kidnapped and executed in Bandon as revenge for the killing of an IRA officer Michael O'Neill during an armed raid. One man was shot and survived his injuries.Ryan, pp. 211–13. It is not clear who ordered the attacks or carried them out.Ryan, pp. 153-55.Hart, pp. 113, 277. However, in 2014 the Irish Times released a confidential memo from the then- Director of Intelligence Colonel Michael Joe Costello (later managing director of the Irish Sugar Company) in September 1925 in relation to a pension claim by former Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer Daniel O'Neill of Enniskean, County Cork, stating: \\"O'Neill is stated to be a very unscrupulous individual and to have taken part in such operations as lotting [looting] of Post Offices, robbing of Postmen and the murder of several Protestants in West Cork in May 1922. A brother of his was shot dead by two of the latter named, Woods and Hornbrooke [sic], who were subsequently murdered.\\"\\"Intimidation and murder of Protestants by elements of the IRA\\", irishtimes.com; accessed 19 August 2014. Sinn Féin and IRA representatives, from both the pro-Treaty side, which controlled the Provisional Government in Dublin and the anti-Treaty side, which controlled the area the killings took place in, immediately condemned the killings. The motivation of the killers remains unclear. It is generally agreed that they were provoked by the fatal shooting of IRA man Michael O'Neill by a loyalist whose house was being raided on 26 April.New York Times, 28 April 1922, Tim Pat Coogan, Michael Collins, p. 359; Meda Ryan, Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter, p. 158; Peter Cotrell, The Anglo-Irish War, The Troubles of 1913–1922, p. 78; Peter Hart, The IRA and its Enemies, pp. 282-85. Some historians have claimed there were sectarian motives; others claim that those killed were targeted only because they were suspected of having been informers during the Anglo-Irish War, and argue that the dead were associated with the so-called \\"Murragh Loyalist Action Group\\", and that their names may have appeared in captured British military intelligence files which listed \\"helpful citizens\\" during the Anglo-Irish War (1919–1921),Ryan, pp. 212-213, 448.Info re alleged informers in Cork , westcorktimes.com; accessed 19 August 2014. Background =Political context= The Irish War of Independence was brought to an end by negotiations in mid-1921. The truce between British Forces and the IRA came into effect on 11 July 1921, after talks between the British and Irish political leaders.Eoin Neeson, p. 53Michael Hopkinson, Irish War of Independence, p. 196; \\"De Valera agreed to a Truce, the terms were negotiated by Neville Macready on behalf of the British Army and by Robert Barton and Eamon Duggan on behalf of the IRA\\". Under the terms, British units were withdrawn to barracks and their commanders committed to \\"no movements for military purposes\\" and \\"no [use of] secret agents noting descriptions of movements\\". For its part, the IRA agreed that, \\"attacks on Crown forces and civilians [were] to cease\\", and to \\"no interference with British Government or private property\\". The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921, after negotiations between British and Irish leaders. On 7 January the Dáil (Irish Parliament established in January 1919) narrowly accepted the Treaty, by 7 votes. The Dáil was then split into two factions, those who accepted and those who rejected the Treaty.Neeson, pp. 57, 66–67. Under the terms of the treaty, a Provisional Government was set up to transfer power from the British regime to the Irish Free State. British troops began to be withdrawn from the Free State in January 1922, though they retained the option to intervene in Irish affairs should the Treaty be rejected and the Irish Republic re- established.Michael Hopkinson, Green against Green, the Irish Civil War; \\"In April he [Churchill] declared, \\"we shall certainly not able to withdraw our troops from their present positions until we know that the Irish people are going to stand by the Treaty, neither shall we be able to refrain from stating the consequences which would follow the setting up of a Republic.\\" (pp. 52-53) On 26 March 1922, part of the IRA repudiated the authority of the Provisional Government on the basis that it had accepted the Treaty and disestablished the Irish Republic declared in 1919. April saw the first armed clashes between pro and anti-Treaty IRA units, including the anti-Treaty occupation of the Four Courts in Dublin, the killing of a pro-Treaty IRA officer in Athlone (Hopkinson, p. 75), and a gun attack on government buildings in Dublin.Archive, nytimes.com; accessed 19 August 2014. According to historian Michael Hopkinson, \\"the transitional [Free State] government lacked the resources and the necessary acceptance to supply effective government\\".Hopkinson, p. 52. In this situation, some IRA anti-Treaty units continued attacks on the remaining British forces. Between December 1921 and February 1922, there were 80 recorded attacks by IRA elements on the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), leaving 12 dead.Harrington, p. 8. Between January and June 1922, twenty-three RIC men, eight British soldiers and eighteen civilians were killed in West Cork, part of the area which would become the Irish Free State.Paul MacMahon, p. 71. =In County Cork= West Cork, where these killings took place, had been one of the most violent parts of Ireland during the Irish War of Independence.Peter Hart, The IRA and its Enemies, p. 50; \\"Cork [was] by far the most violent county in Ireland\\", with 523 killed and 513 wounded between 1920–1921\\", p. 87. It was the scene of many of the conflict's major actions, such as the Kilmichael and Crossbarry ambushes. It contained a strong Irish Republican Army (IRA) Brigade (the 3rd Cork Brigade) and also a sizeable Protestant population – roughly 16%, some of whom were loyalistsHart, p. 289. and affiliated to a loyalist vigilante group.Ryan, pp. 210-11. The local IRA killed fifteen suspected informers from 1919–21, nine Catholics and six Protestants.Ryan, p. 164. They responded to the British burning of republican homes by burning those of local loyalists.Tom Barry, Guerrilla Days in Ireland, Mercer Press, Cork, 1997, pp. 214, 223-24 British intelligence wrote that \\"many\\" of their informers in West Cork \\"were murdered and almost all the remainder suffered grave material loss\\".Irish Political Review, Vol 20, No. 7, July 2005; , pp. 10-11. Republicans suspected the involvement of a local \\"Loyalists civil wing\\" in the killing of two republicans, the Coffey brothers, in Enniskean in early January 1921. The discovery of documents in Dunmanway by republicans later supposedly confirmed the existence of counter-insurgency espionage in the area, which resulted in many purported informers getting safe passage to England.Ryan, p. 157. British forces were withdrawn from west Cork in February 1922. The only British forces left in the county were two battalions of the British Army in Cork City.Paul McMahon, p. 66. The local IRA was almost unanimously Anti-Treaty and not under the control of the Provisional Government in Dublin in April 1922.Hart, p. 112. At the time of the Dunmanway killings, none of the leaders of the Anti- Treaty Cork IRA were in the county. Tom Hales and Sean Moylan were in Limerick, along with much of the Third and Fourth Cork IRA Brigades, trying to prevent the occupation of that city's military barracks by Pro-Treaty troops.Ryan, p. 154. Tom Barry and Liam Deasy were in Dublin attending an Anti-Treaty IRA meeting. They returned to Cork on 28 April, purportedly with a view to stopping any more killings.Ryan, pp. 160-61. Paul McMahon wrote that the British Government had authorised £2,000 to re-establish intelligence in southern Ireland, especially in Cork, in early April 1922. On 26 April, the day after the raid on Hornibrook home, three British intelligence officers (Lts Hendy, Drove and Henderson) and a driver drove to Macroom with the intention of gathering intelligence in west Cork, where they entered an inn. There, the officers were drugged and taken prisoner by IRA men, taken out the country to Kilgobnet and then shot and their bodies dumped. =In Dunmanway= In Dunmanway itself, a company of the Auxiliary Division evacuated their barracks in the workhouse.Ryan, pp. 154-56. The IRA found confidential documents and a diary they left behind: these included a list of names. The information – according to historian Meda Ryan – was so precise \\"only a very well informed spy system could account for some of the entries in the book\\". Flor Crowley, who analysed the diary, claimed \\"it was the work of a man who had many useful 'contacts' not merely in one part of the area but all over it.\\" The list, however, did not contain any of the names of the murdered Protestants.Ryan, pp. 209-10. The IRA's Third Cork Brigade had killed 15 informers between 1919 and 1921, according to Tom Barry, adding \\"for those who are bigots\\" that the religious breakdown was nine Catholics and six Protestants.Ryan, pp. 164, 219. Ryan writes, by way of justification, that the Auxiliaries' files showed that some Protestants in Murragh had formed a group known as the Loyalist Action Group or Protestant Action Group, affiliated to the Anti-Sinn Féin League and the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. The IRA suspected the group of passing information to British forces during the War of Independence.Ryan, p. 213. These included a Black and Tans military intelligence diary. This diary was reproduced with the names excised in The Southern Star newspaper, from 23 October to 27 November 1971, in consecutive editions. Photographs of the diary were published in The Southern Star, which published them again with another article on the intelligence haul in its Centenary Supplement in 1989. Killings in Ballygroman On 26 April 1922, a group of anti-Treaty IRA men, led by Michael O'Neill, arrived at the house of Thomas Hornibrook, a former magistrate, at Ballygroman, East Muskerry, Desertmore, Bandon (near Ballincollig on the outskirts of Cork City), seeking to seize his car. Hornibrook was in the house at the time along with his son, Samuel, and his nephew, Herbert Woods (a former Captain in the British Army and MC).Ryan, p. 211. O'Neill demanded a part of the engine mechanism (the magneto) that had been removed by Thomas Hornibrook to prevent such theft. Hornibrook refused to give them the part, and after further efforts, some of the IRA party entered through a window. Herbert Woods then shot O'Neill, wounding him fatally. O'Neill's companion, Charlie O'Donoghue, took him to a local priest who pronounced him dead. The next morning O'Donoghue left for Bandon to report the incident to his superiors, returning with \\"four military men\\", meeting with the Hornibrooks and Woods, who admitted to shooting O'Neill.Ryan, pp. 211-12.Coogan (at pg. 359) says this occurred on 25 April. A local jury found Woods responsible and said O'Neill had been \\"brutally murdered in the execution of his duty\\". O'Donoghue and Stephen O'Neill, who were present on the night of the killing, both attended the inquest. Some days later, Woods and both Hornibrook men went missing, and in time were presumed killed.Irish Times, 14 April 1923 and 5 May 1928. The Morning Post newspaper reported that \\"about 100\\" IRA men returned from Bandon with O'Neill's comrades and surrounded the house. It reported that a shootout ensued until the Hornibrooks and Woods ran out of ammunition and surrendered. Meda Ryan claims the report in the Morning Post was \\"exaggerated\\". Peter Hart writes that the Hornibrooks and Woods surrendered on condition their lives be spared. When Woods admitted it was he who fired the shot that killed O'Neill, he was beaten unconscious, and the three hostages were \\"driven south into hill country\\", where they were shot dead.Hart p. 279 Some time later the Hornibrook home was burned, the plantation cut down and the land seized. On 13 April, Michael Collins had complained about British newspaper reports on attacks against Protestants in Ireland to Desmond Fitzgerald. Collins said that while some of the coverage was \\"fair newspaper comment\\", the \\"strain of certain parts is very objectionable\\".Coogan, p. 360. Alice Hodder, a local Protestant from Crosshaven some 23 miles to the south east, wrote to her mother shortly afterwards about Herbert Woods, > His aunt and uncle had been subject to a lot of persecution and feared an > attack, so young Woods went to stay with them. At 2:30 am armed men ... > broke in ... Woods fired on the leader and shot him ... They caught Woods, > tried him by mock court martial and sentenced him to be hanged ... The > brothers of the murdered man then gouged out his eyes while he was alive and > then hanged him ... When will the British Government realise that they are > really dealing with savages and not ordinary normal human beings? The letter was forwarded to Lionel Curtis, Secretary of the Cabinet's Irish Committee, on which he appended the comment \\"this is rather obsolete\\". Matilda Woods later testified before the Grants Committee, while applying for £5,000 compensation in 1927, that her husband had been drawn and quartered before being killed and that the Hornibrooks were taken to a remote location, forced to dig their own graves and shot dead. Both Ryan and Hart note that Matilda Woods was not in Ireland when her husband disappeared and there is no record of his body ever being located.Ryan, p. 447. Killings in Dunmanway, Kinneigh, Ballineen, and Clonakilty Over the next two days, ten Protestant men were shot dead in the Dunmanway, Ballineen and Murragh area. In Dunmanway on 27 April, Francis Fitzmaurice (a solicitor and land agent) was shot dead. That same night, David Gray (a chemist) and James Buttimer (a retired draper) were shot in the doorways of their homes in Dunmanway. The next evening, 28 April, in the parish of Kinneigh, Robert Howe and John Chinnery were both shot dead. In the nearby village of Ballineen, sixteen-year-old Alexander McKinley was shot dead in his home.Hart, pp. 274-75. In Murragh, Reverend Ralph Harbord was shot in the leg but survived; he was the son of Rev. Richard C.M. Harbord, also from the Murragh area, who was the target for his connections to the supposed Loyalist Action Group or Protestant Action Group. Later, west of Ballineen, John Buttimer and his farm employee, Jim Greenfield, were both shot dead.Hart, p. 275. The same night, sixteen-year-old Robert Nagle was shot dead in his home on MacCurtain Hill in Clonakilty, ten miles south. Nagle had been shot in place of his father Thomas, caretaker of the Masonic Hall in Clonakilty whose name was on an IRA list of enemy agents and who had gone into hiding, along with Alexander McKinley's uncle.Hart, pp. 275, 284–86. John Bradfield was shot in place of his brother Henry.Peter Hart, pp. 285-87. Henry Bradfield had been \\"wanted\\" by the IRA for allegedly providing information allegedly leading to IRA \\"arrests, torture and deaths\\". Aftermath According to Niall Harrington – a Pro-Treaty IRA officer at the time – more than 100 Protestant families fled West Cork in the aftermath of the killings.Niall C.

Alice Hodder in the same letter cited above wrote: > For two weeks there wasn't standing room on any of the boats or mail trains > leaving Cork for England. All loyalist refugees who were either fleeing in > terror or had been ordered out of the country ... none of the people who did > these things, though they were reported as the rebel IRA faction, were ever > brought to book by the Provisional Government.Coogan, p. 359 One Cork correspondent for The Irish Times who saw the refugees go through the city noted that, \\"so hurried was their flight that many had neither a handbag nor an overcoat.\\"Irish Times, 1 May 1922, cited in Hart at pg. 277. Hodder reported that Protestants in the area were being forcibly evicted from their farms by republicans on behalf of the Irish Transport Union, on the basis that they were bringing down wages, although she conceded that the local Pro-Treaty IRA reinstated them after it was informed. Tom Hales, Commandant of O'Neill's Brigade (3rd Cork), ordered that all arms be brought under control while issuing a statement promising that \\"all citizens in this area, irrespective of creed or class, every protection within my power.\\"Ryan, p. 215. Arthur Griffith echoed Hales' sentiments, although Hales was actively engaged in armed defiance of Griffith's government at this time. Speaking on 28 April in the Dáil, Griffith, President of the Pro-Treaty Irish Provisional Government, stated: > Events, such as the terrible murders at Dunmanway ..., require the exercise > of the utmost strength and authority of Dáil Éireann. Dáil Éireann, so far > as its powers extend, will uphold, to the fullest extent, the protection of > life and property of all classes and sections of the community. It does not > know and cannot know, as a National Government, any distinction of class or > creed. In its name, I express the horror of the Irish nation at the > Dunmanway murders. Speaking immediately afterward, Seán T. O'Kelly said he wished to associate the \\"anti-treaty side\\" in the Dáil with Griffith's sentiments. Speaking in Mullingar on 30 April, the Anti-Treaty leader Éamon de Valera condemned the killings.Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic, p. 705; reprinted 1999. A general convention of Irish Protestant churches in Dublin released a statement: > Apart from this incident, hostility to Protestants by reason of their > religion, has been almost, if not wholly unknown, in the 26 counties in > which they are a minority. However, a deputation of Irish Protestants who met with Winston Churchill in May 1922 told him there was, \\"nothing to prevent the peasants expropriating [the lands of] every last Protestant loyalist\\" and that they feared a repeat of the massacres that Protestants had suffered in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the 1798 Rebellion. Churchill remarked that the events were \\"little short of a massacre\\".McMahon, pp. 75, 86. The Belfast News-Letter on 28 April under the headline \\"Protestants Slain\\" spoke of \\"ghastly crimes of the night\\" and the existence of an appalling state of affairs in the south and west Cork area \\"where a general massacre of Protestants appears to be in progress\\". The Northern Whig on 1 May wrote that \\"it is a matter of notoriety that the murders, far from being unprecedented, are only the last in a long series which began as far back as 1641.\\"Dennis Kennedy, The Widening Gulf: Northern Attitudes to the independent Irish state 1919–49, pp. 116–17, Blackstaff Press, 1988. Local IRA commanders Tom Barry, Liam Deasy and Seán Moylan, returned to the county and ordered that armed guards be put at the homes of Protestants to prevent further violence. Barry, who had returned immediately from Dublin upon hearing of the killings, ensured that some of those who attempted to take advantage of the situation by stealing livestock owned by Protestants were firmly discouraged.Ryan, p. 217. Responsibility Recent evidence confirms that the killings were carried out by the IRA even if it is not clear who precisely ordered their execution as no member ever claimed responsibility.Hart, p. 282. Historian Peter Hart has written that the killers were identified by several eyewitness sources as local IRA men.Peter Hart, pp. 280-84. Hart concludes that from two to five separate groups must have done the killing, and writes that they were likely \\"acting on their own initiative – but with the connivance or acquiescence of local units\\". Hart's analysis of the identity of the killers has been challenged by other historians, including Rev. Brian Murphy (OSB), Niall Meehan and John Borgonovo.John Borgonovo, Spies informers and the 'Anti-Sinn Féin Society', the Intelligence War in Cork City, 1920–21, Irish Academic Press (2007); , pp. 84-85, 97. Hart reported that Clarina Buttimer, a relative of one of those killed (James Buttimer), based on newspaper reports and her 1927 Irish Grants Committee statement, \\"seem[ed] to have recognised at least one of her husband's attackers\\". Meehan pointed out that these newspapers reported Buttimer as asserting, \\"Though there were a number of men there, she only saw one, whom she did not recognise\\", and that her Grants Committee statement was similar. Meehan claimed that Frank Busteed, the person identified and later omitted without explanation, would have undermined Hart's sectarianism thesis as Busteed, although raised by his Catholic nationalist mother, had a Protestant father. John Borgonovo in Spies, informers and the 'Anti-Sinn Féin Society', the Intelligence War in Cork City, 1920–21, comments that Hart could \\"not offer any evidence of the IRA's motivations\\" for the killings of suspected informers in Cork other than their occupation. Meehan notes Borgonovo's detailed analysis of the IRA in Cork, and that Borgonovo disagreed profoundly with Hart's discounting the IRA's intelligence gathering capability. Borgonovo described it as \\"irresponsible\\" of Hart to discount IRA claims of the Dunmanway victims' guilt in the killing of suspected or known informers without offering an analysis of IRA intelligence-gathering operations.Rev. Brian P. Murphy (OSB) & Niall Meehan, Troubled History: A 10th anniversary critique of The IRA and its Enemies, Aubane Historical Society (2008); , pp. 17, 45, 47. Commenting on Hart's work on the IRA in Cork, he wrote that \\"While Dr. Hart's conclusions can be suspected, I do not believe they can be sufficiently documented.\\" At the time the press, including the Belfast Newsletter (1 May 1922), the Irish Times (29 April 1922),Hart, p. 277 and The New York Times, stated that the killings at Dunmanway were in reprisal for the ongoing killings of Catholics in Belfast,New York Times (May 1922), nytimes.com; accessed 9 July 2014. such as the McMahon and the Arnon Street killings. Tim Pat Coogan suggests that O'Neill's death precipitated the Dunmanway murders. Hart wrote that the killing of O'Neill \\"provided the spark\\" which was inflamed by the \\"Belfast pogroms\\"Hart, p. 291. Ryan wrote \\"The outrages were 'sparked' when Capt. Woods shot IRA man Michael O'Neill in the hallway of Thomas Hornibrooke's house\\".Ryan (2003), p. 158. The motive(s) for the targeting of the victims also remains a point of contention. Niall Meehan and Rev. Brian P. Murphy (OSB) have each written that the victims were killed because they were informers on behalf of Crown forces, citing an intelligence diary left by Auxiliaries as they evacuated Dunmanway, however the diary contains none of the names of the thirteen murdered men.Niall Meehan, \\"After the War of Independence: Some further questions about West Cork, April 27–29, 1922\\", The Irish Political Review, Vol. 23, No. 3, p. 1008. In 2013, that list was located in the Florence Begley collection in the Bureau of Military History.Florence Begley collection in the Bureau of Military History, bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie; accessed 23 August 2014. Hart posits these were primarily revenge killings, perpetrated without a clear rationale by \\"angry and frightened young men acting on impulse\\". He suggests the targets were local Protestant men whose status as enemies in the eyes of the killers was codified in \\"political language of the day ... landlord, landgrabber, loyalist, imperialist, Orangeman, Freemason, Free Stater, spy, and informer\\" and continues, \\"these blanket categories made the victims' individual identities ... irrelevant.\\" Coogan concurred, writing, \\"the latent sectarianism of centuries of ballads and landlordism claimed ten Protestant lives\\" that week.Coogan, p. 349. Ryan claims, by way of justification, that all of those killed were described as \\"committed loyalists\\" and \\"extremely anti-Republican\\". She claims they had been in contact with the Essex Regiment based in Bandon during the conflict, supplying information on the local IRA and that it was \\"firmly established\\" later that Fitzmaurice and Gray had been informers, and that their information had done a great deal of damage to the IRA. In Gray's case—as a woman who had been a ten-year-old girl during the Troubles told Ryan—he had allegedly sought out \\"information from children in their innocence\\", hence children were warned against talking to him.Ryan, pp. 213-14. Ryan claims Fitzmaurice, Gray, Buttimer, and Harbord were associated with the above-mentioned Loyalist Action Group, based in Murragh and known locally as the Protestant Action Group, and that all four were involved in espionage.Ryan, pp. 210-12. Ryan claimed to have seen, during a 1981 interview with a surviving Cork IRA flying column volunteer named Dan Cahalane, all thirteen names of the Dunmanway victims listed as \\"helpful citizens\\" in Auxiliaries' documents found by republicans after the departure of the British forces from southern Ireland.Meda Ryan commentary re challenge by Eve Morrison, historyireland.com; accessed 9 September 2015; \\"[Cahalane] showed me the documents he had received on loan. He studied them carefully and was able to pinpoint names plus details regarding the thirteen men killed between 26 and 29 April 1922.\\" Given that four of the killings were cases in which a relative of a target was substituted in the target's absence (Harbord, Nagle, McKinley, Bradfield), it is not clear how Ryan could have seen all thirteen names. Hart writes that the term informer was used as a form of \\"generic abuse\\" and found \\"no evidence whatsoever\\" that they had been active in opposing the IRA.Hart, pp. 285-87. Meehan writes that the killings were not \\"motivated by either land agitation or by sectarian considerations\\". Rev. Murphy agrees, citing a British document, A Record of the Rebellion in Ireland in 1920–1921.A Record of the Rebellion in Ireland in 1920–1921, Jeudwine Papers, 72/8212, Imperial War Museum, London, UK. Meehan and Rev. Murphy conclude \\"the IRA killings in the Bandon area were motivated by political and not sectarian considerations. Possibly, military considerations, rather than political, would have been a more fitting way to describe the reason for the IRA response to those who informed.\\"Irish Political Review, pp. 10-11. because: > [T]he truth was that, as British intelligence officers recognised in the > south, the Protestants and those who supported the [UK] Government rarely > gave much information because, except by chance, they had not got it to > give. An exception to this was in the Bandon area where there were many > Protestant farmers who gave information. Although the Intelligence Officer > of the area was exceptionally experienced and although the troops were most > active it proved almost impossible to protect those brave men, many of whom > were murdered while almost all the remainder suffered grave material loss. Most recently, historian John Regan, in his paper, The Bandon Valley Massacre Revisited, argued that the killings might be best understood in light of purported IRA fears that the British were planning a reoccupation of the south of Ireland and was a preemptive move against people believed to have been informers. Regan argued that the selective use of evidence by Peter Hart to emphasize the sectarian dimension to the killings highlights a wider problem in the politicization of Irish history.John Regan, \\"John Dorney, Peter Hart and the Dunmanway killings controversy\\", theirishstory.com; accessed 19 August 2014.John Regan,The Bandon Valley Massacre Revisited, academia.edu; accessed 9 July 2014. TV programme on RTÉ Cork's Bloody Secret, shown on RTÉ on 5 October 2009, dealt with the Dunmanway killings. The programme was produced by Sean O Mealoid, and included interviews with two descendants of two of the Protestant victims. It included a dialogue between two local historians, Donald Woods and Colum Cronin, and featured Prof. John A. Murphy and Eoghan Harris (who later debated the issue in the Irish Times), alongside UCC historian Andy Bielenberg.Letters from Harris, Murphy and Bielenberg in Jack Lane, ed., An affair with the bishop of Cork, Aubane Historical Society, 2009.

It was shown at the horror film festival 8 Films To Die For during the 2006 fall season. At the 2006 International Horror and Sci- Fi Film Festival it was awarded Best Picture for Horror, and the lead actress, English, won Best Actress.  Plot  The film revolves around a cadaver who seems to bring misfortune on those who come in contact with it. Although there is very little corporeal manifestation of the ghosts, people seem to die when they enrage the spirit which is linked with a special cadaver--by disrespecting it or otherwise. The story takes place mostly inside a hospital, where a young medical student, Alison Blanchard, comes to learn anatomy. By observing the cadaver she was assigned, she discovers that the body had self- inflicted wounds and also had a child. She soon discovers that there is something wrong with the cadaver, which they have nicknamed \\"Norma.\\" Mysterious deaths occur in the hospital, which include the fiancee of one of Allison's team members and several hospital employees. It is revealed that the cadaver is a person named Alita Covas, who once led an archaeological expedition on an Aztec sacrificial site. There she uncovered 50,000 bodies which were offered to Tlazolteotl, the Aztec god of fertility and prostitution. Afterwards, she herself became a prostitute, and started showing symptoms of mental imbalance. Later in her life, she committed murders and was subsequently put in a mental asylum where she died--presumably by her own hand. Once Alison learns of the true nature of the cadaver, she decides the corpse must return to Brazil to satisfy the Aztec god. After a series of gruesome events, Alison and her classmate/love interest take Alita's now dismembered corpse and cremate her in the hospital. In the end, Alison heads to Brazil to spread the ashes in an attempt to put the spirit at rest; however, it is suggested in the final scene that the spirit remains in the hospital.

Taxonomy The species was previously placed in the genus Acrosternum but has been classified as in the genus Chinavia in the more recent literature (e.g., Schwertner and Grazia, 2006). Green stink bug  Description  The green stink bug's color is typically bright green, with narrow yellow, orange, or reddish edges. It is a large, shield-shaped bug with an elongate, oval form and a length between 13–18 mm. It can be differentiated from the species Nezara viridula by its black outermost three antennal segments. Its anterolateral (= in front and away from the middle) pronotal margin is rather straight and not strongly arced such as in Chinavia pensylvanica. Green stink bug on a Lily. Both adults and nymphs have large stink glands on the underside of the thorax extending more than half-way to the edge of the metapleuron. They discharge large amounts of this foul- smelling liquid when disturbed. This liquid, dried and pulverized, was once used at industrial level to reinforce the smell of some acids. Now it's been replaced by artificial composites.  Habitat  It is found in orchards, gardens, woodlands and crop fields throughout North America, feeding with their needle-like mouthparts on the juices of a wide variety of plants from May until the arrival of frost. Adults develop a preference for developing seeds and thus become crop pests (tomato, bean, pea, cotton, corn, soybean, eggplant). When no seeds are present, they also feed on stems and foliage, thus damaging several fruit trees, such as the apple, cherry, orange and peach trees. Moreover, it can be found in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Green stink bugs bred well on bonfire salvia as well as tomatoes and mulberry. Also it has been found on peaches, apricots, grapes, silver beet and french beans. The difference here is that they don't seem to be a pest for them.  Lifecycle  Adults appear in the field early September and become plentiful in sheltered positions. Then, mating happens in early October and finally, the eggs can be found mid to late October. Nymphs appear in late October and early November. Two or three generations occur in the summer months in the field and in the laboratory at 26 °C.  Reproduction  They attach their keg-shaped eggs on the underside of foliage in double rows of twelve eggs or more. The green stink bug produces one generation in the North and two generations in the South. The early instar nymphs are rather brightly colored and striped, turning green when approaching adulthood. The eggs are usually laid in clusters of 14 (some clusters contain fewer eggs, with 9 being the smallest number recorded out of 77 observations). The eggs are laid either on the undersurfaces of leaves or on the stems of plants or on the flowers of salvia. Eggs parasitized by Trissolcus sp. wasp  Pest management  It is parasitized by the tachinid fly Trichopoda pennipes and by parasitic wasps.Species Trissolcus euschisti The green stink bug uses the pheromone methyl (E,Z,Z)-2,4,6-decatrienoate in its communication system and this may be used to attract the bug away from crop fields.

Using standard notation for q-binomial coefficients, the identity states that :\\\\binom{m + n}{k}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q} =\\\\sum_{j} \\\\binom{m}{k - j}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q} \\\\binom{n}{j}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q} q^{j(m-k+j)}. The nonzero contributions to this sum come from values of j such that the q-binomial coefficients on the right side are nonzero, that is, Other conventions As is typical for q-analogues, the q-Vandermonde identity can be rewritten in a number of ways. In the conventions common in applications to quantum groups, a different q-binomial coefficient is used. This q-binomial coefficient, which we denote here by B_q(n,k), is defined by : B_q(n, k) = q^{-k(n-k)} \\\\binom{n}{k}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q^2}. In particular, it is the unique shift of the \\"usual\\" q-binomial coefficient by a power of q such that the result is symmetric in q and q^{-1}. Using this q-binomial coefficient, the q-Vandermonde identity can be written in the form :B_q(m + n,k)=q^{n k}\\\\sum_{j}q^{-(m+n)j} B_q(m,k - j) B_q(n,j). Proof As with the (non-q) Chu–Vandermonde identity, there are several possible proofs of the q-Vandermonde identity. The following proof uses the q-binomial theorem. One standard proof of the Chu–Vandermonde identity is to expand the product (1 + x)^m (1 + x)^n in two different ways. Following Stanley,Stanley (2011), Solution to exercise 1.100, p. 188. we can tweak this proof to prove the q-Vandermonde identity, as well. First, observe that the product :(1 + x)(1 + qx) \\\\cdots \\\\left (1 + q^{m + n - 1}x \\\\right ) can be expanded by the q-binomial theorem as :(1 + x)(1 + qx) \\\\cdots \\\\left (1 + q^{m + n - 1}x \\\\right ) = \\\\sum_k q^{\\\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} \\\\binom{m + n}{k}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q} x^k. Less obviously, we can write :(1 + x)(1 + qx) \\\\cdots \\\\left (1 + q^{m + n - 1}x \\\\right ) = \\\\left((1 + x)\\\\cdots (1 + q^{m - 1}x)\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\left(1 + (q^m x) \\\\right) \\\\left (1 + q(q^m x) \\\\right ) \\\\cdots \\\\left (1 + q^{n - 1}(q^m x) \\\\right )\\\\right) and we may expand both subproducts separately using the q-binomial theorem. This yields :(1 + x)(1 + qx) \\\\cdots \\\\left (1 + q^{m + n - 1}x \\\\right ) = \\\\left(\\\\sum_i q^{\\\\frac{i(i - 1)}{2}} \\\\binom{m}{i}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q} x^i \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\sum_i q^{mi + \\\\frac{i(i - 1)}{2}} \\\\binom{n}{i}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q} x^i \\\\right). Multiplying this latter product out and combining like terms gives : \\\\sum_k \\\\sum_j \\\\left(q^{j(m - k + j) + \\\\frac{k(k - 1)}{2}} \\\\binom{m}{k - j}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q} \\\\binom{n}{j}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!q}\\\\right)x^k. Finally, equating powers of x between the two expressions yields the desired result. This argument may also be phrased in terms of expanding the product (A + B)^m(A + B)^n in two different ways, where A and B are operators (for example, a pair of matrices) that \\"q-commute,\\" that is, that satisfy BA = qAB.

The wires leading from the electrode can be connected to the amplifier and recording setup using regular wires, since no twisting occurs. Freely moving animals may turn through several revolutions in one direction. While recording from freely moving animals, therefore, an electrical commutator is needed to prevent twisting of the wires that go from the electrode (moving and rotating with the head) to the amplifier/recorder (fixed to the ground). Traditional electrical commutators use slip rings for coupling. Slip rings however inject commutator noise into the connection. This is because as the contact points slide over the surface of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the slip rings with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear. Replacing the slip rings with pools of mercury — a conducting fluid — reduces commutator noise and friction, enabling commutator use for small weaker animals. OEM machinery manufacturers are discovering the benefits of using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or slip ring as a connection to the moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a slip ring assembly or standard electrical slip ring may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of connector parts that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.

They are predators of gypsy moth caterpillars and the larvae of beetles such as the Colorado potato beetle and the Mexican bean beetle. Since the Mexican bean beetle is widely regarded as a notorious agricultural pest in North America, soldier bugs are generally considered useful garden insects. This insect is a generalist predator with a broad host range, reportedly attacking 90 insect species, which includes several important economic pests. Reported prey include the larvae of Mexican bean beetle, European corn borer, diamondback moth, corn earworm, beet armyworm, fall armyworm, cabbage looper, imported cabbageworm, Colorado potato beetle, velvetbean caterpillar, and flea beetles. When prey are scarce, the spined soldier bug may feed on plant juices, but this feeding is not reported to cause plant damage. Podisus maculiventris is associated with several crops including alfalfa, apples, asparagus, beans, celery, cotton, crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, potatoes, onions, soybeans, sweet corn and tomatoes. The effectiveness of this species in preying on economic pests resulted in its use in classical biological control programs in other countries, including Eastern Europe and Russia. However, this has not been successful in colder climates, perhaps due to an inability of overwinter. Podisus maculiventris eggs are also sold commercially for use in control programs and this has proven successful in controlling pests in European and North American heated greenhouses. Use in large area field crops is often not economically viable due to the production costs of raising the bug. In addition, naturally occurring populations often are not numerous enough to overpower large populations of pests in the spring. Pheromones have been used to draw naturally occurring and newly emerging populations of this stink bug to target crops in the spring.spined soldier bug References External links * Cornell University.

He was the head coach at the University of Michigan from 2011 to 2014. He grew up in Ohio and attended Ball State University where he played linebacker from 1977 to 1980. He began his coaching career in 1982 and held assistant coaching positions at Grand Valley State (1983), Western Michigan (1984–1986), Toledo (1987–1989), Oregon State (1989–1994) and Michigan (1995–2002). Hoke left his assistant coaching position at Michigan in December 2002 to become the head football coach at his alma mater, Ball State. In six years at Ball State, Hoke was credited with turning around the football program. In 2008, he led the Ball State football team to a 12–1 record and the first appearance in the Associated Press Top 25 (peaking at No. 12) in school history. In December 2008, Hoke was hired as the head football coach at San Diego State University. He led the 2010 San Diego State Aztecs football team to the school's first season with at least nine wins since 1977 and a victory over Navy in the 2010 Poinsettia Bowl. He returned to Michigan after he was hired to be the program's 19th head football coach on January 11, 2011. In his inaugural season with the Wolverines he led them to an 11–2 record, taking Michigan to their first BCS Bowl game since the 2006 football season, where Michigan defeated the Virginia Tech Hokies in the 2012 Sugar Bowl. On December 2, 2014, Michigan fired Hoke after four seasons. He was also the interim head coach at the University of Tennessee at the end of the 2017 season. Early years Hoke graduated from Fairmont East High School in Kettering, Ohio, in 1977. While at Fairmont East, Hoke played linebacker/defensive end and was also on the school's wrestling squad. His father, John Hoke, played for future Ohio State coach Woody Hayes at Miami University, alongside future Michigan coach Bo Schembechler. Despite his father's association with Hayes, Hoke recalled that, while he was growing up in Kettering, he was a Michigan fan. He went on to play football as a linebacker at Ball State University, where he was a four-year letterman from 1977 to 1980. He helped the Ball State Cardinals win the 1978 MAC championship. He tallied 99 tackles as a sophomore, 95 as a junior and 150 as a senior. He was the captain of Ball State's 1980 team and was selected as a second-team All-MAC player. Coaching career =Assistant coach= Hoke began his coaching career in 1982 as the defensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Yorktown High School in Yorktown, Indiana. Hoke began his college coaching career as the defensive line coach at Grand Valley State University in 1983. The following year, he joined Jack Harbaugh's staff at Western Michigan University. He was Western Michigan's defensive line coach from 1984 to 1986. Also on the coaching staff were current Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, current Michigan defensive coordinator Greg Mattison, and current Michigan special teams coordinator Dan Ferrigno. Hoke next served as the linebackers coach at the University of Toledo from 1987 to 1989. Hoke served as an assistant coach at Oregon State University from 1989 to 1994 under head coaches Dave Kragthorpe and his successor Jerry Pettibone. He was the Beavers' defensive line coach in every season except 1990, when coached the inside linebackers. The Beavers went 4–7–1 and 1–10 in Hoke's first two years in Corvallis, resulting in the firing of Kragthorpe. Hoke was retained in 1991 by Oregon State's new head coach, Jerry Pettibone. The Beavers had consecutive one-win seasons in 1991 and 1992 and back-to-back four win seasons in 1993 and 1994. Despite the team's struggles, Hoke later credited Kragthorpe with teaching him many lessons: \\"One of the big things coach Pettibone instilled in me was the recruiting process, and the work ethic that it takes to recruit, and the other factors, as far as trying to get a team ready every week, coming off a couple of lean years, and the intenseness of the rivalry with Oregon.\\" In February 1995, Hoke was hired as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan under head coach Gary Moeller. He was the defensive end coach in 1995 and 1996 and defensive line coach from 1997 to 2002. In May 2002, Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr named Hoke as associate head coach, the only member of the staff with that distinction. At the time, Hoke told the press, \\"Every year you learn more and more what the head coach has to do. I'm very honored to represent this school. I grew up a big Michigan fan, and I think it's a place that's special in a lot of ways.\\" During Hoke's eight years at Michigan, the Wolverines compiled a 75–23 record, went to a bowl game every year and won the national championship in 1997. While at Michigan, Hoke was assigned to recruit in California. One of the players Hoke recruited to Michigan was future legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady. Hoke recalled: \\"Tom wasn't the greatest athlete, with those skinny legs, but there was something about him.\\" Although Hoke was an assistant under head coaches Moeller and Carr at Michigan, Bo Schembechler remained at Michigan in the early part of Hoke's tenure. Interviewed in 2009, Hoke recalled the example set by Schembechler: \\"When I was at Michigan, Bo Schembechler's office was five doors down from mine. Having the opportunity to talk with him on a daily basis was something that transferred those values that are most important if you're going to be successful.\\" =Ball State= In December 2002, Hoke was hired as the 14th head football coach at his alma mater, Ball State University, signing a five- year contract at $125,000 per season. He was among a group of candidates to succeed Bill Lynch, which included Illinois secondary coach Mike Mallory, Ohio State linebackers coach Mark Snyder, and Wisconsin offensive coordinator Brian White. Hoke told reporters that the moment he heard the vacancy sign was out at Ball State, he knew he wanted to be the school's next head football coach: \\"There is no doubt.\\" Hoke added, \\"It is great to return to the school that enabled me to get an education and play football. I am looking forward to representing a great university with integrity and pride.\\" Michigan's head coach Lloyd Carr praised Hoke: \\"Brady has done a tremendous job at Michigan. He is a great recruiter. One of the things I try to do is hire people that have the potential to become head coaches. He is goal-oriented and has a great motivation to be the best that he can be.\\" Hoke took over a Ball State football program that had not had a winning record since 1996. Hoke's teams won only 10 games in his first three seasons as head coach. Hoke began to turn this around in his fourth year as the team finished 5–7 (5–3) in 2006. In 2007, the team improved to 7–5 in the regular season, as sophomore quarterback Nate Davis passed for 3,376 yards and 27 touchdowns. The 2007 Ball State team nearly upset the Nebraska Cornhuskers, but a late touchdown gave Nebraska a 41–40 win. The team was invited to play in the International Bowl in Toronto, losing to Rutgers, 52–30. During the 2008 season, Hoke led the Cardinals to the most wins in school history, finishing the regular season with an undefeated record of 12–0. The 2008 season marked the first time the Ball State Cardinals won a game against a BCS-conference opponent, a 42–20 victory over Indiana. And in October 2008, Ball State was ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 for the first time in the school's history. After his team achieved its top 25 ranking, Hoke told the media, \\"It's flattering obviously, but there's so much season left to play. You have to evaluate the season at the end. We've got a lot of big games ahead of us.\\" The Cardinals were ranked as high as #12 during the 2008 season. After concluding an undefeated regular season, Hoke's 2008 team lost to the Buffalo Bulls in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Ball State's rise to prominence led to Hoke's December 2008 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman where he read a special \\"Top Ten List\\" of the \\"Highlights of the Ball State Cardinals Season\\", topped by \\"The Drunk 3 A.M. Coaching Tips from (Ball State alumnus) Letterman.\\" While at Ball State, several football players were caught in a scheme to sell textbooks for classes they were not enrolled in. The NCAA cut three football scholarships and put the University on two years probation. Nine other sports were involved in the scheme. =San Diego State= In December 2008, Hoke was hired as the 17th head football coach at San Diego State University. Hoke signed a five-year contract with a guaranteed payment of $3,525,000, plus incentives for hitting revenue marks and bowl berths. San Diego State was also required to pay $240,000 to buy out the remaining two years on Hoke's contract at Ball State. At the press conference introducing Hoke as the Aztecs' new coach, Hoke told reporters, \\"Number one, this program is going to be a program that's based on toughness. To play football at the Division I level, to compete academically at the Division I level and balance both, you have to be tough-minded. You have to be physically tough and mentally tough.\\" San Diego State compiled a 2–10 record the year before Hoke arrived. A sports writer for the San Diego Union-Tribune described the challenge facing Hoke: \\"It's going to be difficult for [Brady Hoke], because with the Aztecs, we're basically talking about a sea change in everything from A to Zed. This isn't Urban Meyer taking over at Florida, where the cupboard already was full of epicurean delights. State has rotting skeletons in its closet. The Aztecs haven't had a winning season since 1998, just seven since 1980.\\" Hoke won a reputation for recruiting at San Diego State. His brother Jon Hoke, an assistant coach in the NFL, noted: \\"I don't care where it is, whether it's San Diego State or anywhere else, if there's one thing he can do it's recruit. He's as good at it as anybody. He's relentless with recruiting. He has a great feel for parents and a great feel for players. As long as you give him the budget to (recruit) the way it needs to be done, he'll be fine.\\" In 2009, Hoke led the Aztecs to a record of 4–8. During the 2010 season, Hoke's team improved to 9–4. Two of the Aztecs' losses in 2010 came in close matches against ranked opponents. The Aztecs gave the undefeated, #2 TCU team its closest game of the regular season, losing by a score of 40–35. Hoke's team also lost a close game against No. 12 Missouri by a score of 27–24. The team concluded its season with a convincing 35–14 win over Navy in the 2010 Poinsettia Bowl. Prior to the 2010 season, San Diego State had not won nine or more games in a season since 1977 (when they had their second straight 10 win season) and had not played in a bowl game since the 1998 team lost in the Las Vegas Bowl. After the 2010 season, a reporter for the Orange County Register wrote that Hoke had given San Diego State \\"swagger.\\" =Michigan= 2011 season Brady Hoke (right) with Michigan athletic director Dave Brandon in 2011. On January 11, 2011, Hoke was named the 19th head football coach of the Michigan Wolverines football team. Michigan athletic director Dave Brandon described some of the factors that influenced his selection of Hoke: \\"The reason I wanted him to be prominent in this process was simply the combination of turning around two programs, being known as a terrific recruiter, and being a defensive-minded coach with a lot of experience. Everybody that I ever talked to just raved about the quality of person he is and how much he loves Michigan.\\" Although many speculated that Hoke had been a third choice behind Jim Harbaugh and Les Miles, Brandon stated, \\"The job was never offered to them.\\" On November 26, Hoke's Wolverines defeated Ohio State in Hoke's first season as the Wolverines' head coach, clinching Michigan's first 10-win season since 2006. Hoke's 2011 team also held Michigan's first winning record in Big Ten conference play since 2007. Michigan's win over Ohio State in the long- standing rivalry was its first since 2003. Following the 2011 Big Ten Conference football season, Hoke swept the Big Ten Coach of the Year awards, earning the Hayes-Schembechler Coach of the Year, as selected by conference coaches, and the Dave McClain Coach of the Year, as picked by the media. Hoke won his first bowl game as the head coach of Michigan in an overtime contest against Virginia Tech by a score of 23–20. It was Michigan's first BCS bowl victory since the 2000 Orange Bowl, and its 20th bowl victory overall. 2012–14 seasons Hoke and Jerry Montgomery with defensive linemen in 2012. Hoke's second season in Ann Arbor started off with Michigan losing 41–14 to the defending and eventual repeat national champions, the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Game was played at Cowboy Stadium on a neutral playing field, being broadcast to a nationally televised audience. Hoke said after the game \\"Obviously, we didn't play Michigan football, and that's something that bothers our team, bothers the coaches;\\" he continued \\"Win or lose your first game, you learn a lot.\\" Michigan ended the regular season with losses to AP #25 Nebraska (10–4), #4 Notre Dame (12–1), #3 Ohio State (12–0), and #1 Alabama (13–1), before losing 33–28 on the final touchdown to #8 South Carolina in the Outback Bowl. Hoke led the 2014 Michigan team to a 5–7 record. This marked only the third season since 1975 in which Michigan missed a bowl game (the previous two instances were both under Hoke's predecessor, Rich Rodriguez). The team defeated only one bowl-eligible opponent, with the win coming against Penn State. Following the season, Michigan fired Hoke after four seasons. Hoke compiled a 31–20 record, including an 18–14 record in Big Ten play. =Back as assistant coach= Oregon Hoke was announced as the University of Oregon's defensive coordinator on January 16, 2016. He was not retained by new coach Willie Taggart after the firing of Mark Helfrich. Tennessee Hoke was announced as the University of Tennessee's defensive line coach on February 7, 2017. On November 12, 2017, Butch Jones was terminated as head coach of the Volunteers. As a result, Hoke was named as the interim head coach. Hoke coached the last two games of the season, which were a 30–10 loss to #21 LSU and a 42–24 loss to Vanderbilt. The two losses under Hoke combined with the 4–6 record from Butch Jones gave the Tennessee Volunteers their first eight-loss season in program history. NFL Carolina Panthers On January 29, 2018, ESPN reported that Hoke was hired to coach the defensive line for the NFL's Carolina Panthers. The move to the NFL was a first for Hoke's coaching career, as all of his previous stops had been in high school or college. He was fired on December 3. San Diego State Hoke returned to San Diego State University in 2019 as defensive line coach under head coach Rocky Long. Hoke helped the Aztecs fielded a defense that was second in rush defense allowing 75.4 yards per game and sixth in total defense allowing 287.8 yards per game in 2019. =Second stint at San Diego State= On January 8, 2020, Rocky Long announced his retirement from coaching and Hoke was named the head coach for the Aztecs. Family Hoke and his wife have a daughter, Kelly, who was born in 1986 and is also a Ball State graduate. Brady is the younger brother of Jon Hoke, who is the defensive coordinator of Maryland. Jon's son, Kyle Hoke, played for his uncle at Ball State and was a graduate assistant coach for the Western Michigan Broncos football team in their 2012 and 2013 seasons.

Cory Knauf stars as a teenager who must decide whether to help the victims that his older siblings have kidnapped. Plot A suburban family harbors a dark secret: When their parents are killed in a tragic accident, eldest Hamilton sibling David (Samuel Child) relocates the surviving family members to a quiet California suburb and assumes the responsibility of caring for his orphaned teenage siblings; Wendell (Joseph McKelheer), Darlene (Mackenzie Firgens), and Francis (Cory Knauf). While twins Wendell and Darlene seem to share a bizarre incestuous bond that separates them from the rest of the siblings, Francis acquires a video camera that previously belonged to his deceased parents and sets out preparing a school project about his family. The all-seeing lens of Francis' roving camera begins to reveal that something malevolent is going on inside the Hamilton's picturesque abode. David finds work in a meat-packing warehouse, and is shown to bring some stuff from work home with him, while it is also implied that he is interested in men as he regularly invites male co- workers to go with him to a nearby motel for an evening. One evening, Wendell kidnaps two young girls whom he meets in a local bar and they are tied in their storeroom. Older brother David drains blood off one of them till she slowly dies. Francis gets attracted to the other girl who tries to get him to help her. But things come to a head when Wendell and Darlene murder one of her classmates and feed off her blood. When David tries to kill the other girl, Francis hits him in the head and carries her off to a safe hideout at the meat packing plant which is closed for the night. Wendell asks David to follow Francis, as he is the only one capable of persuading him to return. At the barn, Francis, seeing an open wound on the girl's hand, is unable to control his bloodlust and he kills the girl and feeds off her. When David appears, Francis is crying and we see his fangs. Though terribly sad at his actions, he finally seems to be accepting what he really is: a vampire. With the death of Darlene's classmate, David decides to move somewhere else, and they go to the basement to retrieve the creature locked there, who turns out to be their little brother Lenny. The family, the Hamilitons, is revealed to be a new breed of vampires who are born that way, not made. They move from place to place to hide their secret of their thirst for blood and to avoid detection from the authorities. In the final scene, we see them introducing themselves to their new neighbors, as the Thompsons, and Francis, now having embraced his newfound status as a vampire, is shown making a happy video of his now complete family.

History Radio Sagarmatha was founded by the Nepal Forum of Environmental Journalists (NEFEJ) with the cooperation of the Nepal Press Institute, Himal Association, and World View Nepal. Programming Radio Sagarmatha broadcasts its programs in the Nepali language as well as in many ethnic languages of Nepal including Newar (also known as Nepal Bhasa), Maithali and Tamang. It has nine news bulletins (Halchal/हलचल ) daily, broadcasting 18 hours a day. It has popular daily discussion programmes Aajaka Kura/आजका कुरा (Talk of Today), Dabali /डबली (Forum), and more than 90 programmes a week. Among them are many on different social issues like public health, rule of law, education for all, environment, sustainable development, gender equality, women's empowerment, good governance, human rights, culture and tourism, literature, voices of minorities, youth, workers, folk music among others. It has the strength to raise public issues and make impact at the policy level. The main aim of Radio Sagarmatha is to change society in a positive manner and be the voice of the voiceless poor. Radio Sagarmatha has been broadcasting a popular programme to preserve the social, economic and cultural history of Nepali society, named Uhile Bajeka Palama (In the time of forefathers). The 81-year-old senior journalist Bhairab Risal talks to his senior guests about the social, cultural and economic situation of their time in his stylish way of testimony. Administration The Nepal Forum of Environmental Journalists has formed a board to run Radio Sagarmatha. The station manager is the executive chief of the station. Radio Sagarmatha has always been in front line of the struggle for the press freedom in Nepal. It has played a vital role in conducting the Save Independent Radio Movement in cooperation with other likeminded institutions, while the government put a ban on current affairs during the direct rule of King Gyanendra after February 1, 2005. Five radio journalists were arrested and the station was shut down for 43 hours and 47 minutes by the Royal government in 2006 accusing of broadcasting the interview of Prachanda, the Maoist Chair Person, one of the top underground leader of rebellion. Radio Sagarmatha resumed its on air immediately after getting verdict by the Supreme Court in favor of it. When it began, Radio Sagarmatha was broadcast by a 100 watt capacity transmitter. But these days, the broadcasting capacity of Radio Sagarmatha is 1 kilowatt. It has claimed that around 2.5 million people listen to it regularly. More than 70 journalists are working at Radio Sagarmatha, among them half volunteers. An Ex-Supreme Court Judge and Ex-Chief Election Commissioner have been volunteer producers of Radio Sagarmatha. Bharat Dutta Koirala, prominent media person and the winner of the 2002 Ramon Magsaysay Award in Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts, is one of the founders of Radio Sagarmatha.

He was a major painter of fresco decorations. His ceiling decorations showed a mix of Bolognese and Roman influences.Domenico Maria Canuti at The J. Paul Getty Museum Life Born in Bologna, Canuti first trained in that city under Guido Reni, then with Guercino. He painted many ceiling and wall frescoes. From 1650 to 1660 and later in the 1670s, he was employed in Rome where he painted the quadratura decoration of the ceiling of church of Santi Domenico e Sisto with the Apotheosis of Saint Dominic. He was often patronized by the Olivetans. He was employed with Francesco Cozza and Carlo Maratta in the decoration of Palazzo Altieri. He also completed frescoes for the Palazzo Colonna in Rome.Marina Barbolini Armandi, Domenico Maria Canuti in: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 18 (1975) Returning to Bologna, he completed frescoes in the library of San Michele in Bosco and the Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande, and in the Ducal Palace at Mantua. He helped fresco the Palazzo Felicini in Bologna with Domenico Santi and Giacomo Alboresi. He employed Giuseppe Maria Crespi, Giovanni Antonio Burrini, Antonio Maria Haffner,Orlandi, page 349.

The Michelson stellar interferometer is one of the earliest astronomical interferometers built and used. The interferometer was proposed by Albert A. Michelson in 1890, following a suggestion by Hippolyte Fizeau. The first such interferometer built was at the Mount Wilson observatory, making use of its 100-inch (~250 centimeters) mirror. It was used to make the first-ever measurement of a stellar diameter, by Michelson and Francis G. Pease, when the diameter of Betelgeuse was measured in December 1920. The diameter was found to be 240 million miles (~380 million kilometers), about the size of the orbit of Mars, or about 300 times larger than the Sun.

As a child, she migrated with her family to the US, where she became a Communist political activist, feminist and black nationalist, using the false name Jones as \\"self- protective disinformation\\". Due to the political persecution of Communists in the US, she was deported in 1955 and subsequently lived in the United Kingdom. She founded Britain's first major black newspaper, West Indian Gazette (WIG), in 1958. Early life Claudia Vera Cumberbatch was born in Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 21 February 1915. When she was nine years old, her family emigrated to New York City following the post-war cocoa price crash in Trinidad. Her mother died five years later, and her father eventually found work to support the family. Jones won the Theodore Roosevelt Award for Good Citizenship at her junior high school. In 1932, due to poor living conditions, she was struck with tuberculosis, a condition that irreparably damaged her lungs and plagued her for the rest of her life. She graduated from high school, but her family could not afford the expenses to attend her graduation ceremony. United States career Phoenix, where in 1948 Jones spoke to a crowd of 1,000 people about equal rights for African Americans. Despite being academically bright, being classed as an immigrant woman severely limited Jones' career choices. Instead of going to college she began working in a laundry, and subsequently found other retail work in Harlem. During this time she joined a drama group, and began to write a column called \\"Claudia Comments\\" for a Harlem journal. In 1936, trying to find organisations supporting the Scottsboro Boys, she joined the Young Communist League USA. In 1937 she joined the editorial staff of the Daily Worker, rising by 1938 to become editor of the Weekly Review. After the Young Communist League became American Youth for Democracy during World War II, Jones became editor of its monthly journal, Spotlight. After the war, Jones became executive secretary of the Women's National Commission, secretary for the Women's Commission of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), and in 1952 took the same position at the National Peace Council. In 1953, she took over the editorship of Negro Affairs. = Black feminist leader in the Communist Party = As a member of the Communist Party USA and a black nationalist and feminist, Jones' focus was on creating \\"an anti-imperialist coalition, managed by working-class leadership, fueled by the involvement of women.\\" As the Communist Party had failed to generally acknowledge women's difficulty in securing work, Jones focused on growing the party's support for black and white women. She campaigned for job training programs, equal pay for equal work, government controls on food prices and funding for wartime childcare programs. Jones supported a subcommittee to address the \\"women's question\\". She insisted on the development in the party of theoretical training of women comrades, the organization of women into mass organizations, daytime classes for women, and \\"babysitter\\" funds to allow for women's activism. =\\"An End to the Neglect of the Problems of the Negro Woman!\\"= Jones' best known piece of writing, \\"An End to the Neglect of the Problems of the Negro Woman!\\", appeared in 1949 in the magazine Political Affairs. It exhibits her development of what later came to be termed \\"intersectional\\" analysis within a Marxist framework. In it, she wrote: Deportation An elected member of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA, Jones also organised and spoke at events. As a result of her membership of CPUSA and various associated activities, in 1948 she was arrested and sentenced to the first of four spells in prison. Incarcerated on Ellis Island, she was threatened with deportation to Trinidad. Following a hearing by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, she was found in violation of the McCarran Act for being an alien (non-US citizen) who had joined the Communist Party. Several witnesses testified to her role in party activities, and she had identified herself as a party member since 1936 when completing her Alien Registration on 24 December 1940, in conformity with the Alien Registration Act. She was ordered to be deported on 21 December 1950. In 1951, aged 36 and in prison, she suffered her first heart attack. That same year, she was tried and convicted with 11 others, including her friend Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, of \\"un-American activities\\" under the Smith Act, specifically activities against the United States government. The Supreme Court refused to hear their appeal. In 1955, Jones began her sentence of a year and a day at the Federal Reformatory for Women at Alderson, West Virginia. She was released on 23 October 1955. She was refused entry to Trinidad and Tobago, in part because the British colonial governor Major General Sir Hubert Elvin Rance considered that \\"she may prove troublesome\\". She was eventually offered residency in the United Kingdom on humanitarian grounds, and federal authorities agreed to allow it when she agreed to cease contesting her deportation. On 7 December 1955, at Harlem's Hotel Theresa, 350 people met to see her off. United Kingdom activism Jones arrived in London two weeks later, at a time when the British African-Caribbean community was expanding. However, on engaging the political community in the UK, she was disappointed to find that many British communists were hostile to a black woman. =Activism= Jones found a community that needed active organisation. She became involved in the British African-Caribbean community to organise both access to basic facilities, as well as the early movement for equal rights. Supported by her friends Trevor Carter, Nadia Cattouse, Amy Ashwood Garvey, Beryl McBurnie, Pearl Prescod and her lifelong mentor Paul Robeson, Jones campaigned against racism in housing, education and employment. She addressed peace rallies and the Trade Union Congress, and visited Japan, Russia, and China, where she met with Mao Zedong. In the early 1960s, her health failing, Jones helped organise campaigns against the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill (passed in April 1962), which would make it harder for non- whites to migrate to Britain. She also campaigned for the release of Nelson Mandela, and spoke out against racism in the workplace. =West Indian Gazette and Afro-Asian Caribbean News, 1958= From her experiences in the United States, Jones believed that \\"people without a voice were as lambs to the slaughter.\\" In March 1958 above a barber's shop in Brixton, she founded and thereafter edited the anti-imperialist, anti-racist paper West Indian Gazette, its full title subsequently displayed on its masthead as West Indian Gazette and Afro-Asian Caribbean News (WIG). The paper became a key contributor to the rise of consciousness within the Black British community. Jones wrote in her last published essay, \\"The Caribbean Community in Britain\\", in Freedomways (Summer 1964):Jones, Claudia, \\"The Caribbean Community in Britain\\", Freedomways V. 4 (Summer 1964), 341–57. Quoted in McClendon III, John H., \\"Jones, Claudia (1915–1964)\\", Blackpast.org. Always strapped for cash, WIG folded eight months and four editions after Jones's death in December 1964. =Notting Hill riots and \\"Caribbean Carnival\\", 1959= Claudia Jones blue plaque, Notting Hill In August 1958, four months after the launch of WIG, the Notting Hill race riots occurred, as well as similar disturbances in Robin Hood Chase, Nottingham. In view of the racially driven analysis of these events by the existing British daily newspapers, Jones began receiving visits from members of the black British community and also from various national leaders responding to the concern of their citizens, including Cheddi Jagan of British Guiana, Norman Manley of Jamaica, Eric Williams of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Phyllis Shand Allfrey and Carl La Corbinière of the West Indies Federation. As a result, Claudia identified the need to \\"wash the taste of Notting Hill and Nottingham out of our mouths\\". It was suggested that the British black community should have a carnival; it was December 1958, so the next question was: \\"In the winter?\\" Jones used her connections to gain use of St Pancras Town Hall in January 1959 for the first Mardi-Gras-based carnival, directed by Edric Connor (who in 1951 had arranged for the Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra to appear at the Festival of Britain)Notes, \\"(1954) Edric Connor & The Caribbeans – Songs from Jamaica\\", folkcatalogue. and with the Boscoe Holder Dance Troupe, jazz guitarist Fitzroy Coleman and singer Cleo Laine headlining; the event was televised nationally by the BBC. These early celebrations were epitomised by the slogan: \\"A people's art is the genesis of their freedom.\\" A footnote on the front cover of the original 1959 souvenir brochure states: \\"A part of the proceeds [from the sale] of this brochure are to assist the payments of fines of coloured and white youths involved in the Notting Hill events.\\" Jones and the West Indian Gazette also organised five other annual indoor Caribbean Carnival cabarets at such London venues as Seymour Hall, Porchester Hall and the Lyceum Ballroom, which events are seen as precursors of the celebration of Caribbean Carnival that culminated in the Notting Hill Carnival. Death Jones died on Christmas Eve 1964, aged 49, and was found on Christmas Day at her flat. A post-mortem declared that she had suffered a massive heart attack, due to heart disease and tuberculosis. Her funeral on 9 January 1965 was a large and political ceremony, with her burial plot selected to be that located to the left of the tomb of her hero, Karl Marx, in Highgate Cemetery, North London. A message from Paul Robeson was read out: Legacy The National Union of Journalists' Black Members' Council holds a prestigious annual Claudia Jones Memorial Lecture every October, during Black History Month, to honour Jones and celebrate her contribution to Black-British journalism. The Claudia Jones Organisation was founded in London in 1982 to support and empower women and families of African-Caribbean heritage. Winsome Pinnock's 1989 play A Rock in Water was inspired by the life of Claudia Jones. Jones is named on the list of 100 Great Black Britons (2003 and 2020) and in the 2020 book. In August 2008, a blue plaque was unveiled on the corner of Tavistock Road and Portobello Road commemorating Claudia Jones as the \\"Mother of Caribbean Carnival in Britain\\". In October 2008, Britain's Royal Mail commemorated Jones with a special postage stamp.\\"The Notting Hill Carnival on stamps\\", The British Postal Museum & Archive blog, 27 August 2010. She is the subject of a documentary film by Z. Nia Reynolds, Looking for Claudia Jones (2010).\\"Looking for Claudia Jones trailer\\", Blackstock Films, 2010. On 14 October 2020, Jones was honoured with a Google Doodle.\\"Celebrating Claudia Jones\\", Google, 14 October 2020. =Commemoration of the 100th anniversary of her birth= Various activities took place from June 2014 onwards. The most successful were possibly those organised by Community Support, which put substantial resources into basic research into aspects of her life and work. This led to new revelations and rediscoveries about Claudia Jones, not included in the three printed biographies, or the film biography. Community Support organised A Claudia Jones 100 Day on the 100th anniversary of her birth at Kennington Park Estate Community Centre on Saturday, 21 February 2015. This began with a guided tour showing her two main residences while she lived in London, and the former West Indian Gazette office nearby. There was also a celebration at The Cloth, in Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, near to her birthplace, on the same day. The Day was associated with an event held on the previous evening at Claudia Jones Organisation in Hackney, which featured a screening of the film Looking for Claudia Jones by Z. Nia Reynolds.

It is located south of SH 180, west of Spur 408, north of I-20, and east of FM 1382. The defunct Naval Air Station Dallas (Hensley Field), now an Armed Forces Reserve Center, is located on the northern shore of the lake. Mountain Creek Lake Park is on the lake's southeastern and southwestern edges. The Texas Department of State Health Services recently updated a fish consumption advisory for Mountain Creek Lake in Dallas County due to unsafe levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in certain species of fish. DSHS tested tissue samples from fish as part of a re-evaluation of the lake. Concentrations of dioxins and PCBs in channel catfish, common carp, flathead catfish, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, smallmouth buffalo and white bass continue to exceed DSHS health guidelines. DSHS now recommends people limit or avoid consumption of these species as outlined in the table below: According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, women of childbearing age and children should not consume fish from this lake. Women past childbearing age and adult men should consume no more than follows: White or black crappie- UNRESTRICTED Channel catfish - 1 meal/month Flathead catfish - 2 meal/month Largemouth bass - 3 meal/month White bass - 1 meal/month Common carp - DO NOT EAT Smallmouth buffalo - DO NOT EAT Freshwater drum - DO NOT EAT The recommendations are stronger for children under 12 and women who are nursing, pregnant or who may become pregnant, because the nervous systems of unborn and young children are particularly susceptible to the health effects of toxins. The updated advisory dated January 13, 2017 replaces guidelines issued in 2010 that recommended no one eat any fish from Mountain Creek Lake. Prior to that, the state prohibited people from possessing fish from the lake at all. Elevated levels of dioxins and PCBs in fish do not pose a health risk for people swimming, boating, or participating in other recreational activities.  History  Construction on Mountain Creek Dam began in 1929, and the dam was complete in early 1937. The reservoir was designed as a cooling reservoir for a Dallas Power and Light Company electric power plant. The original permit for the lake suggested a capacity of , but the capacity in 1992 was only because of heavy siltation.

It was in production from 2000 to 2002. The vehicle is four-axled, and is based on the Škoda 03 T, which is a uni-directional model operating in a few cities in the Czech Republic. The low-floor area represents 50% of the entire vehicle floor. The 10T was originally part of Skoda's Astra model line, although in the United States it was referred to only as the 10T, not by that model name, but it was later made part of the company's Elektra model line, after that new line of models was created, around 2010.  Production  In total, 10 trams of this model were manufactured by Škoda and delivered to: * United States: ** Portland, Oregon: 7 cars, for the Portland Streetcar system, built in 2000–2002 ** Tacoma, Washington: 3 cars, for the Tacoma Link system, built in 2002 Those ten trams were constructed at a Škoda factory in the Czech Republic and shipped complete to the USA, under a joint venture between Škoda and Inekon Group, with Inekon having been responsible for most of the mechanical design, as well as marketing and shipping, and with Škoda having manufactured the vehicles. Their propulsion control equipment was supplied by an Austrian company, Elin EBG Traction, and braking systems by Knorr, under subcontracts. However, the relationship between Škoda and Inekon deteriorated, and the partnership collapsed in 2001. Škoda 10T cars that had been ordered in 2000 or 2001 were delivered by Inekon to Portland and Tacoma in 2002, which was already after the Škoda-Inekon joint venture had effectively been dissolved. Inekon Group formed a new venture, named DPO Inekon, selling a slightly modified version of the 10T (which it named 12 Trio),Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, September 2003, p. 347. Light Rail Transit Association (UK). while Škoda continued to offer the 10T. Related model built under license In 2006, Škoda entered into an agreement with a US company to permit the latter to construct a 10T tram (streetcar) under license. Oregon Iron Works (OIW), a specialized manufacturing company based in Clackamas, Oregon (an unincorporated community in the southeastern suburbs of Portland), signed an exclusive technology transfer agreement with Škoda in February 2006, and in January 2007 it was awarded a contract to build one 10T streetcar for the Portland Streetcar system. OIW created a new subsidiary named United Streetcar LLC for this venture. This prototype tram, which could be considered an eleventh Škoda 10T but is more accurately described as the first United Streetcar 10T, was completed and delivered to Portland Streetcar in spring 2009. It was designated as model 10T3 by United Streetcar,\\"United Streetcar ... US manufacturer established for new trams\\". (April 2007). Tramways & Urban Transit, p. 146. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association (UK). but that company changed the model designation to \\"100\\" for the production-series cars it built later.\\"United Streetcar gears up for series production\\". Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, November 2010, p. 406. The prototype US-built 10T was presented to the public and media at a ceremony held on 1 July 2009 in Portland, but it did not enter service until September 2012,\\"Portland Opens New Line\\" (November 2012). Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, p. 409. delayed first by problems that came to light during acceptance testing and later by a decision to replace its propulsion-control system with a new one built by a US company, in order to increase the US content. In August 2009, Portland signed a US$20 million contract with United Streetcar for the supply of six more streetcars, but the city decided in 2010 to modify the OIW/United Streetcar contract for these six cars, to substitute equipment from Elin EBG Traction for the originally planned Škoda equipment.Tramways & Urban Transit, August 2010, p. 313. LRTA Publishing (UK). (They did not receive the experimental system with which the 10T3 prototype was fitted.) They were delivered in 2013 and 2014. In 2010, the city of Tucson, Arizona, placed an order with United Streetcar for seven similar trams for a new tram line to be built there, named Sun Link. An eighth was added to the order in July 2012.\\"Worldwide Review\\" (September 2012). Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, p. 356. Designated as model 200, differing from the 100 in having more powerful air conditioning systems, they were delivered in 2013 and 2014. In April 2012, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, in Washington, DC, placed an order for two model 100 streetcars for use on the DC Streetcar's H Street/Benning Road Line, under construction for opening in 2015, and the order was expanded to three cars in August 2012. The three cars were delivered between January 2014 and June 2014.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, July 2014, p. 305. The orders from all three cities were completed in 2014, the last car being delivered to Portland in November of that year. With no standing orders at that time, United Streetcar ceased production.

It was chosen as one of the 8 Films To Die For in 2006 and screened at that year's After Dark Horrorfest film festival. It has received positive reviews. Plot An unidentified young woman, alone in a room, is attacked by an invisible assailant, who hangs her in the stairway of her house. As she dies, she drops an ornate black envelope. A year later, former college friends Sid (Marcus Thomas), Kira (Josie Maran), and Harris (Dominic Purcell) go out drinking after a funeral. They break into the Crescent View Cemetery to say their final goodbyes to the departed. Continuing their revelries, they get quite drunk. Sid finds a black envelope tucked behind a garland of flowers at the grave. It contains a poem urging those present to be joyful and to dance upon the graves. In their drunken state, the three regard this as a celebration of life, and they dance. Afterwards, mysterious things happen. Harris and his wife Allison (Clare Kramer) are frightened by unexpected visions and odd sounds. Then Kira is attacked by a demonic force. She is severely bitten and sexually assaulted, and her house is ransacked. Sid is plagued by unexpected fires. They enlist a pair of paranormal investigators, Vincent Cochet (Tchéky Karyo) and Frances Culpepper (Megahn Perry), who determine that the three friends inadvertently invoked a powerful curse by dancing on the graves. They are now being haunted by three wayward spirits—a passionate axe murderer, a child pyromaniac, and a serial killer and rapist—who will kill them at the next full moon. As the full moon approaches, they return to the cemetery to disinter the remains of their tormenters, hoping to bury them anew and put the curse to rest. Not all of the critical parts make it back into the ground, however, and on the final night the three friends experience renewed attacks, more powerful and furious than any previously. They are trapped together with the investigators by the malevolent spirits. Sid is incinerated by his firebug ghost, and Kira is murdered and her body is possessed by the axe murderer who is pursuing Harris. Under duress, Culpepper admits that she foiled the burial plan by hiding the skulls of the corpses, the better to gather hard evidence of ghostly activity. Culpepper is then killed with an axe to the chest. Harris takes the axe murderer's skull and tries to return it to its body to break the curse. He helps Allison escape the house through an attic window. The spiritual force in the house coalesces into the form of a demonic head. Smashing through the walls and out of the house, it pursues the characters' fleeing vehicle. Barely eluding the head, Allison and Harris return the skull to its corpse, and the raging spirits disappear. Later, Allison and Harris walk through the cemetery after the funerals of their friends. As they leave, the groundskeeper carefully places an ornate black envelope on one of the tombstones.

The station is part of the Sri Petaling Line (formerly known as STAR). The station was opened on July 11, 1998, as part of the second phase of the STAR system's opening, including 7 new stations along the Chan Sow Lin-Sri Petaling route.  Location  Despite its name, Cheras station is not located within or close to the Kuala Lumpur township of Cheras. Rather, the station is situated between the northern Sungai Besi region, Taman Ikan Emas and Salak South, a kilometre northwest from the nearest border to Cheras. The station is thus more reachable to users from the aforementioned three areas, as well as Bandar Sri Permaisuri (Sri Permaisuri Town) to the south, than Cheras. The station's main access point faces the southeast towards Taman Ikan Emas and is accessible via Jalan Jelawat Satu (Jelawat Road One). In the beginning of its operation, the Cheras station was primarily accessible via a footbridge crossing a ditch. Beginning June 2007, construction work was conducted directly in front of the station, demolishing the original path and requiring a temporary route around the construction site for access into the station. Until late 2006, the western side of the station was lined along a backroad that branched off Jalan 3/12, and several industrial buildings. The area had since been partially cleared away for the construction of the Kuala Lumpur–Putrajaya Expressway, slated for opening in 2008. While the station itself is unaffected, access from the west now requires crossing an overhead bridge prepared along with the expressway. The Cheras station was constructed along two leveled tracks, reusing the now defunct Federated Malay States Railway and Malayan Railway route between Kuala Lumpur, Ampang and Salak South. The station is also the last station from the Putra Heights terminal station before a convergence with the Ampang-bound line at the Chan Sow Lin interchange, 1.5 km northward.  Design  A platform view of Cheras station. The Cheras station is a low-rise structure with two side platforms lined along two tracks for trains traveling in opposite direction. However, unlike the many subsurface stations dotted along the Miharja-Ampang route, the Cheras station was sited on a set of tracks significantly lower than subsurface stations (similar to the Cahaya station), and only includes a single ticket area, as opposed to two for each platform, because a deep tunnel was built linking both platforms. The station also serves as a public crossing by pedestrians and motorcyclists across the Sri Petaling Line tracks between the southeast and northwest via another underground path running beneath the tracks and platforms. The principal styling of the station is similar to most other stations in the line, featuring curved roofs supported by latticed frames, and white plastered walls and pillars. Because the tunnel linking both platforms are connected only by stairways, the station is not accommodative to disabled users.

The stations exits to both Salak South to the west and Bandar Sri Permaisuri to the east. The Salak Selatan station was constructed along two leveled tracks, reusing the now defunct Federated Malay States Railway and Malayan Railway route between Kuala Lumpur, Ampang and Salak South. The station is currently one of two railway stations serving the Salak South locality, the other being a KTM Komuter station bearing the same name. While the STAR station is considerably closer to Salak Selatan, the Komuter station is located some 400 metres south from the town. Unlike other examples in Kuala Lumpur, the two stations are not noted on transit maps as interchange stations between the two lines. Design Salak Selatan station's platforms as of 2017. Underground linkway of the station. Overall, the Salak Selatan station was built as a low-rise station along two tracks for trains traveling in opposite directions. Because the station is nearly subsurface and features two side platforms, the station designates individual ticketing areas for each of the station's two platforms at their level, ensuring access to trains traveling the opposite direction is not freely possible. The station also serves as a public crossing across the railway tracks between Salak South and Bandar Sri Permaisuri via a walkway running underneath the STAR line and platforms. The principal styling of the station is similar to most other stations in the line, featuring multi-tiered roofs supported by latticed frames, and white plastered walls and pillars.

After establishing a reputation for scholarship with two multi-volume books on royal ladies and noblewomen, she was invited to assist in preparing calendars (abstracts) of hitherto disorganised historical state papers. In this role of \\"calendars editor\\", she participated in the mid-19th- century initiative to establish a centralised national archive. She was one of the most respected female historians in Victorian Britain. Family and early career Mary Anne Everett Wood was born in Sheffield to a Wesleyan Methodist minister, Robert Wood, and his wife Sarah (Sarah Bateson, born in Wortley, Leeds, youngest daughter of Matthew Bateson, clothier). Her father was responsible for her education, offering an extensive knowledge of history and languages, and she benefited from mixing with her parents' intellectual friends including James Everett, the minister and writer, after whom she was named. When the family moved to London in 1841 she began researching in the British Museum and elsewhere, and during the 1840s she worked on Letters of Royal and Illustrious Ladies (1846) and Lives of the Princesses of England: from the Norman Conquest (1849–1855). She had started work on this book in 1843, using private libraries like that of the rich collector Sir Thomas Phillipps, as well as archives like those at Lambeth Palace. After her marriage to the painter George Pycock Green in 1845, they travelled for the sake of his artistic career, and she was able to research her subject further in Paris and Antwerp. Lives of the Princesses was praised by the antiquary Dawson Turner and by the historian Sir Francis Palgrave among others. Palgrave, the first Deputy Keeper of the Public Record Office (PRO), had met Green, was impressed with her scholarship, especially her knowledge of languages, and recommended her to his superior John Romilly, the Master of the Rolls. Romilly was continuing Lord Langdale's work of overseeing the establishment of a national archive (the PRO), and publishing some of the documents it held. Numerous state papers which had been assembled from different locations were studied and summarised, and then the abstracts were arranged in chronological order in the form of \\"calendars\\". In 1854 Romilly invited Green to become an external calendars editor. In her first few years doing this work she gave birth to two of her three daughters, one of whom, Evelyn Everett-Green, became a novelist. Mary Anne Everett Green's son had been born in 1847 but died in 1876. Her husband became disabled and it was important for her to earn an income. While supplementing her work at the PRO with journalism, she pursued some private research but had no time to complete a planned book on the Hanoverian queens. Public records Unlike the full- time employees doing similar work, such as Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, and the three male free-lancers working on the calendars, who all had paid assistance, Green's only helper was her sister Esther, but she became the \\"most highly respected\\" and \\"most efficient compiler of calendars\\". She sometimes complained about being paid less than the men, and also disputed editorial questions with her superiors. Romilly did eventually agree to her suggestion of historical prefaces written by herself and the other editors, and these came to be seen as an essential part of the calendars. Green herself wrote 700 pages of prefaces which amount to a history of seventeenth-century England.Christine L. Krueger, Why she lived at the PRO Over the next four decades Green edited 41 volumes starting with Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of James I (4 volumes, 1857–9). By the time she completed Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of Elizabeth in 1872, reviewers considered she had established a model for such work; with more detailed abstracts than many other calendars, as well as the highest standards of scholarship, her work \\"came to be recognized as the standard to be followed by all editors\\". Like other 19th-century women historians, Green tended to concentrate her work in fields seen as suited to \\"feminine\\" talents: research into queens and ladies, private lives, and the deciphering, translation and compilation of historical documents, for instance. One of her earliest books was prefaced by her asking the reader not to criticise her for having \\"ventured upon a field usually occupied only by the learned of the opposite sex.\\"Illustrious Ladies quoted by Anne Laurence Her calendar prefaces, though, were an opportunity to write on broader, more \\"masculine\\" themes, like the Interregnum, earning respect for the overall quality and \\"strict historical accuracy\\".David Masson, quoted by Christine L. Krueger in Why she lived at the PRO She was one of only three women to sign a public petition in 1851 asking the PRO to offer free access to its records for serious scholars, a request which was granted in 1852. Alongside 80 men's signatures, including those of Charles Dickens, Macaulay, and Carlyle, were the women historians who depended on detailed study of freshly discovered original sources to claim authority for their work:Anne Laurence Agnes Strickland and Lucy Aikin were the other two. Green went on working at the PRO until shortly before she died, aged 77, at home in London on 1 November 1895, having passed her research on the Hanoverian queens to her friend A. W. Ward. Her work at the PRO was continued by the niece she had trained: Sophia Crawford Lomas. Both Ward and Lomas helped ensure that her Elizabeth, Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia (1909) appeared posthumously. She also intended to publish an edition of the letters of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia and collected over 400 transcripts.Mary Anne Everett Green, Elizabeth, Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia (London, 1909), p. 122. Other books of hers include Diary of John Rous (1856) and Letters of Queen Henrietta Maria (1857). She was also known for her philanthropy.

KernerArticle \\"Curing Congestion\\" in Discover Magazine, 1999  Biography  Boris S. Kerner is an engineer and physicist. He was born in Moscow, Soviet Union in 1947 and graduated from the Moscow Technical University MIREA in 1972. Boris Kerner was received Ph.D. and Sc.D. (Doctor of Sciences) degrees in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, respectively, in 1979 and 1986. Between 1972 and 1992, his major interests include the physics of semiconductors, plasma and solid state physics. During this time, Boris Kerner together with V.V. Osipov developed a theory of Autosolitons - solitary intrinsic states, which form in a broad class of physical, chemical and biological dissipative systems. After emigration from Russia to Germany in 1992, Boris Kerner worked for the Daimler company in Stuttgart. His major interest since then was the understanding of vehicular traffic. The empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks understood by Boris Kerner is the basis for Kerner's three phase traffic theory, which he introduced and developed in 1996–2002. Between 2000 and 2013 Boris Kerner was a head of a scientific research field Traffic at the Daimler company. In 2011 Boris Kerner was awarded with the degree Professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. After his retirement from the Daimler company on 31 January 2013 Prof. Kerner works at the University Duisburg-Essen.  Scientific work  = Three phase traffic theory = In Kerner's three phase traffic theory, in addition to the free flow traffic phase (F), there are two traffic phases in congested traffic: the synchronized flow traffic phase (S) and the wide moving jam phase (J). One of the main results of Kerner's theory is that traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck is a random (probabilistic) phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (F → S transition) that occurs in a metastable state of free flow at a highway bottleneck. This means that traffic breakdown (F → S transition) exhibits the nucleation nature. The main reason for the Kerner’s three-phase theory is the explanation of the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S transition) at highway bottlenecks observed in real field traffic data. The prediction of the Kerner’s three-phase theory is that this metastability of free flow with respect to the F → S phase transition is governed by the nucleation nature of an instability of synchronized flow with respect to the growth of a large enough local increase in speed in synchronized flow (called a S → F instability). The S → F instability is a growing speed wave of a local increase in speed in synchronized flow at the bottleneck. The development of Kerner's S → F instability leads to a local phase transition from synchronized flow to free flow at the bottleneck (S → F transition). = Synchronized traffic flow = At the end of 1990's Kerner introduced a new traffic phase, called synchronized flow whose basic feature leads to the nucleation nature of the F → S transition at a highway bottleneck. Therefore, Kerner's synchronized flow traffic phase can be used synonymously with the term three-phase traffic theory. = Random time delay of traffic breakdown and F → S → F transitions = In 2015 Kerner found that before traffic breakdown occurs at a highway bottleneck, there can be a random sequence of F → S → F transitions at the bottleneck: The development of a F → S transition is interrupted by a S → F instability that leads to synchronized flow dissolution resulting in a S → F transition at the bottleneck. The effect of Kerner's F → S → F transitions is as follows: The F → S → F transitions determine a random time delay of traffic breakdown at the bottleneck. = Paradigm shift in traffic and transportation science = The basic result of Kerner's three-phase traffic theory about the nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S transition) at a bottleneck shows the incommensurability of three-phase traffic theory with all earlier (standard) traffic flow theories. The term \\"incommensurability\\" has been introduced by Kuhn in his classical bookT.S. Kuhn, \\"The structure of scientific revolutions\\". Fourth edition. (The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, London 2012) to explain a paradigm shift in a scientific field. The paradigm shift in traffic and transportation science is the fundamental change in the meaning of stochastic highway capacity because the meaning of highway capacity is the basis for the development of any method for traffic control, management, and organization of a traffic network as well as applications of intelligent transportation systems. The paradigm of standard traffic and transportation theories is that at any time instant there is a value of stochastic highway capacity. When the flow rate at a bottleneck exceeds the capacity value at this time instant, traffic breakdown must occur at the bottleneck. The new paradigm of traffic and transportation science following from the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown (F → S transition) and Kerner's three-phase traffic theory changes fundamentally the meaning of stochastic highway capacity as follows. At any time instant there is a range of highway capacity values between a minimum and a maximum highway capacity, which are themselves stochastic values. When the flow rate at a bottleneck is inside this capacity range related to this time instant, traffic breakdown can occur at the bottleneck only with some probability, i.e., in some cases traffic breakdown occurs, in other cases it does not occur. = Mathematical models in the framework of three-phase traffic theory = Rather than a mathematical model of traffic flow, Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory is a qualitative traffic flow theory that consists of several hypotheses. The first mathematical model of traffic flow in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory that mathematical simulations can show and explain traffic breakdown by an F → S phase transition in the metastable free flow at the bottleneck was the Kerner-Klenov stochastic microscopic traffic flow model introduced in 2002. Some months later, Kerner, Klenov, and Wolf developed a cellular automaton (CA) traffic flow model in the framework of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory. The Kerner-Klenov stochastic traffic flow model in the framework of Kerner’s theory has further been developed for different applications, in particular to simulate on-ramp metering, speed limit control, dynamic traffic assignment in traffic and transportation networks, traffic at heavy bottlenecks and on moving bottlenecks, features of heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of different vehicles and drivers, jam warning methods, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication for cooperative driving, the performance of self-driving vehicles in mixture traffic flow, traffic breakdown at traffic signals in city traffic, over-saturated city traffic, vehicle fuel consumption in traffic networks. = Intelligent transportation systems in the framework of three- phase traffic theory =  ASDA/FOTO methods for reconstruction of congested traffic patterns  Kerner's three phase traffic theory is a theoretical basis for applications in transportation engineering. One of the first applications of the three-phase traffic theory is ASDA/FOTO methods that are used in on-line applications for spatiotemporal reconstruction of congested traffic patterns in highway networks.  Congested pattern control approach  In 2004 Kerner introduced congested pattern control approach. Contrarily to standard traffic control at a network bottleneck in which a controller (for example, through the use of on-ramp metering, speed limit, or other traffic control strategies) tries to maintain free flow conditions at the maximum possible flow rate at the bottleneck, in congested pattern control approach no control of traffic flow at the bottleneck is realized as long as free flow is realized at the bottleneck. Only when an F → S transition (traffic breakdown) has occurred at the bottleneck, the controller starts to work trying to return free flow at the bottleneck. Congested pattern control approach is consistent with the empirical nucleation nature of traffic breakdown. Due to the congested pattern control approach, either free flow recovers at the bottleneck or traffic congestion is localized at the bottleneck.  Autonomous driving in framework of three-phase traffic theory  In 2004 Kerner introduced a concept of an autonomous driving vehicle in the framework of the three-phase traffic theory. The autonomous driving vehicle in the framework of the three-phase traffic theory is a self-driving vehicle for which there is no fixed time headway to the preceding vehicle. This means the existence of an indifference zone in car-following for the autonomous driving vehicle. Kerner's indifference zone in car-following results from Kerner's two-dimensional (2D) region of steady states of synchronized flow hypothesized in the three-phase traffic theory. = Time- delayed transition from under- to over-saturated traffic at signal = In 2011–2014, Boris Kerner has expanded three phase traffic theory, which he developed initially for highway traffic, for the description of city traffic. It turns out that like traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks, traffic breakdown (transition from under- to over-saturated traffic) at traffic signals is also a random phase transition that occurs in metastable under- saturated city traffic. This theory of traffic breakdown at traffic signals can explain the physics of traffic gridlock in city traffic as well as the breakdown of green wave that is often observed in real city traffic. Moreover, like empirical studies of highway traffic, recent empirical studies of over- saturated city traffic prove the existence of empirical synchronized flow in city traffic. = Breakdown minimization principle = In 2011 Kerner introduced the breakdown minimization principle that is devoted to control and optimization of traffic and transportation networks while keeping the minimum of the probability of the occurrence of traffic congestion in a network. = Network throughput maximization approach = In 2016 Kerner developed an application of the breakdown minimization principle called network throughput maximization approach. Kerner's network throughput maximization approach is devoted to the maximization of the network throughput while keeping free flow conditions in the whole network. = Network capacity = In 2016 Kerner introduced a measure (or \\"metric\\") of a traffic or transportation network called network capacity. Kerner's network capacity determines the maximum total network inflow rate that is still possible to assign in the network while keeping free flow conditions in the whole network. Network capacity allows us to formulate a general condition for the maximization of the network throughput at which free flow does persist in the whole network: Under application of a network throughput maximization approach, as long as the total network inflow rate is smaller than the network capacity traffic breakdown with resulting traffic congestion cannot occur in the network, i.e., free flow remains in the whole network.

After beginning his playing career with Celtic, he broke through to regular first team football with Dundee and appeared for the Scotland under-21 team. He has subsequently played for a number of clubs in Scotland, England, Switzerland and Cyprus, notably Norwich City, where he was club captain. Playing career Fotheringham played three times for Celtic. At the time of his debut, he was the youngest player ever to play in Celtic's first team. In 2003, he moved to one of his hometown clubs, Dundee. After two years with the Dark Blues, making 59 appearances and scoring four goals in all competitions, Fotheringham moved to Germany with SC Freiburg, where he played for a season. After an unsuccessful trial with Leeds United, Fotheringham moved to FC Aarau of the Swiss Super League in 2006 but left midway through the season. =Norwich= Fotheringham began training with Rangers in January 2007 in a bid to earn a contract. However, he decided to join Norwich City on 31 January until the end of the season, with the option of a one-season extension to his contract, which was taken up, keeping him at Norwich until the summer of 2008. He made his debut for Norwich on 3 February 2007 at Carrow Road against Leeds United. The 2007–08 season began well for Fotheringham, as he scored his first goal for the club in a 5–2 League Cup win over Barnet. However, on 18 August 2007, he suffered ankle ligament damage in a match against Southampton which kept him out of action for more than two months. Fotheringham returned to the Norwich side under new Canaries manager Glenn Roeder and for a while became a permanent fixture in the side. For Norwich's home match with Plymouth Argyle on 4 December 2007, Fotheringham was made Norwich captain in the absence of Jason Shackell and was subsequently given the role on a permanent basis. On 23 May 2008, Fotheringham agreed a new one-year deal to stay at Norwich for the 2008–09 season. It was also confirmed that he would remain as club captain, however a number of other players including Darel Russell and Gary Doherty filled this role in his periods of absence from the team during the season. In March 2009, following an incident where he stormed down the Carrow Road tunnel having been substituted in a match against Coventry City, Fotheringham was stripped of his captaincy role to be permanently replaced by Doherty. He never played for the club again, and was released in April 2009.Canaries release midfield duo =After Norwich= On 28 May 2009, it was announced that Espanyol were interested in signing him, and Fotheringham joined Espanyol for a week-long trial in June 2009. Derby County manager Nigel Clough then offered Fotheringham the chance to join Derby for pre-season training, which Fotheringham accepted, and joined Derby on trial in July 2009. Clough later revealed Derby would not be signing him, with Fotheringham also going on trial at Sheffield United. After clinching a January 2010 move to Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta, Fotheringham signed a short-term deal with hometown club Dundee United, for the three months before his move to Cyprus. In January 2010, Mark Fotheringham signed a contract with Anorthosis Famagusta. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Manager Stanimir Stoilov then froze him out of for the pre-season training by banning him from entering the club's facilities. Having joined Sheffield United on trial, Fotheringham signed for Livingston in October 2011. Fotheringham scored in a 2–0 win over Queen of the South on 29 October 2011 and another against Falkirk in a 4–3 loss. Then on 30 December 2011, Fotheringham had his Livingston contract extended by 28 days. He had a brief trial at Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 2012, but was not offered a contract. After the trial, Fotheringham was freed by the club in late-January. On 7 March 2012, Fotheringham re-joined Dundee. On 30 April 2012, it was announced his contract would not be renewed. In the summer of 2012, Fotheringham trained with German clubs 1899 Hoffenheim and VfL Wolfsburg. He signed for Scottish Premier League club Ross County in September 2012. After making thirteen appearances, Fotheringham left Ross County to join Swiss side Luzern. However, it was revealed that Fotheringham only went on trial with the club. On 23 July 2013, Fotheringham, signed for Notts County following his successful trial. Fotheringham played 34 matches for County before signing for Fulham in August 2014. Fotheringham played in only three competitive matches before being released by Fulham at the end of January 2015. After almost a year without a club, he rejoined his former club Livingston in January 2016. He retired at the end of the season. Coaching Tomas Oral, head coach of German side Karlsruher SC, knew Fotheringham from his time as assistant to Felix Magath at Fulham FC. He convinced him to join him at Karlsruhe and after a few days as a guest he signed as assistant coach on 1 July 2016.http://www.ka-news.de/ksc/news/Karlsruhe~/KSC-Trainerstab-komplett-Mark- Fotheringham-kommt-in-den-Wildpark;art516931,1914827 Fotheringham was appointed player / assistant manager of Scottish League Two club Cowdenbeath in 2017.

Location The Miharja station is situated at the southwestern side of the Miharja Flats, a complex of flats close to Kerayong River in the locality of Taman Miharja, off Jalan Loke Yew (Loke Yew Road). The station directly serves the aforementioned flats, as well as the remaining portion of Taman Miharja and the Ue3 shopping centre from the opposite side of Jalan Loke Yew, which also have similarly close access to Maluri station. The Miharja station was constructed along two leveled tracks, reusing the now defunct Federated Malay States Railway and Malayan Railway route between Kuala Lumpur, Ampang and Salak South. The station is also the last station from the Ampang terminal before a convergence with the Putra Heights-bound line and the Chan Sow Lin interchange, 850 metres northward, where the lines merge to form the common route of the Ampang and Sri Petaling Lines towards Sentul Timur station. Design Sri Petaling Line is visible in the background. Overall, the Miharja station was built as a low-rise station along two tracks for trains traveling in opposite direction. Because the station is nearly subsurface and features two side platforms, the station designates individual ticketing areas for each of the station's two platforms at their level, ensuring access to trains traveling the opposite direction is not freely possible.

The installation was originally established as an Army Aviation center, and eventually became home to aviation assets from all the military services. The facility was decommissioned as a naval air station in December 1998 pursuant to BRAC action and the extant Naval Air Reserve, Marine Air Reserve and Texas Air National Guard flying units (wings, groups, squadrons) relocating to the nearby former Carswell AFB, which was concurrently transferred to U.S. Navy custody via the Base Realignment and Closure Commission action and renamed Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth / Carswell Field.GlobalSecurity.org – NAS Dallas/Hensley Field. Retrieved 17 November 2006. The former NAS Dallas was later recommissioned as it is today as the Grand Prairie Armed Forces Reserve Complex, with the half that housed the aircraft-related facilities (such as the runway, hangars, etc.) going to the Texas Air National Guard, and the half with the bulk of non-aircraft related facilities going to the U.S. Army Reserve and a small area to the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Vought Aircraft Industries operates a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) plant adjacent to the former NAS Dallas, now Grand Prairie AFRC. History The City of Dallas established Hensley Field in August 1929 as a training field for Reserve pilots of the then-U.S. Army Air Corps. The facility was named for Major William N. Hensley, a flying instructor located near Dallas in the 1920s and one of the few on board the first trans-Atlantic dirigible crossing in 1919. The city leased the site to the United States Army for a dollar a year. The field became the Air Corps Reserve Base in the Eighth Corps Area. At the beginning of World War II, the Army extended their lease to 40 years. In March 1941, the U.S. Navy began maintaining operations at the base and shortly afterward established a Naval Air Reserve Base on 160 acres (0.7 km2) adjacent to Hensley Field. In December 1941, Hensley Field became headquarters of the Midwest Area of the Air Corps Ferrying Command, after Major Thomas D. Ferguson, commander of the field, was made control officer for the Middle West Area of the United States. The installation became Naval Air Station Dallas on 1 January 1943. Its initial mission was to provide primary flight training for Naval Aviation Cadets destined for commissioned service as Naval Aviators in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. Enlisted personnel destined for aviation duty with the Fleet were also trained at NAS Dallas, and at one time a number of Free French aviators received flight training at the installation. During World War II, the base also served as a radial engine repair station, with thousands of engines overhauled. NAS Dallas also handled all air traffic for the adjacent North American Aircraft Company plant and was the flight test facility and the receiving station for 4,400 SNJ Texan training aircraft manufactured at that plant. In early 1946, Congress appropriated funds to establish a Naval Reserve training program at NAS Dallas and by March of that year the Naval Reserve had taken over the field. The Marine Air Reserve Training Command also established itself there at that time. Naval and Marine Corps Reservists from across the nation, but primarily from Texas, Oklahoma, and eastern New Mexico continued to train at NAS Dallas. Hensley Field passed from the command of the U.S. Air Force to that of the U.S. Navy on 30 September 1949, but the field continued to serve as an Air Force Reserve training center. The Air Force conducted air operations for the Air Force Reserve, the Texas Air National Guard, and for the USAF Civil Air Patrol regional liaison office. In 1950, one of the Naval Air Reserve squadrons stationed at NAS Dallas was the first Naval Air Reserve squadron to be called to active service in the Korean War. The station continued to grow with the construction of newer, longer runways and jet aircraft were assigned to NAS Dallas in 1952. In 1963, the base was the first Naval Air Reserve installation to operate the F-8 Crusader until later transitioning to the F-4 Phantom II in both of its two Naval Reserve fighter squadrons and its single Marine Reserve fighter/attack squadron in the 1970s. The mid-1980s brought to the installation some of the Navy's most sophisticated aircraft, including the F-14 Tomcat and the C-9 Skytrain II. By 1990, there were 2,057 active duty personnel on the base, with an additional 6,789 part-time Reservists and Air National Guardsmen assigned to the station. The total economic impact of the base by then was almost $76 million. By the following year, more than 1,700 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines had been deployed from the base to the Persian Gulf in support of Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM.https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qbn02 The installation was closed in 1998 as part of the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission conducted by the Department of Defense, but was partially reopened in the early 21st-century as the Grand Prairie Armed Forces Reserve Complex to accommodate expanding military training requirements for the Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces. On 1 May 2016, Cedars Neighborhood Association president Michael Sitarzewski presented a proposal to Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings and Dallas City Council members to use part of the city-owned AFRC facility as an encampment for homeless people who were being evicted from a large tent city under Interstate 45 near downtown Dallas in response to persistent complaints from Cedars residents about an over- concentration of homeless in the neighborhood. The proposed encampment—to be called Camp Dignity—would include an open-air tent camping area, tiny homes, boarding houses, fruit and vegetable gardens, and on-site work opportunities to give residents the ability to transition to more permanent housing and jobs. City officials did not comment on the proposal.

Initially, the station itself was not constructed with any public walkway running underneath the tracks and platforms, as other subsurface stations along the route have. However, an overhead bridge and elevators were built later. Patrons are also provided with stairways on opposite sides of the track of a road-based flyover (Jalan Cahaya 1; Cahaya Road 1) over the tracks just northeast. The station's lower height may be attributed to the aforementioned flyover constructed close to the station, restricting the height of the adjoining tracks towards the Ampang terminal, thus affecting the height of the station.

Jennie Smillie Robertson (February 10, 1878 - February 26, 1981), known throughout her career as Jennie Smillie, was the first Canadian female surgeon and also performed the country's first major gynecological surgery. Born to farmers, she worked as a teacher to afford tuition for medical school before enrolling at the Ontario Medical College for Women which merged into the University of Toronto medical school during her time there. Due to a lack of options in Toronto, she completed her training in the United States. In 1911, she helped re-found her alma mater as today's Women's College Hospital after no Toronto hospital would let her perform surgery. She died at age 103. Early life and education Jennie Smillie was born on February 10, 1878, on a farm outside of Hensall, Ontario, to Benjamin Smillie (1839–1886) and Jane Smillie (née Buchanan; 1849–1906) as one of several children. Jennie Smillie attended public schools in Hensall and later in Seaforth. She showed interest in medical science at an early age. As an adult, she told another female doctor and friend, \\"I was only 3 when I first thought about being a doctor. I heard of a woman missionary doctor. When I was 5 I asked my mother if women could be doctors. She told me they could and from then on I knew that is what I would do.\\" Smillie was initially educated as a teacher and worked until age 25 to save for tuition for the Ontario Medical College for Women. Before her second year of medical school in 1906, the college merged with the University of Toronto’s medical school, making the school coeducational; some women felt hostility from their male peers, though Smillie felt the women positively influenced the men. She graduated in 1909. Career Medical internships in Canada were difficult for women to obtain; no hospital in Toronto would take Smillie as a resident intern, forcing her to move to the United States to complete an internship at the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in the city of Philadelphia. In 1910, she returned to Toronto to begin her practice but was not accepted by any doctor for surgical training. Thus, she went back to Philadelphia for six months of intensive training under another female surgeon, which included a week where she oversaw a surgical ward, an experience which she credited with building her confidence. After Smillie's second return to Toronto, no hospital would allow her to perform surgery. Instead, she performed her first surgery (an oophorectomy to remove an ovarian tumor) using daylight on a patient's kitchen table, which made her the first surgeon to perform major gynecological surgery in Canada. As a result, she became the country's first female surgeon recorded in the field's modern era. In 1911, Smillie and her female colleagues re- established the Ontario Medical College for Women as the Women's College Hospital due to an increase of female patients wanting their services and a growing number of female physicians in Canada. Prior to a building being built, the hospital was located inside rented houses, and its early financial difficulties led the founders to gather vegetables from farmers' wives to feed their patients. At the Women's College Hospital, she was chairman of the Gynecology Department from 1912 to 1942 and mainly performed abdominal and gynecological surgeries until her retirement in 1948. Outside of the hospital, Smillie was a founding member of the Federation of Medical Women of Canada and was politically active in liberal causes, at one point serving as president of the Women's Liberal Association. Later years and legacy After her retirement, Smillie married widower Alex Robertson when she was 70, though they had met decades prior, explaining the delay with: \\"I first met [him] in 1898 while I was teaching. At that time I was planning for medicine, not marriage, and I didn’t think I could have both.\\" He died ten years later. On her hundredth birthday she said there was not a day in her life she did not want to be a doctor. Smillie Robertson died in a nursing home in Toronto on February 26, 1981, at the age of 103 and is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto. In 2013, Hensall dedicated and named a pocket park in her honour. In 2016, Smillie Robertson was one of the nominees to be the first woman to have her likeness appear on a Canadian banknote. However, early civil rights activist Viola Desmond was chosen to be the first woman—and black person—to be honoured in this way.

Mineral dust containing large amounts of alkaline compounds such as calcium carbonate can also increase the pH of precipitation and contribute to basic rain. Basic rain can be viewed as opposite to acid rain. Acid rain has posed a serious threat to numerous ecosystems surrounding rivers, lakes and forests.

Photo: Erlend Bjørtvedt The Monksville Reservoir is an artificial lake created in 1987 by damming on the Wanaque River in West Milford, New Jersey. It is named after the former community of Monksville, which was relocated and flooded upon its completion. History The reservoir was built to relieve chronic water shortages in northern New Jersey that occurred in the 1980s due to drought conditions. The reservoir extended the capacity of the nearby Wanaque Reservoir. It is owned jointly by the Hackensack Water Company and the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. Location The lake is in Long Pond Ironworks State Park, which is located in the community of Hewitt, in West Milford, New Jersey, United States. The park is known for its old stone walls, furnaces and other remnants of a once industrious ironworking community that now sits next to the swiftly flowing Wanaque River. The park is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry. The state of New Jersey previously spent $2.7 million purchasing land at the site to be part of the state park before drought changed the priority to the reservoir. Approximately 15 residences, mostly owned by the Rhinesmith and Vreeland families, were purchased with NJ Green Acres funding and their owners relocated. Two homes of historic significance were moved, the others were demolished. One business, Duramic, was relocated and its building demolished. Construction Construction of the reservoir was started in 1985. Land was cleared and gravel was crushed on site and stock-piled. Stonetown Road was realigned to run over the dam. A small bailey bridge that was put in place in 1977 was dismantled to be used again elsewhere. The Monksville dam is approximately 0.4 miles long. A portion of Greenwood Lake Turnpike was realigned to higher ground. The dam impounds water from the Wanaque River flowing down from Greenwood Lake. A spillway was constructed to allow water to flow into the Wanaque Reservoir below. During times of low flow, water from the Monksville Reservoir is released into the Wanaque Reservoir below via the intake tower which mixes water from various levels of the Monksville. The dam was constructed with rollcrete. Dirt and gravel from on-site were mixed with cement. A dry mix of this material was laid down by large spreader trucks. A water truck would sprinkle the mix every 30 minutes around the clock to cure the mix. The face of the dam on the water side was faced with concrete, the other side was earthen. In 2007 the earthen side was refaced with concrete. Building of the actual dam started in March 1987 and was completed in August 1987. Then- governor Thomas Kean was present for the ribbon-cutting ceremony in autumn 1987. The reservoir filled quickly and was full by October 1987. Activities The lake is used by anglers, sporting clubs, the Society for the Education of American Sailors (SEAS), and is the home of Highlands Rowing Center, North Jersey Rowing, and Advanced Community Rowing Association. The reservoir is the home practice facility of the Suffern High School Varsity & Novice Crew teams. The Monksville Reservoir is known for its trophy size muskellunge, walleye, bass and trout.

(Since \\"vixen\\" is pronounced like wichsen, an obscene word meaning \\"to jerk off\\" in German, the game was renamed She-Fox in German- speaking countries.) Gameplay Each level must be completed within a time limit, by progressing from left to right. The player's character is armed only with a whip, used to defeat enemies and to collect bonus items such as gems (for points), extra lives and time. The player's character can also collect fox head tokens. If enough are collected by the end of the level, she will transform into a fox, allowing the player to enter a special underground lair. Here she can collect gems, mega gems (which increase scoring potential above ground) and weapon upgrades (to increase the power of her whip). A notable feature in the game was that the movements of the main character were (at least in some versions of the game) captured from the moving picture, thus the making animation more realistic than usual for a computer game of that era. Plot Vixen is the last human on the planet Granath, which is now ruled by a race of dinosaurs. Abandoned as a child and raised by magical foxes, she intends to follow through on a promise she made to her elders to wipe the dinosaurs out and restore the planet to humanity. Reception The various versions of Vixen received a wide range of review scores, including 452/1000 from ACE, 8/10 from Atari ST User, 7-8/10 from Computer & Video Games, 60% from Crash, between 42–72% from The Games Machine, and 6/10 from Your Sinclair. The cover of the game box caused a lot of controversy, as it features the Page Three girl Corinne Russell in the guise of the Vixen and also includes a poster of the box cover. High street chain Boots refused to stock the game, prompting Martech to re-issue the game with a less provocative cover. The cover of the May 1988 issue of Your Sinclair, which featured the photo was equally controversial as it attracted a number of complaints, in regards to the provocative nature of Russell's pose, different from the box cover. However, that issue became the second best selling issue ever released, with 80,368 issues sold.

The station is branded as \\"Coast Country 100.9\\". In January 2009, the station dropped its longtime classic rock format in favor of country music. It also serves as the \\"Vacationland\\" region affiliate of the Cleveland Browns Radio Network.Cleveland Browns - Coast 1009.com WMJK is currently owned by BAS Broadcasting.BAS Ohio Clear Channel Communications was its former owner, but as of November 16, 2006, it has been announced for sale as part of Clear Channel's divestiture of almost 450 small and middle-market radio properties in the U.S. The cluster was sold on January 15, 2008, to Fremont-based BAS Broadcasting, and BAS took over all three stations on February 1. BAS switched 100.9 The Coast from mostly locally originating programming (outside of the Bob and Tom morning show) to Waitt Radio Networks Genuine Classic Rock satellite format. As a country station, WMJK now uses Waitt's Country Today format. History =As WMEX and WLCO= This station first signed on the air targeting the local community with a blend of MOR music and Spanish- language programming as WMEX on July 16, 1981. The station was founded by Family Broadcasting and Communications Corporation, a company headed by Erasmo Cruz, Sr. Cruz also served as the station's general manager. At that time, the station maintained studios and offices at 806 Everett Road in Fremont, Ohio. The company later changed the station's call letters to WLCO on February 21, 1985 and reduced its Spanish-language programming to 18 hours a week in favor of adult contemporary music. Studios and offices were also moved to 1859 W. McPherson Avenue in Clyde. By 1992, the station had switched its format from adult contemporary to country. =As WNCG= On February 7, 1992, Family Broadcasting and Communications entered into an agreement to sell WLCO to S & S Communications Group, Inc, a partnership headed by Toledo radio sales executive Dave Searfoss and Michigan radio programmer Kent Smith, for $280,000. Upon acquisition of the station almost a month later, S & S Communications changed the station's format from country to 60's and 70's classic hits using the Satellite Music Network's \\"Pure Gold\\" format. With this change came a call letter switch to WNCG and the move of the station's studios and offices to 109 North Main Street in Clyde. In this incarnation, the station adopted the moniker \\"Northcoast Gold\\". Both men operated WNCG under a less-is-more principle, with a small staff and with them doing much of the on- air and sales work hands-on, allowing them to dedicate revenue to the highly aggressive promotion of their station. By this efficient means of operation, the lower-powered WNCG grew into a formidable competitor among its higher- powered competitors, largely due to its constant presence at live remote broadcasts for both paid clients and community events. WNCG also installed remote studios in various malls in its listening area, with appropriate signage, to inform listeners that they were on the air just about everywhere. It was a venture that demonstrated long-term profitability for both Smith and Searfoss. Wishing to relocate his family to northern Michigan to purchase a station for sale there, Smith, along with Searfoss, agreed to sell WNCG on November 7, 1997 for $2.2 million to Jacor Communications. Concurrently, Smith purchased WMJZ in Gaylord, Michigan early the following year. =As WCPZ and WMJK= Under Jacor's ownership, the station maintained its classic hits format, but in April 1998 adopted the call letters WCPZ, which had been long held by a Sandusky-based Top 40 station. The calls were switched in September 1999 to WMJK, which are retained today. Also that same year, Jacor became absorbed into Clear Channel Communications, prompting a name change for the licensee at around the same time. The station in 2001 moved its studios and offices to 1640 Cleveland Road in Sandusky, where it remains today with sister stations WLEC and WCPZ. On June 30, 2008, Clear Channel sold WMJK and several other stations along the Lake Erie corridor to Fremont-based BAS Broadcasting. Following the change in ownership, the station dropped its \\"Majic\\" moniker (though retaining the same call letters) and adopted its current country music format.

Albert Irvin Cassell (1895–1969) was a prominent mid-twentieth-century African-American architect in Washington, D.C., whose work shaped many academic communities in the United States. He designed buildings for Howard University in Washington D.C., Morgan State University in Baltimore, and Virginia Union University in Richmond. Cassell also designed and built civic structures for the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia. Early life Albert Irvin Cassell was born in Towson, Maryland, on June 25, 1895, the third child of Albert Truman Cassell and Charlotte Cassell. His father Albert T. Cassell was a coal truck driver and his mother Charlotte Cassell aka \\"Lottie\\" was a laundress. Albert Cassell began his education in the segregated Baltimore public school system, but moved to New York in 1909 where he began attending Douglas High School. At Douglas High, Cassell studied drafting under Ralph Victor Cook. With Cook's assistance, Cassell was admitted to the Cornell University architecture program in 1915, where he was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha. After completing two years at Cornell, Cassell's studies were interrupted by service in the US Army in World War I. He served in France, but not in combat, and was honorably discharged in 1919 as a second lieutenant in the 351st Heavy Field Artillery Regiment. In 1919 Cassell was awarded his degree from Cornell University, and began his career working with architect William A. Hazel. In 1920, Mr. Cassell joined in the Architecture Department of Howard University as assistant professor. Just two years later, in 1922, Cassell had become University Architect and head of the Architecture Department at Howard. Career Cassell worked at Howard University for eighteen years, serving as an instructor, land manager, surveyor, and architect. Cassell's vision and work helped shape the campus through his \\"Twenty Year Plan\\", through which he designed numerous campus buildings. His most important design at Howard, was the Founders Library, a building which evoked both the Georgian architecture revival style and Independence Hall in Philadelphia. This building would become an architectural and educational symbol for the university. While at Howard, Cassell also designed buildings for other institutional clients. His work included buildings at Virginia Union University, Provident Hospital in Baltimore, various Masonic temples, as well as smaller works for select commercial and residential clients. Following his time at Howard University, Cassell went on to design several buildings for Morgan State College (now Morgan State University) in Baltimore. In his later years he joined with other African-American architects to form the firm of Cassell, Gray & Sutton. He went on to work for several other large clients such as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington and the government of the District of Columbia. As his final project, Cassell sought to develop Chesapeake Heights on the Bay, a summer resort community for African-Americans in Prince Frederick, Calvert County, Maryland. The project was to feature houses, a motel, shopping centers, a pier, a marina, beaches, and a clubhouse fronting the Chesapeake Bay. Roads and a few homes were built by 1969, but the project ended with Cassell's death in that same year. Legacy At a young age Albert Cassell determined that his children would all go to Cornell and all become architects. Cassell had 8 children. Four children would attended Cornell; Charles Cassell ('46), Martha Cassell ('47) Alberta Jeannette Cassell ('48) Paula Cassell ('76). Of the Cornell graduates, all but Paula became architects. Works Two of Cassell's Washington, DC works, the Mayfair Mansions Apartments and the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

He was born in Cortez, Colorado and raised by his grandparents at Picuris Pueblo. He attended primary and secondary school in Peñasco, New Mexico and college at New Mexico Highlands University. When he returned to Picuris in 1976, he became intent on preventing the Picuris micaceous tradition of pottery from dying out. He had an excellent teacher in his grandmother Cora Durand. In 1976, Cora and Francis Martinez were the only ones making traditional Picuris-style pottery. With inspiration from his grandmother, Anthony was producing pottery on a full-time basis within a year. The primary and most important source for gathering micaceous clay by Picuris potters was located four and a half miles east of their village. In the Tiwa language of the Picuris people it is known as “Mowlownan-a” or “pot dirt place.” This site not only provided the best micaceous clay source but also had deep religious and traditional cultural significance for the Picuris people who had been gathering clay here for over 400 years. During the 1960s when mining operations commenced in the area this important clay source was fenced in with the rest of the land mines making it extremely difficult for potters to access the site. By the mid-1990s the Picuris people had lost all access to the site of “Mowlownan-a” which is now buried under tons of waste rock from mining activities. Anthony began to experiment with clays from other sources, as well as different techniques of burnishing and polishing. He uses gray sandstone as temper, which gives his pottery a distinctive look. The Picuris area contains a micaceous material that produces a high luster when used as slip. Since the pottery of Picuris was traditionally made for cooking, it has no painted decorations but instead includes sculpted details. The greenish-gold cast of the pottery is unique to Picuris pueblo. Using an old and unsigned Picuris pot as an example, he was able to reproduce the traditional golden color and high luster that has since become standard to his works. Pottery fragments from the ruins of the old Picuris Pueblo have also inspired some of his molded detail. He used cedar wood in his firing to achieve the gold finish. By the 1980s, his pieces were being sold in shops and galleries as well as at the Santa Fe Indian Market and the Picuris Arts and Crafts Fair. He shared a booth with his grandmother Cora Durand at the Micaceous Pottery Artists Convocation at the School of American Research in 1995. Anthony received several awards and honorable mention at the Santa Fe Indian Market along with first place awards for traditional pottery at the Picuris Tri-Cultural Fair. He died in 2009 at the age of 53. References * Anderson, Duane. All That Glitters: The Emergence of Native American Micaceous Art and Pottery in Northern New Mexico.

Last Word, BBC Radio 4, January 28, 2007. This in turn began with an impromptu act of kindness by Stewart. He was fired just before Christmas two years in a row, both in 1978 and 1979. Around Christmas of 1979, while nursing his wounds at a drive-in restaurant during a very cold day, he noticed a carhop working the cars outside. He recalled, \\"It was cold and this carhop didn't have on a very big jacket, and I thought to myself, 'I think I got it bad. She's out there in this cold making nickels and dimes.'\\" He gave her $20 and told her to keep the change. \\"And suddenly I saw her lips begin to tremble and tears begin to flow down her cheeks. She said, 'Sir, you have no idea what this means to me.'\\" Although he had also donated money to community charities in Kansas City and his hometown of Bruce, Mississippi, he believed in handing out cash directly to people in need because it is something people do not have to, as he said, \\"beg for, get in line for, or apply for.\\" Philanthropy Stewart made his fortune through cable television and long-distance calling. He kept his identity hidden until 2006, when he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which later claimed his life. Many suspected that his illness was the reason he decided to \\"out\\" himself, but according to Stewart, this is untrue. In an interview on the Dave Ramsey Radio Show, Stewart said he came out because a tabloid was about to reveal his identity, and he wanted to tell his own story before they did. Stewart's acts of kindness were not restricted to the Kansas City area. He has traveled to other metropolitan areas during times of local tragedy. He went to New York City in 2001 after September 11, and to Mississippi in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina devastated the area. After his illness, he began \\"training\\" other secret Santas, who were scheduled to give out $65,000 during the 2006 holiday season, in addition to the money Stewart gave out. His philanthropy has been supported and recognized by a number of well-known people, including Buck O'Neil, George Brett, Oprah Winfrey, and, in 2006 in Chicago, Dick Butkus (who had helped Larry as an \\"elf\\" since 2003). Death and legacy Stewart died on January 12, 2007, from esophageal cancer, aged 58. Since Stewart's death, his example has inspired others to continue his mission of philanthropy and of being a secret Santa. On Saturday, January 13, 2007, the day after he died, Stewart was given (posthumously) the 2006 John \\"Buck\\" O'Neil Award, which is one of several \\"Legacy Awards\\" presented by the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (NLBM). The \\"Buck O'Neil Award\\" is presented to a local or national corporate/private philanthropist for Outstanding Support of the NLBM. In 2014, an anonymous wealthy businessman, carrying on Stewart's tradition, deputized officers in the Jackson County sheriff’s office to hand out $100 to \\"deserving suspects\\": people they identified as likely to especially benefit, for example driving with dented cars. Another goal was helping to heal a rift opening up between the public and the police in the wake of the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown.

These Armenian national organizations established Armenian fedayeen () generally referred to as Armenian irregular units and the Russian Empire formed Armenian volunteer units, which recruited Ottoman Armenians from behind the Ottoman lines who had escaped murder at the hands of the Turks. They had no other choice but to help the Russian Caucasus Army against the Ottoman Empire. During this period the Siege of Van on April 20, 1915, and consequent establishment of the Administration for Western Armenia were significant events. The Ottoman Minister of Interior Mehmed Talat Pasha considered the Armenian population a fifth column within the Empire, blaming the rise of the Armenian national liberation movement for the overall unrest inside the Empire in his order on April 24, 1915 that ended with arrests/ murder of Armenian scholars, men in government leadership and scholars (Red Sunday). The Ottoman parliament passed the Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915, which enabled the massive deportation the Armenians from their historic homeland. These deportations and massacres resulted in the deaths of about 600,000 to 1,000,000 Armenians,Encyclopædia Britannica: Armenian Genocide and are referred to as the Armenian Genocide by most scholars of the period; official Turkish sources follow a denial campaign, often referring to an ″Armenian insurgency\\" and disputing the number of victims. Background There were previous Armenian resistances within the Ottoman Empire. The Sasun resistance of 1894 () was the resistance of the Hunchak militia of the Sassoun region. The Zeitun Rebellion took place in 1895, during the Hamidian massacres. The Defense of Van was the Armenian population in Van defense against the Ottoman Empire in June, 1896. The Khanasor Expedition (Armenian: ) was the Armenian militia's response on July 25, 1897, to the Defense of Van, where Mazrik tribe ambushed a squad of Armenian defenders and mercilessly slaughtered them. The Sasun uprising was the resistance of the Armenian militia in the Sassoun region. Mourat together with his companion, Sepouh, had fought at Sasoun, in 1904, and had taken part in the Armenian and Tartar clashes of 1905 and 1906 in the Caucasus. Sassouni, a Tashnak, argues that the Ottoman Empire's fundamental aim was to resolve the Armenian question by massacring the Armenian people and the Armenian national liberation movement's achievement between 1908 and 1914 (what was named as pre-genocide period) was the preparation and organization of nationwide armed resistance for the targets which were only forces against Armenian Revolutionary Federation.Garo Sassouni, A Critical Look at the 1915 Genocide, 1930, page 40.  Forces  Defenders of the Urfa Resistance The Armenian irregular units (called fedayeen) were formed to engage with resistance to Ottoman Forces and were composed of Armenian civilian volunteers (kamavor). Most of the leaders of the volunteers were also leaders and members of the Armenian national liberation movement. Some of the famous leaders were Murad of Sebastia, and Karekin Pastermadjian. Boghos Nubar was the elected speaker for the Armenian National Assembly who worked with French political and military authorities to culminate with the formation of the French Armenian Legion. Many of the Armenian volunteers for French Armenian legion were survivors from Musa Dagh.Walker. \\"World War I and the Armenian Genocide\\", p. 267. Beginning with 1917, the Armenian National Congress (1917) asked the Armenian soldiers and officers scattered throughout Russia to be gradually brought together. The plan was to mobilized Armenians of the Caucasus Front (Russian Republic) against the Ottoman Forces. The call for arms by the Armenian National Congress also received response with some Ottoman Armenian fedayeens, such as Murad of Sebastia, who fought bravely with these forces and died at the battlefields of Baku. The Ottoman Third Army was the major force in the Caucasus Campaign that acted against the Armenian volunteer units of the Russian Empire. Mahmut Kamil was the commander of the Third Army.Keith Neilson, 1983, Coalition Warfare, Published by Wilfrid Laurier University Press, page 49 ; W.E.D. Allen and Paul Muratoff, Caucasian Battlefields, A History of Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border, 1828–1921, 311. After the Armistice of Mudros, Mahmut Kamil was one of the Malta exiles.  Activities  = 1914 = Seventy year old priest leading Armenians In July 1914, before the World War I, both the Russian and the Turkish governments officially appealed to various Armenian national organizations (the Armenian National Congress of the Russian Empire and the Armenian National Assembly in the Ottoman Empire, respectively) with many promises of self governance in order to secure the active participation of the Armenians in the military operations against each other. The Ottomans held talks with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation during the Armenian congress at Erzurum The main of opposition in Ottoman Empire to Turco-German alliance were the Armenian people, who for four years and without an organized government or a national army, played the same role in the Near East by preventing the Turco-German advance toward the interior of Asia as the Belgians played in the West by stopping the march of Germany toward Paris. According to Erickson, after the meeting in Erzurum the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) was convinced of Armenian—Russian links with detailed plans aimed at the detachment of the region from the Ottoman Empire. In August 1914, during the First Zeitun Resistance the Hunchaks resisted to the Ottoman army in the city Zeitun. In October 20, 1914, a patrolling Ottoman unit in Köprüköy discovered Russian rifles cached in Armenian homes in Hasankale. The Third Army received reports of Armenians that served in Russian Army returning to the Ottoman Empire with operational maps and financial resources. On November 2, 1914, the Bergmann Offensive was launched. It was the first engagement of the Caucasus Campaign The Russian success was along the Southern shoulders of the offense where Armenian volunteers were effective and took Karaköse and Doğubeyazıt. On December 29, 1914, the Ottoman Army was defeated at the Battle of Sarikamish The Hugh Chisholm, 1920, Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Company ltd., twelve edition p.198. Armenian detachment battalions challenged the Ottoman operations during the critical times: \\"the delay enabled the Russian Caucasus Army to concentrate sufficient force around Sarikamish\\". = 1915 = Hunchakian leaders, The Twenty Martyrs On February 25, 1915, the \\"Directive 8682\\" was issued and distributed secretly in the form of a ciphered cable. The directive was received by the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Armies; the Iraq Command: I, II, III, IV, V Army Corps: and to the Jandarma Command, where the Armenian population was dominant. The title of the directive was \\"Increased Security Precautions\\". The directive began with summarising dissident Armenian activity in Bitlis, Aleppo, Dortyol, and Kayseri. The directive stated that the Russians and French had influence on activities in these areas. Finally, the directive ordered any ethnic Armenian soldiers should be removed from headquarters staff and taken out of command centers. According to Erickson, from February through July 1915 additional reports from provincial officials and lower level army units reinforced the pattern of allied intelligence gathering of Ottoman military activities. Talaat Pasha's (then Ottoman Ministry of the Interior) Intelligence Division noted that the Armenian Patriarchate in Constantinople was transmitting military secrets and dispositions to the Russians. It was believed at this time that a seventy- year-old priest was leading Armenians On March 25, Hunchaks of the city Zeitun begun the Second Zeitun Resistance against the Ottoman army. In April, around 30,000 Armenians in the city of Van, in addition to the Armenians from surrounding villages, defended themselves during the Siege of Van. The biggest achievement was the establishment of the Administration for Western Armenia headed by the Governor Aram Manukian, a Russian Armenian. Armenian irregular units kept the Ottoman army out at the cost of thousands of civilians killed. The initial armed resistance lasted for a period of less than a month. In May, the Armenian volunteer units with the Russian Caucasus Army entered the city of Van and successfully drove the Ottoman army out. On May 27, hundreds of Armenians were captured by Ottoman authorities in Urfa after the Urfa Resistance. At Urfa the Armenians repulsed the attacks of one division, but finally fell under heavy fire from artillery commanded by German officers. The Armenians destroyed all their property so that it would not fall into the hands of the Ottomans or Germans. In July, the resistance of Murad of Sebastia and his comrades occurred at Sivas. When deportations were ordered gendarmes were sent to capture Murad, he defended himself with his compatriots for a year and a half. On June 15, the Ottoman government hanged the famous 20 Hunchakian gallows. Armenians resisted for a month with Shabin-Karahisar uprising until Neshed Pasha left Sivas with three regiments and artillery to subdue them. On August 19, Armenian defended the city of Van for a second time until the arrival of Russian Caucasus Army, when General Andranik Ozanian lifted the siege. = 1916 = Resistance of Mourat and his comrades occurred at Sivas. Later Mourat led the volunteers at Battle of Erzinjan. Later died in at the Battle of Baku. In 1916, Murad moved to Samsun, with a sail-boat traveled to the Russian port of Batum. He led his volunteers to the Battle of Erzinjan. =1918= In May, there were fierce combats between the Armenians who remained firm and the Ottoman forces beginning with the Battle of Abaran. Between May 24–26, Armenians under Movses Silikyan defeated the Ottoman troops in the three-day long Battle of Sardarapat. Between May 24–28, the Armenian defenders at the Battle of Karakilisa managed to turn back being outnumbered by the invading Ottoman forces. After violent battle for 4 days both parties had serious losses and the Ottoman army had no more forces to continue deeper into Armenian territory. In September, Murad of Sebastia and his volunteers were at Battle of Baku, where he died in the fighting. Art and culture Armenian resistance has left a symbolic dish.

Early life Namgyal Rinpoche was born Leslie George Dawson in 1931, October 11, and raised in Toronto, Canada by parents of Irish and Scottish descent and attended Jarvis Baptist Seminary, before going on to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, USA, where he studied philosophy and psychology and became active in Socialist politics. After visiting Moscow to address an international youth conference, he became disillusioned with politics, and moved to London in 1954. Theravada studies in Asia While in London he studied Buddhism and in 1956 met the Sayadaw U Thila Wunta, a Burmese monk who accepted Leslie Dawson as a student. That same year he traveled to Bodh Gaya, India to rejoin the Sayadaw and received ordination as a sāmaṇera (novice monk). He continued on to Burma where he was ordained as Anandabodhi bhikkhu at the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon on . He began intensive training and meditation practice under the guidance of U Thila Wunta and Mahasi Sayadaw, then in Thailand with Chao Khun Phra Rajasiddhimuni at Wat Mahadhatu in Bangkok. In Sri Lanka he studied the Pāli Canon, the Visuddhimagga, and other classical texts before receiving the title acharya (teacher of Dhamma). Return to the United Kingdom and Canada In 1962 Ananda Bodhi returned to England at the invitation of the English Sangha Trust. He was a special guest speaker at the Fifth International Congress of Psychotherapists in London where he met Julian Huxley, Anna Freud and R.D. Laing, among others. In 1965 he founded the Johnstone House Contemplative Community, a retreat center near Dumfries in Scotland. A year earlier he had met Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Akong Tulku, Tibetan lamas at Oxford sent by the 16th Karmapa to study and live in the West. Ananda Bodhi provided the lamas with assistance and saw to the transfer of ownership of Johnstone House to the Tibetan Karma Kagyu Order which transformed the old hunting lodge into Samye Ling, one of the first Buddhist centers in the West. (Earlier Tibetan centres were the Kalachakra Temple of Saint Petersburg, Russia, founded in 1915; the temple founded by Kalmykian refugees in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1929, and the Lamaist Buddhist Center in Howell, New Jersey, US, founded in 1958). In 1965 Ananda Bodhi returned to Canada with two of his senior students, Tony Olbrecht and Barry Goulden, where he established a new community, The Dharma Centre of Canada (1966, incorporated as a charity 1970), and founded the Centennial Lodge of the Theosophical Society (1967). Over the years that followed, he began to stress the study of Western psychology and philosophy, exercise, diet, and the appreciation of fine art and music as a supplement to traditional Buddhist training, and began taking students with him on voyages to various countries around the world, often on cargo ships. As Namgyal Rinpoche During a pilgrimage with students to India and Sikkim in 1968, Anandabodhi was recognized by the 16th Karmapa, the supreme head of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, as an accomplished master and received Vajrayana robes [2]. In 1971 he led a large group of students to India where they had an audiences with Sakya Trizen at Dehra Dun and the Dalai Lama at Dharamshala. At Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim they received empowerments by the 16th Karmapa who gave Ananda Bodhi his Tibetan name. On his return to Canada he was enthroned (October 1971) with due ceremony as Karma Tenzin Dorje Namgyal Rinpoche at Green River, Ontario, by Karma Thinley Rinpoche, as instructed by the Karmapa. The following year he led another large group of students to Morocco for a four-month retreat, then back to India for an extended audience with Sakya Trizin of the Sakya Order. In 1973 a large group of students joined him in New Zealand on Lake Rotoiti for a three-month meditation retreat. Thereafter, Namgyal Rinpoche practised and taught in the Vajrayana tradition of Tibetan Buddhism as well as Theravadin and Mahayana schools. He was empowered and recognised by many teachers such as Sakya Trizin and Chogye Rinpoche of the Sakyas, Dudjom Rinpoche of the Nyingma sect, and various Kagyu lamas including Kalu Rinpoche, one of the Karmapa's main teachers. In subsequent years Namgyal Rinpoche inspired the establishment of dharma centers around the world. He continued to teach until his death in Switzerland on October 22, 2003, having empowered a number of senior students to continue his work.

It collects seeds from wild plant populations worldwide, with an emphasis on palms and cycads. The garden is a scientific research facility, and not generally open to the public. The center was established in 1959 by Nell Montgomery Jennings in memory of her husband, Robert Hiester Montgomery, co-founder of Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden. It occupies the former site of their estate, the Coconut Grove Palmetum. Today the property is organized into four geographic areas: the Coconut Grove Palmetum, South Palmetum, Lowland Palmetum, and Research which in turn contains research laboratories, the Montgomery Library, a herbarium, and nursery facilities. The center includes nursery facilities operated by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden on eight acres leased by the Center to the Garden. The center's collections provide genetically diverse population samples of wild-collected palms and cycads, with thorough documentation of each plant. They aim to represent the full morphologic and genetic diversities within a species throughout its known native geographic range. As of 2004 the gardens contained a total of 997 taxa in 4,761 accessions and 10,809 plants.

Although the nurseries suffered extensive damage during the 2005 hurricane season, by 2006 they had been almost fully repaired. Plants and seeds have been collected in over 50 expeditions to countries and territories including Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guadeloupe, Guam, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, New Caledonia, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Southern Africa, Spain, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. In 2018, the Center's executive director, Patrick Griffith, noted that the garden's palm trees had proved more resistant to saltwater than previously expected. However, Griffith noted, a third of the garden's current property would likely be underwater in a century due to climate change.

He was wounded in both the Pacific and European Theaters of Operation. He commanded a recon team and also an anti-landmine platoon. He was a subject- matter expert on captured Nazi war documents. Wolfe worked for 34 years at the Archives, functioning as its senior specialist for captured German and related records. Military career Wolfe received head wounds in both theaters. While recovering from his first wound, he served in a training cadre in Ohio. After receiving his second head wound in France, he was assigned to the Office of Military Censorship in Paris, France. After the end of the European war, he joined the Office of Military Government in Heidelberg, Germany. At first his duties were with the prosecutors' office for the Nuremberg War Crimes trials. After the trials ended, he worked with U.S. efforts to rebuild the German civilian government. The office manager in 1947 was Ingeborg Edith Kirch. She and Wolfe were married in 1948 before leaving Germany for the U.S. They returned to Manhattan, New York City, where Robert completed his education at Columbia University. While working on his doctorate, he taught history and political science at Brooklyn College. NARA career He joined the National Archives in 1961, upon concluding service as a member of the American Historical Association team microfilming captured German records at the World War II Records Center in Alexandria, Virginia. =Berlin Document Center= Wolfe also served as archival consultant to the Department of State for the Berlin Document Center (BDC) and as Special Adviser to Eli Wiesel for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. His publications include: Captured German and Related Records: a National Archives Conference (1974) and Americans as Proconsuls: U.S. Military Government in Germany and Japan, 1944-52 (1984). As archival consultant to the Department of State for the BDC from 1968 to 1994, Wolfe was the chief American negotiator for the return to the West German government of original captured Nazi Party personnel records assembled by the victors at the BDC. During that time, he wrote official reports and presented and published papers concerning the history of those records, specifically including reference to the discovery and capture of the Nazi Party records found at the paper mill in Schwabing-Freimann, Germany. One such publication was \\"A Short History of the Berlin Document Center\\", written as a Preface to \\"The Holdings of the Berlin Document Center: A Guide to the Collections\\" (BDC, Berlin, 1994). In 2001, Wolfe wrote a monograph describing the discovery of the Nazi Party's worldwide membership card file by U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps Agent Michel Thomas in early May 1945. =Interagency Working Group= Wolfe was one of eight independent historians employed by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) to assist in implementing the declassification and disclosures under the provisions of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act (NWCDA). The IWG had been established to oversee the review of Federal agency records under consideration for declassification. These historians served as ex officio members of the IWG and were involved in all aspects of the IWG's work with German and Japanese Imperial war records in order to comply with the \\"largest congressionally mandated declassification project in U.S. history\\". The eight million pages of material declassified by the IWG under the NWCDA added significantly to the publicly available information about Nazi war crimes, collaborators, and the lives of selected criminals following the war. Wolfe was one of the authors of a 2004 report entitled U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis which was revised and released the following year, 2005, by Cambridge University Press as a book. Among the senior Nazis intensely sought by the Allies was Heinrich Müller, who was head of the Gestapo. No arrest was reported; no body was identified. Both the Soviets and the West wanted to interrogate him about many aspects of the war. Wolfe and three other historians analyzed what evidence was available. Their conclusion, \\"The Mystery of Heinrich Müller: New Materials from the CIA,\\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies published in 2001, was that Müller had been killed in Berlin as the war drew to a close. The expertise of the historians in the searching process and their resulting analysis of the records was a major contribution to public understanding of World War II war crimes and the involvement of U.S. agencies relating to those charged or suspected of war crimes. Death and tributes Wolfe died in Alexandria, Virginia on December 9, 2014, survived by his wife and two sons. He directed that there be no funeral but, that he be buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was buried, along with his wife, who died on April 2, 2015, on July 10, 2015 . He was among the last of the subject specialists at the National Archives. Shlomo Aronson paid tribute to his memory as \\"a treasurer of the WWII records at the US National Archives, and a warm, humorous mensch. ...

He served in the House of Burgesses before being elected a Justice of the Virginia Court of Appeals (now the Supreme Court of Virginia). He was a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, and cast his vote for ratification of the United States Constitution. Biography Carrington was born at \\"Boston Hill\\" in Cumberland County, Colony of Virginia on March 16, 1733, the son of Col. George Carrington (1711–1785) and Johanna Mayo (1712–1785). His paternal grandparents were Dr. Paul Carrington and Henningham Codrington, who had migrated from England to the Island of Barbados; his father immigrated to the Colony of Virginia in 1723. Carrington's maternal grandparents were Major William Mayo and Frances Gould.Brown, Alexander. The Cabells and Their Kin. Garrett and Massie, 1939, p. 223. At about age 17, he began to study law under Colonel Clement Read in Lunenburg County and received his license to practice in May 1755, signed by Peyton Randolph, John Randolph and George Wythe. On October 1 of that year he was married to Margaret Read, Col. Read's second daughter, and they resided at Mulberry Hill. Their children included George Carrington (1756–1809), Mary Scott Carrington Venable (1758–1837), Ann Carrington Cabell (1760–1838), Clement Carrington (1762–1847) and Paul Carrington (1764–1816). Carrington was for many years a vestryman and churchwarden of Cornwall Parish. He was appointed king's attorney of Bedford County in 1756, major of the Lunenburg County militia in 1761, and colonel of the Charlotte County militia in 1764. After practicing law in the county courts, Carrington was elected to the House of Burgesses from Charlotte County, from its first formation out of Lunenburg in 1765 until 1775. His wife died May 1, 1766, and he said of her, \\"she was the best of wives and a woman of innumerable virtues.\\" He was appointed king's attorney of Mecklenburg County in 1767, of Botetourt County in 1770, and of Lunenburg County in 1770. Carrington was additionally made county lieutenant and presiding justice of Charlotte in 1772 and clerk of Halifax County that year. He was chairman of the Charlotte County Committee from 1774–1776, which endorsed the resolutions of the Continental Congress,Brown, Alexander. The Cabells and Their Kin. Garrett and Massie, 1939, p. 224. and in 1775 became a member of the first Board of Trustees in the founding of Hampden-Sydney College.Brinkley, John Luster. On This Hill: A narrative history of Hampden–Sydney College, 1774–1994. Hampden–Sydney: 1994, p.10. \\"Mulberry Hill\\", Carrington's home and resting place He was elected a Judge of the first Virginia General Court under the newly adopted Virginia state constitution on January 23, 1778; as such, he thereby became the second Justice appointed to the new Court of Appeals, which was then composed of the judges from the General, the Admiralty and the Chancery Courts. In 1780 he became the Chief Justice of the Virginia General Court. In 1789, he was elected by the Virginia General Assembly to be a Justice of the reorganized Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. In 1788, Carrington was a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, by which Virginia narrowly ratified the United States Constitution, by a vote of 89 – 79. Although he voted in favor of ratification, he also played a vigorous role in the development of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which assisted as a model for the U.S. Bill of Rights.Brown, Alexander. The Cabells and Their Kin. Garrett and Massie, 1939, p. 225. On March 6, 1792 Carrington married his second wife, Priscilla Sims, aged 16. Their children were: Henry Carrington (1793–1867), Lettice Priscilla Carrington Coles (1798–1875) and Robert Carrington (1802–1845). She died in September 1803 and he recorded that her loss was irreparable to him and to her family.Brown, Alexander. The Cabells and Their Kin. Garrett and Massie, 1939, p. 226. At age 75, concerned as to his ability to fulfill his judicial duties, Carrington resigned from the bench in 1807. On August 1 of that year he wrote, \\"I have served the public a great many years, and I know with faithful integrity, I had arrived to a time of life that every man ought, in my opinion, to retire, and not remain and die at his post as some of my brethren have.\\" Despite his fears, Judge Carrington lived in retirement another 11 years until he died at the age of 85. Judge Carrington is buried between his wives on the grounds at Mulberry Hill near Randolph, Virginia; his home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. His papers, with the papers of his sons Clement and Robert Carrington, are held by the Library of Virginia. They encompass a wide variety of documents, including powers of attorney, judicial records, receipts, tax records, and deeds for the purchase of land and slaves.

It existed from 1950 until 1957 and specialized in classical music. Unfortunately, the discs suffered from considerable surface noise.Soundfountain website History The earliest Remington recordings were made in Vienna. They were produced by Marcel Prawy from 1950 till 1953. In 1953 Berlin became the recording venue outside the United States.Soundfountain Producer Don Gabor, recording director Laszlo Halasz and engineer Robert Blake made the very first commercial stereophonic tape recordings in the United States in 1953 with Thor Johnson and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. They included Dvořák's Symphony No. 8 (then No. 4) and symphonic and choral works by Sibelius. These stereo recordings were released as mono records in 1954. Mono and stereo recordings were also made in Berlin with the RIAS (Radio in the American Sector) Symphony Orchestra. The recordings were supervised by Don Gabor and conductor Laszlo Halasz. Besides the Cincinnati Symphony recordings, other recordings were made in America with various classical artists, including violinist George Enescu, pianist Jorge Bolet, and violinist Ossy Renardy, among others. Some of Remington's mono and stereo tapes were released in the late 1970s on the Varèse-Sarabande label. Producer Tom Null and his technicians applied a different equalization for the new matrices and this resulted in far better pressings and improved sound. Thor Johnson's recordings for Remington were: *R-199-168 Dvorak: Symphony No. 4 (8th) *R-199-182 Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 2 with Jorge Bolet, pianist (reissued in 1974 in stereo on Turnabout TV-S 34543) *R-199-184 Gershwin: Concerto in F with Alec Templeton, pianist *R-199-185 Ward: Third Symphony; Stein: Three Hassidic Dances. *R-199-187 Tchaikovsky: Symphony No. 2 *R-199-188 Brant: Concerto for Alto Saxophone, Sigurd Rascher soloist (coupled with Glanville-Hicks: Gymnopedies 1, 2 and 3; Rudhyar: Sinfonietta; performed by the RIAS Symphony Orchestra conducted by Jonel Perlea) *R-199-191 Sibelius: The Origin of Fire with the Helsinki University Chorus (coupled with Glazunov's Violin Concerto, played by André Gabriel and the RIAS Symphony conducted by Georg Ludwig Jochum) Don Gabor produced recordings in the 1940s for his Continental label. Best known are the Continental recordings he made with George Enesco of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas. But in the 78 rpm era he recorded several jazz musicians such as Sarah Vaughan, Don Byas, Cozy Cole, and Dizzy Gillespie, as well as popular musicians on Continental. He later reissued most of these recordings on the Remington label and the other labels he had: Masterseal, Plymouth, Merit, Masque, Buckingham, Webster, and Paris.

Schober (born November 7, 1964) is an American psychologist who is currently the dean of the New School for Social Research in New York City. He began teaching at The New School in 1992 as an assistant professor. His own academic background began at Brown University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in cognitive science. He then pursued a Ph.D. at Stanford University in psychology. Further credits to his name include: the editor of the journal Discourse Processes, and a member of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology and the Psychonomic Society. Schober also actively engages in research while fulfilling his duties as professor at the New School for Social Research. Some of his research interests are within the fields of, but not limited to: linguistics, psychology, music, public opinion research analysis, and artificial intelligence. His interest in music may stem from the fact that he is a classical pianist. His sister, Monica Schober is a German Lieder recitalist. He has performed solo, but specializes in chamber and collaborative music. In February 2003, Michael Schober accompanied his sister in a performance of Wagner’s Wesendonck Lieder and selected songs of Richard Strauss, Hugo Wolf, and Johannes Brahms at Steinway Hallhttp://www.steinwayhall.com/ in New York City.  Research interests  Schober identifies himself on his personal webpage as a psychologist who \\"studies how people coordinate their actions, the mental processes underlying that coordination, and how new technologies mediate coordination.\\" Schober's publications are used in many psycholinguistic-based classes at universities across the United States to achieve an up-to-date look at empirical research in the field of psychology specifically psycholinguistics. Schober's work focuses on concepts important to understanding human communications. Some of these most popular publications were in collaboration with Herbert H. Clark, a professor at Stanford University. Michael Schober studied with Clark while attending Stanford University, Clark being a professional and academic mentor to Schober. Schober's first recorded publication was in 1989. It was entitled “Addressees and Overhearers” and was published with Herbert H. Clark. In this article the collaborative view is used to discuss the way individuals understand each other during a conversation, or any situation where a speaker addresses another individual to convey information. Schober and Clark propose that addressees have an advantage to speakers and overhearers because in conversations individuals accumulate information based on common ground. The research leading to the publication of this article included experiments using students at the university level. In the first experiment 10 pairs of students were given two roles: director and matcher. The director was recorded while giving directions for the matcher on how to complete an arrangement of twelve in a particular order. The recording of the director was then played for 40 'overhearers.' The second experiment used the same task and number of pairs, but this time the overhearers joined the groups and listened to the conversations. The participants were all separated from each other by visual barriers and precautions were taken to rule out extraneous variables. A more recent publication in 2004 in collaboration with Fredrick G. Conrad and Scott S. Fricker was entitled “Misunderstanding standardized language in research interviews. In this study two types of experiments were used to understand the way in which individuals interpret words in survey interviews, aptitude tests, and instructions accompanying an experiment. One experiment was a factorial experiment, and the other was a more naturalistic investigation. Participants were required to interpret ordinary survey concepts such as: household furniture. The results show that an investigators actions influence the participants’ answers in both experiments. Study one suggests that interviewers should, in fact, be trained to give clarification when conveying instructions to participants of a study/experiment. Study two suggests that following a script too strictly can lead to a poorer understanding of the information that the interviewer is trying to convey.

Biography Uvarov was the son of Count Sergey Uvarov, an influential minister of education. He came to know the leading historians of the period, Mikhail Pogodin and Timofey Granovsky, from an early age. He was educated at the universities of St. Petersburg, Berlin, and Heidelberg. After his father's death, he commemorated his name by instituting (in 1857) the Uvarov Prize, to be awarded by the Academy of Sciences to distinguished writers and historians. Uvarov's activities as a field archaeologist began with visits to Rostov, Vladimir, Chernigov and other centres of Kievan Rus. Starting in 1854, he excavated the Meryan-Norse settlement at Sarskoe Gorodishche. He summarized his findings in The Meryans and Their Lifestyle as Shown by Kurgan Excavations. Subsequent expeditions took him to Pontic Olbia, Tauric Chersonesus, and Scythian Neapolis. Uvarov was a towering presence in the history of the Russian Archaeological Society. In 1864 he helped organize the Moscow Archaeological Society, of which he remained president until his death. During Uvarov's administration, the society would convene one time in three years at some ancient Russian town. More importantly in the long run, Uvarov contributed to the establishment of the State Historical Museum, with the intention of promoting national self- awareness. Although his judgement was not always accurate and his methods of research may appear amateurish to a modern observer, Uvarov's work greatly advanced knowledge of pre-Slavic cultures inhabiting the European part of the Russian Empire. Two volumes of Russian Archaeology in the Prehistoric Period contain his delineation of Eastern European prehistory.

Merrie Melodies cartoon supervised by Chuck Jones. The title character, Conrad the Cat, is voiced by Pinto Colvig and animated by the quintet. The other featured player is Daffy Duck, voiced as usual by Mel Blanc. Plot synopsis The story takes place aboard a battleship staffed by anthropomorphic cats (which strangely look like dogs with their small ears), most of whom are singing \\"The Song of the Marines (Shovin' Right Off Again)\\" as a chorale group. Cut to Conrad, who talks and sings exactly like Colvig's characterization of the Walt Disney character \\"Goofy\\". As Conrad swabs the deck, he is interrupted by Daffy when he spots his muddy footprints on the deck and Daffy on the mast, and he angrily mutters the song to himself. On the mast, Daffy paces back and forth, mocking Conrad's singing, then remarks to the audience \\"Phew, is that guy awful? Gee, it makes me sick\\". Conrad tries to ignore Daffy and his pranks, growing more suspicious and annoyed at Daffy, who deliberately swaps Conrad's water bucket with a paint bucket, causing Conrad to paint the deck, to which Daffy comments \\"Very sloppy, Roscoe. You're a slovenly housekeeper\\". Conrad angrily throws the mop at Daffy, who then catches it, uses it in a short vaudeville routine before tossing the mop into the air, and shouts to Conrad \\"Catch! Catch!\\", only the mop lands on Conrad's head. The camera angle shows Daffy on top of the mop, again taunting to Conrad \\"Very petite, Betsy. Very, very petite\\" before sliding down the mop and an infuriated Conrad, twisting him and the mop. Conrad finally gets fed up with Daffy, and proceeds to chase him, but Daffy outsmarts him at every turn from hiding in a lifeboat and after Conrad mistakes him for a telescope, keeping watch for Daffy. A running gag in the picture is that all action screeches to a halt whenever the ship's diminutive Admiral walks by, as both sailor and duck snap to attention and salute. The final gag involves Conrad and Daffy being chased by a shell from one of the ship's big guns. All three, including the shell, snap to attention as the Admiral walks by before the chase continues as the cartoon ends with an iris out.

Richard Lewis, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2015; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014) was a British Army officer who later became a pioneer in the study of political violence.  Career  Clutterbuck was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1937 after graduating in mechanical sciences from Pembroke College, Cambridge. After Dunkirk, he went through both the Western Desert and Italian campaigns. The army sent Clutterbuck to different hotspots, including Palestine (1947) during the Irgun Zvei Leumi's terrorist campaign. In 1956, up against Chinese communists, Lieutenant-Colonel Clutterbuck shed his rank badges to go on patrol as an ordinary soldier. As chief engineer Far East, 1966–68, Brigadier Clutterbuck put into practice in northeast Thailand the counter-terrorist philosophy he was gradually evolving. His next job after Thailand was the top one, as Engineer-in-Chief (1968–70) at the Ministry of Defence. While in the Far East, however, he had started to read for a PhD in politics. In 1968, he enrolled at the University of London. His last army post was back in the specialisation he had created for himself, as chief army instructor of the Royal College of Defence Studies, devoted to peacekeeping or \\"low-intensity operations\\" as they were now termed. His Who's Who entry gave his recreations as \\"sailing, canoeing and the study of revolution\\". On retirement in 1972 he received his PhD, and marched straight into the post of lecturer in political conflict at Exeter University. Nicholas Shakespeare reports that Clutterbuck's secret visits to Lima, Peru in the early 1990s transformed police and army operations against the Sendero Luminoso when the organisation appeared on the verge of overthrowing the government. His advice that a forensic rather than militaristic approach be taken to counter-terrorist operations was successfully applied by police chiefs such as General Antonio Ketin Vidal and led directly to the arrest of Abimael Guzman, leader of the Senderistas, and the winding up of his organisation.

He was elected as one of the first justices to serve on the Virginia Court of Appeals (which later became known as the Supreme Court of Virginia), and he later became the second President and Chief Justice of the Court. Biography Lyons was born in Ireland about 1734. He graduated from Trinity College, University of Dublin. Following this, he came to King William County, Virginia, and studied law under his uncle, James Power. He was admitted to the bar on February 5, 1756, and started to practice law in the county courts. On October 20, 1779, Lyons was elected to the general court, which made him an ex officio member of the Court of Appeals. In 1788, the Court of Appeals was reorganized and the judges, reduced to five in number, were to be elected by a joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly. The first five, elected on December 24, 1788, were Edmund Pendleton, John Blair Jr., Peter Lyons, Paul Carrington and William Fleming. Peter Lyons was elected from Hanover County. In 1789, John Blair left the Virginia Court to become a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. This left Peter Lyons the second ranking member of the Virginia Court of Appeals, which he presided over in the absence of Pendleton. When Pendleton died in 1803, Lyons succeeded him as president, running a court of with just three of the original five justices. Lyons maintained the position of president and chief justice until his death six years later in Hanover County on July 30, 1809. References External links * T.
