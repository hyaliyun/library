Some of the primary concerns include whether the Bush administration or the United States Armed Forces had awareness of the planned attack methods, the precise volume of intelligence that American agencies had regarding al-Qaeda activities inside the United States, whether the put options placed on United Airlines and American Airlines and other trades indicate foreknowledge, and why the identities of the traders have never been made public. Additional facets of the conspiracy theories include debate as to whether warnings received from foreign agencies were specific enough to have warranted preventive action, whether domestic intelligence about planned al-Qaeda attacks was thorough enough to have mandated intervention, the extent to which the alleged hijackers were under surveillance prior to the attacks, and whether Mossad or the Pakistani Inter- Services Intelligence were aware of an imminent attack. Using planes as missiles Immediately following the attacks, President George W. Bush stated that: \\"Nobody in our government at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envisage flying air planes into buildings\\" and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice claimed: \\"no-one could have predicted that they would try to use an airplane as a missile\\". An Air Force general called the attack: \\"something we had never seen before, something we had never even thought of.\\" Also published as: \\"Pentagon was unprepared for attack\\", \\"Pentagon explains why it didn't evacuate building\\", \\"Pentagon Unprepared for 'Something We Had Never Even Thought Of'\\" A few days after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller announced: \\"There were no warning signs that I'm aware of that would indicate this type of operation in the country.\\"The Public Education Center. However, Mueller noted that an FBI agent in Minneapolis said Moussaoui might be that type of person that could fly something into the World Trade Center. Mueller said this warning should have been followed more vigorously. Some mainstream media reports have conflicted with these statements, claiming that the FBI, CIA and Executive Branch knew of the threat of planes being used as missiles as early as 1995, following the foiling of the Bojinka Plot. In September 2002, one year after the 9/11 attacks, The Chicago Sun-Times reported that: > The FBI had advance indications of plans to hijack U.S. airliners and use > them as weapons, but neither acted on them nor distributed the intelligence > to local police agencies.

Actually, > elements of the suicide hijacking plan were known to the FBI as early as > 1995 and, if coupled with current information, might have uncovered the > plot. The Pentagon Mass Casualty project (codenamed Pentagon Mascal) was a contingency exercise that was held in the Office of the Secretary of Defense conference room between October 24 and October 26, 2000. The exercise required emergency response teams, members of the defense protective services, and U.S. government officials to conduct emergency simulations in preparation for a possible plane crash into the Pentagon. The book The Terror Timeline includes numerous articles that are often cited to suggest that the method of flying planes into buildings was known by U.S. officials:Complete 911 Timeline: Key Warnings . *In 1994, there were three examples of failed attempts to deliberately crash planes into buildings, including one where a lone pilot crashed a small plane into the lawn of the White House.Did Bush Know? :: Warning Signs of 9‚Äì11 and Intelligence Failures :: (by Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed) ‚Äì Media Monitors Network. *The Bojinka Plot was a foiled large-scale al-Qaeda terrorist attack to blow up eleven airliners and their passengers as they flew from Asia to America, due to take place in January 1995. *The 2000 edition of the FAA's annual report on Criminal Acts Against Aviation said that although Osama bin Laden 'is not known to have attacked civil aviation, he has both the motivation and the wherewithal to do so,' adding, 'Bin Laden's anti-Western and anti-American attitudes make him and his followers a significant threat to civil aviation, particularly to U.S. civil aviation.'\\" *In April 2001, NORAD ran a war game in which the Pentagon was to become incapacitated; a NORAD planner proposed the simulated crash of a hijacked foreign commercial airliner into the Pentagon, but the Joints Chiefs of Staff rejected that scenario as \\"too unrealistic\\"NORAD had drills of jets as weapons By Steven Komarow and Tom Squitieri, USA TODAY.

That NORAD was aware of the threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United States, and using them as guided missiles, was flatly denied by the 9/11 Commission, which asserted several times in their report that \\"The threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United Statesand using them as guided missileswas not recognized by NORAD before 9/11.\\" The September 11 attacks in 2001 occurred during that year's Global Guardian and Vigilant Guardian joint exercises. That year, according to the 9/11 Commission Report, Vigilant Guardian 'postulated a bomber attack from the former Soviet Union' on North America. In contrast to the 9/11 Commission Report - Michael Ruppert has characterized Vigilant Guardian as \\"a hijacking drill, not a cold war exercise\\". He cites direct quotes from participants which indicate \\"that the drill involved hijacked airliners rather than Russian Bombers\\". General Arnold, Tech. Sgt. W. Powel and Lt. Col. Dwane Deskins have stated that when they first were informed about hijacked airliners they thought it was \\"part of the exercise\\".' (read more at Global Guardian and the September 11 Attacks) The Joint Inquiry of 2002 confirmed that the Intelligence Community had received at least twelve reports over a seven-year period suggesting that terrorists might use planes as weapons. After briefly discussing each of them, it says that \\"The CIA disseminated several of these reports to the FBI and to agencies responsible for preventive actions. They included the FAA... Despite these reports, the Intelligence Community did not produce any assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use planes as weapons, and U.S. policymakers apparently remained unaware of this kind of potential threat.\\"part 2, pp. 209, 212.

The 9/11 Commission Report concluded that \\"Exhaustive investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions.\\" The report further stated: =WTC hard drive restoration operation= In December 2001 and early 2002, there was extensive media coverage of the efforts by the German data retrieval company Convar to reconstruct, using laser scanning technology, data from damaged hard drives recovered from the WTC as part of the investigation into a surge in financial transactions just before the two hijacked planes crashed into New York's World Trade Center. The company's CEO, Peter Henschel, noting that the investigation was being conducted for a number of U.S. based clients cooperating with the FBI, said that there was suspicion that criminals had used inside knowledge about the attacks to make and authorize financial transactions during the chaos. According to Convar's data retrieval expert Richard Wagner, criminal transactions in excess of 100 million dollars could have been made in the hope that their trail would have disappeared as a result of the destruction of the WTC mainframe computers. As reported by the Heute Journal, a news programme by the German ZDF TV channel, by March 2002 Convar had been able to restore several hundred hard drives from the WTC. However, the 9/11 Commission, in a memorandum entitled \\"FBI Briefing on Trading\\" dated October 18, 2003, said that when asked about the media coverage of the hard drive restoration operation, the \\"assembled [FBI] agents expressed no knowledge of the reported hard-drive recovery effort\\", further noting that one New York agent argued that it was \\"extremely unlikely that any hard-drives survived to the extent that they data [sic] be recovered.\\" =Later research= The papers of several finance researchers also suggest that some profited from foreknowledge of 9/11. In 2006, Allen Poteshman, a professor of Finance from the University of Illinois, published an analysis of the airline stock option trades preceding the attacks. This peer-reviewed study, published by the University of Chicago Press, came to the conclusion that an indicator of long put volume was \\"unusually high which is consistent with informed investors having traded in the option market in advance of the attacks\\". In January 2010, a team of Swiss financial experts published evidence for at least thirteen informed trades in which the investors had apparent foreknowledge of the attacks. Finally, in April 2010, an international team of experts showed that there was a significant abnormal increase in trading volume in the option market just before the 9/11 attacks in contrast to the absence of abnormal trading volume over periods long before the attacks, concluding that their findings were \\"consistent with insiders anticipating the 9-11 attacks\\". Intelligence warnings The 9/11 Commission Report states that \\"the 9/11 attacks were a shock, but they should not have come as a surprise. Islamic extremists had given plenty of warnings that they meant to kill Americans indiscriminately and in large numbers.\\"9/11 Commission Report Executive Summary, p. 2. The report continued: > During the spring and summer of 2001, U.S. intelligence agencies received a > stream of warnings about an attack al-Qaeda planned, as one report puts it > \\"something very, very, very big.\\" Director of Central Intelligence George > Tenet told us \\"the system was blinking red.\\"9/11 Commission Report Executive > Summary, p. 6. The US administration, CIA and FBI received multiple prior warnings from foreign governments and intelligence services, including France, Germany, the UK, Israel, Jordan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Morocco and Russia. The warnings varied in their level of detail, but all stated that they believed an al-Qaeda attack inside the United States was imminent. British Member of Parliament Michael Meacher cites these warnings, suggesting that some of them must have been deliberately ignored. Some of these warnings include the following: *March 2001 ‚Äì Italian intelligence warns of an al-Qaeda plot in the United States involving a massive strike involving aircraft, based on their wiretap of al-Qaeda cell in Milan. *July 2001 ‚Äì Jordanian intelligence told US officials that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on American soil, and Egyptian intelligence warned the CIA that 20 al-Qaeda Jihadists were in the United States, and that four of them were receiving flight training. *August 2001 ‚Äì The Israeli Mossad gives the CIA a list of 19 terrorists living in the US and says that they appear to be planning to carry out an attack in the near future. *August 2001 ‚Äì The United Kingdom is warned three times of an imminent al-Qaeda attack in the United States, the third specifying multiple airplane hijackings. According to the Sunday Herald, the report is passed on to President Bush a short time later. *September 2001 ‚Äì Egyptian intelligence warns American officials that al-Qaeda is in the advanced stages of executing a significant operation against an American target, probably within the US. =Able Danger= A classified military intelligence program known as \\"Able Danger\\" was created in October 1999 specifically targeting al-Qaeda. Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon (R-PA) charged before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Able Danger had identified Mohamed Atta, and three of the other hijackers, prior to 9/11. The existence of Able Danger, and its purported early identification of the 9/11 terrorists, was first disclosed publicly on June 19, 2005. On June 27, 2005, Weldon stated to the House: > Mr. Speaker, I rise because information has come to my attention over the > past several months that is very disturbing. I have learned that, in fact, > one of our Federal agencies had, in fact, identified the major New York cell > of Mohamed Atta prior to 9/11; and I have learned, Mr. Speaker, that in > September 2000, that Federal agency actually was prepared to bring the FBI > in and prepared to work with the FBI to take down the cell that Mohamed Atta > was involved in in New York City, along with two of the other terrorists.

Hamilton, former Chair and Vice Chair of the 9/11 Commission, issued a statement in which they stated the Commission had been aware of the Able Danger program, and requested and obtained information about it from the Department of Defense (DoD), but none of the information provided had indicated the program had identified Atta or other 9/11 hijackers.More pre-9/11 US intelligence connections to al-Qaeda exposed and spun Online Journal.Com August 24, 2005 pdf.Claim about 9/11 takes new twist San Francisco Chronicle August 19, 2005. Curt Weldon issued a response to this statement clarifying the mission of Able Danger, expressing concern over the statements made by various members of the 9/11 Commission, and promising to push forward until it is understood why the DoD was unable to pass the information uncovered by Able Danger to the FBI, and why the 9/11 Commission failed to follow up on the information they were given on Able Danger.WELDON RESPONDS TO OMISSION OF ABLE DANGER FROM 9/11 REPORT, August 12, 2005. Retrieved 2010-01-12. al-Qaeda investigations Numerous whistleblowers and officials have surfaced, claiming that there was a deliberate effort, from high-ranking officials, to prevent investigations into al-Qaeda. In 2002, FBI agent Coleen Rowley wrote to FBI director Robert Mueller describing her experience working with Minneapolis FBI agents tracking suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui prior to the attacks. She describes how FBI HQ personnel in Washington, D.C. had mishandled and failed to take action on information provided by the Minneapolis Field Office, and had failed to issue a warrant to search Moussaui's computer despite having probable cause.FBI eMails concerning Moussaoui. Senator Chuck Grassley later wrote that \\"If the application for the FISA warrant had gone forward, agents would have found information in Moussaoui's belongings that linked him ... to a major financier of the hijacking plot\\". Rowley was credited as a whistleblower and jointly awarded the TIME Magazine \\"Person of the Year\\" for 2002. Her testimony to the 9/11 Commission was omitted from their final report. FBI agent and al-Qaeda expert John P. O'Neill warned of an al-Qaeda threat to the United States in 2000. He retired from his position in mid-2001, citing repeated blocking of his investigations of al-Qaeda by FBI officials. After his retirement from the FBI, the World Trade Center hired him as its chief of security. He started work on August 23, 2001; 9/11 rescue workers found his body in a staircase inside the south tower rubble. Shortly after the attacks, David Schippers, the chief prosecutor for the impeachment of Bill Clinton, stated that the government had been warned in 1995 about a future attack on a government building and that later he was contacted by three FBI agents who mentioned uncovering a possible terrorist attack planned for lower Manhattan. According to Schippers, as the agents informed their superiors, they were briefed not to pursue the issue and were threatened with prosecution. Schippers declared, \\"Five weeks before the September 11 tragedy, I did my best to get a hold of Attorney General John Ashcroft with my concerns.\\" According to Schippers, Ashcroft responded that the Justice Department does not start investigations at the top. Author William Norman Grigg agrees with Schippers in his article \\"Did We Know What Was Coming?\\" According to the article, three unnamed veteran federal law enforcement agents confirmed \\"the information provided to Schippers was widely known within the Bureau before September 11.\\" According to Senator Bob Graham, who was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee from June 2001 through the buildup to the Iraq war, \\"Two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers had a support network in the United States that included agents of the Saudi government, and the Bush administration and FBI blocked a congressional investigation into that relationship,\\" as reported by the Miami Herald. And in Graham's book, Intelligence Matters, he makes clear that some details of that financial support from Saudi Arabia were in the 27 pages of the congressional inquiry's final report that were blocked from release by the administration, despite the pleas of leaders of both parties on the House and Senate intelligence committees.\\" In March 2012 as part of a lawsuit by 9/11 victims families Graham and another former U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey said in affidavits that they were certain there were direct links between the Saudi government and the attacks.'Direct line' between 9/11 terrorists, Saudi government, claim ex-US Senators The Expresse Tribune with The International Herald Tribune March 2, 2012 There have also been allegations that the hijackers' preparations may have been given assistance by U.S. intelligence. According to CBS News, \\"two of the Sept. 11 hijackers who lived in San Diego in 2000 rented a room from a man who reportedly worked as an undercover FBI informant... the FBI informant prayed with them and even helped one open a bank account.\\" Doubts have been raised about the speed with which the hijackers were identified, leading to suggestions that the FBI already had the names of the hijackers in advance. In his book Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke said that at 9:59 am on September 11, which is the time when WTC2 collapsed and 8 minutes before NORAD even knew Flight 93 had been hijacked, the FBI already had a list of the 19 alleged hijackers.

In 2004 the 9/11 Commission \\"found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack.\\" Just before their report was published the committee received evidence which caused to add to the report that the topic required further investigation.May: Al-Qaida's big fat Iranian wedding Clifford May for Scripps Howard News Service On December 22, 2010, a United States Federal Judge signed a default judgment holding Iran, the Taliban and al-Qaeda liable following an open court hearing in which the evidence was produced by the plaintiffs' attorneys which they said showed that Iran assisted the hijackers. 9/11 Commission members and witnesses who claimed they were Iranian defectors and members of Ministry of Intelligence and National Security and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards also testified during the hearing. The suit Havlish, et al. v. bin Laden, et al was brought in 2001 by Fiona Havlish whose husband died in the North Tower. Abolghasem Mesbahi, who claimed he was a former Ministry of Intelligence operative in charge of Iran's espionage operations in Western Europe testified that he was part of a task force that designed contingency plans for unconventional warfare against the United States code-named Shaitan dar Atash/Satan in Flames which included crashing hijacked passenger airliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the White House, and that in the summer of 2001 he received three coded messages telling him to activate the plan. An Iranian government memorandum was presented as evidence that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had pre-knowledge of the attacks.Judge: Iran, Taliban, al Qaeda liable for 9/11 CBS News December 22, 2011Federal Judge Rules: Iran Behind 9/11 Attacks ‚Äì OpEd Eurasia Review December 28, 2011 Several days after the ruling a spokesperson for Iran's Foreign ministry said charges that Iran \\"had a hand in planning the attacks and that one of al-Qaeda's members was present inside the country is baseless,\\" and said \\"With the repetition of such claims to back its political aims the U.S. is putting the peace and security of the world in jeopardy\\".Iran Rejects U.S. Accusations of Sept. 11 Role, Ministry Says Bloomberg In February 2012 President Obama's Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that \\"Iran has harbored al-Qaida leaders, facilitators,\\" and that they have been \\"under house arrest conditions. (Iran's rulers) have had this sort of standoff arrangement with al-Qaida, allowing (al-Qaida) to exist (inside Iran), but not to foment any operations directly from Iran, because they're very sensitive about, 'Hey, we might come after them there as well.'... So there has been this longstanding, as I say, kind of, shotgun marriage, or marriage of convenience.\\" =Israel= It was reported that the Mossad informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in August 2001 that as many as 200 terrorists were slipping into the United States and planning \\"a major assault on the United States.\\" The Israeli intelligence agency allegedly cautioned the FBI that it had picked up indications of a \\"large-scale target\\" in the United States and that Americans would be \\"very vulnerable.\\"Officials Told of ‚ÄòMajor Assault‚Äô Plans LA Times, RICHARD A. SERRANO and JOHN-THOR DAHLBURGTIMES STAFF WRITERS In September 2001, The New York Times and Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that four hours after the attack, the FBI arrested five Israelis who had been filming the smoking skyline from the roof of a white van in the parking lot of an apartment building, for \\"puzzling behavior\\". They were charged with illegally residing in the United States and working there without permits. The Israelis were said to have pulled into the parking lot after the destruction of the first tower and videotaped the remainder of the disaster with what was interpreted as cries of \\"joy and mockery\\".5 Israelis detained for \`puzzling behavior' after WTC tragedy By Yossi Melman, Haaretz.com. Retrieved 2010-01-12. Police found the van and a search revealed $4,700 in cash hidden, along with foreign passports and a boxcutter which aroused suspicions and led to the detention of the occupants. The men were held in detention for more than 2 months, during which time they were subjected to interrogation and polygraph tests, before being deported back to Israel; one of the men (Paul Kurzberg) refused to take the test for 10 weeks, and then failed it. The five men worked at the company Urban Moving Systems, owned and operated by Dominik Suter. After the men were arrested the FBI searched their offices and questioned Suter, however Suter fled to Israel before he could be questioned further. Eventually, Suter's name appeared on the May 2002 FBI Suspect List, along with the Sep 11 hijackers and other suspected extremists. According to a former CIA chief of operations for counterterrorism Vince Cannistraro, there was speculation that Urban Moving Systems may have been a front for an intelligence operation investigating fund-raising networks channeling money to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. On March 15, 2002, The Forward claimed that the FBI had concluded that the van's driver, Paul Kurzberg, and his brother Sivan, were indeed Mossad operatives, who were in America \\"spying on local Arabs\\". ABC news cited this report on June 21, 2002, adding that the FBI had concluded that the five Israelis had no foreknowledge of the attacks. In March 2001, the US Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive had issued a warning about people identifying themselves as \\"Israeli art students\\" attempting to bypass security and gain entry to federal buildings, and even to the private residences of senior federal officials. A French intelligence agency later noted \\"according to the FBI, Arab terrorists and suspected terror cells lived in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as in Miami and Hollywood, Florida, from December 2000 to April 2001 in direct proximity to the Israeli spy cells\\". The report contended that Mossad agents were spying on Mohammed Atta and Marwan al-Shehi, two of leaders of the 9/11 hijack teams. In 2002 several officials dismissed reports of a spy ring and said the allegations were made by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was angry that his theories had been dismissed. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in an August 2010 speech that no \\"Zionists\\" were killed in the attacks since, according to him, \\"one day earlier they were told not go to their workplace.\\" He also remarked, \\"What was the story of September 11? During five to six days, and with the aid of the media, they created and prepared public opinion so that everyone considered an attack on Afghanistan and Iraq\\". However, contrary to such conspiracy theories about Jews being warned not to go to work that day, the number of Jews who died in the attacks is variously estimated at between 270 and 400,A survey of the 1,700 victims whose religion was listed found approximately 10% were Jewish indicating around 270 in total. A survey based on the last names of victims found that around 400 (15¬Ω%) were possibly Jewish. A survey of 390 Cantor Fitzgerald employees who had public memorials (out of the 658 who died) found 49 were Jewish (12¬Ω%). According to the 2002 American Jewish Year Book, New York State's population was 9% Jewish. Sixty-four percent of the WTC victims lived in New York State. while a few Israelis died in the attack as well. =France= On December 5, 2007, French authorities filed preliminary charges against Guillaume Dasqui√©, a reporter for the daily Le Monde, for publishing state secrets related to the 9/11 hijackings. Dasqui√©'s April 16 article in Le Monde, titled \\"September 11: the French had long known\\" reported that the General Directorate of External Security (DGSE), had warned the U.S. of a possible terrorist plot that involved al-Qaeda hijacking planes and crashing them into buildings some eight months before 9/11. The article contained excerpts from a 328-page classified DGSE report on al-Qaeda activities which included maps, analyses, graphics, and satellite photos.French journalist investigated over intelligence leaks Committee to Protect Journalists December 10, 2007. =Afghanistan= Moderate elements of the Taliban are reported to have given the USA advance warning of the attacks. The BBC reports that Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, the Taliban's Foreign Minister, sent the USA an advance warning of the attack following a tip-off he received from Tohir Yo'ldosh, the leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Like al-Qaeda, the Taliban allowed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to place training camps in Afghanistan. Tohir Yo'ldosh was reported to have been concerned, correctly, as it turned out, that if al-Qaeda was not stopped prior to launching the attacks, the USA would retaliate against all of Afghanistan, which would have a negative effect on his movement's efforts.

Set in an English manor house in 1926, shortly before the disappearance of crime fiction novelist Agatha Christie (played in the episode by Fenella Woolgar), the episode is a murder-mystery storyline where a shapeshifting giant wasp, in disguise as one of the party guests, murders the other guests using methods similar to those in the novels of Christie, who is also a guest. Plot The Tenth Doctor and Donna invite themselves to a dinner party hosted by Lady Clemency Eddison and her husband Colonel Hugh Curbishley in 1926. They are thrilled to find one of the guests is Agatha Christie, and the Doctor realises that they have arrived on the day that she will inexplicably disappear for ten days. One of the guests is suddenly found dead in the library. The Doctor and Donna discover a viscous substance left behind by the killer that the Doctor identifies as morphic residue. He concludes that the murderer is an alien in human form. While searching in a room that had previously been empty for 40 years, Donna sees a gigantic wasp outside. It smashes through the window and attacks Donna, embedding its sting in the door before escaping. The creature then kills the housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala. The Doctor, Donna, and Agatha chase the alien but it returns to human form before they catch it. When they regroup in the study, the Doctor identifies the substance from the sting as venom from an alien wasp called a Vespiform, before, all of a sudden, he is poisoned with cyanide. Luckily, his Time Lord physiology allows him to detoxify. During a failed attempt to reveal the wasp at dinner, Lady Eddison's necklace is stolen, and her son, Roger, is stabbed in the back with a knife. The remaining guests are assembled in the sitting room. Agatha exposes one of the guests, Lady Robina Redmond, as the thief but not the murderer when she says \\"toilet\\" instead of the upper class saying \\"loo\\". Then the Doctor deduces that Lady Eddison's shutting herself away for months, years ago was due to her becoming impregnated by another Vespiform, who had given her the necklace before he died in 1885; unbeknownst to her, it links her telepathically with their child. The Doctor further reveals that the child, whom she gave up for adoption, is Reverend Golightly. Via the telepathic link, the Reverend became aware of his alien nature and absorbed the details of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, an Agatha Christie murder mystery his mother was reading at the time. Golightly transforms into the Vespiform and threatens the guests. Agatha grabs the necklace and lures him away while driving towards the nearby Silent Pool. When Donna catches up with Agatha, she grabs the necklace and throws it into the water, prompting the wasp to dive in after it and drown. Due to her own connection with the necklace, Agatha falls unconscious and suffers from amnesia. The Doctor quietly drops Agatha off near the Harrogate Hotel ten days later, before showing Donna his copy of Death in the Clouds, in which wasps play a vital part, stating that Christie did remember, after all. =Continuity= The Doctor produces items from a chest of items beginning with C, including a Cyberman chest-plate from \\"The Age of Steel\\", the head of a Greco-Roman statue (possibly depicting Caecilius from \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\"), and the crystal ball in which the Carrionites are trapped from \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" (which he playfully shakes). Early in the episode, the Doctor states his desire to meet Agatha Christie. This is a reference to \\"Last of the Time Lords\\". Donna remarks that meeting Agatha Christie during a murder mystery would be as preposterous as meeting \\"Charles Dickens surrounded by ghosts at Christmas\\", unknowingly describing the events of \\"The Unquiet Dead\\". When Donna talks to Agatha about her cheating husband, she recalls her own engagement to Lance in which she found out he was using her, briefly mentioning the Empress of Racnoss as \\"a giant spider\\". This is a reference of the 2006 Christmas episode \\"The Runaway Bride\\". The Doctor has a flashback scene when unravelling motives with Agatha Christie. He is shown in medieval Belgium with a bow and quiver of arrows on his back. His voiceover explains that he was deep in the Ardennes, looking for Charlemagne who was \\"kidnapped by an insane computer\\". Christie interrupts before he can paint a full picture; however the events are fully explored on Doctor Who's BBC website in the short story \\"The Lonely Computer.\\" Production=Writing= The episode is written by Gareth Roberts, who previously wrote the pseudohistorical episode \\"The Shakespeare Code\\". Roberts was given a fourth series episode to write after executive producer Russell T Davies reviewed Roberts' script for \\"The Shakespeare Code\\". Several months later, he received an email from the production team which said \\"Agatha Christie\\". The idea for a murder mystery featuring Agatha Christie came originally from producer Phil Collinson. Roberts, a self-confessed fan of Christie's works, made the episode into a comedy. Roberts based the episode on his favourite Christie works: Crooked House, which focuses on secrets within an aristocratic society, and the 1982 film adaptation of Evil Under the Sun. Speaking of both works, Roberts noted that it was \\"quite strange writing a modern Doctor Who with posh people in it. We don't really see posh people on television anymore, except at Christmas\\", and \\"there's something funny about the veneer of upper class respectability and the truth of any family underneath\\". He also stated that \\"there's really nothing nicer than watching a lot of English actors hamming it up in a vaguely exotic location... and then somebody's murdered!\\" The episode's title was deliberately chosen to sound \\"vaguely Christie-ish\\", but Roberts admitted that \\"[Christie] never used 'the blank and the blank' construction\\". In writing the episode, Roberts aimed to make the episode a \\"big, fun, all-star murder mystery romp\\". He was influenced by advice given by Davies, who wanted Roberts to \\"go funnier\\" with every draft, and former Doctor Who script editor Douglas Adams' advice that \\"a danger one runs is that the moment you have anything in the script that's clearly meant to be funny in some way, everybody thinks 'oh well we can do silly voices and silly walks and so on', and I think that's exactly the wrong way to do it\\". Using this advice, he used the adage that in comedy, the characters do not realise the humour, and cited Basil Fawlty's mishaps in Fawlty Towers as an example. In an interview with Doctor Who Magazine, Roberts stated that \\"to a certain extent [there was less pressure]\\" in writing the episode. He was pleased with the success of \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" and The Sarah Jane Adventures two-parter Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?, but likened himself to Corporal Bell, a member of the administrative staff at the fictional Doctor Who organisation UNIT, in saying that he did not wish to be \\"in the middle of things\\" or writing episodes \\"where big, pivotal things have happened to [the Doctor]\\". Roberts and Davies held an unofficial contest to see how many references to Christie's works could be inserted. Titles that were noted were: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Why Didn't They Ask Evans; The Body in the Library; The Secret Adversary; N or M?; Nemesis; Cat Among the Pigeons; Dead Man's Folly; They Do It With Mirrors; Appointment with Death; Cards on the Table; Sparkling Cyanide; Endless Night; Crooked House; Death in the Clouds; The Moving Finger; Taken at the Flood; Death Comes as the End; Murder on the Orient Express and The Murder at the Vicarage. A deleted scene referred to The Man in the Brown Suit, referring to the Doctor's clothing. The narrative itself parallels several of Christie's novels: the jewel theft storyline parallels The Secret of Chimneys; Miss Chandrakala's death was influenced by And Then There Were None; and the Colonel's revelation that he was not disabled paralleled a key concept of The Pale Horse. In an email conversation with journalist Benjamin Cook, Davies admitted he had initially added a reference to the original title of And Then There Were None, Ten Little Niggers, but decided it was too risky. =Cast notes= David Tennant's father Alexander McDonald had a silent cameo as a footman in one of the early scenes, after being asked to act when visiting David on set. The casting of Fenella Woolgar as Agatha Christie was made at the suggestion of David Tennant, who had previously worked with her on Bright Young Things and He Knew He Was Right. She later played Hellan Femor in the audio play The Company of Friends and Morella Wendigo in Nevermore. Fenella Woolgar had previously appeared in an episode of Agatha Christie's Poirot, \\"Lord Edgware Dies\\" as Elis, and has since appeared in the episode \\"Hallowe'en Party\\" as Elizabeth Whittaker. David Quilter has also made an appearance, \\"The Million Dollar Bond Robbery\\". Christopher Benjamin, who plays Colonel Curbishley, previously starred in two serials of the original Doctor Who series, playing Sir Keith Gold in Inferno (1970) and Henry Gordon Jago in The Talons of Weng-Chiang (1977). =Music= The music playing at the garden party is the \\"Twentieth Century Blues\\", originally from No√´l Coward's 1931 play Cavalcade. The recording used here, edited together with other period music, is a 1931 recording of 'Love is the Sweetest Thing' by Ray Noble and the New Mayfair Orchestra, featuring vocalist Al Bowlly. =Editing= A framing device featuring the aged Agatha Christie (played by Daphne Oxenford) trying to recall the events that took place during her disappearance was deleted because the producers felt it diminished the story's urgency. The original ending featured the Doctor and Donna visiting the elderly Christie; a new ending in the TARDIS set was filmed after the producers decided to cut the framing sequence, much later than the filming for the rest of the story. The framing sequence and another scene cut for time are present on the Doctor Who Series 4 DVD box set. Broadcast BARB figures show that \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\", was watched by 8.41 million viewers, making it the second most popular programme of the day (behind ITV's Britain's Got Talent) and the seventh most watched programme of the week. =Critical reception= The episode received an Appreciation Index score of 86 (considered \\"Excellent\\"). Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode four stars out of five. Rawson-Jones' opening section approved of the episode, saying \\"I say old boy, what frightfully spiffing fun!\\". He claimed that style and substance \\"merge wonderfully in 'The Unicorn and The Wasp'\\" praising Gareth Roberts for his \\"deceptively frivolous story\\" managing to \\"successfully juggle many elements including the real life disappearance of Agatha Christie, a giant alien bug and a recreation of the classic 'whodunnit' murder mystery plot.\\" However, he claimed that there was also an \\"air of predictability about all of the tongue- in-cheek references to Agatha Christie's body of work\\", citing prior serials that contain famous authors such as The Unquiet Dead and The Shakespeare Code. He then went on to say that these references managed to \\"excite rather than annoy\\", due to Roberts having \\"turned the entire plot into a Christie homage\\". He praised Fenella Woolgar in particular, stating that she was \\"sublime\\" as Christie. Rawson-Jones also highly praised \\"the anchovy scene\\", citing it as \\"being perhaps the funniest ever moment in Doctor Who's 45 year history.\\". Overall, he saw the episode as a positive \\"breath of fresh air\\" from the previous \\"heavy sci-fi\\" episodes. Jordan Thomas, the lead director of the game BioShock 2, stated that his creation of the game's character of Sofia Lamb was inspired by Fenella Woolgar's portrayal of Agatha Christie in this episode, and Woolgar was hired to voice the character. The game also has a character named Grace Holloway in it, a reference to the companion of the same name in the 1996 Doctor Who TV film.\\"BioShock 2 Podcast Episode Nine: Sofia Lamb\\" at the Cult of Rapture ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Doctor Who pseudohistorical serials Category:Tenth Doctor episodes Category:2008 British television episodes Category:Films with screenplays by Gareth Roberts Category:Fiction set in 1926 Category:Television episodes set in England Category:Television episodes about murder Category:Cultural depictions of Agatha Christie ","title":"The Unicorn and the Wasp"},{"id":"15134981","text":"Agust√≠ Querol i Subirats (or Agust√≠n Querol y Subirats) (May 17, 1860 - December 14, 1909) was a prominent Spanish sculptor, born in Tortosa, Catalonia.  Life  Born to a poor family, the son of a baker, Querol was educated under Ramon Cerveto Bestraten (1829‚Äì1906). At the age of 18, he left his job at his father‚Äôs bakery and moved to Barcelona, where he worked as an apprentice at the studios of Domingo Talarn and of the Vallmitjana Brothers. He also attended sculpture classes at the Escola Provincial de Belles Arts (called colloquially ‚Äúla Llotja‚Äù). He studied dissection and anatomy at the Hospital de la Santa Creu in Barcelona, then won a scholarship to study in Rome. Based in Madrid from 1890, he was responsible for many monuments, sculptures, and project proposals through much of the Spanish-speaking world.Escultura Urbana: Agust√≠n Querol Subirats Querol's work is characterized by the same romantic style, fluid modeling, wealth of detail and technical skill as his French fin de si√®cle contemporaries like Jules Dalou, but Querol's work is even more dynamic and profuse. The pediment for the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a, for instance, is crowded with 19 separate figures. All of his major designs are equally busy. Querol ran a relatively large studio. Among the apprentices in his studio were Lorenzo Coullaut Valera and Jacinto Higueras. Querol also worked as a businessman, dealing in Carrara marble; was involved in art expositions; wrote literary pieces under the pseudonym El Plutarco del Pueblo, the \\"People's Plutarch\\"; served as vice- director of the Museo de Arte Moderno de Madrid (1892‚Äì1895) and a Conservative deputy to the Cortes (for Roquetes); and was a man about town. Querol died in Madrid,Agust√≠n Querol Subirats and is buried in San Justo in Madrid. Memorial to Casilda Iturrizar created by Querol located in Bilbao's Parque de Do√±a Casilda Iturr√≠zar. He left unfinished monuments in Tortosa, Buenos Aires, Guayaquil, and Montevideo, which were later completed after his death. One example is the Monument De los Espa√±oles in Buenos Aires. The elaborate sculpture, representing a statue of Liberty on a tower, with an extensive frieze at the base, all of it set in a pool with fountains, surrounded by monumental bronze figures dedicated to the Constitution of Argentina and the country's regions, was designed before Querol's death. It was begun in 1910, assigned to a replacement sculptor Cipriano Folgueras who then died in 1911, and further delayed with the tragic 1916 loss of the trans-Atlantic steamer Prince of Asturias, which sank with the loss of 457 lives and a cargo of finished bronze and marble sculptures. The monument was finally completed in 1927.

Stagliano and Evil Angel pioneered the Gonzo pornography genre in the late 1980s. Several of the most acclaimed pornographic film directors have worked for Evil Angel, and its films have won numerous awards.Petkovich, p.10 It has been described as \\"the top porn-film producer\\" in the U.S, as one of the handful of companies which dominate the distribution of hardcore pornographic films in the U.S., and as one of the most profitable porn studios.Eric Schlosser, \\"The Business of Pornography,\\" U.S. News and World Report, February 10, 1997. History Evil Angel owner John Stagliano =Background and beginnings= The company's rise to prominence was fueled by the industry switch from film to videotape. In the late 1970s a feature-length porn film shot on celluloid‚Äîusually 35mm‚Äîmight have cost as much as $350,000. In 1983 the VCR had been recently introduced, and producers were beginning to make pornographic films on videotape. A film using video could be made for as little as $5,000, compared to a minimum of $40,000 for a movie shot on film. Into the 1990s, by shooting its productions with video cameras, Evil Angel could still make films for $8,000. Stagliano initially had little knowledge of filmmaking, but he made his first movie for $8,000 in 1983: Bouncing Buns, starring Stacy Donovan. For the next six years he shot films for other companies to manufacture and distribute. In 1989 he started Evil Angel, to sell his own films. The origin of the company's name goes back to when Stagliano was working as a stripper: \\"There was another guy in one of my shows named John. So this MC started calling me Evil John to differentiate us. This was when I was doing Dracula and chains. At the same time I had a girlfriend who called herself Angel when she did strip shows. She was a very nasty girl and I suggested that she call herself Evil Angel. She didn't, but I loved the name and wound up using it for my company.\\" =Buttman and Gonzo= The first Evil Angel film was Dance Fire, filmed in 1988 by Stagliano, starring himself, Trinity Loren, Brandy Alexandre and others. It would only be released on DVD 20 years later. Influenced by amateur pornography, In 1989 Stagliano hit on the idea of performing in a film while also operating the camera, so that the viewer experiences the film through the eyes of his character. The first-person perspective was influenced by the 1960s film Blowup.O'Toole, Kerekes p.17 At the time this was in contrast to the majority of porn, which tended not to make viewers aware of the camera.O'Toole, Kerekes p.16 This technique is today known as Point of view pornography. He formed his Buttman persona, and shot Adventures of Buttman. The early Buttman films were written, produced, directed, edited, shot and manufactured personally by Stagliano.O'Toole, Kerekes p.7 The first two Buttman films had lengthy scripts, but the series soon evolved into an improvised, spontaneous format. In contrast to his earlier work and the standard porn of the time, Stagliano did not link each scene together to form a conventional narrative. At times the camerawork was shaky. Partly due to his lack of funds, he didn't use elaborate sets or locations. At the time porn films had a traditional storyline, with sex scenes interspersed with dialogue by performers with little acting ability. Instead of that format, Stagliano chose to film \\"one sex scene which has a beginning, a middle and ends at a climax. Trying to make all that relate to a bigger story is very difficult and creates all sorts of problems that get in the way of making the best scene possible.\\" The distinct style of the early Evil Angel films would be widely imitated, and would come to be known as Gonzo pornography. =Success= In the 1990s Stagliano became one of the most successful figures in the American pornographic film industry. In 1990 Patrick Collins and Stagliano founded the Elegant Angel label as a subsidiary of Evil Angel. In 1991 Stagliano established a production subsidiary in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. By 1993 the company was producing a new videotape every three weeks, and was grossing more than $1 million a year; in 1996 it sold approximately half a million videos. In the mid-'90s the company started using the phrase \\"The Evil Empire\\" on its box covers, in reference to its growing stable of directors. In 1996 Collins established Elegant Angel as a separate company, and in 1998 it ended all cooperation with Evil Angel.O'Toole, Kerekes p.30 His departure from Evil Angel has been called \\"less than amicable\\", and he and Stagliano are apparently \\"ex-friend[s]\\". At the time Collins said that Stagliano \\"couldn't run a business, and would fail without him\\". According to Stagliano, \\"Patrick's a bully . . . he wasn't doing his job properly . . . I should have fired him years ago\\". A 1997 U.S. News and World Report investigation identified Evil Angel as the most profitable pornographic studio. In 2007 the studio received 127 AVN Award nominations in 60 categories, making it the fourth year in a row in which it received more than 100 nominations. In 2008 EA won 18 AVN awards. Stagliano won the \\"Best Director - Video\\" award for Fashionistas Safado: Berlin. In 2015, company vice president John Grayson reported that transsexual pornography was by far the company's most profitable category or genre, earning about 20% more on a per-movie basis than any other productions.http://www.ibtimes.com/transgender-porn-best-seller-it-good-trans- people-2028219 = Legal issues = In August 2007 Evil Angel and Jules Jordan prevailed in a DVD piracy case against Kaytel Video Distribution and several other defendants, winning a total of over $17.5 million, which was the largest sum ever awarded in an adult piracy case.Evil Angel, Jules Jordan Win Over $16.6 Million In DVD Piracy Case, Adult Video News, posted August 10, 2007. Evil Angel was awarded $11.2 million and Jordan $5.3 million. EA had originally filed the lawsuit in November 2005. On April 8, 2008, Evil Angel and Stagliano were indicted on federal obscenity charges by a federal grand jury in Washington, DC.John Stagliano, Evil Angel Indicted On Federal Obscenity Charges Adult Video News, posted April 8, 2008 Films named in the obscenity charges included Storm Squirters 2 by Joey Silvera, Milk Nymphos by Jay Sin and a trailer for Belladonna: Fetish Fanatic 5. Stagliano and Evil Angel were represented by Al Gelbard, who successfully defended JM Productions owner Jeff Steward in a 2007 obscenity case. The company released a compilation DVD entitled Defend Our Porn, with proceeds going towards its legal defense fund, and set up the DefendOurPorn.org website to provide information on the legal proceedings. In December 2008 the BBC reported that Stagliano and Evil Angel were a client of UK lawyers Davenport Lyons who were seeking financial redress from people they asserted had downloaded copyright material using Peer to Peer software. Directors and films The company differs from most other porn studios in that it contracts with in-house directors and permits them to own the films that they create, while Evil Angel handles the film's manufacture, distribution, promotion and sales and takes a percentage of the gross sales. Each director has their own particular style and is a star in their own right, with their own brand identity. Stagliano adopted this business model due to his previous experience selling his videos to other companies. He found it difficult to establish his reputation when someone else owned his content, and he didn't receive any more money if a film sold well. The company's roster of directors, includes Stagliano himself, Aiden Starr, Proxy Paige, LeWood, John Leslie, Rocco Siffredi, Joey Silvera, Christoph Clark, Nacho Vidal, Jonni Darkko, Jake Malone, Jay Sin, Jazz Duro, Manuel Ferrara, Lexington Steele, Mike Adriano, Steve Holmes, Uncle D and Belladonna. Previous directors include Gregory Dark, Jules Jordan, Bruce Seven, Bionca, Alex de Renzy and Erik Everhard. =Former directors= Gregory Dark left VCA over \\"creative differences\\" in the summer of 1995 and launched his own film company, Dark Works, with Evil Angel Video handling all distribution.Petkovich, p.44 His first film for Evil Angel was Sex Freaks, starring Stephanie Swift, Nyrobi Knights, Lovette and Tom Byron.Petkovich, p.13 He also worked on Snake Pit and The Best Of Gregory Dark. Dark has since stopped directing for the studio. Jules Jordan formerly directed for Evil Angel, producing series including Ass Worship. In 2006 he left to form his own company, Jules Jordan Video. Erik Everhard also worked with the company, after directing for Anabolic Video, Diabolic Video and Red Light District Video. He left Red Light District in 2005 to join Evil Angel, before joining Jules Jordan Video. =Current directors= John Leslie Stagliano has directed several series for the studio. By 2003 almost 30 entries in the Buttman series had been produced, some of them shot in locations including New Zealand, Prague (Czech Republic), San Diego and London. The premise of most of the films is Stagliano approaching a woman and persuading her to show him her buttocks, followed by their having sex. The films blurred the boundary between what was a pre-arranged set-up and what was real.O'Toole, Kerekes p.8 It has also been turned into a comic-book.O'Toole, Kerekes p.13 John Leslie had a successful career as an actor, then began directing for VCA Pictures in the mid-'80s. The first film he directed for Evil Angel was The Dog Walker in 1994, after its script had been rejected by VCA. Rocco Siffredi began working as a director for the company in 1994. Joey Silvera started directing for Evil Angel in 1995. Previously he had been an actor, then directed for Devil's Film in the early 1990s, from 1998 onwards his 'Rogue Adventures' series (along with Devil's Film's own 'Transsexual Prostitutes' series) helped bring transsexual pornography into the mainstream. Christoph Clark joined the company in 1997. His first film was Euro Angels. Nacho Vidal joined the studio in late 2001. Jonni Darkko first directed for New Sensations. In 2004 he formed Darkko Productions and joined Evil Angel. Belladonna Manuel Ferrara released his first Evil Angel film in May 2006, after working for Red Light District Video for two years. He was originally a prot√©g√© of Rocco Siffredi, and had an award-winning acting career, including an appearance in Stagliano's Fashionistas. Jake Malone signed an exclusive distribution deal in June 2006. Belladonna was first introduced to Stagliano by her then-boyfriend Nacho Vidal. Evil Angel is the exclusive distributor of titles under the Belladonna Entertainment and Deadly Nightshade Productions labels. Jay Sin started directing for Buttman Magazine Choice in early 2007, working on films including Milk Nymphos 2, then became an EA director in January 2008. Sin is known for his extreme anal pornography, more recently including rectal prolapse in some of his videos. Many of his videos also feature women inserting objects such as oranges and baseballs into their rectums, then pushing the objects back out. Sin calls his films \\"artistic\\" and states that porn for him is \\"a way of life\\" Evil Angel Publishing Evil Angel Publishing is the magazine division of Evil Angel. In March 2007, it launched Extra Parts, a 100-page publication featuring pictures from director Joey Silvera's movies featuring transgender women.

Ingres' contemporaries considered the work to signify Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism. Grande Odalisque attracted wide criticism when it was first shown. It is renowned for the elongated proportions and lack of anatomical realism. The work is owned by the Louvre Museum, Paris which purchased the work in 1899. __TOC__ History The painting was commissioned by Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples, and finished in 1814. Ingres drew upon works such as Dresden Venus by Giorgione, and Titian's Venus of Urbino as inspiration for his reclining nude figure, though the actual pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder is directly drawn from the 1800 Portrait of Madame R√©camier by Jacques-Louis David. Venus of Urbino, Titian Madame R√©camier painted by Jacques-Louis David (1800). Ingres portrays a concubine in languid pose as seen from behind with distorted proportions. The small head, elongated limbs, and cool color scheme all reveal influences from Mannerists such as Parmigianino, whose Madonna with the Long Neck was also famous for anatomical distortion. This eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Critics viewed Ingres as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, one critic remarked that the work had \\"neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation\\". This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism. Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant, even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be criticized for his work until the mid-1820s. Anatomy Stemming from the initial criticism the painting received, the figure in Grande Odalisque is thought to be drawn with \\"two or three vertebrae too many.\\" Critics at the time believed the elongations to be errors on the part of Ingres, but recent studies show the elongations to have been deliberate distortions. Measurements taken on the proportions of real women showed that Ingres's figure was drawn with a curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to replicate. It also showed the left arm of the odalisque is shorter than the right. The study concluded that the figure was longer by five instead of two or three vertebrae and that the excess affected the lengths of the pelvis and lower back instead of merely the lumbar region. Another interpretation of this painting suggests that since the duty of some concubines was merely to satisfy the carnal pleasures of the sultan, this elongation of her pelvic area may have been a symbolic distortion by Ingres. While this may represent sensuous feminine beauty, her gaze, on the other hand, has been said to \\"[reflect] a complex psychological make-up\\" or \\"[betray] no feeling\\". In addition, the distance between her gaze and her pelvic region may be a physical representation of the depth of thought and complex emotions of a woman's thoughts and feelings. In other works La Grande Odalisque was appropriated by the feminist art group Guerrilla Girls for their first color poster and most iconic image. The 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster gave Ingres's odalisque a gorilla mask and posed the question \\"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?\\". The poster used data from the group's first \\"weenie count\\" and drew attention to the overwhelming number of female nudes counted in the Modern Art sections of The Met. The poster was rejected by the Public Art Fund in New York and was run in advertising space on New York City buses until the bus company cancelled the lease arguing that the image was \\"too suggestive and that the figure appeared to have more than a fan in her hand.\\" ReferencesBibliographyExternal links Category:Paintings by Jean-Auguste- Dominique Ingres Category:1814 paintings Category:Paintings of the Louvre by French artists Category:Neoclassical paintings Category:Nude art ","title":"Grande Odalisque"},{"id":"15135176","text":"Carmine Furletti Carmine Furletti (1926 - January 9, 2008) was a former president of the Brazilian football club Cruzeiro Esporte Clube.

Sherwood, n√©e CaskeyJefferson City Post-Tribune from Jefferson City, Missouri - Page 4 (born February 7, 1908, date of death unknown) was a burlesque dancer and Salvation Army worker who was convicted of first-degree murder for killing her two-year-old son. Early life and marriage Sherwood was born in St. Louis, Missouri.American Mother May Escape Electric Chair, San Antonio Light, April 5, 1936, pg. 18. She was the third child of Thomas Caskey, a Scotch-Irish foundry worker and his wife Florence Caskey. Her father was married six times and Sherwood was the daughter of his third wife. One of her older siblings died at eighteen months and another at five years of age. Sherwood's mother died when she was nine and she was placed in an orphanage. Salvation Army work, in 1925, followed her period in the orphanage. As a lassie, she wore a red-ribboned bonnet. In this endeavor, she sang gospel hymns in six southern cities for approximately three years.Even A Death Verdict Didn't Explain Why the Showgirl Drowned Her Baby, Fresno Bee The Republican, February 16, 1936, pg. 37. From this job, she moved on to dance in burlesque. One day she saw an ad offering employment in show business to girls with fair singing voices. She answered the ad and went to work in Chicago, Illinois. In burlesque, she never achieved the prominence of a stripper. Instead, she was always in the back row in the chorus. She married a stagehand, James Sherwood, the electrician of the burlesque company. Her marriage was conducted as a publicity stunt before an audience of burlesque fans during a regular performance. James was from a poor family in Newburgh, New York, a Hudson River town. When the company broke up, the couple returned to Newburgh. There James found sporadic work as a motion picture operator and Sherwood was employed as a waitress. Their daughter, then age seven, resided with his mother. At that time their other child, Jimmy, was an infant. James had tuberculosis and died in a sanitarium in New York. Afterward, Sherwood became engaged to a minor politician and dry county agent. When she lost her job the engagement was broken. Her landlady evicted her when she could not afford the room and board. Crime Sherwood drowned two-year-old Jimmy in Moodna Creek in Newburgh, on August 20, 1935. The case was exceptional, being the only first-degree murder case involving a woman in Orange County, New York history until then. She carried Jimmy's body to the Newburgh police headquarters, exclaiming it was too hard to make a living for myself and the baby.Slayer Of Her Baby Is Freed On Parole, The New York Times, December 28, 1939, pg. 11. Her husband died four months earlier.Drowned Her Baby, Woman Declares, The New York Times, August 21, 1935, pg. 5. Trial and sentence Sherwood, 27, pleaded temporary insanity during her trial for the drowning of Jimmy in January 1936. The jury recommended mercy when it convicted her of first-degree murder. The jury foreman mentioned that she had led a hard life. Trial Judge Jonathan D. Wilson was compelled by New York state law to sentence her to die in the electric chair at Sing Sing. Two defense psychiatrists maintained that Sherwood was insane while two prosecution psychiatrists testified to the contrary. In 1936 all first-degree murder convictions were reviewed by the New York Court of Appeals.Mrs. Sherwood Is Found Guilty of Murder; Chair Mandatory In Drowning of Her Son, The New York Times, January 19, 1936, pg.1 Appeal and parole The United States War Veterans Association circulated petitions days later urging Governor Herbert Lehman to grant Sherwood an unconditional pardon.Urges Pardon for Mrs. Sherwood, The New York Times, January 24, 1936, pg. 40. She won an appeal for a new trial.Term For Mrs. Sherwood, The New York Times, September 17, 1936, pg. 16. The Court of Appeals set aside the first-degree murder conviction on July 8, 1936. She pleaded guilty to the first-degree manslaughter the following September 2 and received a six-to-fifteen-year sentence. She was then 28. Sherwood was freed on parole after serving three years and three months at the Westfield State Farm (Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women) in Bedford Hills, New York. The Salvation Army employed her doing clerical work in one of its institutions. Sherwood was allowed to visit her 11-year-old daughter, Dorothy May, who resided in Newburgh.

The airport has services for commercial and private aviation. Aircraft operations, including local general aviation, transient general aviation, and air taxi, average 70 per day. The Airport Industrial Park is adjacent to the field. It is owned and operated by the city of Terrell.  History  The airport, actually only a grass field, was first used by a local flying club beginning in the fall of 1940. In June 1941, the field was leased to Major William Long of Dallas, a civilian flight school operator, to be the home of the new No. 1 British Flying Training School, the first of seven British contract flight schools in the United States. This training was part of Lend-Lease aid where Royal Air Force flying cadets were provided a 20-week flying course of 150 flight hours, taught by civilian instructors under the supervision of a Royal Air Force and civilian staff. Toward the end of the war the course had grown to a 32-week course of 220 hours. The new school, known as the Terrell Aviation School, offered flight training from primary through advanced instruction at the field. The school initially used the Stearman PT-18 primary trainer, the Vultee BT-13 basic trainer, and the AT-6 advanced trainer. After November 1943 the BT-13 was removed and students transitioned from the Stearman directly to the AT-6. From November 1942 until June 1944, small numbers of American Army Air Forces flight cadets trained alongside the RAF students. During 1943 the school was expanded from 200 students to 300 students and two 3,000' asphalt hard surface runways were constructed by the Defense Plant Corporation (an agency of the US Government which had assumed ownership of the physical assets of all civilian flight schools in the United States). Runway 17/35 was extended to 5000' after the war. One of the RAF pilots trained at Terrell was actor Robert Hardy\\"Goodbye To The Minister Of Magic, Actor Robert Hardy\\", Vivian Hughbanks, The Federalist, August 7, 2017, https://thefederalist.com/2017/08/07/goodbye-minister-magic-actor-robert- hardy. Another of the RAF trainees was Arthur Louis Aaron, who later won the Victoria Cross. Royal Air Force pilot training at the airfield ended in early September 1945 and with the end of World War II the airfield was determined to be excess by the military and turned over to the local government for civil use.

Biography Born as Maniu Micu in the Transylvanian village of Sadu, in the Austrian Empire (now in Sibiu County, Romania), he was the son of a Greek-Catholic protopope and the nephew of bishop Inocen≈£iu Micu- Klein.Hitchins, p. 667. He began to study at the Seminary of Blaj and he joined the Order of Saint Basil in 1762. Micu received a scholarship in 1762 and began studying at the Catholic P√°zm√°neum University of Vienna. There is little known about his life in Vienna, but it is known he was attracted to science, studying experimental physics, mechanics and mathematics, in addition to theology and philosophy. In 1772, returning to Blaj to teach ethics and mathematics at the Seminary, Klein met and befriended bishop Grigorie Maior, whom he accompanied in visits throughout his diocese, trying to win converts to Greek-Catholicism. These trips proved to be useful in his study of the Romanian language, especially of the language spoken by the peasants, gathering materials for a future grammar. Klein was also interested in Romanian folklore, his writings being one of the earliest works on it.Hitchins, p. 667-668. In 1774, he finished writing a work of history named De ortu progressu conversione valachorum episcopis item archiepiscopis et metropolitis eorum, which talked about the Roman origins of the Romanians and the origins of their faith in the Roman Christian Church in ancient Dacia. Apparently, his goal was to make the bishopric become a metropolis, so it would no longer belong to the Archdiocese of Esztergom.Hitchins, p. 668. He went to Vienna in 1779 to become a prefect of studies at the Saint Barbara College, he published in 1780, together with Gheorghe Sincai the first Romanian grammar, Elementa linguae daco-romanae sive valachicae. Klein returned to Blaj, and between 1782 and 1804, he was very productive both in his translations and in writing original works:Hitchins, p. 668-669 * translation of textbooks for Blaj schools * translation of over seventy-seven titles and 7,500 pages from the Church Fathers * a history of Romania entitled ScurtƒÉ cuno≈ütin≈£ƒÉ a istoriei Rom√¢nilor (1792) * a translation of The Granite Matrix (1794) * a translation of the bible (Biblia de la Blaj, 1795) * a four- volume Latin draft of Istoria, lucrurile ≈üi √Ænt√¢mplƒÉrile Rom√¢nilor (1800, though only an 1805 translation to Romanian survived) Klein moved to Buda in 1804 to become the editor at the University of Buda press for the Romanian- language books, hoping that this would allow him to publish his historical works, a project which did not materialise because of his death just two years later.Hitchins, p. 669.

The stoopway entrance that is high and wide leads to a forty-foot passage into a fairly normal limestone crawlway conduit cave.Kleber It is the only known habitat for Louisville cave beetles, that is listed as a Candidate for endangered species status.http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=I0QJ The legend View from east bank The Joneses were supposed to have used the cave as a hideout in the 19th century. They were reportedly bank robbers, counterfeiters, and murderers. They stashed their ill-gotten gains within the cave. The brothers also created eleven rooms to live in within the cave. The Joneses eventually left the area, and their treasure reportedly hid behind collapsed rocks. Since the rooms have never been found, legend often says the gang sealed them off by collapsing the cave roof. The cave was supposedly once large enough to drive a horse and carriage through, but has since \\"shrunk,\\" a geological impossibility.George, 343 Three-inch bars on a gate were supposed to further decrease the chances that someone might find the Jones' gold, silver, and jewels. These bars were said to prevent access to a main passage, which was also supposed to be guarded by a cannon. A book published by University of Kentucky Press has called this account \\"mythical\\". Early descriptions of the area, as late as 1822, make no mention of the cave or legends surrounding it, but it was known to locals as the source of a spring by 1831. It was first definitively called Eleven Jones Cave in 1848. Eight entrances were said to have been located along Beargrass Creek, although none but the main entrance were ever found.George, 344-347 Studies Eleven Jones Cave entrance In 1967 there were two physical survey trips into the cave, but neither found evidence of the Jones Brothers' story, nor for a story that in 1949 an army saber from the American Civil War was found within the cave. All that was found was that the cave had no entrance other than the reliable spring entrance on Beargrass Creek. \\"Bad air\\" is present in the cave, with very high levels of carbon dioxide just inside the entrance. Dangerous hypoxia is possible within minutes, and fatal poisoning is likely farther into the cave. Concentrations of CO2 inside the cave are in excess of 10 times the normal atmospheric value.(Citation needed) It is the only known location for living Louisville cave beetles, Pseudanophthalmus troglodytes. This insect is reddish-brown, small, eyeless, and eats invertebrates. The Louisville cave beetle was described in 1973 from specimens collected from Oxmoor Cave (near Oxmoor Center). During 1994, surveys of other caves that could potentially support the species were conducted and the species was found in only one additional cave: Eleven Jones Cave.2005 Federal Register, 70 FR 24870; Centralized Library: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service - FR Doc 05-9283 Oxmoor Cave was bulldozed over in 1990. The species has been listed as \\"imperiled\\" by the Kentucky Natural Heritage Program. Since 1994 it has been a candidate for ESA protection, but currently has no state or federal protections.Center for Biological Diversity - Candidate Project  In popular media  A character in 17776 hides in Eleven Jones Cave, and breaks the fourth wall to warn the reader not to visit it.

The Wind Farm was developed by Your Energy Ltd, is owned by Mistral Windfarms and operated by Engineering Renewables Ltd. E.ON UK is buying the electricity output of the project under a long-term power purchase agreement. The farm is spread over three hectares. It has an installed capacity of 20 MW and generate on average around 40,000,000 units (kilowatt hours) of electricity annually. The project  Burton Wold Wind Farm Burton Wold Wind Farm was the first to be erected in Northamptonshire. Construction work on the site began in December 2005, and the wind farm became operational in May 2006. It comprises 10 turbines with a total nameplate capacity of 20 megawatts. These 10 turbines have the ability to produce electricity for an average of 10,000 homes each year, the equivalent of 25% of all the homes in the borough of Kettering. The E70-E4 turbines were supplied by Enercon Gmbh of Germany, who are one of the leading manufacturers of wind turbines in the world. Each turbine is 64 meters tall to the hub, the rotor blades have a diameter of 71 meters which gives the turbines an overall height from the ground to the vertical tip of a blade of 99.5 meters. Figures on the Ofgem website show that in 2008 (a leap year) the wind farm produced 43,416 Megawatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to the average needs of 9,237 domestic households. This corresponds to a capacity factor of: \\\\frac{43,416 \\\\mbox{MWh}}{(366 \\\\mbox{days}) \\\\times (24 \\\\mbox{hours/day}) \\\\times (20 \\\\mbox{MW})}=0.2471 \\\\approx{25\\\\%} The wind farm will contribute ¬£280,000 to a community fund during its 25-year life, which is directed towards energy efficiency and education projects within Burton Latimer. The fund is administered by the Kettering Borough Council. The fund has paid for solar hot water heaters at a local sheltered housing development, sun pipes at a local school, and contributed ¬£10,000 towards energy efficient renovations of the Guide Hall. The fund is cited as a case study in two reports produced by the Renewables Advisory Board Delivering Community Benefits from Wind Energy - A Toolkit 2009 The wind farm received a Mention in the 2008 Civic Trust Awards and was shortlisted in the MKSM Excellence Awards in 2009.

Since being founded in 2004, Yoonew provided tickets and ticket derivatives for large sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Stanley Cup, the UEFA European Football Championship, the Final Four and the US Open. History yoonew Inc. was founded in September 2004 by MIT Sloan students Gerry Wilson and Hagos Mehreteab in hopes of creating a method by which die-hard fans without thousands of dollars to spare could get their hands on cheap tickets to major sporting events. The idea was born when Wilson was unable to obtain affordable tickets to the 2003 World Series. After the idea fared well in a couple of business-plan competitions,http://bplan.berkeley.edu Wilson and Mehreteab, a longtime friend, launched the company. The company experienced difficulties early as co-founder Wilson was forced to liquidate his 401(k) in order to provide customers with 2005 NCAA Final Four college basketball tickets in 2005. After struggling initially, Yoonew was able to raise $2 million in investments and began to grow. In October 2007, yoonew changed its interface to provide real- time price plotting similar to that seen on Yahoo! and Google. A point of contention raised regarding the new interface was that it was too heavily geared towards traders, which reduces usability for the average user. To make the site more accessible for the average user, yoonew launches on July 2008, yoonew direct a new interface in Adobe Flash which complements the existing interface (yoonew exchange). Users having an account on yoonew exchange can use the same account to log in yoonew direct and vice versa. In addition, products purchased on yoonew direct can be traded on the yoonew exchange. At the same time, yoonew launched a new feature which allows users to place orders for exact seat (defined by a section, row and seat) unlike the other events where users can only choose the seating category (usually five). At the moment, this feature is only available for the US Open 2008. This company is now out of business. How it worked If a fan believes his favorite team will reach the championship game, he can purchase ticket futures months in advance at a low prices which are market-based. If the team actually makes it to the big game, the fan is guaranteed tickets. If the team is eliminated and the holder has not re-sold their contract, they lose their investment. yoonew offers three types of contracts: * A Team Fantasy Seat for a given team and a given event which entitles the owner the ticket to the event if the team makes it to the event; * A Matchup Fantasy Seat for a given matchup and a given event which entitles the owner the ticket to the event if both teams of the matchup makes it to the event; * A Ticket for a given event. If Matchup Fantasy Seat are riskier than Team Fantasy Seat, they are also much cheaper. During the playoff, the Fantasy Seats of eliminated teams get expired and are removed from their owner's portfolios. When a team becomes a finalist, the Team Fantasy Seat for the team is converted into a ticket. When both teams of a matchup become finalist, the Matchup Fantasy Seats are converted into tickets. The owners of such Fantasy Seats can choose either to sell the ticket on the exchange for a profit or keeps it to go to the game. For example, in 2006, sports fan Joe Kocott bought 18 futures contracts for the Pittsburgh Steelers making the Super Bowl at an average of $185 each. When the Steelers eventually made it to the Super Bowl, he was delivered the tickets, which were selling at around $2,500 each at the time. In 2007, a systems analyst paid $537 apiece for two futures contracts for the New England Patriots for upper- deck seats at University of Phoenix Stadium in Arizona. Since the Patriots made it to the Super Bowl, he ends up with two tickets for the Super Bowl XLII. For Super Bowl XLII, a consumer could have had got a ticket for only $86 had he bought a team fantasy seat for the Giants one month before the big game. More recently in 2008, Craig Cox, an associate professor at Texas Tech's School of Pharmacy bought two Matchup Fantasy Seats for the Steelers and Cardinals at the lower level for the Super Bowl XLIII for only $29.70 apiece one month before the NFL playoff. As both teams made it to the big game, he received two tickets and went to the game with his brother. On the other hand, if a trader believes that a team will unlikely make it to the championship game, he can short the Fantasy Seat. To make sure that the short is covered, yoonew required that the trader owns a ticket. With one ticket to the Super Bowl for instance, the trader can short up to 16 Team Fantasy Seats (one for each team of the AFC conference or one for each team of the NFC conference). If the trader shorts a Team Fantasy Seat for a team which gets eliminated, she earns the amount at which she shorted the Fantasy Seat. However, in the \\"unfortunate\\" case the team makes it to the final, she loses her ticket. End of business On February 1, 2010 Yoonew ceased operations. Yoonew personally called its users on 1/31/2010 to make the announcement and notify customers that Yoonew would not be able to deliver Super Bowl 2010 tickets to customers who owned valid futures for that event. In the phone call, Yoonew indicated that they could not fulfill Super Bowl tickets because the macroeconomic crisis forced the bank responsible for its merchant account to go bankrupt and they had not paid Yoonew the money it was owed for its credit card deposits. Yoonew also indicated that they were in litigation with The Ticket Reserve.http://www.docstoc.com/docs/16746997/The-Ticketreserve-Inc-v-Viagogo- Inc-et-al In understanding that by not delivering the tickets to its customers that there would be no hope for repairing market confidence, Yoonew was forced to end its business. Yoonew promised to return the money its customers paid for their winning Super Bowl 2010 Fantasy Seats. On January 31, 2010 Yoonew decommissioned its forum and blog and directed all inquiries to service[at]yoonew.com.

The airline also independently operated scheduled passenger flights within the state of Texas during the mid-1980s with Douglas DC-9-10 jet and Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop aircraft and briefly served Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and later Wichita, Kansas and Omaha, Nebraska as well.http://www.departedflights.com, Sept. 15, 1984 Emerald Air system timetablehttp://www.departedflights.com, July 15, 1982 Emerald Air route map Operations for Purolator Courier Emerald began operating scheduled cargo flights, which fed Purolator Courier's Columbus, Ohio hub, in October 1978. Operations for Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) In June 1981, the airline began scheduled Douglas DC-9-10 jet service as well as Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop service to feed Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) flights at Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) via a code sharing agreement. Emerald was promoted in print advertising by the carriers as 'Emerald the Pan Am Express.' and operated flights on behalf of Pan Am between Houston and Austin, Corpus Christi, McAllen and San Antonio in Texas.http://departedflights.com, Feb. 1, 1983 Pan Am domestic route map including Emerald Air/Pan Am Express routes Operations for Continental Airlines For a brief time in the mid-1980s, Emerald Air operated a connecting jet shuttle service on behalf of Continental Airlines between Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and Houston Hobby Airport (HOU), which was called the 'Houston Proud Express.' Unlike the Pan Am operations in which Pan Am markings and aircraft livery were not used, Emerald painted its aircraft to mimic those of Continental Airlines' then present orange colors and scheme. This \\"cross-town\\" service in Houston was operated with Douglas DC-9-10 jet aircraft via a code sharing agreement. Independent operations Emerald Air also independently operated scheduled passenger flights primarily within the state of Texas and also briefly to Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma during the early and mid-1980s. According to an Emerald Air route map dated July 15, 1982 as well as the airline's system timetables dated March 15, 1984 and September 15, 1984, the following cities were served:http://www.departedflights.com, July 15, 1982 Emerald Air route map * Austin, TX (AUS) * Corpus Christi, TX (CRP) * Dallas/Fort Worth, TX (DFW) * Houston, TX - Hobby Airport (HOU) and Intercontinental Airport (IAH) * McAllen, TX (MFE) * Oklahoma City, OK (OKC) * Omaha, NE (OMA) * San Antonio, TX (SAT) * Wichita, KS (ICT) According to its March 15, 1984 timetable, Emerald Air was flying nonstop service on the following routes: Austin- Houston, Corpus Christi-Dallas/Ft. Worth, Corpus Christi-Houston, Corpus Christi-McAllen, Dallas/Ft. Worth-McAllen, Houston-McAllen, Houston-San Antonio and McAllen-San Antonio. These flights were operated with Douglas DC-9-10 jet and Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop aircraft. Emerald was an intrastate airline in Texas at this time as it was no longer serving Oklahoma City. In September 1984, Emerald Air then extended its scheduled passenger service north from Dallas/Ft. Worth with a DC-9 jet flight nonstop to Wichita, KS (ICT) with continuing same plane service to Omaha, NE (OMA). According to the October 1, 1989 edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Emerald Air was operating nonstop DC-9 jet service between Newport News (PHF) and Orlando (MCO) twice a week.Oct. 1, 1989 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Newport News & Orlando flight schedules Bankruptcy and acquisition by Bia Cor Holdings Inc. By 1985, Emerald ceased operations primarily in Texas and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 1991, BIA-COR Holdings Inc., acquired Emerald Air's FAA and DOT operating certificate, along with Emerald's three Douglas DC-9-14 aircraft; and renamed the carrier Braniff International Airlines, Inc., before promptly going out of business. Parts of Emerald thus became the third and final resurrection of the Braniff name.

The state was founded in c. 1311 and lasted for six centuries until its peaceful dissolution in 1949 when it merged into the erstwhile Bombay State of India. Geography Sirohi State was in the Rajputana agency. It had an area The territory was much broken up by hills and rocky ranges; the Aravalli range divided it into two portions, running from north-east to south-west. The south and south-east part of the territory is mountainous and rugged, containing the lofty Mount Abu, an isolated mass of granite rock, culminating in a cluster of hills, enclosing several valleys surrounded by rocky ridges, like great hollows. On both sides of the Aravallis the country is intersected with numerous water channels, which run with considerable force and volume during the height of the rainy season, but are dry for the greater part of the year. The only river of any importance is the Western Banas. In 1911 the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition recorded that a large portion of the state was covered with dense jungle, in which wild animals, including the tiger, bear and leopard, abounded; and that the climate was on the whole dry (in the south and east there was usually a fair amount of rain. On Abu the average annual rainfall is about , whereas in Erinpura, less than to the north, the average fall is only between . During the 19th century the Rajputana Railway was built. It traversed the state, and a station was built at Abu Road, south of the town of Sirohi. In 1901 the population of the state was 154,544, showing a decrease of 17% in the decade, due to the results of famine. Gross revenue was ¬£28,000, tribute to the British Raj was ¬£450. The population of the town of Sirohi was 5,651 and its main business was the manufacturing of sword-blades and other weapons. History Sirohi State was founded in c. 1311 by Lumbha, who conquered the area which later formed the state. In 1311, then-ruler Shivabhan established the capital of the state at Shivpuri, 3 kilometers east of the present-day town of Sirohi. In 1425, Rao Sains Mal built the town of Sirohi, while later became the capital of the state. During the early years of the 19th century, Sirohi suffered much from wars with Jodhpur and the hill tribes of the area. The protection of the British was sought in 1817; the pretensions of Jodhpur to suzerainty over Sirohi were disallowed, and in 1823 a treaty was concluded with the British government. Sirohi became a self-governing princely state within British India, and part of the Rajputana Agency. For services rendered during the Revolt of 1857, the Rao received a remission of half his tribute. Rao Keshri Singh (ruled 1875-1920) and his successors were granted the title Maharao (equivalent to Maharaja) in 1889. When India became independent in 1947, there was no immediate consensus about whether Sirohi State should be merged with the new states of Bombay or Rajasthan. Initially, the area under Sirohi State was merged into Bombay 1949, but was transferred to Rajasthan in 1950. Revenue system The traditional practice of revenue collection consisted of bhog batai and halbandi. Bhog batai, the more prevalent practice, consisted of direct collection of a part of the harvested produce by the state. In some areas of the state, halbandi was used, under which a cash tax was imposed on the implements used by farmers. In 1904, a new revenue-collection system was introduced which consisted of revenue collection based on average productivity of the cultivated area as the criterion for payment. From the state's perspective, the new revenue system was largely successful, leading to a large increase in the state's revenue.

Due to his wild personality, poetic lyrics, his widely recognized voice, unpredictable and erratic performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and early death, Morrison is regarded by music critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock history. Since his death, his fame has endured as one of popular culture's most rebellious and oft-displayed icons, representing the generation gap and youth counterculture. Together with Ray Manzarek, Morrison co-founded the Doors during the summer of 1965 in Venice, California. The band spent two years in obscurity until shooting to prominence with their number-one single in the United States, \\"Light My Fire,\\" taken from their self-titled debut album. Morrison wrote or co-wrote many of the Doors' songs, including \\"Light My Fire\\", \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\\", \\"The End\\", \\"Moonlight Drive\\", \\"Wild Child\\", \\"The Soft Parade\\", \\"People Are Strange\\", \\"Hello, I Love You\\", \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", \\"L.A. Woman\\", and \\"Riders on the Storm\\". He recorded a total of six studio albums with the Doors, all of which sold well and received critical acclaim. Morrison was well known for improvising spoken word poetry passages while the band played live. Manzarek said Morrison \\"embodied hippie counterculture rebellion\\". Morrison developed an alcohol dependency during the 1960s, which at times affected his performances on stage. He died unexpectedly at the age of 27 in Paris, among conflicting witness and alleged witness reports. As no autopsy was performed, the cause of Morrison's death remains disputed. Though the Doors recorded two more albums after Morrison died, his death severely affected the band's fortunes, and they split up in 1973. In 1993, Morrison was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Doors. In 2008, he was ranked 47th in Rolling Stone magazine's list \\"The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.\\" Biography=1943‚Äì1961: Early years= Morrison was born in late 1943 in Melbourne, Florida, to Clara Virginia (n√©e Clarke) and Lt.(j.g.) George Stephen Morrison, a future rear admiral in the U.S. Navy. His ancestors were Scottish, Irish, and English.Dead Famous: Jim Morrison Admiral Morrison commanded U.S. naval forces during the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, which provided the pretext for the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1965. Morrison had a younger sister, Anne Robin (born 1947 in Albuquerque, New Mexico), and a younger brother, Andrew Lee Morrison (born 1948 in Los Altos, California). In 1947, when he was three to four years old, Morrison allegedly witnessed a car accident in the desert, during which a truck overturned and some Native Americans were lying injured at the side of the road. He referred to this incident in the Doors' song \\"Peace Frog\\" on their 1970 album Morrison Hotel, as well as in the spoken word performances \\"Dawn's Highway\\" and \\"Ghost Song\\" on the posthumous 1978 album An American Prayer. Morrison believed this incident to be the most formative event of his life, and made repeated references to it in the imagery in his songs, poems, and interviews. His family does not recall this traffic incident happening in the way he told it. According to the Morrison biography No One Here Gets Out Alive, Morrison's family did drive past a car accident on an Indian reservation when he was a child, and he was very upset by it. The book The Doors, written by the surviving members of the Doors, explains how different Morrison's account of the incident was from that of his father. This book quotes his father as saying, \\"We went by several Indians. It did make an impression on him [the young James]. He always thought about that crying Indian.\\" This is contrasted sharply with Morrison's tale of \\"Indians scattered all over the highway, bleeding to death.\\" In the same book, his sister is quoted as saying, \\"He enjoyed telling that story and exaggerating it. He said he saw a dead Indian by the side of the road, and I don't even know if that's true.\\" Raised a military brat, Morrison spent part of his childhood in San Diego, completed third grade in northern Virginia at Fairfax County Elementary School, and attended Charles H. Flato Elementary School in Kingsville, Texas, while his father was stationed at NAS Kingsville in 1952. He continued at St. John's Methodist School in Albuquerque, and then Longfellow School Sixth Grade Graduation Program from San Diego. In 1957, Morrison attended Alameda High School in Alameda, California, for his freshman and first semester of his sophomore year. The Morrison family moved back to northern Virginia in 1959, and he graduated from George Washington High School (now a middle school) in Alexandria in June 1961. =1961‚Äì1963: Literary influences= A voracious reader from an early age, Morrison was particularly inspired by the writings of several philosophers and poets. He was influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche, whose views on aesthetics, morality, and the Apollonian and Dionysian duality would appear in his conversation, poetry and songs. Some of his formative influences were Plutarch's Parallel Lives and the works of the French Symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud, whose style would later influence the form of Morrison's short prose poems. He was also influenced by William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Louis Ferdinand Celine, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Charles Baudelaire, Moli√®re, Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Honor√© de Balzac and Jean Cocteau, along with most of the French existentialist philosophers. His senior year English teacher said, \\"Jim read as much and probably more than any student in class, but everything he read was so offbeat I had another teacher (who was going to the Library of Congress) check to see if the books Jim was reporting on actually existed. I suspected he was making them up, as they were English books on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century demonology. I'd never heard of them, but they existed, and I'm convinced from the paper he wrote that he read them, and the Library of Congress would've been the only source.\\" football game Morrison went to live with his paternal grandparents in Clearwater, Florida, and attended St. Petersburg Junior College. In 1962, he transferred to Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee, and appeared in a school recruitment film. While at FSU, Morrison was arrested for disturbing the peace while drunk at a home football game on September 28, 1963. =1964‚Äì1965: College experience in Los Angeles= In January 1964, Morrison moved to Los Angeles to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Seven months later, his father commanded a carrier division of the U.S. fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. At UCLA, Morrison enrolled in Jack Hirschman's class on Antonin Artaud in the Comparative Literature program within the UCLA English Department. Artaud's brand of surrealist theatre had a profound impact on Morrison's dark poetic sensibility of cinematic theatricality. Morrison completed his undergraduate degree at UCLA's film school within the Theater Arts department of the College of Fine Arts in 1965. At the time of the graduation ceremony, he went to Venice Beach, and the university mailed his diploma to his mother in Coronado, California. He made several short films while attending UCLA. First Love, the first of these films, made with Morrison's classmate and roommate Max Schwartz, was released to the public when it appeared in a documentary about the film Obscura. During these years, while living in Venice Beach, he befriended writers at the Los Angeles Free Press, for which he advocated until his death in 1971\\\\. He conducted a lengthy and in-depth interview with Bob Chorush and Andy Kent, both working for the Free Press at the time (approximately December 6‚Äì8, 1970), and was planning on visiting the headquarters of the busy newspaper shortly before leaving for Paris. =1965‚Äì1971: The Doors= Promotional photo of the Doors in late 1966 In the summer of 1965, after graduating with a bachelor's degree from the UCLA film school, Morrison led a bohemian lifestyle in Venice Beach. Living on the rooftop of a building inhabited by his old UCLA cinematography friend, Dennis Jacobs, he wrote the lyrics of many of the early songs the Doors would later perform live and record on albums, such as \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and \\"Hello, I Love You.\\" According to Manzarek, he lived on canned beans and LSD for several months. Morrison and fellow UCLA student Ray Manzarek were the first two members of the Doors, forming the group during that summer. They had met months earlier as cinematography students. The story claims that Manzarek was lying on the beach at Venice one day, where he accidentally encountered Morrison. He was impressed with Morrison's poetic lyrics, claiming that they were \\"rock group\\" material. Subsequently, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore joined. Krieger auditioned at Densmore's recommendation and was then added to the lineup. All three musicians shared a common interest in the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's meditation practices at the time, attending scheduled classes, but Morrison was not involved in these series of classes. The Doors took their name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception (a reference to the unlocking of doors of perception through psychedelic drug use). Huxley's own title was a quotation from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, in which Blake wrote: \\"If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.\\" Although Morrison was known as the lyricist of the group, Krieger also made significant lyrical contributions, writing or co- writing some of the group's biggest hits, including \\"Light My Fire,\\" \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" \\"Love Her Madly\\" and \\"Touch Me.\\" On the other hand, Morrison, who did not write most songs using an instrument, would come up with vocal melodies for his own lyrics, with the other band members contributing chords and rhythm. Morrison did not play an instrument live (except for maracas and tambourine for most shows, and harmonica on a few occasions) or in the studio (excluding maracas, tambourine, handclaps, and whistling). However, he did play the grand piano on \\"Orange County Suite\\" and a Moog synthesizer on \\"Strange Days.\\" In June 1966, Morrison and the Doors were the opening act at the Whisky a Go Go in the last week of the residency of Van Morrison's band Them. Van's influence on Jim's developing stage performance was later noted by Brian Hinton in his book Celtic Crossroads: The Art of Van Morrison: \\"Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks.\\" On the final night, the two Morrisons and their two bands jammed together on \\"Gloria.\\" In November 1966, Morrison and the Doors produced a promotional film for \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\", which was their first single release. The film featured the four members of the group playing the song on a darkened set with alternating views and close-ups of the performers while Morrison lip-synched the lyrics. Morrison and the Doors continued to make short music films, including \\"The Unknown Soldier\\", \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and \\"People Are Strange\\". Morrison performing with the Doors in 1967 The Doors achieved national recognition after signing with Elektra Records in 1967. The single \\"Light My Fire\\" spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in July/August 1967. This was a far cry from the Doors opening for Simon and Garfunkel or playing at a high school as they did in Connecticut that same year. Later, the Doors appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular Sunday night variety series that had introduced the Beatles and Elvis Presley to the United States. Ed Sullivan requested two songs from the Doors for the show, \\"People Are Strange\\" and \\"Light My Fire\\". Sullivan's censors insisted that the Doors change the lyrics of the song \\"Light My Fire\\" from \\"Girl we couldn't get much higher\\" to \\"Girl we couldn't get much better\\" for the television viewers; this was reportedly due to what was perceived as a reference to drugs in the original lyrics. After giving assurances of compliance to the producer in the dressing room, the band agreed and proceeded to sing the song with the original lyrics. Sullivan was not happy and he refused to shake hands with Morrison or any other band member after their performance. Sullivan had a show producer tell the band that they would never appear on The Ed Sullivan Show again. Morrison reportedly said to the producer, in a defiant tone, \\"Hey man. We just did the Sullivan Show!\\" By the release of their second album, Strange Days, the Doors had become one of the most popular rock bands in the United States. Their blend of blues and dark psychedelic rock included a number of original songs and distinctive cover versions, such as their rendition of \\"Alabama Song,\\" from Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's opera, Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny. The band also performed a number of extended concept works, including the songs \\"The End,\\" \\"When the Music's Over,\\" and \\"Celebration of the Lizard.\\" In 1966, photographer Joel Brodsky took a series of black-and-white photos of Morrison, in a photo shoot known as \\"The Young Lion\\" photo session. These photographs are considered among the most iconic images of Jim Morrison and are frequently used as covers for compilation albums, books, and other memorabilia of the Doors and Morrison. In late 1967 at a concert in New Haven, Connecticut, he was arrested on stage, an incident that further added to his mystique and emphasized his rebellious image. Morrison became the first rock artist to be arrested onstage during a concert performance. Jim Morrison performing in Copenhagen in September 1968 Los Angeles motel room where Morrison lived between 1968 and 1970; currently covered in graffiti from his fans. In 1968, the Doors released their third studio album, Waiting for the Sun. The band performed on July 5 at the Hollywood Bowl; this performance became famous with the DVD: Live at the Hollywood Bowl. It's also this year that the band played, for the first time, in Europe. Their fourth album, The Soft Parade, was released in 1969. It was the first album where the individual band members were given credit on the inner sleeve for the songs they had written. Previously, each song on their albums had been credited simply to \\"The Doors\\". On September 6 and 7, 1968, the Doors played four performances at the Roundhouse, London, England with Jefferson Airplane which was filmed by Granada for a television documentary The Doors Are Open directed by John Sheppard. Around this time, Morrison‚Äîwho had long been a heavy drinker‚Äîstarted showing up for recording sessions visibly inebriated. He was also frequently late for live performances. By early 1969, the formerly svelte singer had gained weight, grown a beard and mustache, and begun dressing more casually ‚Äî abandoning the leather pants and concho belts for slacks, jeans, and T-shirts. During a concert on March 1 at the Dinner Key Auditorium in Miami, Morrison attempted to spark a riot in the audience, in part by screaming \\"You wanna see my cock?\\" and other obscenities. He failed, but six warrants for his arrest were issued by the Dade County Police department three days later for indecent exposure, among other things. Consequently, many of the Doors' scheduled concerts were canceled. After Miami, Morrison lost his desire to perform with The Doors, and even tried to quit many times. He had become tired of the rock- star life. On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and profanity by a six-person jury in Miami after a trial that had 16 days of testimony.\\"Rock King Jim Morrison Found Guilty of Exposure\\", Palm Beach (FL) Post, September 21, 1970, pD-10 Morrison, who attended the October 30 sentencing \\"in a wool jacket adorned with Indian designs\\", silently listened as he was sentenced to six months in prison and had to pay a $500 fine. Morrison remained free on a $50,000 bond. At the sentencing, Judge Murray Goodman told Morrison that he was a \\"person graced with a talent\\" admired by many of his peers; Morrison remained free on $50,000 bond while the conviction was appealed. His death eight months later made the appeal a moot point. On December 8, 2010‚Äîthe 67th anniversary of Morrison's birth‚ÄîFlorida Governor Charlie Crist and the state clemency board unanimously signed a complete posthumous pardon for Morrison. Drummer John Densmore denied Morrison ever exposed himself on stage that night. Following The Soft Parade, the Doors released Morrison Hotel. After a lengthy break, the group reconvened in October 1970 to record their final album with Morrison, titled L.A. Woman. Shortly after the recording sessions for the album began, producer Paul A. Rothchild ‚Äî who had overseen all of their previous recordings ‚Äî left the project, and engineer Bruce Botnick took over as producer. =July 3, 1971: Death= Morrison's apartment in Le Marais, Paris After recording L.A. Woman in Los Angeles, Morrison joined Pamela Courson in Paris in March 1971, at an apartment she had rented for him at 17‚Äì19, Rue Beautreillis in Le Marais, 4th arrondissement, Paris. In letters, he described going for long walks through the city, alone.Kennealy (1992) pp.314‚Äì16 During this time, he shaved his beard and lost some of the weight he had gained in the previous months. He died on July 3, 1971, at age 27. He was reportedly found by Courson in the bathtub of the apartment. The official cause of death was listed as heart failure, although no autopsy was performed, as it was not required by French law. It has also been reported, by several individuals who say they were eyewitnesses, that his death was due to an accidental heroin overdose. His death came two years to the day after the death of Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones and approximately nine months after the deaths of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin ‚Äî all of whom died at the age of 27. Three years after his death, Courson also died at the age of 27. Personal relationships=Morrison's family= USS Bon Homme Richard in January 1964 Morrison's early life was the semi-nomadic existence typical of military families. Jerry Hopkins recorded Morrison's brother, Andy, explaining that his parents had determined never to use physical corporal punishment such as spanking on their children. They instead instilled discipline and levied punishment by the military tradition known as \\"dressing down.\\" This consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings. Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family. By the time Morrison's music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that his parents and siblings were dead (or claiming, as it has been widely misreported, that he was an only child). This misinformation was published as part of the materials distributed with the Doors' self-titled debut album. Admiral Morrison was not supportive of his son's career choice in music. One day, an acquaintance brought over a record thought to have Jim on the cover. The record was the Doors' self-titled debut. The young man played the record for Morrison's father and family. Upon hearing the record, Morrison's father wrote him a letter telling him \\"to give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I consider to be a complete lack of talent in this direction.\\" In a letter to the Florida Probation and Parole Commission District Office dated October 2, 1970, Morrison's father acknowledged the breakdown in family communications as the result of an argument over his assessment of his son's musical talents. He said he could not blame his son for being reluctant to initiate contact and that he was proud of him. Morrison spoke fondly of his Irish and Scottish ancestry and was inspired by Celtic mythology in his poetry and songs. Celtic Family Magazine revealed in its 2016 Spring Issue that his Morrison clan was originally from the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, while his Irish side, the Clelland clan who married into the Morrison line, were from County Down, Northern Ireland. =Relationships= Morrison was sought after by many as a photographer's model, confidante, romantic partner and sexual conquest. Throughout his life he had at least several serious, ongoing relationships, and many casual encounters. By many accounts, he could also be inconsistent with his partners, displaying what some recall as \\"a dual personality\\". Doors producer Paul Rothchild recalls, \\"Jim really was two very distinct and different people. A Jekyll and Hyde. When he was sober, he was Jekyll, the most erudite, balanced, friendly kind of guy ... He was Mr. America. When he would start to drink, he'd be okay at first, then, suddenly, he would turn into a maniac. Turn into Hyde.\\" Morrison spent the majority of his adult life in an open, and at times very charged and intense, relationship with Pamela Courson. They met while both were attending college, and she encouraged him to develop his poetry. Through to the end, Courson saw Morrison as more than a rock star, as \\"a great poet\\"; she constantly encouraged him and pushed him to write. Courson attended his concerts, and focused on supporting his career. Like Morrison, she was described by many as fiery, determined and attractive, as someone who was tough despite appearing fragile. Manzarek called Pamela \\"Jim's other half\\" and said, \\"I never knew another person who could so complement his bizarreness.\\" Courson was buried by her family as Pamela Susan Morrison, after Jim Morrison's death, despite the two having never been married. After Courson's death in 1974, and her parents petitioned the court for inheritance of Morrison's estate, the probate court in California decided that she and Morrison had once had what qualified as a common-law marriage, despite neither having applied for such status, and the common-law marriage not being recognized in California. Morrison's will at the time of his death named Courson as the sole heir. Morrison dedicated his published poetry books The Lords and New Creatures and the lost writings Wilderness to her. A number of writers have speculated that songs like \\"Love Street,\\" \\"Orange County Suite\\" and \\"Queen of the Highway,\\" among other songs, may have been written about her. Though the relationship was \\"tumultuous\\" much of the time, and both also had relationships with others, they always maintained a unique and ongoing connection with one another, right up until the end. One of Morrison's early significant relationships was with Mary Werbelow, whom he met on the beach in Florida, when they were teenagers in 1962. In a 2005 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, she said Morrison spoke to her before a photo shoot for the Doors' fourth album and told her the first three albums were about her. Throughout his career, Morrison had regular sexual and romantic encounters with fans (including groupies) such as Pamela Des Barres, as well as ongoing affairs with other musicians, writers and photographers involved in the music business. These included Nico, an encounter with singer Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane while the two bands toured together, an on-again, off- again relationship with 16 Magazines Gloria Stavers, as well as an alleged alcohol-fueled encounter with Janis Joplin. David Crosby said many years later Morrison treated Joplin meanly at a party at the Calabasas, California, home of John Davidson while Davidson was out of town. She reportedly hit him over the head with a bottle of whiskey in retaliation during a fight in front of witnesses. Thereafter, whenever Joplin had a conversation with someone who mentioned Morrison, Joplin referred to him as \\"that asshole,\\" never by his first or last name.legitimate source with music business publicist Danny Fields' statement on Janis Joplin's opinion of Jim Morrison First written about in No One Here Gets Out Alive, Break On Through, and later in her own memoir, Strange Days: My Life with and without Jim Morrison, Morrison participated in a Celtic Pagan handfasting ceremony with rock critic Patricia Kennealy. The couple signed a handwritten document, and were declared wed by a Celtic High Priestess and High Priest on Midsummer's Night in 1970, but none of the necessary paperwork for a legal marriage was filed with the state. The couple had been friends, and then in a long-distance relationship, since meeting at a private interview for Jazz & Pop magazine in January 1969. The handfasting ceremony is described in No One Here Gets Out Alive as a \\"blending of souls on a karmic and cosmic plane.\\" Morrison was also still seeing Pamela Courson when he was in Los Angeles, and later moved to Paris for the summer where Courson had acquired an apartment. In an interview in the book Rock Wives, Kennealy says he turned \\"really cold\\" when she became pregnant, leading her to speculate that maybe he hadn't taken the wedding as seriously as he'd led her to believe. The author notes the pregnancy was not her choice. She also notes that his coldness and distance was during the trial in Miami, and that \\"he was scared to death. They were really out to put him away. Jim was devastated that he wasn't getting any public support.\\" As he did with so many people, Morrison could be cruel and cold and then turn warm and loving; he wrote in letters that he was planning on returning to her, to New York City, in the fall of '71. However, Kennealy was skeptical. Morrison seemed to be falling apart. He was back with Courson in Paris, he was severely alcoholic and in poor health, and like many, Kennealy feared he was dying. At the time of Morrison's death, there were multiple paternity actions pending against him, although no claims were made against his estate by any of the putative paternity claimants. Artistic influences Jim Morrison Memorial in Germany (Berlin-Baumschulenweg) Although Morrison's early education was routinely disrupted as he moved from school to school, he was drawn to the study of literature, poetry, religion, philosophy and psychology, among other fields. Biographers have consistently pointed to a number of writers and philosophers who influenced Morrison's thinking and, perhaps, his behavior.Manzarek, Ray. Light My Fire. New York: Berkley Boulevard Books, 1998 (). Penguin edition While still in his adolescence, Morrison discovered the works of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. He was also drawn to the poetry of William Blake, Charles Baudelaire, and Arthur Rimbaud. Beat Generation writers such as Jack Kerouac and libertine writers such as the Marquis de Sade also had a strong influence on Morrison's outlook and manner of expression; Morrison was eager to experience the life described in Kerouac's On the Road. He was similarly drawn to the work of French writer Louis-Ferdinand C√©line. C√©line's book, Voyage Au Bout de la Nuit (Journey to the End of the Night) and Blake's Auguries of Innocence both echo through one of Morrison's early songs, \\"End of the Night\\". Morrison later met and befriended Michael McClure, a well-known Beat poet. McClure had enjoyed Morrison's lyrics but was even more impressed by his poetry and encouraged him to further develop his craft. Morrison's vision of performance was colored by the works of 20th-century French playwright Antonin Artaud (author of Theater and its Double) and by Judith Malina and Julian Beck's Living Theater. Other works relating to religion, mysticism, ancient myth and symbolism were of lasting interest, particularly Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces. James Frazer's The Golden Bough also became a source of inspiration and is reflected in the title and lyrics of the song \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\". Morrison was particularly attracted to the myths and religions of Native American cultures. While he was still at school, his family moved to New Mexico where he got to see some of the places and artifacts important to the American Southwest Indigenous cultures. These interests appear to be the source of many references to creatures and places such as lizards, snakes, deserts and \\"ancient lakes\\" that appear in his songs and poetry. His interpretation and imagination of Native American ceremonies and peoples (which, based on his readings, he referred to by the anthropological term \\"shamans\\") influenced his stage routine, notably in seeking trance states and vision through dancing to the point of exhaustion. In particular, Morrison's poem \\"The Ghost Song\\" was inspired by his readings about the Native American Ghost Dance. Morrison's vocal influences included Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra, which is evident in his baritone crooning style on several of the Doors' songs. In the 1981 documentary The Doors: A Tribute to Jim Morrison, producer Paul Rothchild relates his first impression of Morrison as being a \\"Rock and Roll Bing Crosby\\". Sugerman states that Morrison, as a teenager, was such a fan of Presley that he demanded silence when Elvis was on the radio. He states that Sinatra was Morrison's favorite singer. According to record producer David Anderle, Morrison considered Brian Wilson \\"his favorite musician\\" and the Beach Boys' 1967 LP Wild Honey \\"one of his favorite albums. ... he really got into it.\\" Wallace Fowlie, professor emeritus of French literature at Duke University, wrote Rimbaud and Jim Morrison, subtitled \\"The Rebel as Poet ‚Äì A Memoir\\". In this, he recounts his surprise at receiving a fan letter from Morrison who, in 1968, thanked him for his latest translation of Arthur Rimbaud's verse into English. \\"I don't read French easily\\", he wrote, \\"...your book travels around with me.\\" Fowlie went on to give lectures on numerous campuses comparing the lives, philosophies, and poetry of Morrison and Rimbaud. The book The Doors by the remaining Doors quotes Morrison's close friend Frank Lisciandro as saying that too many people took a remark of Morrison's that he was interested in revolt, disorder, and chaos \\"to mean that he was an anarchist, a revolutionary, or, worse yet, a nihilist. Hardly anyone noticed that Jim was paraphrasing Rimbaud and the Surrealist poets.\\" Poetry and film Morrison began writing in earnest during his adolescence. At UCLA he studied the related fields of theater, film, and cinematography. He self- published two separate volumes of his poetry in 1969, titled The Lords / Notes on Vision and The New Creatures. The Lords consists primarily of brief descriptions of places, people, events and Morrison's thoughts on cinema. The New Creatures verses are more poetic in structure, feel and appearance. These two books were later combined into a single volume titled The Lords and The New Creatures. These were the only writings published during Morrison's lifetime. Morrison befriended Beat poet Michael McClure, who wrote the afterword for Jerry Hopkins' biography of Morrison, No One Here Gets Out Alive. McClure and Morrison reportedly collaborated on a number of unmade film projects, including a film version of McClure's infamous play The Beard, in which Morrison would have played Billy the Kid. After his death, a further two volumes of Morrison's poetry were published. The contents of the books were selected and arranged by Morrison's friend, photographer Frank Lisciandro, and girlfriend Pamela Courson's parents, who owned the rights to his poetry. The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison Volume I is titled Wilderness, and, upon its release in 1988, became an instant New York Times Bestseller. Volume II, The American Night, released in 1990, was also a success. Morrison recorded his own poetry in a professional sound studio on two separate occasions. The first was in March 1969 in Los Angeles and the second was on December 8, 1970. The latter recording session was attended by Morrison's personal friends and included a variety of sketch pieces. Some of the segments from the 1969 session were issued on the bootleg album The Lost Paris Tapes and were later used as part of the Doors' An American Prayer album, released in 1978. The album reached No. 54 on the music charts. Some poetry recorded from the December 1970 session remains unreleased to this day and is in the possession of the Courson family. Morrison's best-known but seldom seen cinematic endeavor is HWY: An American Pastoral, a project he started in 1969. Morrison financed the venture and formed his own production company in order to maintain complete control of the project. Paul Ferrara, Frank Lisciandro, and Babe Hill assisted with the project. Morrison played the main character, a hitchhiker turned killer/car thief. Morrison asked his friend, composer/pianist Fred Myrow, to select the soundtrack for the film. =Paris Journal= After his death, a notebook of poetry written by Morrison was recovered, titled Paris Journal; amongst other personal details, it contains the allegorical foretelling of a man who will be left grieving and having to abandon his belongings, due to a police investigation into a death connected to the Chinese opium trade. \\"Weeping, he left his pad on orders from police and furnishings hauled away, all records and mementos, and reporters calculating tears & curses for the press: 'I hope the Chinese junkies get you' and they will for the [opium] poppy rules the world\\". The concluding stanzas of this poem convey disappointment for someone with whom he had had an intimate relationship and contain a further invocation of Billy the killer/Hitchhiker, a common character in Morrison's body of work. \\"This is my poem for you, Great flowing funky flower'd beast, Great perfumed wreck of hell...Someone new in your knickers & who would that be? You know, You know more, than you let on...Tell them you came & saw & look'd into my eyes & saw the shadow of the guard receding, Thoughts in time & out of season The Hitchhiker stood by the side of the road & levelled his thumb in the calm calculus of reason.\\" In 2013, another of Morrison's notebooks from Paris, found alongside the Paris Journal in the same box, known as the 127 Fascination box, sold for $250,000 at auction. This box of personal belongings similarly contained a home movie of Pamela Courson dancing in an unspecified cemetery in Corsica, the only film so far recovered to have been filmed by Morrison. The box also housed a number of older notebooks and journals and may initially have included the \\"Steno Pad\\" and the falsely titled The Lost Paris Tapes bootleg, if they had not been separated from the primary collection and sold by Philippe Dalecky with this promotional title. Those familiar with the voices of Morrison's friends and colleagues later determined that, contrary to the story advanced by Dalecky that this was Morrison's final recording made with busking Parisian musicians, the Lost Paris Tapes are in fact of \\"Jomo & The Smoothies\\": Morrison, friend Michael McClure and producer Paul Rothchild loose jamming in Los Angeles, well before Paris 1971. Grave site P√®re Lachaise in August 2008, with the Greek inscription ŒöŒëŒ§Œë Œ§ŒüŒù ŒîŒëŒôŒúŒüŒùŒë ŒïŒëŒ•Œ§ŒüŒ• Morrison was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, one of the city's most visited tourist attractions, where Irish playwright Oscar Wilde, French cabaret singer Edith Piaf, and many other poets and artists are also buried. The grave had no official marker until French officials placed a shield over it, which was stolen in 1973. The grave was listed in the cemetery directory with Morrison's name incorrectly arranged as \\"Douglas James Morrison.\\" In 1981, Croatian sculptor Mladen Mikulin voluntarily placed a bust of his own design and a new gravestone with Morrison's name at the grave to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Morrison's death; the bust was defaced through the years by vandals, and later stolen in 1988. Mikulin made another bust of Morrison in 1989, and a bronze portrait of him in 2001; neither piece is at the gravesite. In 1990, Morrison's father, George Stephen Morrison, after a consultation with E. Nicholas Genovese, Professor of Classics and Humanities, San Diego State University, placed a flat stone on the grave. The bronze plaque thereon bears the Greek inscription: ŒöŒëŒ§Œë Œ§ŒüŒù ŒîŒëŒôŒúŒüŒùŒë ŒïŒëŒ•Œ§ŒüŒ•, usually translated as \\"true to his own spirit\\" or \\"according to his own daemon.\\"Liewer, Steve (November 28, 2008) inscription: ŒöŒëŒ§Œë Œ§ŒüŒù ŒîŒëŒôŒúŒüŒùŒë ŒïŒëŒ•Œ§ŒüŒ•. \\"George 'Steve' Morrison; Rear Admiral Flew Combat Missions in Lengthy Career\\" . The San Diego Union-Tribune. Accessed November 18, 2010. Legacy=Musical= Morrison was, and continues to be, one of the most popular and influential singer-songwriters and iconic frontmen in rock history. To this day Morrison is widely regarded as the prototypical rock star: surly, sexy, scandalous, and mysterious. The leather pants he was fond of wearing both onstage and off have since become stereotyped as rock-star apparel. In 2011, a Rolling Stone readers' pick placed Jim Morrison in fifth place of the magazine's \\"Best Lead Singers of All Time\\". He was also ranked number 22 on Classic Rock magazine's \\"50 Greatest Singers in Rock\\". In 1993, Morrison was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Doors. Iggy and the Stooges are said to have formed after lead singer Iggy Pop was inspired by Morrison while attending a Doors concert in Ann Arbor, Michigan. One of Pop's most popular songs, \\"The Passenger\\", is said to be based on one of Morrison's poems. Layne Staley, the vocalist of Alice in Chains; Morten Harket, The vocalist of A-ha; Eddie Vedder, the vocalist of Pearl Jam; Scott Weiland, the vocalist of Stone Temple Pilots, and Velvet Revolver; Glenn Danzig, singer, and founder of Danzig; Julian Casablancas of the Strokes; James LaBrie of Dream Theater; Scott Stapp of Creed; and Ville Valo of H.I.M. have all said that Morrison was their biggest influence and inspiration. Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver have both covered \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" by the Doors. Weiland also filled in for Morrison to perform \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\\" with the rest of the Doors. Stapp filled in for Morrison for \\"Light My Fire,\\" \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" on VH1 Storytellers; Travis Meeks, of Days of the New, also performed \\"The End.\\" Creed performed their version of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" with Robby Krieger for the 1999 Woodstock Festival. Morrison's recital of his poem \\"Bird of Prey\\" can be heard throughout the song \\"Sunset\\" by Fatboy Slim. Rock band Bon Jovi featured Morrison's grave in their \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\\" video clip. The band Radiohead mentions Jim Morrison in their song \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\", stating \\"I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison\\". Alice Cooper in the liner notes of the album Killer stated that the song \\"Desperado\\" is about Jim Morrison. The leather trousers of U2's lead singer Bono's \\"The Fly\\" persona for the Achtung Baby era and subsequent Zoo TV Tour is attributed to Jim Morrison. In 2012 electronic music producer Skrillex released \\"Breakn' a Sweat\\" which contained vocals from an interview with Jim Morrison. Morrison was also referenced in the Lana Del Rey song \\"Gods & Monsters\\" in the line \\"living like Jim Morrison.\\" =Other= In June 2013, a fossil analysis discovered a large lizard in Myanmar. The extinct reptile was given the moniker Barbaturex morrisoni in honor of Morrison. \\"This is a king lizard, and he was the lizard king, so it just fit,\\" said Jason Head, a paleontologist at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln.

The novel was a New York Times Book Review Notable Book and won the WH Smith Literary Award in 1999. It was nominated for the Booker Prize in what was Bainbridge's fifth nomination. Plot summary The novel is told in six chapters, the first two set in Liverpool in 1846 and 1850, the remainder set in 1854 Crimea ending outside Sevastopol. George Hardy, an attractive English surgeon, amateur photographer and bisexual, leaves his affluent lifestyle in Liverpool, where he is heir to a fortune, to go to war at Inkerman in the Crimea. He believes \\"that the war would at last provide him with the prop he needed.\\" His story is told by three other characters: Myrtle, a lovestruck foundling who bears Hardy's children, Dr. Potter, an intellectual and geologist and Pompey Jones, a one-time street performer who learns photography from Hardy.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 called it a general aviation facility. It is owned and operated by the city of Mineral Wells. The airport, and the city, lie in Palo Pinto County and Parker County. The terminal is in Parker County.  History  Originally established as Camp Wolters in 1925, it was named for Brig. Gen. Jacob F. Wolters, commander of the Fifty-sixth Brigade of the National Guard, and designated a summer training site for his units. Mineral Wells donated of land, leased , and in World War II provided land to increase the camp's area to . The airfield opened in May 1943 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a training base. The army camp became an important infantry-replacement training center with a troop capacity that reached a peak of 24,973. In December 1945 the entire facility was deactivated. Local businessmen purchased the land and facilities and converted them to private use. The tensions of the cold war, however, resulted in the reopening of the camp in early 1951, under the authority of the United States Air Force. At the installation, then named Wolters Air Force Base, was housed the newly formed Aviation Engineer Force. Special-category army and air force personnel were trained there. In September 1956 the base became the Primary Helicopter Center directed by the United States Army. In June 1963 it was renamed Fort Wolters. At the time all army rotary-wing aviators received basic and primary flight training there. The Vietnam War increased the need for pilots, and the base became the home for training not just army personnel, but also helicopter pilots for the Marine Corps in 1968 and for the Air Force in 1970. By 1970 Fort Wolters covered and leased an additional 1,700 to help handle the 1,200 helicopters used at the camp. By January 1, 1973, 40,000 students had completed the twenty-week training program. The base was also the home of the Beach Army Hospital, the Eighty-fourth Military Police Detachment, the 328th United States Army Band, and United States Army Reserve Detachment 20, Sixteenth Weather Squadron. In 1975 orders deactivating the base were issued. Part of the land and facilities became the property of the city and private businessmen; and thirteen buildings became the Education Center of Weatherford College. A portion of the land was transferred by the United States government to the state of Texas for development as part of Lake Mineral Wells State Park. Pioneer Air Lines began flying to Mineral Wells in 1947; in 1949 it scheduled eight DC-3 departures a day. Successor Continental pulled out in 1958-59. Facilities Mineral Wells Airport covers 505 acres (204 ha) at an elevation of 974 feet (297 m). It has two runways: 13/31 is 5,996 by 100 feet (1,828 x 30 m) and 17/35 is 4,188 by 100 feet (1,277 x 30 m). In the year ending April 28, 2017 the airport had 32,250 aircraft operations, average 88 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% military. 59 aircraft were then based at this airport: 81% single-engine, 10% multi-engine, 7% helicopter, 1% jet, and 1% ultralight.  Accidents and incidents  * 14 June 1985: A Cessna T210N, registration N6993N, was destroyed when it struck a hillside about 1/2 mi (0.8 km) short of the runway during an attempted nighttime forced landing after an engine failure. The pilot, the sole occupant, suffered minor injuries. The accident was attributed to fuel exhaustion and the pilot's failure to identify unsafe or hazardous conditions. Contributing factors were dark night conditions, rough terrain, and trees at the crash site. * 10 June 1990: A Gyroflug SC01B160, registration N3412L, went into a steep bank and struck the ground on approach to land, destroying the aircraft and killing the pilot. One of the propeller blades was found 1/4 mi (0.4 km) from the crash site and several deficiences were found in the remaining propeller assembly. The accident was attributed to \\"total propeller blade retention failure, the resultant separation of one propeller blade, and the improper installation of the propeller by unknown maintenance personnel.\\" * 4 July 2001: The pilot of an experimental Glover RV-8, registration N50FG, lost control of the aircraft during the takeoff roll when the control stick jammed under the instrument panel; as the pilot attempted to turn onto another runway, a crosswind caused the right wing to strike the ground, spinning the aircraft around. The pilot and single passenger escaped uninjured but the aircraft was destroyed in a post-crash fire. The accident was attributed to \\"the jammed elevator control stick on takeoff roll. A contributory factor was the crosswind.\\" * 12 November 2003: Immediately after taking off for a night cross-country flight, a Cessna 152, registration N95604, descended steeply and impacted terrain nose-first, causing substantial aircraft damage and seriously injuring the pilot and a single passenger. The pilot had no recollection of the flight afterwards. The accident was attributed to \\"the pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall.\\" * 18 November 2003: During a simulated engine-out approach, a Cessna 550, registration N418MA began to sink rapidly and continued to descend despite the immediate application of full power to both engines and 12¬∞ of nose-up pitch. The jet touched down 350 ft (107 m) short of the runway threshold, collided with a berm, and was consumed in a post-crash fire. 1 of the 4 occupants suffered serious injuries. One pilot remarked that he had \\"never experienced wind shear like that before.\\" The accident was attributed to \\"The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain control of the airplane while executing a simulated engine failure on final approach. A factor was the windshear.\\" * 4 August 2004: A Piper PA-32-260 Cherokee Six, registration N3352W, was flying over Runway 31 at an altitude of about 150 ft (46 m) AGL when it suddenly pitched up, banked, and descended sharply, colliding with a power pole and crashing off-airport. The 2 occupants were killed. The accident was attributed to \\"the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in a stall. A contributing factor was the low altitude.\\" * 11 November 2006: A McCutchan Glasair, registration N606MC, spiraled to the ground and crashed 1.68 mi (2.70 km) short of the runway, killing both aircraft occupants. The aircraft was found with the fuel tanks and carburetor float bowl empty, with no signs of leaked fuel at the crash site, and the propeller blades showing no signatures of rotation on impact. The accident was attributed to \\"The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed during a forced landing, resulting in an inadvertent stall. A factor was the loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.\\" * 21 September 2016: A Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche, registration N7663Y, lost power in both engines on approach and the pilot initiated an off-airport forced landing; the aircraft suffered substantial damage and the pilot and 1 of 2 passengers were seriously injured. Immediately before losing power, the pilot had switched from the auxiliary tanks to the main tanks, which were found empty. However, investigators found evidence that the wing tip fuel tanks had been full, writing that \\"...it is likely that pilot did not use the tip fuel tanks during the previous flight despite believing that he had done so and instead used the main and auxiliary fuel tanks.\\" The accident was attributed to \\"The pilot's fuel mismanagement, which resulted in fuel starvation to both engines and their subsequent loss of engine power.\\"  See also  * Texas World War II Army Airfields  References  ;Notes ;Citations  Other sources  * * Shaw, Frederick J.

He is best known as the founder of UK estate agency Foxtons, and is more recently known as the founder of Pavilion, the business members club chain. He has developed Wilderness Reserve, an area of restored natural lakes, parkland and woods situated in Suffolk's Yox Valley. Early life and career Jonathan Michael Hunt was born in June 1953, in Colchester, Essex, into an Army family. Hunt was awarded a scholarship to Millfield boarding school (tennis, rugby and swimming). He left after O-levels to join the Army, passing basic training for the Royal Artillery, where his father had been a colonel. After leaving the army, and following a short spell washing cars in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Hunt returned to the UK in 1972 and spent the next eight years working as an estate agent in Woking and Guildford, Surrey. Foxtons Hunt's property career began at age 19 when he borrowed a ¬£100 deposit to buy a one-bedroom conversion flat in Walton Road, Woking for ¬£4,500. In 1982 Hunt, then aged 28, founded Foxtons with school friend Anthony Pelligrinelli, who put in ¬£30,000 to fund the business in its first year. The company took its name from a village near Hunt's Suffolk home. Hunt has since commented: :\\"When Foxtons opened in 1981 I had no idea there was a recession going on. I didn‚Äôt often read the newspapers let alone the business pages.\\" The firm's office in London's Notting Hill Gate neighbourhood distinguished itself from competing estate agents by opening a then-unusual 74 hours a week, including weekend and evening hours, rather than the conventional 40 hours worked by rival estate agents. Foxtons expanded to other London districts, each new branch offering a 0% commission in its first three months of operation to attract customers, thereafter charging higher rates than competitors. The property crash of 1988‚Äì94 had a severe impact on the firm. In a 2010 interview, Hunt recalled: :‚Äú‚Ä¶Foxtons had no significant lettings department and as a consequence it barely hung on ‚Äì we were close to going bust every day\\". The experience prompted Hunt to expand into lettings, relying on the additional income stream to cover operating costs during future downturns. Other notable Foxtons initiatives from Hunt included an early web presence, initiated in 1999, and an 800-strong fleet of branded Minis driven by agents. During Hunt's tenure Foxtons grew to 20 branches, over 1,600 employees in the UK and US, ¬£110m in turnover and ¬£34m profits. Director Magazine called the company \\"...London's biggest, brashest estate agency.\\" Hunt is quoted as saying that Foxtons clients expected it ‚Äú‚Ä¶go to war for them\\", while others described the company culture as overly competitive. A 2006 BBC documentary of the UK estate agency industry accused Foxtons agents of misleading clients, falsifying signatures and destroying the signs of rival agencies. Hunt later agreed that the company had made mistakes, though he felt the programme was edited unfairly. Hunt sold Foxtons to private equity group BC Partners for ¬£375 million in May 2007, at what some commentators described as the height of the UK property market. Interviewed by the Evening Standard newspaper in 2010, Hunt insisted that his timing of the sale was straightforward: :\\"If you remember, there was a rampant market ... I did think this is roughly the right time and if you're going to go, go now. I'm absolutely not a genius.\\" Commercial and residential property investments Since selling Foxtons, Hunt has made significant investments into commercial and residential property in central London. These investments, along with other family property holdings, are managed by Ocubis Ltd. In December 2011 Ocubis received planning consent for a 120,000 square foot mixed use redevelopment of its building at 150 Holborn, designed by Make Architects. Ocubis also refurbished the 120,000 sq ft Fulham Green Campus next to Putney Bridge tube station in 2012 and their agents Savills, Frost Meadowcroft and Hanover Green let these offices to tenants including Emma Bridgewater, Hurtigruten, Green Fields Technology and Sweaty Betty.http://www.fulhamgreen.com/tenants Fulham Green website In May 2013 Ocubis purchased the Grade II* listed building at No.5 St James's Square, formerly the Libyan Embassy. The Times newspaper reports that Hunt plans to refurbish the building to provide 15,000 sq ft of office space, along with 13 luxury flats currently under construction on an adjoining site. In October 2015, the parent company for Ocubis filed accounts showing that pre-tax profits in 2014 reached ¬£3m, up from ¬£1.6m the year before, with staff numbers rising to 82 from 61. The company is said to be seeking rents of ¬£160 per sq ft for its office building at 5 St James's Square, making it among the most expensive in London. In 2010, Hunt formed Bacchus Partners, which invests in sites suitable for residential or retail development in the South East of England. Focusing on sites between ¬£200,000 and ¬£1 million in value, Bacchus works with local property professionals who identify suitable investments in their local area in exchange for an equity stake in the development project. Pavilion Hunt owns and operates Pavilion, a business members' club in Kensington High Street. Pavilion is an up-market serviced office catering to entrepreneurs and business executives; it has been described by The Times as \\"...an office rental club aimed at affluent start-ups\\". It opened under the name \\"Dryland\\" in 2011. Heveningham Hall Heveningham Hall is a 5000-acre 18th-century Suffolk estate owned by Hunt. It was first purchased by him in 1994. It hosts an annual motorsport and classic car event, the Heveningham Hall Concours d'Elegance. It also hosts an annual country fair, reported to attract over 10,000 attendees. All proceeds from the fair go to local community charities. A Grade I listed Palladian country house, Heveningham was designed by 18th-century English architects Sir Robert Taylor and James Wyatt; its garden was designed by noted 18th century landscape artist Capability Brown and is being restored by Kim Wilkie. The project is expected to require the planting of 800,000 trees. Up to 20 hectares of broadleaf woodland is being planted each year. Wilkie is implementing a set of plans drawn up by Brown that had lain abandoned since 1782. The plans had hitherto been unrecognised as Brown's work. Hunt also owns a property in Kensington Palace Gardens, London, known as London's most expensive street, where he plans to house his collection of vintage cars. Wilderness Reserve In 2013 Hunt launched the Wilderness Reserve, an area of restored natural lakes, parkland and woods situated in Suffolk's Yox Valley on the Heritage Coast. The reserve is part of a recently implemented design by the noted landscape architect 'Lancelot 'Capability' Brown (1716-1783). In developing the Reserve, Hunt purchased 5000 acres of land, restored buildings and oversaw the reintroduction of wildlife and various species of flora and fauna. Hunt's private residence is adjacent to the Reserve; within the Reserve Hunt has made various buildings available for private hire, including Sibton Hall. He told the Financial Times: \\"Farming alone won‚Äôt pay for a modern estate to survive. Real estate will.\\" Personal life Hunt is married to Lois, a former nurse, and they have four children together. In press reports he is described as having the \\"bearing and manner of a former military man\\" and being \\"like an ex-SAS officer\\", as well as \\"famously tight-lipped\\". He is a known collector of classic Ferraris.

Early life Louis Lambillotte was born at La Hamaide, near Charleroi and began studying solf√®ge, piano, and harmony at the age of seven.Callens S.J., Paul L. \\"Louis Lambillote S.J.\\", Caecilia, January/February 1955, pp. 72‚Äì73 At the age of fifteen, he became organist in Charleroi; later he went in a similar capacity to Dinant (Belgium). In 1820 he was appointed choirmaster and organist of the Jesuit College of Saint-Acheul, Amiens. While exercising these functions he also studied the classics, and at the end of five years, in August, 1825, he entered the Society of Jesus. The thirty years of his Jesuit life were spent successively in the colleges of Saint-Acheul, Fribourg, Estavayer, Brugelette and Vaugirard (Paris). While occupied in teaching and directing music, he gave himself up more entirely to composition, with a view to enhance both the religious ceremonies and the academic entertainments in those newly founded colleges. His powers of composition were checked by the limited ability of his performers, his orchestra, like his chorus, being entirely recruited from the ranks of the students; nevertheless he provided new music for almost every occasion, producing in the course of time, besides his volumes of canticles, a large number of motets, short oratorios, masses and secular cantatas, mostly for four-part chorus and orchestra. This music became popular, especially in educational institutions. Late in life Lambillotte regretted having published those written improvisations without taking time to revise them. After his death a revision of the greater part of them was made and published (Paris, 1870) by his pupil, Jesuit Father Camille de la Croix, and by Louis Dessane, organist of St. Sulpice, Paris, and afterwards of St. Francis Xavier, New York.Young, John. \\"Louis Lambillotte.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 3 September 2016 He received some piano lessons from C√©sar Franck at Immaculate Conception college, and in turn taught Franck about plainchant. Work on Gregorian chant Corrupt versions of Gregorian chant had been in use for several centuries. As a practical guide towards a radical restoration the Abbot of Solesmes Dom Gu√©ranger, in his Institutions Liturgiques, had laid down the principle that \\"when a large number of manuscripts of various epochs and from different countries agree in the version of a chant, it may be affirmed that those MSS. undoubtedly give us the phrase of St. Gregory.\\" Acting upon this principle, Lambillotte for many years gathered and compared all the documents that were to be found in the Jesuit houses. He next undertook to visit and re-visit almost every country of Europe, exploring libraries, secular as well as monastic, in search of the most ancient MSS. and all treatises bearing on the history or the theory of the chant. In the library of the former Benedictine Abbey of St. Gall in Switzerland, he found himself in presence of what seems to be the most authentic Gregorian manuscript in existence, i.e. a transcription from the original Antiphonarium of St. Gregory, thought to have been brought from Rome to St. Gall by the monk Romanus in the closing years of the eighth century. This volume of 131 pages of old parchment, the ivory binding of which depicts ancient Etruscan sculptures, contains all the Graduals, the Alleluias, and the Tracts of the whole year, in the ancient neumatic notation (a sort of musical stenography), together with the so-called Romanian signs, i.e. the special marks of time and expression added by Romanus. Lambillotte succeeded, not without serious difficulty, in obtaining permission to have a facsimile of this manuscript made by an expert copyist. This he published (Brussels, 1851), adding to it his own key to the neumatic notation, and a brief historical and critical account of the document. The appearance of the Antiphonaire de St. Gr√©goire made a strong impression on the scholarly world, and obtained for its author a Brief of congratulation and encouragement from Pope Pius IX, 1 May 1852, and a \\"very honourable mention\\" from the French Institute, 12 November of the same year. Lambillotte now undertook to embody the results of his investigations in a new and complete edition of the liturgical chant books. He lived to finish this extensive work, but not to see its publication. The Gradual and the Vesperal appeared 1855‚Äì1856 in both Gregorian and modern notations, under the editorship of Father Dufour, who had for years shared the work of Lambillotte. He also published the \\"Esth√©tique\\", a volume of 418 pages, setting forth Lambillotte's views on the theory and the practice of Gregorian music. Later, it became clear that the Antiphanaire was not a copy of Gregory's, and did not date from the eighth century.Rankin, Susan. Writing Sounds in Carolingian Europe: The Invention of Musical Notation, Cambridge University Press, 2018 The Benedictine, Dom Pothier, also worked on restoring Gregorian restoration. Pothier says of the \\"Esth√©tique\\" that it is \\"filled with precious information\\".Pothier, M√©lodies Gr√©goriennes, p. 145, note At the same time he calls attention to some serious errors in translation and even in reading, on the subject of rhythm, which, he holds, have been conclusively refuted by Chanoine Gontier, in his M√©thode de Plain Chant, pp. 96 etc. De Monter also speaks of grave errors and numerous assertions contrary to its own method, that have crept into the treatise. He attributes the introduction of the sharp into the Gregorian scales to the editors of this posthumous work. Lambillottes \\"Gradual\\" and \\"Vesperal\\" were adopted by only a small number of French dioceses. Some argue that his work was ahead of its time. Lambillotte made cuts and alterations which had been the chief criticism of former editions. Twenty-five years were still to elapse before the classical work in Gregorian music, the M√©lodies Gr√©goriennes by Dom Pothier, could make its appearance (Tournay, 1880), and another twenty-five before the teaching of Dom Pothier was to receive official sanction and practical application through the Vatican edition. Lambillotte's contemporaries placed the following inscription on his tomb at Vaugirard: > Qui cecinit Jesum et Mariam, eripuitque tenebris Gregorium, hunc superis > insere, Christe, choris. (Receive, O Christ, into Thy choirs above him who > sang the praises of Jesus and Mary, and rescued the music of Gregory from > the darkness of ages.)

Brunvand, Jan Harold, ed. Garland Publishing, NY, 1996. Children Playing New York Street Games photographed by Martha Cooper Sahadi's Middle Eastern Grocery, photographed by Martha Cooper With a mission to foster New York City ‚Äì and America‚Äôs ‚Äì living cultural heritage through education and public programs, City Lore encompasses a Lower East Side gallery space, performances, lectures, the People's Hall of Fame, a POEMobile that projects poems onto walls and buildings, and education programs throughout the five boroughs. City Lore documents, presents, and advocates for New York City‚Äôs grassroots cultures to ensure their living legacy in stories and histories, places and traditions. The organization also works with a wide range of partners to develop exhibitions, publications, and documentary films, and to advocate for the rights of street performers, ethnic clubs, and other grassroots cultural expressions in New York City. Described as ‚Äúwise renegades‚Äù by Sonnet Takahisa, the group has also been described as a ‚Äúpractical application of a utopian endeavor‚Äù by the writer Marc Kaminsky. In a March 21, 2020 article in The Wall Street Journal, Steve Zeitlin notes, ‚ÄúWe believe in grassroots creativity as a redeeming force in society and a symbol of the irrepressible nature of the human spirit.‚Äù Since 2013, City Lore has been headquartered at 56 East 1st Street on the historic Lower East Side of New York. The building holds offices, a gallery, and a multicultural library for teachers and researchers. In 2019, City Lore became an official Smithsonian Affiliate, one of only 6 affiliates in New York City. City Lore works collaboratively with folk and community artists, embracing different aesthetics for the creation of art. Their collaborators include the Gotham Center for New York City History, the New-York Historical Society, Bank Street College of Education, and smaller groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21. City Lore‚Äôs staff has consisted of professional folklorists ( founder and executive director Steve Zeitlin, Elena Mart√≠nez and Amanda Dargan), historians (Marci Reaven), photographers (Martha Cooper), ethnomusicologists (Roberta Singer and Lois Wilcken), playwrights (Jake Rosenberg, Raquel Almazan) and arts and education specialists (Anika Selhorst).  Founding  November, 1985, folklorist Steve Zeitlin founded City Lore, and the organization received full non-profit status. Prior to founding City Lore, Steve Zeitlin worked for eight years as a folklorist for the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs Festival of American Folklife. In 1979, the New York City Chapter of the New York Folklore Society, led by Dr. Barbara Kirshenblatt Gimblett, Nancy Groce and others, sponsored the first of three conferences on New York City Folklore. Zeitlin, who participated in the conferences, moved to New York in 1981, and, in 1983, became the President of the New York City Chapter of the New York Folklore Society. City Lore‚Äôs first program was a tribute to late anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff in September, 1985. In 1986 moved into offices at 72 E. First Street on the Lower East Side. In 1986, the organization held the first City Lore Festival in Central Park staged in tandem with the first Central Park Summerstage.  Approach to Folklore  City Lore founder Steve Zeitlin City Lore's Founder Dr. Steve Zeitlin has said that City Lore has: an \\"open mission to document and present New York City and America's living cultural heritage. Living cultural heritage used by folklorists to suggest the documentation, interpretation, and presentation of traditions within living memory, as opposed to events that predate living memory, and are, in a sense, purely historical. The original impetus for the discipline of folklore in the 19th century was the notion of collecting myths and legends as \\"survivals\\" from an earlier age, but City Lore is very present oriented. It's not only about capturing the past, it's about using an arts perspective to look at life itself. And to see the present in a slightly more vivid and interested and compelling way by looking at the artistic impulse in everyday life. Folklorists distinguish themselves from historians and from cultural anthropologists, because of the attention they pay to the aesthetic dimensions of history and culture.\\"[2] According to Zeitlin, City Lore is ‚Äútradition inspired but not tradition bound, and we are all about the redemptive power of grassroots creativity.\\" Working across so many arenas of life, the organization has been described as a ‚Äúfull court press‚Äù on what became the tag line for the organization: the art of everyday life. In a formal evaluation by the Artography initiative of Leveraging Investments in Creativity (LINC) funded by the Ford Foundation, Dr. William Westerman writes: \\"It‚Äôs hard to understand what City Lore does in terms of art-making without first understanding how folklorists think of the concept of art. It is as if in Western society what is seen as the arts is equivalent to the visible light in the spectrum, whereas folklorists see the art across the whole spectrum, from ultraviolet to infrared. That full range of creative expression is what concerns the mission of City Lore, and it includes history and memory, language and religion, food and gardens, lace and place.\\" The difference between City Lore and other arts programs is not simply that the arts presented are folk and traditional arts, but that City Lore‚Äôs arts are traditional and modern, and a great deal of the artmaking takes place in the collaborations of different cultural organizations and artists, and in the ties between the traditional and the way that contemporary New Yorkers use and adapt their traditions in their current work, whether they are professionals or schoolchildren. In this way, musical and poetic forms that build on traditional genres ‚Äì including hip-hop, mambo,and spoken word ‚Äì are part of a continuum of artistic practice that recognizes and builds upon deep genealogical connections to the past without being bound by them. It is in this way that City Lore‚Äôs work gets far beyond nostalgia, because the thrust is always forward-looking, not referring to what once was and could never be again, but building creatively with respect for the cultural foundations that exist.\\"[3]  Programs and Series  City Lore works in four cultural domains: urban folklore and history, preservation, arts in education, and grassroots poetry traditions. In addition, City Lore undertakes special projects in keeping with its mission, and serves as a fiscal sponsor for filmmakers and other cultural specialists. = Urban folklore = The City Lore archives at 56 E. First Street on the Lower East Side houses 12,685 images by photographer Martha Cooper and 5,634 by Katrina Thomas. The total with other photographers was 19,320 images. The archive also includes 5,210 photographic negatives, 692 cassette tapes, 143 dat tapes, 163 mini DV tapes and 148 VHS tapes including oral histories, and traditional music and poetry performance tapes.[4] City Lore has over 800 digital video clips highlighting urban folklore subjects. Described as a ‚Äúliving archive,‚Äù the repository comes alive as it serves to inspire new public programs and continued documentation. City Lore is a pioneer in cultural story mapping. In 2008, it launched City of Memory (cityofmemory.org), a story map of New York written about in the volume Letting Go: Sharing Authority in a User Generated World. Designed with Flash technology by Local Projects, the map has been complemented with City Lore‚Äôs new Youtube based storymap designed by ESRI.Tariq Hamad at his sweet shop City Lore's People's Hall of Fame, established in 1993, honors grassroots contributions to New York's cultural life and presents winners with a plate- sized bronze version of the New York City subway token, representing a token of esteem. Recipients have included the Pearls of Wisdom Storytellers, Peter Benfaremo (\\"The Lemon Ice King of Corona\\"), Jim Power (\\"New York's Mosaic Man\\"),[6] and Renee Flowers (original member of the Gowanus Wildcats Girls Drill Team).[7] Honorees covered by The New York Times include the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band (1997), the Bronx Old Timers Stickball League (1997), and Tariq Hamad (1998), founder of the first Indian sweet shop in New York. In 2019, the People‚Äôs Hall of Fame honored Waterfront Heroes, local artists and activists working to preserve the New York Harbor including Naima Rauam for painting the poetry of the Fulton Fish Market; David Sharps, founder of the Waterfront Museum on a barge he personally dredged from the Hudson; Conrad Milster, a steam whistle collector from Brooklyn who started a 50-year New Year's Eve steam whistle blowing tradition in Brooklyn; and Samir Faraq, founder of Staten Island's Museum of Maritime Navigation & Communication and collector of forgotten maritime paraphernalia. Children playing a traditional game on the streets of NYC, photographed by Martha Cooper City Lore‚Äôs first urban folklore initiative was to document New York City street games. The City Play exhibit opened at the Museum of the City of New York in 1988, and the book, City Play was published by Rutgers University Press in 1992. In 2016, City Lore and Public Art Films released Let‚Äôs Get the Rhythm: the Life and Times of Miss Mary Mack, directed by Irene Chagall, and coproduced by Steve Zeitlin and Irene Chagall. The New York Times writes ‚ÄúAs it swings between games and interviews, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get the Rhythm‚Äù has a beat; its incandescent musicality brings this hand-clapping universe to life.‚Äù In 1996, City Lore worked with activist Susie Tanenbaum and the Street Performers Advocacy Project to publish Know Your Rights! A Guide for Subway Performers pamphlet, now online, offering street performers the first look at their constitutional right to perform on subway platforms. The Guide has been in use by performers ever since. = Place Matters = Empire Roller Rink, Birthplace of Roller Disco, archived by Place Matters In 1988, City Lore established the ‚ÄúEndangered Spaces‚Äù project to advocate for local establishments and landmarks that were disappearing from the New York City landscape. In 1996, City Lore joined a new Task Force on Historical and Cultural Landmarks run by Ned Kaufman at the Municipal Art Society (MAS) and sponsored the conference ‚ÄúHistory Happened Here‚Äù at the Museum of the City of New York in 1998. Two years later, Place Matters was formally established by Ned Kaufman, Steve Zeitlin, and Marci Reaven, with Laura Hansen as the director. Based at City Lore, Place Matters aims to broaden the ways that preservation is understood and practiced by offering alternative ways of identifying, interpreting, celebrating, and ultimately protecting places that matter. In 2001, City Lore successfully nominated Bohemian Hall, still a vibrant community center/beer garden started by Czech immigrants in Astoria, Queens, the Casa Amadeo Music Store, the oldest, continuously occupied Latin music store in New York City, and the former Culyer Presbyterian Church, a center of Mohawk life in North Gowanus (Boerum Hill), as census sites to the National Register of Historic Places. Since then, there have been over 800 nominations from the public for City Lore‚Äôs Census of Places that Matter, including parks, historic sites, public art, bars, community gardens, industrial sites, and storefronts. In 2006, the Rutgers University Press published Hidden New York: A Guide to Places that Matter. A year later, Place Matters, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, and the Lower East Side Preservation Project presented the experiences of past and present Lower East Siders in a place-marking project called Your Guide to the Lower East Side. The initiative included twenty-eight signs at six separate sidewalk locations that featured photographs and text in five languages. These ‚Äúplace markers‚Äù weave personal stories and cherished memories directly into the landscape, often right where the stories took place. The signs reveal the rich and diverse layers of human experience that make the neighborhood so distinctive. They transform the participants' stories of struggle and achievement into a legacy for all who pass by. Molly Garfinkel became the director of Place Matters in 2011, and, since then the program has expanded to include advocacy for community anchor sites across the nation, history-based public art projects in Baldwinsville, NY and greater Syracuse area, and policy-oriented campaigns around culturally-competent historic preservation protocols. Her 2019 essay Place Matters: Rooting Conservation in Community was published in the Journal of American Folklore. Place Matters continues to welcome nominations to the Census of Places that Matter. = Arts in Education = Since 1986, City Lore has brought folk and community-based artists into New York City‚Äôs public schools reaching thousands of students each year students each year. Beginning as a partnership with Arts Connection, City Lore‚Äôs education program has grown to be a centerpiece of the organization‚Äôs work. In 2019-2020, the organization partnered with 15 schools to provide arts instruction for approximately 7,800 students in grades K-12 in a variety of art forms in the visual, literary, performing, and new media arts. An early inspiration was an essay by Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, ‚ÄúAn Accessible Aesthetic‚Äù: A major factor in effective education is the integration of what is learned in the school with the experiences children have in their homes and communities. An equal challenge is the integration of the culture of the community into the curriculum. While we want our children to be exposed to a variety of art forms and cultures, we do not want them to be alienated for their birthright, their own heritage. And their own heritage is valuable, not only because it is their own, but also because of the importance of a strong indigenous culture to the coherence of community life. City Lore‚Äôs teaching artists mirror the diversity of New York City‚Äôs public schools, and the organization works with partner schools \`to customize arts residencies so that they relate the schools‚Äô populations and integrate with their curricula. City Lore‚Äôs arts programs have brought Mexican, Ecuadorian, Egyptian, Ivorian, Cuban, Haitian, Peruvian, South African, and Brazilian artists into the schools. Recent initiatives include: * Roots, Routes, & Rhythms, an initiative that engages students in grades 3 through 8 from five Queens partner schools in exploring the roots of music and dance traditions in their boroughs and neighborhoods. * From Homer to Hip Hop: Oral Traditions as a Gateway to Literature and Literacy, a new program which introduces students in grades 3 and 8 in two elementary and two middle schools in Queens to world poetry traditions, including sung poetry. * Urban Explorers, a year-round after school program, including Saturdays and summer, that engages 26 youth in grades 6 to 12 in multi-media storytelling about and advocating for New York City‚Äôs grassroots cultures, while supporting their in-school education. * KickFlip, an interest-driven, connected learning program implemented 2013-2015 designed to engage teen skateboarders and help them develop filmmaking, game design and coding skills to develop projects relating to their sport. * City Lore‚Äôs education programs also have a national outreach. The organization helped organize a national conference in 1993 at the National Endowment for the Arts, and served as the sponsor and incubator for Local Learning: the National Network for Folk Arts in Education. City Lore cosponsored the newsletter CARTS (Cultural Arts Resources for Teachers and Students) Newsletter. City Lore contributes regularly to Local Learning's publication, Journal of Folk Arts in Education. = Grassroots Poetry = Poetry plays a key role in New York‚Äôs ethnic and cultural communities. For many immigrant communities, poetry is the most accessible and profound way for people to express themselves. Every community in New York City has its poets. City Lore is committed to finding ways to give these poets voice, finding the venues and formats for them to convey their artistry to their own communities and to the city at large, often finding new and innovative ways to communicate across languages. City Lore was inspired to create the People‚Äôs Poetry initiative because, while some groups are dedicated to traditional music and many to literary poetry, no other organization was systematically presenting the diverse oral poetry traditions of New York City, the U.S. and beyond. The People‚Äôs Poetry Project grew out of the People‚Äôs Poetry Gathering, held in 1999, 2001, 2003 with Poets House, and in 2006 with Bowery Arts + Science, to bring together folk, ethnic, inner city, and literary poets. During these festivals in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006, Lower Manhattan was transformed into a poetry village for three days. The People‚Äôs Poetry Gathering was one of the highest profile poetry events in the United States and had an average audience of 10,000. In 2003, Poet Laureate, Billy Collins, wrote an insightful essay on the ballad for The New York Times on the festival‚Äôs opening day; and City Lore hosted a special conference and concert honoring Alan Lomax for his contribution to folk music and poetry. Beowulf and Sundiata were among the works featured. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001 attacks, City Lore found and collected anonymous poems and other writings that had been left at memorials, hospitals and gathering places throughout the city. Through these actions, City Lore played a major role in documenting the shrines and memorials that cropped up after 9/11. A selection of these anonymous poems was published in the book, Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam. and appeared in Steve Zeitlin's essay, \\"Oh Did You See the Ashes Come Thickly Falling Down. In 2006, the People‚Äôs Poetry Gathering featured poetry from the world‚Äôs endangered languages. This inspired Bob Holman and Steve Zeitlin to begin work on a tribute to the world‚Äôs endangered languages, a world ‚Äúcento‚Äù (stitched together) poem in which each line came from a different endangered language. In 2013, the Festival of American Folklife in Washington DC hosted Khonsay: Poem of Many Tongues as an exhibit. The poem and subsequent film with Bob Holman would go on to serve as the subject of a tribute and call to action to preserve the worlds endangered languages, which premiered at the Margaret Meade Film Festival, and can be viewed online with extensive background information and a call for language preservation.The City Lore PoeMobile in action In 2010, City Lore and Bowery Arts + Science received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to launch the POEMobile that projects poems onto walls and building in tandem with live readings in New York City Neighborhoods. The POEMobile has traveled to Persian, Greek, Portuguese, Haitian, Dominican, Korean, as well as Yiddish- speaking neighborhoods, and also performed work with youth poets from Urban Word. In 2018, the POEMobile projected poems on to the steam rising up from New York City manholes to express the evanescence of life. = Urban Music and Dance = Children Breakdancing in NYC, photographed by Martha Cooper Prior to its founding in 1986, City Lore‚Äôs predecessor, the New York City Chapter of the New York Folklore Society sponsored \\"Music from the Islands: Puerto Rico, Cuba, and New York\\" at El Museo de Barrio, initiating a longstanding commitment to Latino music traditions. City Lore served as first fiscal sponsor for Puerto Rican Bomba and Plena band, Los Pleneros de la 21, whose director Juan Guti√©rrez won a National Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1996. In 2006, City Lore completed the documentary film From Mambo to Hip Hop, which won an Alma Award for Best Documentary that same year. In 2016, the organization sponsored Mathew Rodriguez Warrens‚Äô doc, We Like It Like That: the Story of Latin Boogaloo. Elena Martinez coproduced both films, and was tapped by WHEDco (Women‚Äôs Housing and Urban Development) to spearhead along with Grammy-nominated bandleader Bobby Sanabria, the Bronx Music Heritage Lab and the new cultural center, The Bronx Music Heritage Center, opening in 2020. In 1995, City Lore, working with folklorist Ray Allen, completed the Grassroots Gospel Initiative, recording acapella gospel quartet music in the borough's and releasing an LP. In 2006, Funds were raised by City Lore to support Peter Siegel's project to restore and issue tapes he made in the 1960s of folk music concerts by Mississippi John Hurt, The Carter Family, Jesse Fuller, Bill Monroe, and others. The recordings became the box set Friends of Old Time Music released by Smithsonian Folkways. [10] The box set was named one of the 10 best box sets of 2006 by The New York Times. = Urban Culture Exhibitions = Beginning with the opening of the exhibit City Play at the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY) in 1988, City Lore has developed public exhibitions about New York City ‚Äì and America‚Äôs ‚Äì folk culture. In 1993, City Lore curated the exhibit Welcome to Your Second Home: New York City‚Äôs Ethnic Social Clubs at MCNY. In 2002, City Lore researched and curated Missing: Streetscape of a City in Mourning about the shrines and memorials that cropped up on New York City Streets after September 11. In 2005, City Lore developed the traveling exhibit and accompanying book, Weavings of War: Fabrics of Memory which featured the work of women textile artists from Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and South Africa featured at The Puffin Gallery. In 2012, City Lore curated the outdoor exhibit, Your Guide to the Lower East Side. The House under the Roller Coaster, made famous by Woody Allen in Annie Hall, demolished in 2000. Photo by Hazel Hankin Nathan's Original Hot Dogs on Coney Island, archived by Place Matters In 1988, City Lore presented oral histories of Coney Island on the boardwalk. In 1991, folklorist Steve Zeitlin suggested to Dick Zigun at Coney Island USA that, rather than trying performance art, they should bring a traditional old time sideshow, which Zeitlin had brought to the Smithsonian‚Äôs Folklife Festival a few years earlier, to Coney. The sideshow has run continuously to this day. In 2017, City Lore presented the exhibit Boardwalk Renaissance: How the Arts Saved Coney Island. In 2014, City Lore opened its own storefront gallery at 56 E. First Street. Exhibits have included Mother Tongues: Endangered Languages Spoken in New York City and Beyond (2015); What We Bring: New Immigrant Gifts (2018); and Bama and Pistol: Pioneers of Subway Graffiti (2019). In 2017, City Lore and Poets House curated the traveling exhibit Poetic Voices of the Muslim World, that travelled to public libraries in 12 cities = Special projects = City Lore produces documentary films and collaborates with filmmakers whose work relates to the organization's mission. Award-winning films include Ric Burns' Coney Island and the five-part series New York: A Documentary Film; City of Dreams, a film about women artists in New York City; From Mambo to Hip Hop,[11] a documentary which traces the history of music in the South Bronx; and DeAf Jam, which highlights the poetry and storytelling of the deaf performed in American Sign Language. In 2017, City Lore teamed up with the Nurse Practitioner Healthcare Foundation is Seattle to create From Heritage to Health: An Art‚ÄìCentered Approach to Cultural Competence (H2H), a multi-year project that highlights the ways in which storytelling and the arts can inform the diverse practices of medical professionals. H2H includes a learner needs assessment, public and professional presentations, eLearning courses, and other forms of educational outreach that enhance cultural competency in healthcare. In 2019, City Lore became host to American Lore Theater and premiered the original play Salt Water People about the Bonacker Baymen of Long Island.  Notable works and awards  In 2002, City Lore successfully nominated three cultural heritage sites from under-recognized communities to the National Register: Casa Amadeo Record Store, Bohemian Hall, and Cuyler Church used by the Mohawk community in Brooklyn. On 2004, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg officially proclaimed November 18 to be People's Hall of Fame Day in the City of New York, saying \\"In a city with 8 million stories to tell, some of the most fascinating tales are lost in the glorious din. Founded in 1986, City Lore is dedicated to amplifying the compelling but often unheard voices that make New York great. Through an engaging series of programs and publications, City Lore reveals the true richness of our cultural heritage. One of the organization‚Äôs signature events is the annual People's Hall of Fame Awards, which eschews the glare of popular celebrity in favor of the more luminescent glow of inspiration and integrity.\\"Proclamation, Office of the Mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, November 18, 2004 On Marcy 29, 2007, Mayor Bloomberg proclaimed another City Lore People's Hall of Fame Day in recognition of the tenth class of honorees.Proclamation, Office of the Mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, March 29, 2007 In 2007 City Lore‚Äôs Founder Steve Zeitlin was awarded the Benjamin Botkin Award by the American Folklore Society for lifetime achievement in public folklore; in 2019, City Lore‚Äôs Director of Arts in Education Amanda Dargan also received the award.

He lives in a mock Tudor Barratt home development in Carmarthen, West Wales. Early history Terwyn was brought up in the Aeron Valley, Ceredigion, and was educated at Felinfach Primary School and then at Aberaeron Comprehensive School. He then went on to study Communication at the University of Wales, Bangor and took a post-graduate course in Journalism.  Radio Ceredigion  Terwyn joined the Radio Ceredigion presenting team in 1995, and presented various dedication, music and travel programmes, including a weekly two-hour country music show - in which he played the best new country music from Nashville and the latest Welsh country music artistes. He does not like hip hop however.  BBC Radio Cymru  In October 1999, whilst still at University, Terwyn joined the BBC Radio Cymru presenting team where he co-presented Gang Bangor, a youth music programme, with Dylan Wyn and Owain Gwilym. In 2000, he acquired a new partner - Stephen Edwards and both continued to present Gang Bangor, before it was replaced by C2. An attempt to launch a Welsh language version of Radio Caroline in the Menai Straits was however abandoned. Terwyn co-presented the late-night slot on C2 every Thursday and Friday between 11pm and 1am with Stephen Edwards and Jeni Lyn, and also on Saturday mornings between 10:30am and 12:30pm. Later, the slot was changed to a later time of 12:30pm to 2:00pm, this time under the Steve a Terwyn branding. In October 2007, Steve and Terwyn's programme came to an end. He spent a month working at a Kibbutz. Terwyn is still a regular voice on BBC Radio Cymru, contributing sometimes to the Caryl Parry Jones and Dafydd Du programme. He also is a stand-in presenter of BBC Radio Cymru's daily early-morning farming news bulletin, and on the Geraint Lloyd programme when Dei Tomos and Geraint Lloyd are away on holiday.  Television work  In his private life, Terwyn has worked for independent TV production company Telesgop since 2001 where he started as a researcher on the farming magazine programme Ffermio. Between 2005 and 2008, he worked as an interactive producer on the programme - responsible for the programme's website and interactive TV application. Between August 2008 and May 2009, Terwyn presented and produced the Bwletin Ffermio programme every Tuesday and Friday at 1:30pm on S4C Digidol. Then he went on to produce a new series for S4C called Bro (area), presented by Sh√¢n Cothi and Iolo Williams, visiting different areas of Wales every week, getting to know the area through its history, its people and its landscape. Terwyn has also coped with a stammer from a very young age, which caused emotional problems for him during his childhood and teenage years. But somehow through his radio work, he has now learned to control the stammer, and although has not totally overcome it, has managed to make it disappear while he broadcasts. In February 2011, Terwyn joined the Ffermio presenting team on S4C, while regular presenter Daloni Metcalfe took maternity leave.

Meigs Field. History Founded in 1970 in Carbondale, Illinois, Air Illinois primarily operated small twin turboprop aircraft such as the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter. By 1978, the company acquired two 44-seat Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprops (tail registrations N748LL and N749LL), which were mostly used to connect Springfield, Illinois with Chicago's Meigs Field. The HS 748 was the largest aircraft to use the lakefront airport on a regular basis. By far the company's most utilized aircraft was the Twin Otter, an eighteen-passenger aircraft noted for short field take-offs and landings (STOL) that was truly the company's workhorse. The company's two letter identifier was UX although the Official Airline Guide (OAG) states that Air Illinois also used the QX code for its stand-alone intrastate airline operation in Illinois between Chicago Meigs Field and the state capital in Springfield.http://www.departedflights.com, April 15, 1975 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Chicago Meigs Field flight schedules In December 1977, Air Illinois purchased the small Handley Page Jetstream fleet of South Central Air Transport (SCAT). SCAT was based in Natchez, Mississippi and was incorporated by Andrew Peabody in 1971 to replace Southern Airways' Martin 4-0-4 flights between Natchez, Jackson and New Orleans. By 1976 SCAT flew between New Orleans and Jackson, Mississippi, New Orleans and Gulfport-Biloxi as well as on a route from New Orleans to Birmingham, Alabama with stops in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Panama City, Florida, Montgomery, Alabama, and Mobile, Alabama. SCAT flew three of the 18 passenger Handley Page HP.137 MK1 Jetstream and two of the Frakes Pratt & Whitney PT-6 modified HP.137's (tail registrations N11DN and N7RJ). The airline tried to become a replacement carrier for Southern, but faced challenges trying to compete with Southern's DC-9s in the New Orleans market. SCAT ended airline service during the summer of 1977. In July 1982 the company leased two British Aircraft Corp. British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven (tail registrations N1542 and N1547) 74-passenger, twin jet aircraft from USAir, which were utilized mainly on scheduled routes from Springfield, Illinois, St. Louis, Missouri, Evansville, Indiana, and Waterloo and Cedar Rapids, Iowa to Chicago O'Hare. In addition, the company entered into agreements with the federal government and an Atlantic City-based casino to operate charter flights. The crash In October 1983, Air Illinois Flight 710 flying between Chicago, Illinois and Carbondale, Illinois via Springfield, Illinois crashed in poor weather near Pinckneyville, Illinois.http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi- bin/airline_detail.cgi?airline=Air+Illinois Three crew members and seven passengers lost their lives. Several weeks after the crash the FAA grounded the company and began official hearings into the crash. The cause was determined to be pilot error after the plane's generators failed two minutes after takeoff yet the crew elected to \\"push on\\" to their destination, crashing in a pasture when the plane lost all electrical power. Following this, the company lost $1 million.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/27/business/air- illinois-sale.html Measures were taken to bring the safety to federal standards.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/17/business/flights-halted-on-air- illinois.html Most company employees were placed on furlough and after an extensive rewrite of the company's operations manual the FAA granted an operating certificate for FAR part 121 flight operations which was composed of jet service utilizing their BAC One-Eleven aircraft. The operating certificate for the most lucrative part of their original operation, which was under FAR part 135 rules, was delayed. This fact, along with substantially lower passenger loads, led airline officials to cease operating and file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 1984. Meanwhile, the commuter airline Air Midwest had dropped its plans to acquire Air Illinois.

Airlift International Fairchild-Hiller FH-227C in 1989 The first flights were between Miami and Puerto Rico using Curtiss C-46 and Douglas DC-4 aircraft. In 1951 it expanded services to serve New York City. Then the route system was expanded to include Chicago and Detroit. In 1960 two Douglas DC-7 were added to the fleet and with those aircraft were used for charter flights to Europe, including charters for the military. The next aircraft type to join the fleet was the Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy dedicated cargo aircraft, but those were replaced in 1963 by the Douglas DC-8. Further aircraft used were the L-1049 Super Constellation, the Canadair CL-44, the Lockheed L-382 Hercules, the Boeing 707, and the Boeing 727-100QC. The freight schedule was augmented by charter flights to South America and the military but by 1981 Airlift International went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy for reorganization. Following the reorganization the DC-8-54, the Fairchild FH-227 and F-27 models were used. Due to financial problems during 1990 and 1991, Airlift International ceased operations in June 1991.

The highway follows Virginia Street, the primary north‚Äìsouth arterial street of the area. US 395 is also designated as State Route 430 (SR 430) from its intersection with SR 659 (McCarran Boulevard) to its northern terminus at US 395\\\\. US 395 Bus. is the former alignment of US 395 through Reno before the construction of a new freeway alignment through the city. The route passes through the heart of Reno and is notable for passing through popular tourist landmarks. Route description As Virginia Street passes north under Interstate 580 (I-580) and US 395 freeway on the south end of Reno, the US 395 Bus. designation begins along the road (concurrent with US 395 Alternate, US 395 Alt.). The roadway turns slightly westward as it travels further north into Reno. In about , the highway again meets the I-580/US 395 freeway. The alternate route ends just north of here, at the intersection with Patriot Boulevard; US 395 Bus., however continues to follow Virginia Street northward. Beyond the terminus of the alternate route, businesses appear more frequently along the arterial. Large retail stores, shopping malls and restaurants begin to line the sides of the business route. After passing another interchange with I-580/US 395 and the junction with Kietzke Lane, the Reno-Sparks Convention Center can be seen along the east side of the road, along with larger casino properties and additional businesses as the route continues north. Passing north of California Avenue, Virginia Street narrows down and reaches Downtown Reno. Seen amongst other businesses along the highway are major office buildings, government institutions and cultural centers. In the center of Reno, US 395 Bus. crosses over the Truckee River on the Virginia Street Bridge. The river crossing dates back to 1860, prior to the Reno's existence as \\"Lake's Crossing\\". On the opposite side of the river crossing, US 395 Bus. enters the downtown core. Each side of the highway is lined with numerous casinos and small businesses. Portions of Virginia Street between First Street and Sixth Street are frequently closed to vehicular traffic (most often in the summertime) to host special events that attract tourists and locals to the downtown area; such events include Hot August Nights, Street Vibrations, parades and other activities. A notable landmark along this stretch of roadway is the Biggest Little City in the World sign. Located at Virginia Street and Commercial Row (just south of Third Street), the current version of this famous arch was erected in 1987. North of downtown, the business route intersects I-80 as it heads away from the casinos. Just past the Interstate, US 395 Bus. encounters the University of Nevada, Reno campus. Academic buildings, residence halls, the student union, Lawlor Events Center and Fleischmann Planetarium are several of the university buildings visible from Virginia Street, which follows the western border of the campus. =State Route 430= State Route 430 begins as Virginia Street crosses North McCarran Boulevard (SR 659). Roadside businesses taper off as the route travels north out of Reno, paralleling the Union Pacific railroad tracks heading towards northern California. Both SR 430 and US 395 Bus. terminate at the route's final interchange with US 395 near Panther Valley north of Reno. SR 430 was previously a much longer route, extending from the northern reaches of Reno all the way through Washoe City along Virginia Street and the Carson‚ÄìReno highway. The entirety of the route formerly served as the mainline alignment of US 395 before being bypassed by freeway segments. Most of SR 430 has gradually been phased out by either being turned over to local control or becoming part of U.S. Route 395 Alt. History View north along Virginia Street in downtown Reno Looking south in 2007, Virginia Street passes under the famous Reno Arch View from the north end of SR 430 looking southbound US 395 Bus. is the original routing of US 395 through the Reno area. The US 395 designation was removed from Virginia Street and added to the new highway segmentally as new stretches of freeway were completed. SR 430 was designated as US 395 Bus. for some time after the freeway was completed. By 2001, any US 395 Bus. shields on Virginia Street had been removed; however, a few business shields remain on older overhead guide signs in the Reno area. In 2001, the gap between the two segments of SR 430 along Virginia Street was much smaller. The southern section had a northern terminus at the intersection with Plumb Lane (SR 653). However, the state maintained part of South Virginia Street was truncated to the I-580 half interchange by 2006. More of SR 430 was given to local control by 2008, when the northern terminus of the southern section was moved to Patriot Boulevard. Also in 2001, the northern segment of SR 430 had a southern terminus at I-80. However, the portion of North Virginia Street along the west edge of the University of Nevada, Reno between I-80 and North McCarran Boulevard (SR 659) was relinquished to the City of Reno by January 2008.

Prominent members of the Context-Driven School of Testingcontext-driven-testing.com consider much of the writing about software testing to be doctrine, mythology, and folklore. Some contend that this belief directly contradicts standards such as the IEEE 829 test documentation standard, and organizations such as the Food and Drug Administration who promote them. The Context-Driven School's retort is that Lessons Learned in Software Testing includes one lesson supporting the use IEEE 829 and another opposing it; that not all software testing occurs in a regulated environment and that practices appropriate for such environments would be ruinously expensive, unnecessary, and inappropriate for other contexts; and that in any case the FDA generally promotes the principle of the least burdensome approach. Some of the major controversies include:  Best practices  Many members of the Context-Driven School of Testing believe that there are no best practices of testing, but rather that testing is a set of skills that allow the tester to select or invent testing practices to suit each unique situation. James Bach wrote \\"...there is no practice that is better than all other possible practices, regardless of the context.\\" However, some testing practitioners do not see an issue with the concept of \\"best practices\\" and do not believe that term implies that a practice is universally applicable. Agile vs. traditional Starting around 1990, a new style of writing about testing began to challenge what had come before. The seminal work in this regard is widely considered to be Testing Computer Software, by Cem Kaner. Instead of assuming that testers have full access to source code and complete specifications, these writers, including Kaner and James Bach, argued that testers must learn to work under conditions of uncertainty and constant change. Meanwhile, an opposing trend toward process \\"maturity\\" also gained ground, in the form of the Capability Maturity Model. The agile testing movement (which includes but is not limited to forms of testing practiced on agile development projects) has popularity mainly in commercial circles, whereas the CMM was embraced by government and military software providers. However, saying that \\"maturity models\\" like CMM gained ground against or opposing Agile testing may not be right. Agile movement is a 'way of working', while CMM is a process improvement idea. But another point of view must be considered: the operational culture of an organization. While it may be true that testers must have an ability to work in a world of uncertainty, it is also true that their flexibility must have direction. In many cases test cultures are self-directed and as a result fruitless, unproductive results can ensue. Furthermore, providing positive evidence of defects may either indicate that you have found the tip of a much larger problem, or that you have exhausted all possibilities. A framework is a test of Testing. It provides a boundary that can measure (validate) the capacity of our work. Both sides have, and will continue to argue the virtues of their work. The proof however is in each and every assessment of delivery quality. It does little good to test systematically if you are too narrowly focused. On the other hand, finding a bunch of errors is not an indicator that Agile methods was the driving force; you may simply have stumbled upon an obviously poor piece of work. Exploratory vs. scripted Exploratory testing means simultaneous test design and test execution with an emphasis on learning. Scripted testing means that learning and test design happen prior to test execution, and quite often the learning has to be done again during test execution. Exploratory testing is very common, but in most writing and training about testing it is barely mentioned and generally misunderstood. Some writers consider it a primary and essential practice. Structured exploratory testing is a compromise when the testers are familiar with the software. A vague test plan, known as a test charter, is written up, describing what functionalities need to be tested but not how, allowing the individual testers to choose the method and steps of testing. There are two main disadvantages associated with a primarily exploratory testing approach. The first is that there is no opportunity to prevent defects, which can happen when the designing of tests in advance serves as a form of structured static testing that often reveals problems in system requirements and design. The second is that, even with test charters, demonstrating test coverage and achieving repeatability of tests using a purely exploratory testing approach is difficult. For this reason, a blended approach of scripted and exploratory testing is often used to reap the benefits while mitigating each approach's disadvantages. Manual vs. automated Some writers believe that test automation is so expensive relative to its value that it should be used sparingly.An example is Mark Fewster, Dorothy Graham: Software Test Automation. Addison Wesley, 1999, Others, such as advocates of agile development, recommend automating 100% of all tests. A challenge with automation is that automated testing requires automated test oracles (an oracle is a mechanism or principle by which a problem in the software can be recognized). Such tools have value in load testing software (by signing on to an application with hundreds or thousands of instances simultaneously), or in checking for intermittent errors in software. The success of automated software testing depends on complete and comprehensive test planning. Software development strategies such as test-driven development are highly compatible with the idea of devoting a large part of an organization's testing resources to automated testing. Many large software organizations perform automated testing. Some have developed their own automated testing environments specifically for internal development, and not for resale. Software design vs. software implementation Ideally, software testers should not be limited only to testing software implementation, but also to testing software design. With this assumption, the role and involvement of testers will change dramatically. In such an environment, the test cycle will change too. To test software design, testers would review requirement and design specifications together with designer and programmer, potentially helping to identify bugs earlier in software development. Who watches the watchmen? One principle in software testing is summed up by the classical Latin question posed by Juvenal: Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes (Who watches the watchmen?), or is alternatively referred informally, as the \\"Heisenbug\\" concept (a common misconception that confuses Heisenberg's uncertainty principle with observer effect). The idea is that any form of observation is also an interaction, that the act of testing can also affect that which is being tested. In practical terms, the test engineer is testing software (and sometimes hardware or firmware) with other software (and hardware and firmware). The process can fail in ways that are not the result of defects in the target but rather result from defects in (or indeed intended features of) the testing tool. There are metrics being developed to measure the effectiveness of testing. One method is by analyzing code coverage (this is highly controversial) - where everyone can agree what areas are not being covered at all and try to improve coverage in these areas. Bugs can also be placed into code on purpose, and the number of bugs that have not been found can be predicted based on the percentage of intentionally placed bugs that were found. The problem is that it assumes that the intentional bugs are the same type of bug as the unintentional ones. Finally, there is the analysis of historical find-rates. By measuring how many bugs are found and comparing them to predicted numbers (based on past experience with similar projects), certain assumptions regarding the effectiveness of testing can be made. While not an absolute measurement of quality, if a project is halfway complete and there have been no defects found, then changes may be needed to the procedures being employed by QA.

The school shares its sporting facilities, including astro-turf pitches, a sports hall, a multi-gym, and a swimming pool, with Lichfield Council for community use. History  With the introduction of Comprehensive secondary education in the period 1970-73 a new school opened on Eastern Avenue as Friary Grange initially taking older pupils. The former girls' grammar school at St.John Street was renamed The Friary and catered for younger pupils. The school was finally united at Eastern Avenue as The Friary in 1987. The St. John Street site became Lichfield college with the city library and records office moving to the site in 1989.

Ancestors of the breed came from the Caucasus, and it is believed that they were of the Kabarda (horse) breed. They were bred pure in Turkey until 1930, when Anadolu pony and Nonius (horse) blood was introduced. The Uzunyayla has a large head with a concave profile; the eyes are small; the neck is of medium length; the withers are well pronounced; the legs are strong with good joints; the pasterns are sloped and very strong; the feet are well shaped and of tough horn. The Uzunyayla is usually bay in colour. Feathering on the legs is coarse, and the tail grows very long. They stand between high. This breed is very good for riding long distances. Uzunyayla horses have a good gallop but cannot do the rahvan walk like some other Turkish breeds. The normal walking speed is not fast as is seen in the Anadolu breed. They are used as a pack horse, a light draft horse and as a general riding horse. There is no association or stud book for the Uzunyayla breed, but breeders hope that one will be formed in the near future. Presently there are only about 2,000 specimens of this breed.

She inspired some of her father's works, at 13 wrote her own biography of him, which he later published in his autobiography, and acted as a literary critic. Her father was heartbroken when she died of spinal meningitis at age twenty-four. Her biography of her father was published in 1988 in its entirety as Papa: An Intimate Biography of Mark Twain, a volume which also included a biography of Susy Clemens and her correspondence with her father.Clemens, Susy (1988) Life Susy Clemens was the inspiration for the character of Joan of Arc in her father's novel Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc. Born in Elmira, New York, Clemens was largely raised in Hartford, Connecticut, but went abroad with her family to England in 1873 and again in 1878‚Äì79. At age thirteen, she wrote a biography of her father that Twain later included in his Chapters from my Autobiography. The biography described her impressions of her father and her happy family life. Her father wrote: \\"I had had compliments before, but none that touched me like this; none that could approach it for value in my eyes.\\" Like her father, she was interested in writing, and wrote her own plays and acted in them during her childhood and adolescence.Ward, Duncan and Burns (2001), p. 133 Twain later described his favorite daughter as intelligent, thoughtful, sensitive and vivacious and said he had regarded her as a prodigy. \\"She was a magazine of feelings and they were of all kinds and of all shades of force; she was so volatile, as a little child, that sometimes the whole battery came into play in the short compass of a day,\\" he wrote after her death. \\"She was full of life, full of activity, full of fire, her waking hours were a crowding and hurrying procession of enthusiasms ... Joy, sorrow, anger, remorse, storm, sunshine, rain, darkness -- they were all there: They came in a moment and they were gone as quickly. In all things she was intense: in her this characteristic was not a mere glow, dispensing warmth, but a consuming fire.\\" He based the character of Joan of Arc in his book Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc on his eldest daughter as he remembered her at age seventeen.Ward, Duncan and Burns (2001), p. 159 In the fall of 1890, Clemens attended Bryn Mawr College, where she was given the starring role of Phyllis in the play Iolanthe, began calling herself by her real first name \\"Olivia\\" and developed a close friendship with fellow student Louise BrownellLystra (2004), p. 15 that some biographers have speculated may have been romantic in nature. Clemens left the college after one semester, possibly because of her family's financial difficulties, because she found the studies too difficult, or because of her relationship with Brownell. As she grew older, she became frustrated with her father's fame, which sometimes left her in the shadows. She was annoyed by her father's reputation as a \\"mere humorist\\" and felt he should represent himself as a serious writer instead of just as a funny man.Ward Duncan and Burns (2001), p. 161 She was embarrassed when Twain performed the ghost story The Golden Arm for an audience at Bryn Mawr. She had begged him not to tell the story, thinking it too unsophisticated for her worldly classmates, and ran out of the hall crying when her father told the story anyway. She later accompanied her family abroad and attended schools in Geneva and Berlin, where she took language and voice lessons, though she was disappointed when her voice teacher, Mathilde Marchesi, told her she had a lovely soprano voice but didn't have the strength or stamina for grand opera. Marchesi observed that Clemens was anemic, sleep-deprived, and anorexic. She had Clemens stop singing lessons for the time being and encouraged her to restore her health first. She recommended hydrotherapy and proper diet and exercise, while Twain thought Susy might also be helped by hypnotism. However, she was never able to acquire enough lung capacity to project her voice from the stage.Robert Rushmore, The Singing Voice. Dodd, Mead, 1971, p. 198-199. In Europe she was at loose ends, bored by her family's evenings at home and annoyed by her father's frequent temperamental outbursts.Ward Duncan and Burns (2001), p. 151 She wrote to her friend Brownell that she sometimes had trouble finding a reason for existence. She was also frustrated by society's refusal to see her as anything other than the daughter of Mark Twain.Lystra (2004), p. 18 In Florence, the then nineteen-year-old Clemens became infatuated with a married Italian count. Her physical and mental health suffered, and she again sought cures ranging from hydrotherapy to \\"mind cures\\". She felt she was helped by Mental Science, a less structured version of Christian Science, and to some extent by modern Spiritualism.Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain: A Biography. Harper & Bros., 1912. Death Clemens chose not to accompany the family to Europe on Twain's lecture tour of 1895‚Äì1896, citing seasickness and a desire to recover her health and become an opera singer. She stayed in Elmira, at the home of her aunt Susan Crane. In August 1896, while visiting her former home in Hartford, Clemens developed a fever that turned into spinal meningitis. Susy was moved to her family home, and stayed in her parents' mahogany bed, which had detachable angels on each post, a bed that she and her sisters had fond memories of playing with as children. Katy Leary, the family's Irish maid, took care of her, sleeping on a sofa in the room. Susy developed delirium, at one point clutching an article of her mother's clothing and crying because she thought her mother had died, and at another looking out the windows at the traffic and singing, \\"Up go the trolley cars for Mark Twain's daughter. Down go the trolley cars for Mark Twain's daughter.\\"Ward, Duncan, and Burns (2001), p. 176 She spent several days writing a 47-page prose poem partially addressed to the opera singer Maria Malibran, whom she had taken as a kind of role model. Eventually she lost her sight and lapsed into a coma. On August 18, 1896, she died at age twenty-four; her family was devastated.Ward, Duncan, and Burns (2001), pp. 161, 176‚Äì177 Clemens was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira. The poem on her headstone was adapted from a poem called Annette by poet Robert Richardson: \\"Warm summer sun shine kindly here, Warm southern wind blow softly here, Green sod above, lie light, lie light ‚Äì Good night, dear heart, Good night, good night.\\" Popular culture A children's book, The Extraordinary Mark Twain (According to Susy), features excerpts of Susy's biography of her father with smaller journal-style pages inserted between the main pages.Kerley (2010) \\"Mark Twain: Words & Music\\" is a double-CD that tells the life story of Samuel Clemens in spoken word and song and features segments about his family.

DNA polymerase eta is a eukaryotic DNA polymerase involved in the DNA repair by translesion synthesis. The gene encoding DNA polymerase eta is POLH, also known as XPV, because loss of this gene results in the disease xeroderma pigmentosum. Polymerase eta is particularly important for allowing accurate translesion synthesis of DNA damage resulting from ultraviolet radiation or UV.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the Y family of specialized DNA polymerases. It copies undamaged DNA with a lower fidelity than other DNA- directed polymerases. However, it accurately replicates UV-damaged DNA; when thymine dimers are present, this polymerase inserts the complementary nucleotides in the newly synthesized DNA, thereby bypassing the lesion and suppressing the mutagenic effect of UV-induced DNA damage. This polymerase is thought to be involved in hypermutation during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. =Bypass of 8-oxoguanine= During DNA replication of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome, the oxidative DNA damage 8-oxoguanine triggers a switch to translesion synthesis by DNA polymerase eta. This polymerase replicates 8-oxoguanine with an accuracy (insertion of a cytosine opposite the 8-oxoguanine) of approximately 94%. Replication of 8-oxoguanine in the absence of DNA polymerase eta is less than 40%.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene result in XPV, a variant type of xeroderma pigmentosum, characterized by sun sensitivity, elevated incidence of skin cancer, and at the cellular level, by delayed replication and hypermutability after UV-irradiation  Interactions  POLH has been shown to interact with PCNA.

Out of uniform (which he generally was) he was always immaculate in silk hat, patent leather boots, and carrying a carefully rolled umbrella.\\" Called 'the man with iron hands', Froest was incredibly strong, and could tear a pack of cards in half and snap a sixpence 'like a biscuit'.Sunday News, January 12, 1930 Police career Frank Froest joined the Metropolitan Police as a police constable in 1879 and worked his way up to Inspector 2nd Class at Scotland Yard by 1894, Chief Inspector in 1903 and Superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Metropolitan Police from 1906 to his retirement in 1912. Famous cases As one of the country's top detectives, he had important responsibilities, including the return of the disgraced financier Jabez Balfour from Argentina in 1895, in what was essentially a kidnapping. The Times obituary described him as having 'all the appearance of a prosperous and ingenuous country gentleman, but he was a man of shrewdness and resource ... highly esteemed for his professional ability'.The Times, 8 January 1930, page 14. On 18 February 1896 Detective Inspector Froest boarded the S.S. Harlech Castle at Madeira, and arrested 26 officers and 399 other ranks who were prisoners after having taken part in the Jameson Raid. It was the largest mass arrest in the history of British law enforcement. In 1898 Froest was involved in bringing international jewel-thief William Johnson, known as 'Harry the Valet', to justice. Johnson stole jewellery then valued at ¬£30,000 from Mary Caroline (nee Michell), Dowager Duchess of Sutherland while she was travelling by train from Paris to London with her husband, Sir Albert Rollit MP, and her brother, his wife and the Duchess's footman and maid.Hamilton (2011) pp.181-183 Froest investigated the case together with Inspectors Walter Dinnie and Walter Dew. They tracked Johnson, who by now was spending large amounts of money, to lodgings in London's South Kensington.Hamilton (2011) pp.208-210 Despite receiving a seven-year prison sentence, Johnson refused to disclose the whereabouts of the Duchess's jewels, and only ¬£4,000 worth were ever recovered.Connell, Nicholas Walter Dew: the Man Who Caught Crippen Sutton Publishing.

It was on his initiative that wireless was used to organise the arrest of Dr Crippen, the first time it was used in this way. Later years On his retirement, he was awarded an MVO and moved to Weston-Super-Mare and became a magistrate and member of Somerset County Council. He was the author of a number of police procedural crime stories,Hamilton (2011) p.265 including The Grell Mystery (1913), The Crime Club (1915), and The Rogues' Syndicate (1916). He died in Weston-super-Mare, aged 73. His last resting place can be found at St Nicholas Church, Uphill Weston-super-Mare as discovered by Carlito Corway.

CPC is headquartered in College Park, Maryland. Its roots trace back to the late 18th century, with the United States Army Signal Corp taking over responsibility of the climate program in the late 19th century. Once it became part of the United States Weather Bureau, it was known as the Weather Bureau Climate and Crop Services. From 1957 through 1966, the United States Weather Bureau's Office of Climatology, located in Washington, D.C. and then Suitland, Maryland, published the Mariners Weather Log publication. Late in the 20th century, it was known as the Climate Analysis Center for a time, before evolving into CPC in 1995. CPC issues climate forecasts valid for weeks and months in advance. History The roots of modern climate prediction can be traced to the late 18th century. One of the nation's first applied climatologists was Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. A century later, the federal government assigned to the Army Signal Corps the mission to define the climate of the regions of the country being opened for farming. In 1890, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) created the Weather Bureau climate and crops services which began publishing the Weather and Crops Weekly Bulletin, which the CPC in conjunction with the USDA still publishes today. The records of the Climate Division span from 1883 to 1961. For a time during the 1960s, the Weather Bureau's Office of Climatology was located in Suitland, Maryland. In 1970, various federal weather and climate functions were consolidated into the National Weather Service (NWS) and placed in a new agency called the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In the 1980s the National Weather Service established the Climate Prediction Center, known at the time as the Climate Analysis Center (CAC). The CPC is best known for its United States climate forecasts based on El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a conditions in the tropical Pacific. Products This visualization showcases the five weather satellites that create NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) products. The five geosynchronous satellites are: GOES-13, GOES-15, Meteosat-7, Meteosat-9 and MTSAT-2. precipitation outlook The CPC's products are operational predictions of climate variability, real-time monitoring of global climate, and attribution of the origins of major climate anomalies. The products cover time scales from a week to seasons, and cover the land, the ocean, and the atmosphere, extending into the stratosphere. These climate services are available for users in government, the public and private industry, both in this country and abroad. Applications include the mitigation of weather-related natural disasters and uses for social and economic good in agriculture, energy, transportation, water resources, and health.

He previously played for the Cincinnati Reds from 2008 through 2015, and the Kansas City Royals in 2015. He was traded by the Reds to the Royals during the 2015 season, and helped the Royals win the World Series. Cueto made his MLB debut in 2008. By 2011 he emerged as the ace of the Reds pitching staff and one of the top pitchers in the National League. He won 19 games and posted a 2.78 ERA in 2012, finishing fourth in the voting for the National League Cy Young Award and helping lead the Reds to the NL Central title. In 2014, he won 20 games with a 2.25 ERA and tied for the NL lead in strikeouts with 242, finishing as the runner-up for the Cy Young. In 2016, he won 18 games with the San Francisco Giants while posting a 2.79 ERA, helping lead them to the postseason, where they lost in the NLDS, and achieving another top-10 finish in the Cy Young voting. He was an MLB All-Star in 2014 and 2016, and was chosen as the starting pitcher for the 2016 MLB All-Star Game. From 2011 to 2017, Cueto accumulated the second-lowest ERA of all pitchers with at least 750 innings pitched (behind Clayton Kershaw), managing a 2.94 ERA alongside a 90‚Äì51 (.638) record in innings. Minor league career Cueto signed in 2004 as an undrafted amateur free agent for a $35,000 signing bonus. He was in the Minor Leagues for three seasons, and excelled at many levels, but really turned heads during the 2007 season. Cueto started his career for the Gulf Coast Reds of the Rookie Gulf Coast League, posting a 5.02 earned run average (ERA), before being promoted to the High-A Sarasota Reds of the Florida State League, where he finished his 2005 season. Johnny has had progressively better seasons since. In 2006, Cueto was assigned to the Low A Dayton Dragons, posting a 2.61 ERA, and a 0.88 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio. While with Dayton, on May 13, 2006, he threw a rain-shortened no-hitter against Wisconsin. He was later promoted back to Sarasota, where he finished his season for the second consecutive year. In 2007, Cueto was placed, once again, in Sarasota. He pitched 14 games in Sarasota, before going on a hot streak, and advancing through three levels in one season. He played for the AA Chattanooga Lookouts, and AAA Louisville Bats throughout the rest of his 2007 campaign. He was named the Reds' Minor League Pitcher of the Year for the second consecutive season. Major league career=Cincinnati Reds (2008‚Äì2015)=2008: Rookie season Cueto made his MLB debut on April 3, 2008, for the Reds at home against the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he carried a perfect game through five innings before surrendering a home run to Justin Upton in the top of the sixth inning. The home runner was the only baserunner he allowed, striking out 10 in 7 innings. Cueto was credited with the win in his debut, as the Reds hung on to win 3‚Äì2. Cueto was the first Red since 1900 to throw ten strikeouts in his MLB debut. He was also the first MLB pitcher to have 10 strikeouts and 0 walks in his debut. He was the third in MLB history to have 10 strikeouts and give up only 1 hit. For the game, Cueto's ERA was 1.29 on 92 pitches. Despite his impressive debut, Cueto was inconsistent for the most part on the season. In his first two starts of the season, Cueto was 1-0 with a 2.02 ERA in innings with 18 strikeouts, while he went 1-5 in innings with a 6.65 ERA across his next eight. Cueto struck out several batters in his starts, but found himself unable to pitch himself deep into games rather frequently due to high pitch counts and giving up many home runs. At the end of the 2008 campaign, he finished with a 9‚Äì14 record with an ERA of 4.81 in 31 starts (14 quality starts). While he pitched only 174 innings, Cueto struck 158 batters (the most of all NL rookies), good for a K/9 ratio of 8.17, the eighth best in the National League. 2009: Hot and cold Cincinnati Reds in 2009 Cueto started 2009 as the Reds #4 starter. Cueto gave up four earned runs in six innings in his season debut in a 10-2 loss to the Pirates, despite striking out nine. Over his next three starts, however, Cueto posted a sub 1.00 ERA, allowing just two earned runs in 18 innings. Cueto pitched a career high eight shutout innings on May 3, allowing four hits and a walk while striking out in a 5-0 win over the Pirates. Between April 22 and May 29, Cueto had a nine start span where he pitched at least seven innings and allowed three earned runs or fewer in all but one of those starts. Cueto's ERA continued to be one of the strongest in the National League through the first three months of the season. On June 14, he took the lead for the lowest NL ERA, with a mark of 2.17 in 87 innings. His BB/9 lowered as the 2009 season progressed. Two weeks before the All-Star game, Cueto was 8-4 with a 2.69 ERA, a major improvement from the previous season. On July 6, 2009, Cueto suffered the worst defeat in his young career. Taking the mound against the Phillies, he allowed nine earned runs on five hits, walking three. To top it off, all this happened in the first inning, and Cueto was taken out of the game after only recording two outs. The Phillies scored 10 runs that inning. Cueto struggled following that defeat, turning in a 5.91 ERA over his final 13 starts while only managing a 3-6 record, although the final six starts (3-1 with a 3.63 ERA) were more promising. Cueto finished the season with a record of 11‚Äì11, and an ERA of 4.41 in 30 starts. In innings, Cueto struck out 132 batters and walked 61 batters, which despite a lower BB/9 ratio (3.20 versus 3.52) resulted in a lower K/BB ratio than his rookie season (2.32 versus 2.16) due to a decrease in strikeouts per nine innings (6.93 versus 8.17). 2010: Increasing consistency Cueto started the 2010 season as the Reds' third starter. On May 11, Cueto pitched a one-hit shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He struck out eight, walked none and hit one batter, leading the Reds to a 9‚Äì0 victory. In his 11 starts following his shutout before the All-Star break, Cueto went 6-1 with a 3.01 ERA, which included a streak of six consecutive decisions being wins, a new career high. On August 12, Cueto was suspended seven games for what Major League Baseball described as his \\"violent and aggressive actions\\" in a bench-clearing brawl in the first inning of the Reds' August 10 game against the St. Louis Cardinals. While pinned to the backstop, Cueto began kicking wildly at various Cardinals, injuring Chris Carpenter and Jason LaRue. LaRue suffered a severe concussion in the brawl, and was forced to retire after the season. Cueto only won one more game after the incident. Cueto finished the 2010 season with a 12‚Äì7 record and a 3.64 ERA in 31 starts, pitching innings, striking out 138 batters, but giving up only 56 walks, 19 home runs and 181 hits. In Game 3 of the NLDS, he allowed 2 runs (1 earned) in 5 innings and took the loss as Cole Hamels pitched a shutout. Following the 2010 season, the Reds and Cueto agreed to a four-year, $27 million contract. 2011: Breakout year Cueto began the season on the disabled list due to irritation in his right triceps suffered towards the end of spring training. He returned on May 8, pitching six scoreless innings against the Chicago Cubs. Since he missed a lot of starts from being on the disabled list, Cueto didn't become eligible for the ERA race until his start against the San Francisco Giants on July 31, where he pitched a three-hit, complete game shutout. He then took the Major League Baseball lead with a 1.72 ERA. He lost eligibility, twice, due to lack of innings since, but retook the National League lead in ERA after throwing seven innings of shutout ball against the Colorado Rockies on August 11. As the season progressed, Cueto began incorporating more and more of a turn to his windup. At the start of the season, his windup featured a conventional step, keeping his body pointed at third base before delivering to the plate. However, by late July, Cueto's torso faces second base and he pauses for a brief moment. Many people have compared this turn to Boston Red Sox great Luis Tiant's famous turn. As of August 25, he was tied with Jered Weaver for the best ERA in all of Major League Baseball at 2.03. On August 28, Cueto struck out a career-high 11 batters against the Washington Nationals, receiving a no- decision as he threw seven innings of two-run ball. Cueto's bid for the ERA title and season came to an end after he strained a muscle in his back on September 15, while pitching vs the Cubs. On September 20, the team decided to shut down Cueto for the year without risking further injury. Cueto finished the season with a 9-5 record and a 2.31 ERA in 156 innings across 24 starts ‚Äì six innings short of qualifying for the ERA title. Cueto struck out 104 batters, and gave up just 123 hits, 47 walks and eight home runs. He also pitched 3 complete games, 1 of which was a shutout. 2012: Breaking the 200-inning plateau and Cy Young finalist Cueto started on Opening Day for the Reds and went on to win 19 games against only 9 losses with a 2.78 ERA in 33 starts, giving up 205 hits and 15 home runs across 217 innings and striking out 170 batters, while walking just 49. Cueto established career bests in HR/9, BB/9, and K/BB ratios with 0.62, 2.03, and 3.47 respectively, while his 7.05 K/9 ratio was his best since his rookie year in 2008. It was the first time in his career he pitched 200 plus innings in a single season. Cueto also threw two complete games. In his first one, on May 4 against the Pirates, Cueto allowed just one run on seven hits, striking out four and giving up no walks. Cueto threw another complete game against the Cleveland Indians on June 12, giving up just one run on six hits, with seven strikeouts and no walks. During an eleven start stretch between May 30 and July 28, Cueto threw innings without allowing a home run, a stretch in which he posted an 8-3 record with a 2.27 ERA. His streak came to an end on August 2, when Eddy Rodriguez hit a home run off Cueto in a game versus the Brewers. Cueto threw 23 quality starts, and ranked third in wins and ERA, fourth in complete games, fifth in innings pitched, eighth in hits allowed and ninth in winning percentage in the National League, while breaking his career bests in all of those categories. The Reds clinched the NL Central Division title for the second time in three years, and the second best record in baseball (97-65) behind the Washington Nationals. Cueto started Game 1 of the National League Division Series against San Francisco, but left after only eight pitches because of a strained muscle in his back. After the Giants won Game 3, forcing a fourth game of the NLDS, the Reds replaced Cueto on the playoff roster with Mike Leake, who was their fifth starter during the season. Cueto finished fourth in the voting for the National League Cy Young Award, behind winner R.A. Dickey, Clayton Kershaw and Gio Gonz√°lez. 2013: Injury plagued season Cueto suffered from a variety of injuries in 2013, including a lat strain, a shoulder strain and tightness in his lat, limiting him to only 11 starts on the season. In those 11 starts, Cueto had a record of 5‚Äì2 with a 2.82 ERA and 51 strikeouts over innings, holding opponents to a .209 batting average. He gave up no more than three earned runs in ten of his 11 starts, and no more than one earned run in eight of them. Despite his limited season, Cueto was chosen to start the 2013 NL Wild Card Game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Cueto was met by a raucous, loud Pittsburgh crowd who had not seen a playoff game in 20 years. The Pirates fans chanted Cueto's name loudly the entire game, attempting to rattle him. After already giving up a second-inning home run to Pirates outfielder Marlon Byrd, Cueto, who was having his name mockingly chanted by over 40,000 people, dropped the ball off the mound, much to the delight of the Pittsburgh crowd. On the next pitch he threw, Cueto gave up another home run to Pirates catcher Russell Martin, giving Pittsburgh an early 2‚Äì0 lead. Cueto allowed two more runs, and was pulled after innings, having already given up 4 earned runs on 8 hits. The Reds would show little resistance the rest of the way, and the Pirates won the game 6‚Äì2, advancing to an NLDS series with other division rival the St. Louis Cardinals. Cueto took the loss in the game, which ended the season for both Cueto and the Reds. 2014: First All-Star selection and Cy Young runner up After a disappointing finish to an injury-riddled 2013 season, Cueto not only opened the season in excellent fashion, but produced one of the most dominant performances by a starter in years. In his first nine starts of the season, he pitched at least seven innings, giving up no more than two earned runs and five hits per outing. Making his third consecutive opening day start, Cueto permitted just one run on three hits in seven innings, striking out eight batters. Despite allowing only five earned runs and 13 hits in his first three starts (21 innings) Cueto had accumulated two losses and a no decision due to poor run support from his offense. On April 16, Cueto threw a complete game, three-hit shutout versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, striking out a career-high 12 batters without issuing a single walk. It was the seventh career complete game and third career shutout for Cueto and his first complete game in nearly two years. Cueto threw another complete game versus his Pirates in his next start on April 22, in which he had a shutout going until he gave up a home run to Andrew McCutchen in the ninth with one out. He settled down to just allow the one run and another two hits, both of them singles, striking out four and walking three while throwing 117 pitches and outdueling former Reds teammate Edinson Volquez. It was the first time in his career Cueto had thrown complete games in back-to-back starts. Cueto followed this up by throwing another shutout versus the Padres (his third complete game of the season) on May 15, striking out eight batters and allowing three singles and two walks, lowering his ERA to 1.25. In his first fifteen starts of the season, despite compiling only a 6-5 win-loss record, Cueto had a 1.92 ERA across 108 innings, with 111 strikeouts against only 26 walks, good for a WHIP of 0.83, while limiting opponents to a .169 batting average. In July Cueto was selected to his first All-Star Game. At the time, Cueto was second in the NL in ERA (2.13) and strikeouts (141) and first in innings pitched () and opponents batting average (.181). Cueto was named National League Player of the Week for August 4‚Äì10 after recording a 2‚Äì0 record with a 2.12 ERA, and 15 strikeouts in 17.0 innings pitched. After his first twenty-five starts, Cueto had a 14-6 record with a 2.05 ERA, having already established career highs in strikeouts, complete games and shutouts. On September 28, 2014, Cueto recorded his 20th win of the 2014 season, becoming the first Cincinnati Reds player to achieve 20 or more victories in a season since Danny Jackson achieved the feat in 1988. The final score of the game, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, was 4‚Äì1. Cueto pitched a total of eight innings of one-run ball and was allowed to bat in the 8th inning instead of a pinch hitter, with the game tied 1‚Äì1 and a runner on third base. Cueto hit a go-ahead single and Aroldis Chapman picked up the save for the game in the 9th. Cueto finished the 2014 season with a 20-9 record and a 2.25 ERA in 34 starts (29 quality starts), giving up only 169 hits and 22 home runs across innings pitched, recording 242 strikeouts (tied for the most in the NL with Stephen Strasburg) against just 65 walks, an opponent batting average of .194, an opponent on-base percentage of .261, an opponent slugging percentage of .313, an opponent on-base plus slugging of .584, and an 0.96 WHIP. He also pitched 4 complete games (2 shutouts), never pitched less than 5 innings in any outing, pitched 6 or more innings in 29 of his 34 starts, 7 or more innings in 23 starts, and 8 or more innings in 15 starts. Cueto gave up 2 earned runs or fewer in 27 starts, gave up 7 hits or fewer in all but one of his starts, struck out 8.94 batters per nine innings (the ninth best K/9 ratio in the National League), and gave up fewer hits per nine innings than any other starting pitcher in the majors (6.24 H/9). On November 12, 2014, Cueto finished second in the National League Cy Young Award voting to Clayton Kershaw. He also received the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award for his defensive excellence. 2015: Final season in Cincinnati On April 6, Cueto recorded the 1,000th strikeout of his career in a 5‚Äì2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Cueto finished his fourth consecutive Opening Day start allowing just five baserunners (four hits and one walk) across seven scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, a personal Opening Day high. He pitched at least seven innings in eight of his nine first starts, continuing his trend of pitching deep into games as established during the 2011 season. Cueto struggled with inflammation in his elbow in May, but only missed a pair of starts and continued to assert himself as one of the top pitchers in baseball. At the end of June, Cueto had a 2.98 ERA, a .204 opponent batting average and a 0.94 WHIP while limiting opponents to a .204 batting average. Cueto was a candidate for the Final Vote on the NL All-Star ballot, but lost to Carlos Martinez. On July 7, Cueto had his best outing of the year against the Nationals, throwing a complete game two-hit shutout, striking out 11 batters and walking only one. Despite Cueto's success, the Reds' continued to plummet in the NL Central, and ultimately chose to trade Cueto to the Royals days before the Trade Deadline. In 19 starts with the Reds, Cueto went 7-6 with a 2.62 ERA, striking out 120 batters across innings (good for a K/9 ratio of 8.27), limiting opponents to a .196 batting average, and posting a WHIP of 0.93. =Kansas City Royals (2015)=2015: Ups and downs and World Series championship Cueto pitching in 2015 World Series On July 26, 2015, Cueto was traded to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Brandon Finnegan and minor leaguers John Lamb and Cody Reed. In his home debut with the Royals, Cueto threw a 4-hit complete game shutout against the Detroit Tigers, striking out eight batters without issuing a walk. This gave him his first win in a Royals uniform. After a promising start, Cueto struggled down the stretch, posting a 4-7 record and a 4.76 ERA in 13 starts after joining the Royals. After a mediocre performance in game 2 of the American League Division Series against the Houston Astros, Cueto returned to form in game 5, pitching eight dominant innings, striking out 8 and retiring his final 19 batters. The only hits he allowed came on back-to-back pitches: an infield single by Evan Gattis and a home run by Luis Valbuena. The Royals went on to win 7‚Äì2, eliminating the Astros and securing a spot in the ALCS for the second straight season. In the ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays, Cueto took the loss in game 3 after giving up eight earned runs in two innings as the Royals' series lead shrunk from 2 games to 1. Cueto started in game two of the World Series, delivering by far the best postseason performance in his entire career up to that point. Cueto was dominant from start to finish, pitching a complete game and only gave up two hits and one run (while striking out four) to give the Royals a 7‚Äì1 victory over the New York Mets and a 2‚Äì0 series lead. Only Lucas Duda recorded a hit (with 2), becoming the difference maker between Cueto and a no- hitter. Cueto became the first AL pitcher to throw a complete game in the World Series since Minnesota's Jack Morris in 1991. The Royals went on to win the World Series in 5 games to give Cueto his first championship ring. In 32 starts between the Reds and Royals, Cueto went 11-13 with a 3.44 ERA, striking out 176 batters across 212 innings, allowing just 194 hits and 46 walks, while pitching 2 complete game shutouts. He set career highs in BB/9 (1.95) and K/BB (3.83) ratios alongside a K/9 ratio of 7.47, despite failing to post a sub-3.00 ERA for the first time since 2010. Following the World Series, Cueto became a free agent for the first time in his career. =San Francisco Giants (2016‚Äìpresent)=2016: All-Star starting pitcher and Giants co-ace On December 16, 2015, Cueto signed a six-year, $130 million contract with the San Francisco Giants (an annual amount of $21.7 million) with a club option for 2022 worth $22 million with a $5 million buyout. Cueto's contract includes a $500,000 bonus if he is traded to another team, as well as the option to opt out of the contract after two years with a guaranteed $5 million pay for the buyout. Cueto made his Giants debut on April 5 against the Milwaukee Brewers, earning the win after pitching seven innings, limiting the Brewers to an earned run on six hits while striking out four. In his home debut at AT&T; Park on April 10, despite allowing five earned runs in the first inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cueto allowed just one more earned run in seven innings, striking out eight while walking only two. On April 26 at AT&T; Park, in a 1‚Äì0 complete game shutout over the San Diego Padres, his first with the Giants and the seventh of his career (13th complete game), Cueto won his 100th career game on 119 pitches. He became the twelfth Dominican-born pitcher in Major League history to win one hundred games. Cueto struck out 11 batters, giving up seven hits while issuing one walk. Cueto threw his second complete game of the season, against the Padres at Petco Park on May 18, giving up just one run on four hits, striking out eight batters and walking just two. On May 23, Cueto pitched another 1‚Äì0 complete game shutout, the 15th complete game and eighth shutout of his career, at home against the Padres, giving up just two hits and striking out six without issuing a walk. Cueto was named National League Player of the Week for the second time in his career for May 23‚Äì29, going 2‚Äì0 with a 0.60 ERA (1 ER in 15 innings pitched), giving up eight hits, walking two and striking out 11. Cueto earned his tenth win of the season on June 15 against the Brewers, allowing one run in seven innings while striking out nine, lowering his ERA to 2.10 (1.04 ERA in his last eight starts combined). Cueto became only the fourth Giants pitcher since 1958 to win 10 of his first eleven decisions on a season and the first since Tim Lincecum in 2008 (Gaylord Perry and Juan Marichal both did it in 1966). On July 6, Cueto was selected to his second All-Star game. At the time, Cueto had 12 wins against just one loss, having won nine straight decisions, compiling a 2.57 ERA across innings, and notching 107 strikeouts against just 23 walks and 102 hits, while giving up only six home runs. In his final start before the All- Star break, Cueto threw another complete game, his fourth of the season, at home against the Colorado Rockies. He allowed just one run on five hits, walking only one batter and striking out eight, retiring 17 of the final 18 batters he faced, his Major-League leading 13th win on the season. Manager Terry Collins chose Cueto to start the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game for the National League, making him the first Giants pitcher to start the All-Star game since Matt Cain in 2012. He started with his battery mate, Buster Posey who was the starting catcher for the National League, and received the loss, as the NL lost 4-2. Cueto posted an 0-2 record with a 4.84 ERA in his first six starts following the All-Star break, during which opposing hitters batted .284 against him and hit six home runs, as many as he had given up before the All-Star break. Cueto won his first game since the All-Star break on August 19 against the Mets, pitching seven innings of one run ball to improve his record to 14-3. Across his final seven starts of the season following his first post All-Star win, Cueto went 4-2 with a 2.35 ERA in 46 innings, averaging a strikeout an inning and holding opposing batters to a .228 batting average. In September, he pitched to a 4-0 record and a 1.78 ERA in innings, his lowest ERA in any month since tallying a 1.15 ERA in April 2014 with the Reds. Cueto threw another complete game, his fifth of the year (a new career high), against the St. Louis Cardinals on September 15, giving up two runs on five hits, walking one batter while striking out seven batters, during which he surpassed 200 innings pitched for the fourth time in his career (and in the last five seasons). On September 20, during a start against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cueto exited the game after scoreless innings due to a groin strain (he received the victory, allowing just eight hits and striking out six), causing him to miss his next start. Cueto finished the year on a high note on September 29 against the Colorado Rockies, in his final start of the regular season, pitching seven strong innings in which he gave up just two earned runs on nine hits and struck out 11 batters, as the Giants won the game 7-2. Led by the strength of the pitching tandem of Cueto, Madison Bumgarner and Jeff Samardzija (who combined to go 45-25 with a 3.09 ERA in innings with 616 strikeouts (for a K/9 rate of 8.53) across 98 starts), the Giants clinched a Wild Card berth, and defeated the New York Mets and advanced to the National League Division Series against the Chicago Cubs. In Game 1 of the NLDS, in the midst of a duel with Cubs pitcher Jon Lester, after throwing 7‚Öì scoreless innings, Cueto gave up a home run in the eighth inning to Javier Baez as San Francisco lost 1-0 to the Cubs (Cueto received the loss having pitched a complete game, striking out ten batters over eight innings while allowing just the one run on three hits without walking a batter). The Cubs would go on to win the series 3 games to 1, eliminating the Giants from the postseason. Cueto finished his first regular season with the Giants with an 18‚Äì5 record and a 2.79 ERA in innings across 32 starts, tallying a total of 198 strikeouts against 45 walks while giving up 195 hits and 15 home runs. Cueto ranked among the league and baseball leaders in all major categories. He was third in the NL in wins (18), fifth in ERA (2.79), second in win percentage (.783%), third in innings pitched (), eighth in games started (32), first in complete games (5), second in shutouts (2), fifth in hits allowed (195), eleventh in hit batters (11), fourteenth in batting average against (.238), fourteenth in H/9 allowed (7.99), second in HR/9 allowed (0.61), eighth in WHIP (1.09), eighth in opponent OBP (.284), seventh in opponent SLG (.350), seventh in opponent OPS (.637), sixth in strikeouts (198), twelfth in K/9 ratio (8.11), third in BB/9 allowed (1.84), fifth in K/BB ratio (4.40), third in FIP (2.96), sixth in Adjusted ERA+ (147), first in win probability added (5.0), third in batters faced (881), fourth in quality starts (22), fourth in number of pitches thrown (3299) and second in number of batters picked off (5). Cueto was one of only six pitchers in the National League to pitch at least 200 innings during the 2016 season, and pitched more innings per game than any other qualified pitcher in the National League, averaging approximately 6.865 innings pitched per start. His statistics for complete games, HR/9, BB/9, FIP and K/BB were all career highs. Cueto finished in sixth place in the voting for the National League Cy Young Award, behind Kershaw, Bumgarner, Kyle Hendricks, Jon Lester and Max Scherzer. He received 3 third-place votes, 3 fourth-place votes and 4 fifth-place votes. 2017: Injuries and inconsistency Cueto began his second season in San Francisco as the Giants #2 starter once again right behind fellow co-ace Bumgarner. On April 4, Cueto made his season debut versus the Diamondbacks at Chase Field. Despite giving up four earned runs on two walks and six hits (two home runs) across five innings, he was able to come away with the win in his season debut. In his outing he notched five strikeouts and helped tremendously with the Giants offense, contributing a single, an RBI and reaching base twice in the Giants 8-4 win. After pitching seven innings of two-run ball against the Rockies on April 14, Cueto became the first Giants pitcher to win his first three starts of the season in back to back years since Rick Reuschel did so in 1988 and 1989.. After revealing he had been suffering a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand since the culmination of spring training, Cueto struck out 10 batters and allowed just two earned runs in seven innings in his second start at Great American Ballpark since leaving the Reds, his fourteenth (fifteenth counting the postseason) double digit strikeout game, and he established the record for the most double digit strikeout games by a pitcher at the stadium (eight). Cueto returned to form on May 28 against the Atlanta Braves, allowing one earned run in six strong innings striking out eight batters, while tacking on a RBI sac fly and a sac bunt at the plate. Cueto then went winless in his next five starts, before posting his sixth victory of the season after allowing two runs in five innings against the Pirates on June 30. He was placed on the DL on July 15 following his first start after the All-Star Break with blisters on his right hand, while later suffering a slight forearm injury in his rehab assignment. At the time he was placed on the DL Cueto was 6-7 with a 4.59 ERA in 115‚Öî innings (he had struck out 103), his worst ERA in a single season by that point since he was a rookie in 2008. Cueto finished the season 8-8 with a 4.52 ERA and 1.45 WHIP in innings (25 starts), striking out 136 batters as the Giants slumped to the worst record in baseball, finishing the season an abysmal 34 games under .500 (64-98). 2018: Tommy John surgery In his season debut on March 30 against the Dodgers, Cueto carried a perfect game through six innings before giving up a single to Chris Taylor to lead off the seventh inning. Cueto finished his outing facing the minimum of 21 batters through seven scoreless innings, giving up the one hit while striking out four and walking none as he received a no-decision in a 1‚Äì0 Giants victory. Through his first four starts, Cueto led the major leagues with a 0.35 ERA, giving up just one earned run in 26 innings. On May 7, Cueto was diagnosed with a right elbow sprain. Though he was ruled out for 6-8 weeks, he did not require Tommy John surgery, much to the delight of Giants manager Bruce Bochy. However, on July 30, Cueto went back on the disabled list due to an aggravated right elbow sprain. On August 1, it was announced he would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending his season. He finished the season with 9 starts and an ERA of 3.23 in 53 innings. 2019: Return from surgery Cueto returned from Tommy John rehab, including pitching in the minor leagues in which he was 0-2 with a 3.38 ERA in six starts covering 21.1 innings, on September 10 against the Pirates, pitching five shutout innings and allowing only one hit and one walk. In 2019 with the Giants, he was 1-2 with a 5.06 ERA in four starts covering 16 innings. Background and influences Cueto's road to the Major League was a trying one because many teams were wary of his small stature. \\"Some told me I was too short, others thought I was in fact older than the age that appeared in my papers\\", said the right-handed fireballer. He is listed at , but some believe he is closer to . However, rather than give in to the criticism, Cueto looked to another undersized Dominican pitcher, Pedro Mart√≠nez, for inspiration. \\"Pedro has been my inspiration, the person for whom I decided to stop playing outfield to become a pitcher\\", Cueto said. \\"One of my biggest dreams is to be able to meet Pedro in person, shake his hand and tell him that he has been my hero and my role model.\\" Pitching style Cueto throws a variety of pitches, although his main ones are a four-seam fastball (91‚Äì97 mph), a two-seam fastball (89‚Äì94 mph), and a slider (81‚Äì88 mph), which he supplements with a cutter (87‚Äì92 mph), a changeup (82‚Äì86 mph), and a curveball (78‚Äì83 mph). Cueto only throws his changeup to left-handed hitters, and he rarely uses his curveball. He often likes to use his slider with two strikes. Cueto's distinctive wind-up, which on some pitches begins by spinning back towards second base so that his back faces the batter, has been compared to that of Luis Tiant and Hideo Nomo. Cueto's unorthodox delivery where he would turn towards second base then shimmy before the ball was thrown led Detroit Tigers manager Brad Ausmus to question its legality during and after Cueto's shutout of the Tigers in August 2015. Ausmus argued to umpire Joe West during the game and to reporters after the game that Cueto sometimes stops in his wind-up, thereby making those pitches illegal. Throughout most of his career, Cueto has used his pitches from four different windups: the traditional windup, the 'Tiant', the quick pitch and the 'rocking chair', which have contributed majorly to his big league success. Cueto is able to trick batters using his variety of windups, creating an arsenal that has a depth of almost twenty different types of pitches, which has helped to make him one of the top ten pitchers in baseball since 2010. World Baseball Classic Cueto was a member of the Dominican Republic national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In his only start, an elimination game against Panama, Cueto earned the win after throwing 4‚Öî scoreless innings, striking out five against one walk and three hits, the only member of his team to earn a win in the tournament following their elimination in their next game. He missed the tournament in 2013 due to injury. Cueto was scheduled to represent the Dominican Republic once again in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but was unable to attend the opening rounds due to his father falling ill (the Dominican Republic was eliminated in the second round), thus Cueto missed the tournament again. Personal life Cueto has three children, sons Johnny Jr. and Joande and daughter Yeiliani.

Industry was 39.9% of China's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017. In 2007, industry (including mining, manufacturing, construction, and power) contributed 46.7 percent of GDP in 2010 and occupied 27 percent of the workforce. In 2015, the manufacturing industrial sectors contributed to 40% of China's GDP. The manufacturing sector produced 44.1 percent of GDP in 2004 and accounted for 11.3 percent of total employment in 2006. China is the world's leading manufacturer of chemical fertilizers, cement, and steel. Prior to 1978, most output was produced by state-owned enterprises. As a result of the economic reforms that followed, there was a significant increase in production by enterprises sponsored by local governments, especially townships and villages, and, increasingly, by private entrepreneurs and foreign investors, but by 1990 the state sector accounted for about 70 percent of output. By 2002 the share in gross industrial output by state-owned and state-holding industries had decreased with the state-run enterprises themselves accounting for 46 percent of China's industrial output. In November, 2012 the State Council of the People's Republic of China mandated a \\"social risk assessment\\" for all major industrial projects. This requirement followed mass public protests in some locations for planned projects or expansions. History Industry and construction account for about 48% of China's GDP. China ranks first worldwide in industrial output. Major industries include mining and ore processing; iron and steel; aluminum; coal; machinery; armaments; textiles and apparel; petroleum; cement; chemical; fertilizers; food processing; automobiles and other transportation equipment including rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft; consumer products including footwear, toys, and electronics; telecommunications and information technology. China has become a preferred destination for the relocation of global manufacturing facilities. Its strength as an export platform has contributed to incomes and employment in China. The state-owned sector still accounts for about 40% of GDP. In recent years, authorities have been giving greater attention to the management of state assets‚Äîboth in the financial market as well as among state-owned-enterprises‚Äîand progress has been noteworthy. Since the founding of the People's Republic, industrial development has been given considerable attention. Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and metallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas alone now account for about 20‚Äì30 percent of the total gross value of industrial output.Florida Forestry China Trade Mission Report In these, as in most other areas of industry, however, innovation has generally suffered at the hands of a system that has rewarded increases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication and quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of specialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of more than 10 percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic growth and degree of modernization.Industrial output growth 1978‚Äì2006 Some heavy industries and products deemed to be of national strategic importance remain state-owned, but an increasing proportion of lighter and consumer-oriented manufacturing firms are privately held or are private-state joint ventures. Structure Since the 1950s, the trend away from the agricultural sector toward industrialisation has been dramatic, and is a result of both policy changes and free market mechanisms. During the 1950s and 1960s, heavy industry received most attention and consequently grew twice as rapidly as agriculture. After the reforms of 1978, more attention to the agricultural sector as well as a move away from heavy industry toward light resulted in agricultural output almost doubling with only marginal increases for industry. Before 1978, state-owned and collectively owned enterprises represented 77.6 percent and 22.4 percent respectively of China's exclusively public-ownership economy. The policy of reform and opening-up has given extensive scope to the common development of various economic sectors. Individual and private industrial enterprises and enterprises have mushroomed with investment from outside mainland China. Domestically, modernisation and economic growth has been the focus of the reformist policies introduced by Deng Xiaoping, and in attempting to achieve this, the leadership has implemented the Four Modernizations Program that lays special emphasis on the fields of agriculture, industry In the countryside, the \\"responsibility system\\" has been implemented and basically represents a return to family farming. Under this system, families lease land for a period of up to thirty years, and must agree to supply the state an agreed quota of grain or industrial crops at a fixed low cost in return. The remaining surplus can either be sold to the state or on the free market. As a result, peasants have been increasing their agricultural output in response to these incentives. Together with the responsibility system, there have also been a number of reforms relating to rural businesses‚Äîespecially in the spheres of commerce and manufacturing. The increase in personal income brought about through the responsibility system has led to a burgeoning of small-scale enterprises that remain completely in private hands. Reform of state-owned enterprises has always been the key link of China's economic restructuring. The Chinese government has made various attempts to solve the problem of chronic extensive losses in this sector and by now almost every state-owned enterprise has adopted the company system. After being transformed into joint stock companies, the economic benefit of the state-owned enterprises increased steadily and their overall strength and quality were remarkably enhanced, gaining continuously in their control, influence and lead in the whole national economy. The role of free market forces has also been instrumental in altering China's sectoral make-up. After 1979, the forces of supply and demand meant that consumers could play a greater role in determining which crops would be planted. This had the effect of making more profitable the planting of such crops as fruit, vegetables and tea. As a consequence, however, traditional grain crops have suffered, as farmers prefer to plant the more profitable cash crops. Increases in light industrial production and more profitable crops brought about by the loosening of market controls had not always been enough to satisfy consumer demand, which in turn led to inflation. Rather than increased demand being met with increased supply, the manufacturing sector and economic infrastructure were still too underdeveloped to supply a population of over one billion people with the commodities they wanted or needed. Instead, a 'dual track' pricing system arose which had promoted arbitrage between official and free-market prices for the same commodities. Inflation and the unavailability of consumer goods had made some commodities too expensive for ordinary Chinese workers, as well as resulting in a general decline in living standards. Another factor arising from inflation in China had been corruption among the higher echelons of the CCP. Managers of factories in regulated industries‚Äîusually high-level Party cadres‚Äîhave been selling factory produce on the free market at grossly inflated prices. Inflation and corruption had become so embedded in the system by 1988, that the leadership was forced to take some drastic economic measures. In response to the general economic malaise, Prime Minister Li Peng adopted several austerity measures in the middle of 1988. The primary goal of these measures was to reduce economic growth and included such measures as limiting joint ventures, curtailing capital investment, tightening fiscal and monetary controls, reimposing centralised control on local construction projects and cuts in capital investment. China's eighth Five Year Plan (1991‚Äì1995) reflected the goals of slowing the economy down to a manageable level after the excesses of the late 1980s. The growth rate of GNP was planned to average 6% per annum, and government investment to be drawn away from national construction programs towards agriculture, transportation and communications. However, the national economy also showed similar signs of stagnation. Although eighteen months of austerity measures had lowered inflation to 2.1%, after eighteen months of rising unemployment, stagnation of industrial output and a breakdown of the Chinese financial system because of debt defaults, the government was forced to loosen the economic screws in the mid-1990s. Increased investment into capital construction programs and Township and Village Enterprises (TVEs) was the government's solution to reviving the economy. However, by mid-1991 signs re-emerged that the economy was about to overheat once again. Rises in industrial production within TVEs of 32% for the first half of 1991, refusal to heed calls for curbs on investment capital construction in the provinces as well as the re-emergence of double-digit inflation. The rapid growth of early 1991 indicated that the government was still going to have to struggle further with enforcing its economic policies. The national economy had been characterised by a large share of industry‚Äîstanding at 61.2% of total GDP in 1990‚Äîwith a smaller share of 24.4% devoted to agriculture and a much smaller service sector constituting only 14.4% of GDP. Such a constitution of GDP was a reflection of the Soviet influence of a planned economy since the 1950s. The dominance of the industrial sector in the PRC's GDP constitution has not always been the case however, and it has been largely through governmental intervention that this evolution took place. In 2004, of the industrial added value created by all state-owned industrial enterprises and non-state industrial enterprises with annual turnover exceeding five million yuan, state-owned and state stock- holding enterprises accounted for 42.4 percent, collectively owned enterprises 5.3 percent, the rest taken up by other non-public enterprises, including enterprises with investment from outside mainland China, and individual and private enterprises. The result is a dynamic juxtaposition of diversified economic elements. In 2004, of Chinese enterprises ranking in the world's top 500, 14 enterprises of China's mainland were all state-owned. Of China's own top 500, 74 percent (370) were state-owned and state stock-holding enterprises, with assets of 27, 370 billion yuan and realizing profit of 266.3 billion yuan, representing 96.96 percent and 84.09 percent respectively of the top 500 corresponding values. Small and medium-sized enterprises and non- public enterprises have become China's main job creators. Private enterprises alone provided 50 percent of employment of the entire society. Industrial output China has achieved a rapid increase in the gross value of industrial output (used before China switched to GNP accounting in 1986), which, according to official Chinese statistics, rose by 13.3% annually between 1950 and 1979. The greatest sustained surge in growth occurred during the first decade, with the rate averaging 22% annually during 1949‚Äì60. During 1961‚Äì74, the yearly growth rate fell to about 6%, partly as a result of the disruptions brought on by the collapse of the Great Leap Forward (which accompanied the withdrawal of Soviet technicians in mid-1960) and of work stoppages and transportation disruptions during the Cultural Revolution. Growth averaged 10% from 1970 to 1980 and 10.1% from 1979 to 1985. Major policy reforms of 1984 further accelerated the pace of industrial growth, which reached 20.8% by 1988. After a brief retrenchment period in 1989‚Äì90 as government policies prioritized inflation control over other concerns, expansion of the country's industrial sector resumed apace, exceeding 20% in 1992 and 18% in 1994. Industrial output was officially up 13.4% in 1995, with state enterprises contributing the majority. While approximately 50% of total industrial output still derives from the state-owned factories, a notable feature of China's recent industrial history has been the dynamic growth of the collectively owned rural township and village enterprise as well as private and foreign joint-venture sectors. Also apparent has been the spatial unevenness of recent industrial development, with growth concentrated mainly in Shanghai, the traditional hub of China's industrial activity, and, increasingly, a number of new economic centers along the southern coast. The coastal provinces of Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces together account for close to 33% of the country's total industrial output and most of its merchandise exports. One key factor in this industrial geography has been the government's establishment of several Special Economic Zones in Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan provinces, and its designation of over 14 \\"open coastal cities\\" where foreign investment in export-oriented industries was actively encouraged during the 1980s. China's cotton textile industry is the largest in the world, producing yarn, cloth, woolen piece goods, knitting wool, silk, jute bags, and synthetic fibers. Labor-intensive light industries played a prominent role in the industrial boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, accounting for 49% of total industrial output, but heavy industry and high technology took over in the late 1990s. In addition to garments and textiles, output from light industry includes footwear, toys, food processing, and consumer electronics. Heavy industries include iron and steel, coal, machine building, armaments, petroleum, cement, chemical fertilizers, and autos. High technology industries produce high-speed computers, 600 types of semiconductors, specialized electronic measuring instruments, and telecommunications equipment. Since 1962, industry has been providing agriculture with farm machines, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, means of transportation, power, building materials, and other essential commodities. Handicraft cooperatives also have been busy making hand-operated or animal- drawn implements. Production of a variety of industrial goods has expanded, increasingly in order to supply the country's own expanding industrial base. In addition to fertilizers, the chemicals industry produces calcium carbide, ethylene, and plastics. Since 1963, great emphasis has been placed on the manufacture of transportation equipment, and China now produces varied lines of passenger cars, trucks, buses, and bicycles. In 1995, output included 1,452,697 motor vehicles (more than double the 1991 figure). Output for 2009 was over 13.7 million units. The industry underwent a major overhaul in the late 1990s in order to stimulate efficiency and production. Large numbers of joint ventures with foreign firms helped introduce new technology and management to the industry. Machinery manufacturing China's machinery manufacturing industry can provide complete sets of large advanced equipment, including large gas turbines, large pump storage groups, and nuclear power sets, ultra-high voltage direct-current transmission and transformer equipment, complete sets of large metallurgical, fertilizer and petro-chemical equipment, urban light rail transport equipment, and new papermaking and textile machinery. Machinery and transportation equipment have been the mainstay products of Chinese exports, as China's leading export sector for successive 11 years from 1996 to 2006. In 2006, the export value of machinery and transportation equipment reached 425 billion US dollars, 28.3 percent more than 2005.China Facts and Figures 2007: Machinery Manufacturing and Automotive Industries. Energy industry A power plant in Tianjin Thermal, hydro and nuclear power industries are the fastest growing of all industrial sectors. At the end of 2009, the installed capacity of generators totaled 874 million kW, and the total generated electricity came to 3.2 trillion kwh, ranking second in the world. Power grid construction has entered its fastest ever development; main power grids now cover all the cities and most rural areas, with 501-kv grids beginning to replace 220-kv grids for inter-province and inter-region transmission and exchange operations. An international advanced control automation system with computers as the mainstay has been universally adopted, and has proved practical. Now China's power industry has entered a new era featuring large generating units, large power plants, large power grids, ultra-high voltage and automation. Starting in the 1980s, China has invested hugely into creating a number of large-scale modern coal mines, contributing to the gradual increase of coal output, maintained at more than one billion tons annually since 1989. China now has the ability to design, construct, equip, and administer 10-million-ton opencast coalmines and large and medium-sized mining areas. China's coal washing and dressing technologies and abilities have constantly improved and coal liquefaction and underground gasification are being introduced.\\"China Facts and Figures 2007: Energy Industry (Coal)\\" Petroleum and natural gas are important energy resources. For eight years running from 1997 to 2004, annual crude oil output exceeded 160 million tons, ranking fifth in the world. Oil industry development has accelerated the growth of local economies and related industries, such as machinery manufacturing, iron and steel industries, transport and communications. In 1996, China's natural gas output surpassed 20 billion cu m, a figure that has increased steadily over the following years, reaching 41.49 billion cu m in 2004. In 2004, China's nuclear-power-generated electricity topped 50 billion kwh, setting a record high, By 2020, China will build 36-million-kW nuclear power facilities, in addition to the 8.7-million-kW nuclear power generation capacity already in use and under construction. To relieve the shortage of energy supplies that fetters China's economic growth, China is developing new energy resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and tidal power. Its abundant wind energy resources give China the potential for mass-produced wind power. Between 2001 and 2005, the government invested 1.5 billion yuan in the wind power industry. Some 200,000 small wind generators already play an important power generation role in agricultural and pastoral areas and according to government targets the national installed capacity of wind generators is to increase greatly. It is expected to add 18GW to the installed base of 20 GW by 2010. Given northern China's rich wind energy resources, its wind power industry has attracted domestic and overseas investment and Asia's largest wind power station, with an investment of 10 billion yuan and a capacity of one million kW, will be completed in Inner Mongolia before 2008. Meanwhile, in western China, with a radiation flux of three thousand kwh per day, solar energy has been widely utilized. Asia's largest demonstration base for solar heating and cooling technologies in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, has become the training center of applied solar technologies for developing countries.\\"China Facts and Figures 2007: Energy Industry (Alternative Energy)\\" Automobile Chang'an avenue in Beijing An example of an emerging heavy industry is automobile manufacture, which has soared during the reform period. In 1975 only 139,800 automobiles were produced annually, but by 1985 production had reached 443,377, then jumped to nearly 1.1 million by 1992 and increased fairly evenly each year up until 2001, when it reached 2.3 million. In 2002 production rose to nearly 3.3 million and then jumped again the next year to 4.4 million. Domestic sales have kept pace with production. After respectable annual increases in the mid- and late 1990s, sales soared in 18 the early 2000s, reaching 3 million automobiles sold in 2003. With some governmental controls in place, sales dipped to 2.4 million sold in 2004. Sales automobiles and vans reached 13 million in 2010. So successful has China's automotive industry been that it began exporting car parts in 1999. China began to plan major moves into the automobile and components export business starting in 2005. A new Honda factory in Guangzhou was being built in 2004 solely for the export market and was expected to ship 30,000 passenger vehicles to Europe in 2005. By 2004, 12 major foreign automotive manufacturers had joint-venture plants in China. They produced a wide range of automobiles, minivans, sport utility vehicles, buses, and trucks. In 2003 China exported US$4.7 billion worth of vehicles and components, an increase of 34.4 percent over 2002. By 2004 China had become the world's fourth largest automotive vehicle manufacturer. Steel Concomitant with automotive production and other steel-consuming industries, China has been rapidly increasing its steel production. Iron ore production kept pace with steel production in the early 1990s but was soon outpaced by imported iron ore and other metals in the early 2000s. Steel production, an estimated 140 million tons in 2000, rose to more than 420 million tons by 2007. Before the first five-year plan (1953‚Äì57), China had only one major steel center‚Äî Anshan, in the northeast‚Äîand several minor ones. All these produced 1.93 million tons of pig iron and 1.35 million tons of steel in 1952. By 1995, China was producing 92,970 million tons of crude steel and 101,700 million tons of pig iron. China had one trillion tons of confirmed coal reserves and an estimated five trillion tons of coal reserves and 48.7 billion tons of iron ore in 2000. Anshan continues to be the hub of the industry, but other huge steel complexes have been constructed at Baotou, Benxi (about 50 km east of Anshan), Taiyuan, Wuhan, and Ma'anshan (near Nanjing).

Pompeo Marchesi (; 7 August 1783, in Saltrio, near Milan ‚Äì 6 February 1858, in Milan) was a Lombard sculptor of the neoclassical school.  Biography  He first studied at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan. In 1804 he won a scholarship to study in Rome under Canova, from whom he received much encouragement. The greater part of his life was spent in Milan, where for many years he was professor of sculpture at the Academy. He executed a large number of groups in marble and portrait busts. One of his earliest works was a larger than life statue of St. Ambrose, patron of the city, for the Duomo of Milan. For the Arco della Pace (commemorative arch now in the Parco Sempione), completed in 1838, he made various reliefs including of Terpsichore and Venus Urania, and of the rivers Adige and Tagliamento. He decorated the fa√ßade of the Castello with twelve figures of great Italian captains, and that of the Palazzo Saporiti with reliefs in modern classic style. One of his best-known compositions is the group of the \\"Mater Dolorosa\\", in the church of San Carlo, at which he worked for many years. Works outside of Milan include the larger than life statue of Charles Emmanuel III in Novara; that of Philibert Emanuel of Savoy in Turin; the sitting figure of Goethe for the library in Frankfurt; two statues of the Emperor Francis I of Austria, one made with the assistance of Manfredoni, for Goritz, and another, unassisted, for the Hofburg in Vienna. He also executed the monument to Volta in Como; the monument of the singer Maria Malibran; others to Cesare Beccaria and Bellini and a bust of Professor Zuccala for the Atheneum of Bergamo.

It is also the name of a village located on the western edge of the bay (although the village is sometimes shortened to Runswick on UK road signs). It is north of Whitby, and close to the villages of Ellerby and Hinderwell. It is a popular tourist attraction due to its picturesque cliffside village and Runswick Sands, a white sand beach. It is on the Cleveland Way national trail. Runswick Bay  History  The original fishing village was almost completely destroyed by a landslide in 1682. Remarkably, there were no fatalities, as the village was alerted by two mourners at a wake. The village was rebuilt, slightly further to the south, perched on the side of cliffs. The cliffside village of Runswick Bay The village ran its own lifeboat from 1866, until it was moved to the RNLI station at Staithes in 1978. The boathouse still remains, and has run its own volunteer rescue boat service since 1982. In the late 1880s, Runswick Bay was the site of an art colony. The village is located within the Parish of Hinderwell, which at the 2011 census, had a population of 1,875 people.  Geography  On the north side of the bay is Cauldron Cliff, and the headland on the south side is known as Kettleness, site of alum mining from 1727 until the late 1800s. Around the edge of the bay is a white sand beach called Runswick Sands, and a series of caves. The largest cave on the bay, Hob Hole, was so named as it was believed to be the home of a 'Hob' (or Boggart) in local folklore. The bay is long. A seawall, made of large boulders, was completed in 1970. Like other parts of the Yorkshire Coast, the area suffers from a high degree of coastal erosion which has made it a popular location for fossil hunting. Looking across Runswick Bay toward Kettleness A number of local streams drain into the bay across Runswick Sands; from West to East: Nettle Dale, Dunsley Dale, Calais Beck and Widgeytoft Gill. Runswick Bay village covers an area of 620 hectares and has a peak seasonal population of 2,315, though permanent residence is low with a high degree of houses being holiday lets and second homes. It is split into two parts, the 'lower' red- roofed, cliff-side, former-fishing village, and Runswick Bank Top, a hamlet located adjacent to farmland overlooking the bay, built around the intersection of the roads leading to Ellerby and Hinderwell. The Bank Top village contains a camping and Caravan site, a hotel and modern housing developments. The two parts of the village are joined via a steep lane which is part of the Cleveland Way, with the beach located at the bottom of the lane. The Lower village of Runswick Bay is densely packed with narrow winding streets and steep steps. It is largely inaccessible to traffic. Key buildings include the old lifeboat station, and a thatched cottage which is a Grade II Listed building. There is a sailing club, a hotel and in summer months, tourists are served by a series of car parks and a beachside cafe.

It was discovered on 11 February 1980, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station, Flagstaff, United States. The asteroid was named after Julius Caesar's wife, Calpurnia.  Orbit and classification  Calpurnia orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.9‚Äì3.4 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,024 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. In 1954, a first precovery was taken at the Palomar Observatory in California, extending the body's observation arc by 26 prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.  Physical characterization = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Calpurnia measures 27.6 and 20.854 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.0639 and 0.102, respectively. It has an absolute magnitude of 11.6. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations, however, gave a higher albedo of 0.15 with a subsequently shorter diameter of 18 kilometers. Calpurnia has a featureless surface with up to 60% amorphous magnesium pyroxenes that might explain the high albedo for an carbonaceous outer-belt asteroid. = Lightcurve = As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve has been obtained. The body's spectral type, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Calpurnia, the last wife of Julius Caesar. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 April 1982 ().

' is a Latin phrase that translates literally as \\"Oh the times! Oh the customs!\\", first recorded to have been spoken by Cicero. A more natural, yet still quite literal, translation is \\"Oh what times! Oh what customs!\\";Ottenheimer, I. & M. Latin- English Dictionary 1955 a common idiomatic rendering in English is \\"Shame on this age and on its lost principles!\\", originated by the classicist Charles Duke Yonge. The original Latin phrase is often printed as ', with the addition of exclamation marks, which would not have been used in the Latin written in Cicero's day. The phrase was used by the Roman orator Cicero in four different speeches,In Verrem 2.4.56; in Catilinam 1.2; de Domo sua 137; pro Rege Deiotaro 31. of which the earliest was his speech against Verres in 70 BC. The most famous instance, however, is in the second paragraph of his First Oration against Catiline, a speech made in 63 BC, when Cicero was consul (Roman head of state), denouncing his political enemy Catiline. In this passage, Cicero uses it as an expression of his disgust, to deplore the sorry condition of the Roman Republic, in which a citizen could plot against the state and not be punished in his view adequately for it.Susan O Shapiro (2005) O Tempora! O Mores! Cicero's Catlinarian Orations: A Student Edition with Historical Essays, note on Cat. 1.2. The passage in question reads as follows: Cicero is frustrated that, despite all of the evidence that has been compiled against Catiline, who had been conspiring to overthrow the Roman government and assassinate Cicero himself, and in spite of the fact that the Senate had given its senatus consultum ultimum, Catiline had not yet been executed. Cicero goes on to describe various times throughout Roman history where consuls saw fit to execute conspirators with less evidence, in one instance‚Äîthe case of former consul Lucius Opimius' slaughter of Gaius Gracchus (one of the Gracchi brothers)‚Äîbased only on : \\"mere suspicion of disaffection\\".M. Tullii Ciceronis Orationes in Catilinam: Cic. Catil. 1.2.4 (Latin)  Cultural references  In later classical times Cicero's exclamation had already become famous, being quoted for example in Seneca the Elder's :Seneca the Elder, Suas. 6.3. Martial's poem \\"To Caecilianus\\" (Epigrams ¬ß9.70) also makes reference to the First Catilinarian Oration:Martial, Epigrams: 9.70. > English version from Bohn's Classical Library (1897) In modern times this exclamation is still used to criticize present-day attitudes and trends, but sometimes is used humorously or wryly. Even in the eighteenth century it began being used this way: an aquatint print of 1787 by Samuel Alken after Thomas Rowlandson in the British Royal Collection entitled shows two old men surprised to find three young drunk men who had fallen asleep together at a table.Rowlandson, O Tempora, O Mores!. Edgar Allan Poe used the phrase as the title and subject of his poem, \\"O, Tempora! O, Mores!\\" (‚âà1825), in which he criticized the manners of the men of his time. It is pronounced by a drunken poet in the 1936 movie Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. The expression is used in both the play (1955) and movie (1960) Inherit the Wind, a fictional account of the Scopes Trial, in which it is uttered by the cynical reporter, Hornbeck, referring to the town's backward attitude towards modern science (Darwin's theory of evolution). The musical comedians Flanders and Swann used the term when Flanders proclaimed \\" - Oh Times, Oh Daily Mirror!\\" (1964).Flanders, M and Swann, D At the Drop of Another Hat (after the track All Gall) 1964. It is also one of several Latin phrases found in Asterix and Obelix comics published in the 1960s and 1970s. The phrase is also used in the Doctor Who serial, The Romans (1964). In November 2014, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas used the opening of Cicero's First Catilinarian Oration on the U.S. Senate floor, with only a few words changed, to criticize President Barack Obama's use of executive orders. In his version of the speech, which followed the translation of Charles Duke Yonge,M. Tullius Cicero. The Orations of Marcus Tullius Cicero, literally translated by C. D. Yonge, B. A. London.

These films brought together the fictional storylines and creatures of the Alien and Predator science fiction franchises, serving as sequels to the two Predator films and prequels to the four Alien films, since Ellen Ripley does not appear in them. Although the creatures had previously been crossed-over in other media such as comic books and video games, starring Machiko Noguchi, these films represented the first time that they had appeared together in feature films. Lance Henriksen was the only previous actor from either the Alien or Predator films to appear in one of the crossover films. Henriksen had portrayed the android Bishop in Aliens (1986) and a man claiming to be the android's creator in Alien 3 (1992). He returned to the franchise for Alien vs. Predator to portray billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop Weyland, the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries (also known as Weyland Corporation).  Alien vs. Predator = Humans =Alexa \\"Lex\\" Woods The heroine of Alien vs. Predator, based on Machiko Noguchi Alexa ‚ÄúLex‚Äù Woods (portrayed by Sanaa Lathan) is recruited by Maxwell Stafford to be the guide for a team of explorers and scientists that is sent by Weyland Industries to explore a pyramid located under Bouvet Island. During the expedition, she and her team accidentally start a 'coming of age' rite for the Predators ahead of schedule by removing the Predators' plasma cannons, thus leaving them with only melee weapons to use against the Aliens. However, after most of the humans and Predators are killed, Lex join forces with the sole surviving Predator after Lex kills an Alien that ambushes the two. Lex provides Scar with his plasma cannon while he makes her a makeshift shield and spear out of the remains of the dead Alien in return of her gratitude. After the last surviving member of the team, Sebastian De Rosa is killed, they set a bomb in the hive to destroy the temple. Alexa and Scar attempt to evacuate, but are once again attacked by Aliens. Lex manages to kill one with Scar's plasma cannon which fell off from his shoulder when an Alien pounced on him. Taking the opportunity, both Alexa and the Predator flee the temple before it is destroyed. After they rise to the surface, Scar subsequently marks her a warrior in recognition of her defeat of two of the Aliens. Following the attack of the Alien Queen, during which the Queen was tipped into the Southern Ocean, Scar dies. Alexa is confronted by the rest of the Predator clan as they collect Scars' body. Recognizing her mark given by Scar, the commander of the Predator ship (known as Elder) gives her one of their Combi-Sticks as a trophy before departing. Charles Bishop Weyland Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the Weyland Industries chief executive officer, and his team of archaeologists, scientists, and explorers search an ancient pyramid under the ice of Bouvet Island, believed to be the first pyramid ever built due to its structure, combining elements of all the great ancient civilizations. Terminally ill, Weyland views the discovery of the pyramid as his last chance to make his mark on history. When the Aliens attack, Weyland refuses to abandon the guns they acquired earlier because he feels that \\"Too much has been lost to leave with nothing\\", then, realizing that his illness is slowing them down, chooses to stay behind to try to buy Alexa and Sebastian time to escape. Though Weyland tries to stop the pursuing Predator, Scar refrains from killing him after a scan shows that Weyland is already dying of his illness, making him an unworthy target. When Weyland subsequently uses an improvised flamethrower (made out of his inhaler and a flare) against the Predator after it leaves him lying on the ground, Scar retaliates and kills him. Joe Connors Joe Connors (Joseph Rye) is a mercenary member of the team. Connors falls down a shaft when the pyramid shifts and injures his leg. Connors is taken by the aliens and is later seen cocooned to the wall and already dead from a chestburster. Graeme Miller Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner) is an engineer and a member of the expedition crew. While the Weyland Industries team is searching the whaling camp, he is startled by a penguin. He befriends Alexa and Sebastian on the helicopter ride to the pyramid. During so, it is revealed that he has two sons. He also seems to be somewhat nervous and anxious most of the time. When the pyramid shifts, he is trapped in a small room with Verheiden. He tells him that they have to continue if they are to get home to their boys. However, when they are traveling on through the pyramid, it shifts once more, separating the two. Once Verheiden is taken away, he sees an Alien at the end of the room, and is dragged off to the hive. Once there, he awakens to find an egg opening before him and a facehugger ready to leap. Still attached to the wall, he manages to get a hold of Verheiden's gun and shoots the facehugger repeatedly. He then realizes that there are several other eggs opening in response and is outnumbered by the facehuggers while attempting to shoot them. Miller is later discovered to be dead by Alexa and Scar, his chest having been ripped open. Maxwell Stafford Weyland's right-hand man, Maxwell Stafford (Colin Salmon) was a member of the team sent into the ancient pyramid. He is one of three people to become targets for the predators, after taking one of their ceremonial plasma guns. After the pyramid shifts, he is attacked by Celtic and is trapped under a tightening net. He pleads for Weyland to help him, but it proves futile. He is killed when Celtic subsequently impaled him with his Combi-Stick. Sebastian De Rosa An Italian member of the team of explorers hired by Weyland to explore the pyramid, Sebastian De Rosa (Raul Bova) serves as the team's archaeologist and linguist, translating the writings on the walls of the pyramid to learn the story of the Predators and their hunts. When the pyramid shifts, he gets trapped with Weyland, Stafford and Alexa. After a Predator attack, he and Alexa are the only ones remaining. After being chased by Scar, the pyramid shifts, just in time for them to escape into another room. There, they watch Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien, then witness him mark himself with its blood. After Sebastian translates the hieroglyphs around them to learn that the Predators have come to Earth as part of a ritual to prove themselves, Alexa and Sebastian conclude that they must return Scar's gun to him. When the pyramid shifts once more, they are chased by Aliens to a cliff, where Alexa just misses the other side and Sebastian is forced to lift her up. Just then, the Alien \\"Grid\\" appears right next to him, and drags him off to the hive. Later, she and Scar find Rosa cocooned in the hive. He pleads for her to kill him, having stated that \\"it\\" is already inside of him. She honors his wish, and shoots him in the head. Ad√®le Rousseau The second female member of the exploration team, Ad√®le Rosseau (Agathe de La Boulaye) becomes the first victim of a facehugger and the resulting chestburster, after she is put in charge of studying the sacrificial chamber. After Stafford and his men remove the Predator guns from a sarcophagus in the room below the sacrificial chamber, they unwittingly trigger the pyramid which then shifts and seals Rousseau and the exploration team in the sacrificial chamber. Xenomorph eggs then begin to rise from the slabs, startling everyone and they begin to open when approached, despite being armed with a gun, Rousseau fails to defend herself and the others from the much more agile facehuggers. She awakes to find a dead facehugger next to her and Thomas and one other member of the exploration team with facehuggers still on them. After catching her breath, she takes off her jacket and begins to moan and convulse, spitting up blood as the chestburster rips through her chest. Mark Verheiden One of the mercenaries hired to protect the explorers, Mark Verheiden (Tommy Flanagan), along with Stafford is one of the team members to take one of the Predators' ceremonial guns, thus making him a target of the Predators. When the pyramid shifts, he sees Connors in trouble, but does nothing. Despite him keeping his distance, he gets trapped in a small room with Miller, where it is revealed that he has one child awaiting him at home. With that encouragement given by Miller, he continues to move through the pyramid. However, immediately afterward, the floor moves out from under him, dropping him down a hole and breaking his legs. As he screams for Miller to get him out, the floor closes back up above him. He then spots an Alien down the hallway, and grabs hold of a machine gun that is covered in slime, shooting at the Alien. However, upon turning around, he sees another Alien right next to him, and is then taken away, He is next seen Facehugged and cocooned in the sacrificial chamber, he grabs Miller's hand when the latter reached for his gun and can be heard futilely trying to shout for help, indicating that he was still conscious which is an unusual circumstance since facehuggers will usually render their host unconscious. The character is named after the writer of the Dark Horse comic book in which the original concept originated. Rusten Quinn Rusten Quinn (Carsten Noorgard) is one of the mercenaries and an experienced driller. Quinn is one for the few characters to put up any sort of fight against the Predator, bravely attempting to defend himself from Celtic, however, he is hopelessly outmatched and winds up injured and falls down the tunnel to the pyramid, though he survives this. Quinn is then killed by Scar when the Predators reach the bottom of tunnel. Stone Stone (Petr Jakl) is one of the mercenaries. While patrolling the pyramid Stone runs into a predator's razor sharp noose, which strangles him and silently drags him up. Stone's gun drops to the floor shortly after, alerting the others. Bass Bass (Pavel Bezdek) is one of the mercenaries. After Stone is killed, Bass looks around, discovering multiple Predator statues. Bass realizes one statue is actually a Predator, which hurls a combi-stick into him, killing him instantly. Sven Sven (Adrian Bouchet) is a Swedish mercenary. Sven remains at the camp, which is attacked by the Predators. Sven is killed when one Predator impales him with its combi-stick. =Aliens=Grid Grid (Tom Woodruff Jr.) is an Alien that gets its name from the grid-like scars on its head, which it got from fighting Celtic and being caught in his net and his tail blade was cut off. Grid is one of the more dangerous and cunning Aliens, successfully killing two Predators: Chopper by sneaking up on it, and Celtic by taking advantage of Celtic's overconfidence. Grid is killed by the explosion of Scar's self-destruct device. In the Alien vs. Predator (2010) game, there is a \\"Nethead\\" skin for the alien which has the net-induced scars on its head. =Predators=Scar Scar (Ian Whyte) is one of three Predators that has arrived at the Pyramid to enact a once in a hundred year ritual to become \\"blooded\\" hunters. Scar is the only one of the three to achieve blooded status and shows more competency and skill than the other two predators, who both fail to either mind their surroundings and underestimate the Alien threat. However, Scar is caught off guard by a facehugger when he removes his mask to mark it with the acid blood of his recent kill. He succeeds in killing several Aliens and manages to survive the pyramid, and aids Lex in defeating the Queen, but is mortally wounded and dies from his injuries. His body is taken by his clan and later left unattended in a chamber, where his chest then explodes as a chestburster erupts from it. Celtic Celtic (Whyte) is a large predator who seems to be the leader of the three, after seeing Chopper killed by Grid, he engages the Xenomorph in battle, displaying decent combat skills and eventually succeeds in defeating Grid, however due to his hubris and overconfidence, he fails to land the killing blow on Grid before the latter frees itself from the net. Grid then pins and kills Celtic by using its inner jaw to pierce his head. Chopper Chopper (Whyte) is one of the young Predators. Chopper helped slaughter the camp. After discovering the humans had taken the plasmacasters, they split up. Chopper and Celtic caught up with a group of survivors. While preparing to kill Lex, Grid impales him on its tail and headbites him. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem=Humans=Dallas Howard Dallas Howard (portrayed by Steven Pasquale), an ex con and the film's main protagonist, returns to Gunnison, Colorado, after his time in prison. He is Ricky's older brother and good friends with Sheriff Eddie Morales. When Ricky comes home to find Dallas back from his time in prison he tells him about Dale having attacked him and that his car keys are lost in the sewer. He offers to help Ricky get them back, but only after thoroughly arguing. In the sewers, they manage to find the keys, but not after Ricky sees a newborn Alien chestburster swimming through the sewage. They then hear an Alien hissing at the end of the tunnel, and flee. When the Aliens attack, he and Morales take the teenagers along with Darcy to a radio store where they find a few more refugees; two clerk owners. He sides with Kelly when she offers an alternative escape plan, and leads her, Molly, Ricky, Jesse and Drew, while Morales leads Darcy and several others to the army's promised evacuation zone. After they get through the hospital, Jesse and Drew having been killed and Ricky having been impaled, Dallas finds the Predator Wolf's plasma pistol and uses it as his own weapon. The group travels to the helicopter on the rooftop's building, but are attacked by a number of Aliens. Escape seems almost impossible, until Dallas manages to blow a hole through the wall with the pistol, allowing them to leave safely. When the group finally makes it to the helicopter, Dallas stays behind to buy them time. Using the pistol, he kills several Aliens and is almost overpowered. Just when the helicopter is about to take off, Wolf finds him and attempts to take the pistol back. Wolf then battles the Predalien, allowing Dallas to board the copter. They manage to fly away, but the town's explosion causes turbulence, forcing them to crash. Dallas awakes, dazed, to find a group of camouflaged troops surrounding the group, where Dallas finally gives up the gun in return for medical help for Ricky.

Ricky Howard Dallas Howard's younger brother (portrayed by Johnny Lewis) and Jesse's love interest, Ricky Howard is an enemy of Dale, as Jesse shows interest in him. However, Ricky doesn't seem to hate Dale back. It is revealed that he works as a pizza delivery boy with Drew as his manager. His role in the film begins when Drew assigns him a delivery at Jesse's house. When he gets there, he realizes that Dale is also at the house with his two friends, Nick and Mark. They treat him badly while there, but don't bother him physically until Ricky is at his car, ready to leave. The three attack him, steal his keys, and throw them down the storm drain. He gets home to find Dallas back from jail. Ricky asks Dallas to help get his keys back, and Dallas agrees. When in the sewer, they see the keys in the bottom of a pile of muck and when they attempt to reach them, find an Alien chestburster swimming in the water. Frightened, the two flee the sewers with Ricky's keys. A while later, Ricky meets up with Jesse at the school's pool. However, Dale and his cronies meet them there; Ricky shoves them into the water unaware that an Alien is lurking nearby. Jesse spots the Alien and yells for them to get out, but not before Dale's friends are killed by the Alien. Ricky escapes and travels with his older brother in order to locate a way out of town. They decide to make their way to the hospital, where a helicopter is on the rooftop. However, during an extended melee throughout the hospital, Jesse is killed by Wolf, pinned to the wall with a shuriken. Ricky, enraged, attacks the Predator, before Wolf is jumped on by an Alien, causing them to fall down an elevator shaft. The attack makes Wolf drop his plasma gun. Ricky picks up the gun, but he is impaled by the Predalien through the shoulder. After Dallas opens fire on the Predalien, the creature flees. Injured, Ricky manages to get to the helicopter with Dallas, Kelly and Molly before the bomb is detonated. Kelly O'Brien Kelly O'Brien (portrayed by Reiko Aylesworth), comes home after serving her time in the U.S. Army, to an estranged daughter, Molly, and her awaiting husband, Tim. During the attack her husband Tim is mauled and killed by an Alien. She flees with Molly to the local graveyard and find a man who is then killed by the Predator. She and Molly later arrive at the sporting goods store where Dallas and a few others are hiding. She convinces the others to avoid Gilliam Circle i.e. the center of town, and the airlift because she knows the Army will look to contain the Aliens even above saving lives. Together with Dallas, Ricky and Molly she escapes the town on the helicopter after losing Drew and Jesse. Molly O'Brien Molly was Kelly and Tim O' Brien's daughter (portrayed by Ariel Gade). She becomes traumatized by the Aliens and the fact her father is killed in the attack. Together with Dallas, Ricky, and Kelly, she escaped the town on the helicopter after losing Drew and Jesse. Tim O'Brien Tim O'Brien (portrayed by Sam Trammell) is Molly's father and Kelly's husband. After Kelly's time in the army, it is revealed that he has become Molly's \\"mother role\\" after she denies her mother to read her a bed-time story. He is killed when Molly says that she saw a monster outside her bedroom window. When he looks outside, an Alien attacks him. As he holds it off, he tells Kelly to take Molly and run. He is unable to overpower the Alien, and is killed, but nevertheless, he manages to save enough time to allow Kelly and Molly to escape. Colonel Stevens \\"Colonel Stevens\\" (portrayed by Robert Joy) identified himself as an officer in the Army to the survivors in Gunnison. He told Sheriff Morales to gather the citizens of Gunnison in the center of town for an airlift, but no airlift was planned, instead the town was nuked. After eventually receiving Wolf's plasma pistol, he gave it to Ms. Yutani. Sue Sue is a pregnant woman who was impregnated by the Predalien. Jessica \\"Jesse\\" Salinger Jessica \\"Jesse\\" Salinger (played by Kristen Hager) was Ricky's love interest and Dale's girlfriend (later ex-girlfriend). Jesse arranges to meet Ricky at the school pool after hours. Wishing to seduce him, Jesse strips to her swimsuit that consists of a black bikini top and light blue bikini bottom; she claims to have not known what to wear, initiating a kiss. However, Dale arrives with his posse to harass and harm Ricky in retaliation. The Xenomorph and Predator's fight soon spills into the pool hall, forcing them to flee and pick up allies during the chaos. She is killed when the Predator accidentally pins her upper body to the wall with his shuriken. Dale Collins Dale Collins (portrayed by David Paetkau) is Jesse's ex-boyfriend and an enemy of Ricky. He beats Ricky up and throws his keys into the sewer. He dies when the Predator kills an Alien that falls on top of him, burning his face with its acidic blood. Ms. Yutani Ms. Yutani (portrayed by Fran√ßoise Yip) is the head of the Yutani Corporation. She controlled Colonel Stevens and it was he who gave her Wolf's plasma pistol. It is implied that she will develop the beginning of interstellar space technology through this. Nick and Mark Nick (portrayed by Michael Suchanek) and Mark (Matt Ward) are Dale's two friends, and enemies of Ricky. When Ricky is fighting the trio in the pool, an Alien kills Mark with its inner jaw, and as Dale, Jesse, and Ricky escape through the window, the Alien pulls Nick back through the window and kills him as well (shortly before being killed in turn by a Predator). Sheriff Eddie Morales Edward \\"Eddie\\" Morales (portrayed by John Ortiz) was the town's Sheriff. He greets Dallas when he returns to Gunnison, but also shows a small hatred towards him at some times. He receives a call for help from Dallas during the alien invasion, but does not believe him until an alien breaks into his house and kills his wife. He later joins a group of survivors waiting for a rescue. He dies when the nuclear device is dropped and is killed along with the survivors, the Predator, the Aliens, and the Predalien. =Aliens=Predalien=Predators=WolfBullAtomicSee also * List of Alien characters * List of Predator characters References Category:Alien vs. Predator (franchise) characters ","title":"List of Alien vs. Predator (franchise) characters"},{"id":"15137403","text":"Bryan Keith Kelly (born February 24, 1959) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

The battle started after demoralized troops throughout Iraq began to rebel against Saddam Hussein. From 5 to 19 March 1991, the city of Karbala became a chaotic battlefield between the insurgents and the Iraqi Republican Guard. After the failure of the uprising, citizens were killed in large numbers.Fervour tinged with fear at Karbala, BBC News, 8 September 2006. Parts of the city were nearly leveled. Prelude In the years leading up to the Gulf War, the city of Karbala boasted over 150,000 inhabitants. Tourists from Africa all the way to Pakistan flocked to the city as pilgrims to the Imam Husayn Shrine. In the months of the Gulf War, the city was carefully avoided by the Coalition bombing campaign due to the significance of the city's mosques.Karbala Journal; Who Hit the Mosques? Not Us, Baghdad Says, The New York Times, 13 August 1994. The city suffered little damage throughout the war in general. In the days leading up to the uprising, it was believed by some that agents from Iran moved in amongst the population for the future channeling of Islamic revolution; an unsubstantiated claim which the Ba'athist regime was all too eager to propagate in their attempt to discredit the uprising. Finally, on 1 March, the uprising began in the southern city of Basra. With this, the tides of revolt spread throughout Iraq, from the southern marshes to the Kurdish mountains. Uprising=5 March= Some of the opposition groups had already distributed pamphlets throughout the local population, feeding anti-Saddam sentiment to the people. It was also reported that a number of these opposition groups consisted of former regular Iraqi Army soldiers who had served in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War. Earlier that day, soldiers returning from the front arrived in Karbala. The revolt began at 2:30 PM when youths began riding through the streets with weapons, attacking government buildings and loyalist soldiers. This action provoked the population to come out of their homes with light arms and knives, known as \\"white weapons,\\" to join in the attack. Such weapons became supplemented with heavier weapons captured from Baath Party forces. The Holy Endowments administration building was the first to be sacked, followed by several others. The rebels also stormed the al-Husseini hospital and took over their wards. Many of the holy Shia shrines immediately became the main headquarters for the insurgency, the main two being the Shrines of Husayn ibn Ali and Al- Abbas ibn Ali. Some of the local Baathist officials and top security agents, including the chief of police and the deputy governor, were killed in brutal ways since they did not retreat in time. Many of their bodies were left lying in their streets and often burned. On the loudspeakers from the Shia Shrines, insurgents called for prisoners to be brought to the Shrine of Abbas for execution. By morning, the city was under complete rebel control. =6‚Äì11 March= There was great hope that the Saddam's regime would not be able to quell this rebellion without air power, which was blocked by the coalition forces as a condition of Gulf War ceasefire. However, U.S. forces did not prevent Saddam from using overwhelming force to suppress the uprising. Karbala suffered severe artillery shelling and rebel holdouts were attacked with helicopter gunships, despite the official declaration of Iraqi no-fly zones. Iraqi Republican Guard encountered resistance as soon as they entered the city. As a result of the mostly-Sunni Republican Guard's resentment of the Shiites, it was said that the tanks bore placards saying, \\"No More Shia After Today.\\" The main targets included the main Shia shrines and the al-Husseini hospital. At the hospital, doctors treated the wounded while people continually rushed in to donate blood and medicine, despite the concentrated shelling from the loyalist forces on the city outskirts. The rebels put up a stiff resistance in defending the hospital. Once it fell, the army rounded up doctors, nurses, and took them away for execution. Patients were thrown out of windows and reports surfaced of bulldozers burying bodies on the hospital grounds. Throughout the counterattack, voices could be heard on loudspeakers at the shrines of Abbas and Hussein, directing orders for the insurgency to attack the Republican Guard. In the closing days of the uprising, the shrines were heavily damaged by artillery and rocket fire from helicopters. Many rebels and their civilian sympathizers barricaded themselves into the buildings. Video recordings show the people dancing in euphoria and calling for the aid of America and Iran, which never came. Once the loyalist forces surrounded the shrine, the leader of the assault and a henchman of Saddam, Kamal Hussein Majid, stood on a tank and shouted: \\"Your name is Hussein and so is mine. Let us see who is stronger now.\\" He then gave the order to open fire on the shrine. After blowing down the doors, the Guard rushed in and killed a majority of those inside with automatic weapons fire. Once in control of the city, the army encircled each district looking for young men. At first they shot whomever they saw. After a day or so, they arrested every male over the age of 15. Shia clerics found walking on the streets were rounded up and never seen again. Dead bodies were mined and they were not allowed to be removed from the streets. Helicopter gunships on the outskirts reportedly strafed civilians fleeing the city as well. =19 March= Soldiers took vengeance on both rebels and civilians who had not fled. Moving from district to district, they rounded up young men suspected of being rebels, transported them to stadiums where some were executed. Others were reportedly sent to a large detention facility outside Baghdad. Such marks indicated that the uprising was officially suppressed. Aftermath Reports indicated that no neighborhood was left intact after the uprising. In the vicinity of the shrines of Husayn ibn Ali and Abbas ibn Ali, most of the buildings surrounding the shrines were completely reduced to rubble. The shrines themselves were scarred from bullet marks and tank fire. They were, however, quickly restored by the Shiite donations. In December 2005, workers maintaining water pipes 500 meters from the Imam Hussein Shrine unearthed a mass grave containing dozens of bodies, apparently those of Shiites killed after the uprising.Mass grave unearthed in Iraq city, BBC News, 27 December 2005. Another mass grave was discovered on 10 January 2010 south of Karbala, containing 23 bodies of people from both sexes.Mass grave from 1991 uprising unearthed in Karbala , Aswat al-Iraq, 3 January 2010.

An urban settlement of the pre-Columbian Maya, it is the earliest-known Maya polity in the southern Belizean lowlands, with evidence of occupation dating to the Early Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (ca. 250-500 CE).\\"Introduction\\", Prufer (2005). It is one of five major Maya sites in this region, whose archaeological sites also include Nim Li Punit and Lubaantun. Settlement of Uxbenka has been suggested to have occurred originally by Peten peoples. The site is approximately 40 square kilometers in size, and Uxbenka is referred to as a medium-sized polity ). Uxbenka rose shortly after the expansion of another Mayan site: Tikal. The site is thought to have been first inhabited during the late Preclassic period.  Settlement  The residential housing settlements of Uxbenka were very dispersed around the site. Some LiDAR images suggest that the people of Uxbenka utilized and modified the hilltops for public and residential structures. The residential settlements expand about 3 kilometers from the site's core. Two very large public structures characterize the site core.  Stelae  Thirteen stelae (stone slabs which were used to record the political history of ancient Maya sites) have been identified at Uxbenka. Only two stelae remain standing, the remaining having been moved or fallen over. The surviving stelae have gone through natural weathering processes, leaving most of the epigraphic information on the stela to be unreadable. Of the legible ethnographic data found on the surviving stela, a series of long count dates were found. The discovery of these long count dates indicate that Uxbenka was occupied from the Early Classic to the Late Classic period. Stela 5: Stela 5 is in front of the northeast corner of Structure 1. The carvings on this stela are deteriorated to the point that archaeologists have not been able to identify what the carvings depicted. Stela 6: Stela 6 was found directly in front of Structure 1. This stela is missing its upper half, it appears that its upper half was broken off. Glyphs were found on this stela, which has been dated to the Late Classic period. Of those glyphs, one section reads ‚ÄúHanab Pakal‚Äù, which has been translated to ‚Äúflower shield‚Äù. Stela 11: This stela was found in three pieces, positioned face down in the northwest corner of Structure 1. Similarly, to Stela 6, Stela 11 is also missing its upper half. Stela 11 contains some of the more readable glyphs found in Uxbenka, as archaeologists were able to read the complete long count date: ‚Äú8.18.0.0.‚Äù which dates it to the Early Classic period. Additional legible glyphs found on Stela 11 include a jaguar paw similar to one found on Tikal Stela 39. Iconography present on Stela 11 includes the lower half of an individual with both feet pointed in the same direction and a Double-Headed Serpent Bar. This indicated that this stela is from the Early Classic also, as it is a pose consistent with other Early Classic iconography. Stela 14: Stela 14 is not only the tallest of the stela at Uxbenka but also, ‚Äúthe tallest monument at Uxbenka‚Äù. Most of the inscriptions on Stela 14 were eroded off by natural weathering processes. Faint outlines of a large Late Classic-style witz monster are nevertheless observable. Stela 15: Stela 15 was found broken into two pieces in front of Structure 3. Inscriptions on this stela that remain legible include the initial series introductory glyph (ISIG) and a long count date of 9.17.10.0.0, or November 28, 780 A.D. Stela 18: This stela was found face down east of Structure 7. Although partly eroded, iconography on Stela 18 is interpreted to show an Early Classic ruler. Faint outlines of inscriptions are seen on Stela 18, but they are too eroded to read Stela 19: Stela 19 was found west of the central staircase that lead to the stelae plaza. Inscriptions on this stela are comparatively well preserved, with 35 glyphs legible. A partial long count date and introductory series initial glyph (ISIG) has been identified, translated as 9.17.11 or A.D. 782. Stela 21: Originally only the left half of Stela 21 was found, in front of Structure 1 and close to Stela 11. Survey conducted by the Maya Mountains Archaeological Project recovered the right half of Stela 21 in a looter's pit in front of Stela 15 Similarly to Stela 11 and Stela 18, Stela 21 depicts a similar carving of an Early Classic ruler with a Double-Headed Serpent Bar. This craving helps date it to the Early Classic Period. Stela 22: Stela 22 was found buried under Stela 13. Six severely eroded glyphs are found on one side of this stela A possible date of A.D. 751 was suggested from a legible ‚ÄúHaab‚Äù glyph.  Agriculture  Archaeological research suggests that the soils around Uxbenka are high in nutrients, making the area propitious for agricultural production. Slash-and-burn and milpa agricultural techniques were used by the inhabitants of Uxbenka, along with soil management strategies like terracing. Terracing utilizes hillsides to combat soil erosion and make use of available land resources.

It runs north from Oxford Street to Greenwell Street, just short of the busy A501 Marylebone Road and Euston Road. It lies within the informally designated London area of Fitzrovia. In administrative terms it is in the City of Westminster. It lies within their designated East Marylebone Conservation Area in the former Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone. History Like the better known Portland Place and Great Portland Street which run parallel with it to the west, Great Titchfield Street was developed by the Dukes of Portland, who owned most of the eastern half of Marylebone in the 18th and 19th centuries. It appears half complete on the John Rocque map of 1746. At that time it only ran from Oxford Street to Riding House Street. In 1757 the New Road, now Marylebone Road, was laid out to provide a route around built-up London. This encouraged residential development in the area, with a regular grid of streets centred on Great Titchfield Street and Great Portland Street. Great Titchfield Street appears in its current complete form on the Richard Horwood map of 1793 (Guildhall Archives). Great Titchfield Street was also named Cirencester Place on its northern stretch in Greenwoods' map of 1827 Character By the mid-19th century it was described as being in an area of \\"dirty shops and dingy private dwellings...where children never washed\\" (quote from Pevsner and Cherry, 1991, London 3: North West). However, in February 1900, F.S.Webster, rector of the All Souls Church, Langham Place described how \\"the locality east of Great Titchfield Street is rapidly changing. The old dwelling houses are being pulled down and large blocks containing small residential flats and business premises are being built in their place whose flats...are too expensive for working people\\" (quote from B Hanson, 1993, The Golden City Essays). The garment industry, historically important in the East Marylebone and Soho areas, continues to have a presence in Great Titchfield Street. In recent years many have been displaced by the arrival of media organisations, television production and post-production companies and a number of highly specialised boutiques including E-Man, Side, Wise Buddah and Maverick Media. The radio & television stations of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation have their UK Office & Administration headquarters at 43-51 Great Titchfield Street. Like Charlotte Street, its near neighbour to the east, Great Titchfield Street is also home to a diverse range of specialist restaurants including Scandinavian Kitchen (Norwegian, Swedish and Danish), HT Harris (Italian Delicatessen), Efes (Turkish), Sergios (Italian Cafe), Shikara (North Indian) and the Riding House Cafe. Designation It was designated a Conservation Area in 1982 (City of Westminster, Conservation Audit No.33: East Marylebone).

Cumming converted to Roman Catholicism about the age of 30, joining Stanbrook Abbey, Worcestershire. There she took over management of the printing press for many years. Biography Cumming was born in Battersea on 15 December 1909. Her father, Frederick Mann Cumming, was a civil engineer's assistant and her mother was Emma Georgina Love. She attended school in Clapham, before studying at the Royal Academy of Music. There she also gained teaching qualifications and was appointed a piano sub-professor in 1932, however, she moved on within a year to Wentworth's Collegiate School for Girls Around 1930, Cumming joined Oxford Group, falling in love with one of the members, but was not given permission to marry by the group's leader. In 1940, the Collegiate School was evacuated to Llangollen, where she converted to Roman Catholicism. On 18 December 1941, she took her vows as a Benedictine nun at Stanbrook Abbey, Worcestershire. She took the name Hildelith and would remain attached to the abbey for the remainder of her life. Cumming took on a number of musical roles within the abbey, including assistant organist, director of choir and director of music. While at the abbey, she was bestowed the Benedictine honorific title of \\"Dame\\". Cumming took over management of the Stanbrook Abbey Press in 1952, after the press was recommended for closure. She was taught the art of printing by John Dreyfus and Jan van Krimpen and became renowned for her book designs and printing.

Within the Square Mile, the London Stock Exchange lies at the heart of the United Kingdom's corporations. The United Kingdom company law regulates corporations formed under the Companies Act 2006. Also governed by the Insolvency Act 1986, the UK Corporate Governance Code, European Union Directives and court cases, the company is the primary legal vehicle to organise and run business. Tracing their modern history to the late Industrial Revolution, public companies now employ more people and generate more of wealth in the United Kingdom economy than any other form of organisation. The United Kingdom was the first country to draft modern corporation statutes,See Joint Stock Companies Act 1856. The French Code de Commerce of 1807, as part of the Napoleonic Code allowed for public company formation with limited liability after an express governmental concession, and the New York Act Relative to Incorporations for Manufacturing Purposes of 1811 allowed for free incorporation with limited liability, but only for manufacturing businesses. So, while necessarily drawing on ideas formulated in France and the US, the UK had the first modern company law. where through a simple registration procedure any investors could incorporate, limit liability to their commercial creditors in the event of business insolvency, and where management was delegated to a centralised board of directors.RC Clark, Corporate Law (Aspen 1986) 2, defines the modern public company by these three features (separate legal personality, limited liability, delegated management) and in addition, freely transferable shares. An influential model within Europe, the Commonwealth and as an international standard setter, UK law has always given people broad freedom to design the internal company rules, so long as the mandatory minimum rights of investors under its legislation are complied with. Company law, or corporate law, can be broken down into two main fields, corporate governance and corporate finance. Corporate governance in the UK mediates the rights and duties among shareholders, employees, creditors and directors. Since the board of directors habitually possesses the power to manage the business under a company constitution, a central theme is what mechanisms exist to ensure directors' accountability. UK law is \\"shareholder friendly\\" in that shareholders, to the exclusion of employees, typically exercise sole voting rights in the general meeting. The general meeting holds a series of minimum rights to change the company constitution, issue resolutions and remove members of the board. In turn, directors owe a set of duties to their companies. Directors must carry out their responsibilities with competence, in good faith and undivided loyalty to the enterprise. If the mechanisms of voting do not prove enough, particularly for minority shareholders, directors' duties and other member rights may be vindicated in court. Of central importance in public and listed companies is the securities market, typified by the London Stock Exchange. Through the Takeover Code the UK strongly protects the right of shareholders to be treated equally and freely trade their shares. Corporate finance concerns the two money raising options for limited companies. Equity finance involves the traditional method of issuing shares to build up a company's capital. Shares can contain any rights the company and purchaser wish to contract for, but generally grant the right to participate in dividends after a company earns profits and the right to vote in company affairs. A purchaser of shares is helped to make an informed decision directly by prospectus requirements of full disclosure, and indirectly through restrictions on financial assistance by companies for purchase of their own shares. Debt finance means getting loans, usually for the price of a fixed annual interest repayment. Sophisticated lenders, such as banks typically contract for a security interest over the assets of a company, so that in the event of default on loan repayments they may seize the company's property directly to satisfy debts. Creditors are also, to some extent, protected by courts' power to set aside unfair transactions before a company goes under, or recoup money from negligent directors engaged in wrongful trading. If a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, UK insolvency law requires an administrator to attempt a rescue of the company (if the company itself has the assets to pay for this). If rescue proves impossible, a company's life ends when its assets are liquidated, distributed to creditors and the company is struck off the register. If a company becomes insolvent with no assets it can be wound up by a creditor, for a fee (not that common), or more commonly by the tax creditor (HMRC). History Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom's depiction in 1614 of competing British East India Company and Dutch East India Company ships, both with monopolies to trade. Other chartered corporations, still in existence include the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company (est 1670) and the Bank of England (est 1694). Company law in its modern shape dates from the mid-19th century, however an array of business associations developed long before. In medieval times traders would do business through common law constructs, such as partnerships. Whenever people acted together with a view to profit, the law deemed that a partnership arose. Early guilds and livery companies were also often involved in the regulation of competition between traders. As England sought to build a mercantile Empire, the government created corporations under a Royal Charter or an Act of Parliament with the grant of a monopoly over a specified territory. The best known example, established in 1600, was the British East India Company. Queen Elizabeth I granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the Cape of Good Hope. Corporations at this time would essentially act on the government's behalf, bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad. Subsequently, the Company became increasingly integrated with British military and colonial policy, just as most UK corporations were essentially dependent on the British navy's ability to control trade routes on the high seas. A similar chartered company, the South Sea Company, was established in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the Treaty of Utrecht, signed in 1713 as a settlement following the War of Spanish Succession, which gave the United Kingdom an assiento to trade, and to sell slaves in the region for thirty years. In fact the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in the UK, enticed by company promoters' extravagant promises of profit, bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the public debt of the UK government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the Royal Exchange and London Assurance Corporation Act 1719, which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price. By inflating demand this in turn led to higher share prices. The \\"South Sea bubble\\" was the first speculative bubble the country had seen, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had \\"burst\\", and the share price sank from ¬£1000 to under ¬£100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations, and errant directors, was bitter. Even in 1776, Adam Smith wrote in the Wealth of Nations that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of \\"other people's money\\" would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.A Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) Book V, ch 1, para 107 Robert Lowe, then Vice President of the Board of Trade has been dubbed the \\"father of modern company law\\" for his role in drafting the 1856 reforms.See J Micklethwait and A Wooldridge, The company: A short history of a revolutionary idea (Modern Library 2003) ch 3 The Bubble Act 1720's prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until 1825. By this point the Industrial Revolution had gathered pace, pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity. Restrictions were gradually lifted on ordinary people incorporating,See the Bubble Companies, etc. Act 1825, 6 Geo 4, c 91 though businesses such as those chronicled by Charles Dickens in Martin Chuzzlewit under primitive companies legislation were often scams. Without cohesive regulation, undercapitalised ventures like the proverbial \\"Anglo- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company\\" promised no hope of success, except for richly remunerated promoters.See C Dickens, Martin Chuzzlewit (1843) ch 27, \\"'The secretary‚Äôs salary, David,‚Äô said Mr Montague, 'the office being now established, is eight hundred pounds per annum, with his house‚Äìrent, coals, and candles free. His five‚Äìand‚Äìtwenty shares he holds, of course.

'If that‚Äôs enough,‚Äô said Montague, 'I will propose it at the Board to‚Äìday, in my capacity as chairman.' The secretary smiled again; laughed, indeed, this time; and said, rubbing his nose slily with one end of the portfolio: 'It was a capital thought, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äô 'What was a capital thought, David?‚Äô Mr Montague inquired. 'The Anglo‚ÄìBengalee,‚Äô tittered the secretary. ‚ÄòThe Anglo‚ÄìBengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company is rather a capital concern, I hope, David,‚Äô said Montague. 'Capital indeed!‚Äô cried the secretary, with another laugh ‚Äî‚Äô in one sense.' 'In the only important one,‚Äô observed the chairman; 'which is number one, David.' 'What,‚Äô asked the secretary, bursting into another laugh, 'what will be the paid up capital, according to the next prospectus?‚Äô 'A figure of two, and as many oughts after it as the printer can get into the same line,‚Äô replied his friend. 'Ha, ha!‚Äô At this they both laughed; the secretary so vehemently, that in kicking up his feet, he kicked the apron open, and nearly started Cauliflower‚Äôs brother into an oyster shop; not to mention Mr Bailey‚Äôs receiving such a sudden swing, that he held on for a moment quite a young Fame, by one strap and no legs.\\" Then in 1843, William Gladstone took chairmanship of a Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies, which led to the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844.Report of the Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies (1844) British Parliamentary Papers vol VII For the first time it was possible for ordinary people through a simple registration procedure to incorporate. The advantage of establishing a company as a separate legal person was mainly administrative, as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled. The most important development came through the Limited Liability Act 1855, which allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company. These two features - a simple registration procedure and limited liability - were subsequently codified in the world's first modern company law, the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856. A series of Companies Acts up to the present Companies Act 2006 have essentially retained the same fundamental features. Over the 20th century, companies in the UK became the dominant organisational form of economic activity, which raised concerns about how accountable those who controlled companies were to those who invested in them. The first reforms following the Great Depression, in the Companies Act 1948, ensured that directors could be removed by shareholders with a simple majority vote. In 1977, the government's Bullock Report proposed reform to allow employees to participate in selecting the board of directors, as was happening across Europe, exemplified by the German Codetermination Act 1976. However the UK never implemented the reforms, and from 1979 the debate shifted. Although making directors more accountable to employees was delayed, the Cork Report led to stiffer sanctions in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 against directors who negligently ran companies at a loss. Through the 1990s the focus in corporate governance turned toward internal control mechanisms, such as auditing, separation of the chief executive position from the chair, and remuneration committees as an attempt to place some check on excessive executive pay. These rules applicable to listed companies, now found in the UK Corporate Governance Code, have been complemented by principles based regulation of institutional investors' activity in company affairs. At the same time, the UK's integration in the European Union meant a steadily growing body of EU Company Law Directives and case law to harmonise company law within the internal market.e.g. Case C-212/97 Centros Ltd v Erhvervs-og Selskabsstryrelsen [1999] 2 CMLR 551 and Case C-167/01 Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd [2003] ECR I-10155 Companies and the general law Companies occupy a special place in private law, because they have a legal personality separate from those who invest their capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and unjust enrichment operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A sole trader acquires rights and duties as normal under the general law of obligations. If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a sole trader, partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the business, if the partnership owes more money than the enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company. =Forming a company= Companies employ over half the workers in the UK, and turn over more than ¬£2,500 billion. A variety of companies may be incorporated under the Companies Act 2006. The people interested in starting the enterprise - the prospective directors, employees and shareholders - may choose, firstly, an unlimited or a limited company. \\"Unlimited\\" will mean the incorporators will be liable for all losses and debts under the general principles of private law.CA 2006 s 3(4); under CA 2006 s 448, unlimited companies are exempt from publishing accounts and reports The option of a limited company leads to a second choice. A company can be \\"limited by guarantee\\", meaning that if the company owes more debts than it can pay, the guarantors' liability will be limited to the extent of the money they elect to guarantee. Or a company may choose to be \\"limited by shares\\", meaning capital investors' liability is limited to the amount they subscribe for in share capital.Insolvency Act 1986 s 74(2)(d) 'In the case of a company limited by shares, no contribution is required from any member exceeding the amount (if any) unpaid on the shares in respect of which he is liable as a present or future member.' A third choice is whether a company limited by shares will be public or private.CA 2006 s 4 Both kinds of companies must display (partly as a warning) the endings \\"plc\\" or \\"Ltd\\" following the company name.CA 2006 s 58 Most new businesses will opt for a private company limited by shares, while unlimited companiesCA 2006 s 3(4) and companies limited by guarantee are typically chosen by either charities, risky ventures or mutual funds wanting to signal they will not leave debts unpaid. Charitable ventures also have the option to become a community interest company.CA 2006 s 35(2) and the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 Public companies are the predominant business vehicle in the UK economy. While far less numerous than private companies, they employ the overwhelming mass of British workers and turn over the greatest share of wealth. Public companies can offer shares to the public, must have a minimum capital of ¬£50,000, must allow free transferability of its shares, and typically (as most big public companies will be listed) will follow requirements of the London Stock Exchange or a similar securities market.See CA 2006 ss 755 (offering shares to the public), ss 761-763 (minimum capital); for market regulation rules, see the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Businesses may also elect to incorporate under the European Company Statute as a Societas Europaea. An \\"SE\\" will be treated in every European Union member state as if it were a public company formed in accordance with the law of that state,See The European Public Limited-Liability Company Regulations 2004 SI 2326/2004 and EU Regulation 2157/2001/EC and may opt in or out of employee involvement.EU Directive 2001/86/EC Once the decision has been made about the type of company, formation occurs through a series of procedures with the registrar at Companies House.CA 2006 s 7 Before registration, anybody promoting the company to attract investment falls under strict fiduciary duties to disclose all material facts about the venture and its finances.See Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co (1878) 3 App Cas 1218, reversing Clarke v Dickson (1858) EB & E 148. On remedies for misrepresentation, Derry v Peek (1889) LR 14 App Cas 337, Heilbut, Symons & Co v Buckleton [1913] AC 30 and Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd [1997] AC 254. Note however, share tender offers are merely invitations to treat, Spencer v Harding (1870) LR 5 CP 561. Moreover, anybody purporting to contract in a company's name before its registration will generally be personally liable on those obligations.See Kelner v Baxter (1866) LR 2 CP 174; CA 2006 s 51, implementing the Second Company Law Directive 68/151/EEC, replaced by the Single Person Company Directive 2009/101/EC and Phonogram Ltd v Lane [1982] 2 QB 938 In the registration process, those who invest money in a company will sign a memorandum of association stating what shares they will initially take, and pledge their compliance with the Companies Act 2006.CA 2006 s 13 A standard company constitution, known as the Model Articles, is deemed to apply,CA 2006 s 20 and the Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/3229) or the corporators may register their own individualised articles of association. Directors must be appointed - one in a private company and at least two in a public company - and a public company must have a secretary, but there needs to be no more than a single member.See CA 2006 s 154 (directors), s 12 (secretary) s 7 (member) and Single Person Company Directive 2009/102/EC The company will be refused registration if it is set up for an unlawful purpose, and a name must be chosen that is not inappropriate or already in use.See CA 2006 ss 54-69, Business Names Act 1985 and Bowman v Secular Society Ltd [1917] AC 406; see also, F Goldsmith (Sicklesmere) Ltd v Baxter [1970] 1 Ch 85, holding that if a company misstates its name in a contract, the contract is not void if a reasonable person would understand the entity referred to. This information is filled out in a form available on the Companies House website. In 2018, a ¬£12 fee was paid for online registration when Model Articles are adopted, or a ¬£40 for postal registration using the \\"IN01\\" form.See http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/forms/formsContinuation.shtml#IN01 (last accessed 6 October 2018) The registrar then issues a certificate of incorporation and a new legal personality enters the stage. =Corporate personality= The Corporation of London, which governs the Square Mile from the Griffin at Temple Bar to the Tower of London, is an early example of a separate legal person. English law recognised long ago that a corporation would have \\"legal personality\\". Legal personality simply means the entity is the subject of legal rights and duties. It can sue and be sued. Historically, municipal councils (such as the Corporation of London) or charitable establishments would be the primary examples of corporations. In 1612, Sir Edward Coke remarked in the Case of Sutton's Hospital,Case of Sutton's Hospital (1612) 10 Rep 32; 77 Eng Rep 960, 973 > the Corporation itself is onely in abstracto, and resteth onely in > intendment and consideration of the Law; for a Corporation aggregate of many > is invisible, immortal, & resteth only in intendment and consideration of > the Law; and therefore it cannot have predecessor nor successor. They may > not commit treason, nor be outlawed, nor excommunicate, for they have no > souls, neither can they appear in person, but by Attorney. A Corporation > aggregate of many cannot do fealty, for an invisible body cannot be in > person, nor can swear, it is not subject to imbecilities, or death of the > natural, body, and divers other cases. Without a body to be kicked or a soul to be damned, a corporation does not itself suffer penalties administered by courts, but those who stand to lose their investments will. A company will, as a separate person, be the first liable entity for any obligations its directors and employees create on its behalf.For a very old example, see Edmunds v Brown and Tillard (1668) 83 ER 385-387 If a company does not have enough assets to pay its debts as they fall due, it will be insolvent - bankrupt. Unless an administrator (someone like an auditing firm partner, usually appointed by creditors on a company's insolvency) is able to rescue the business, shareholders will lose their money, employees will lose their jobs and a liquidator will be appointed to sell off any remaining assets to distribute as much as possible to unpaid creditors. Yet if business remains successful, a company can persist forever,It is highly improbable in practice that companies lifespans are longer than an average person's. Of the 100 largest global companies in 1912, 48 had gone by 1995, see L Hannah, 'Marshall's Trees and the Global Forest: Were Giant Redwoods Different?' in N Lamoreaux et al (eds), Learning by Doing in Markets, Firms and Countries (1998) 253, 259 even as the natural people who invest in it and carry out its business change or pass away. Most companies adopt limited liability for their members, seen in the suffix of \\"Ltd\\" or \\"plc\\". This means that if a company does go insolvent, unpaid creditors cannot (generally) seek contributions from the company's shareholders and employees, even if shareholders and employees profited handsomely before a company's fortunes declined or would bear primary responsibility for the losses under ordinary civil law principles. The liability of a company itself is unlimited (companies have to pay all they owe with the assets they have), but the liability of those who invest their capital in a company is (generally) limited to their shares, and those who invest their labour can only lose their jobs.See Insolvency Act 1986 s 74(2)(d) in the case of a company limited by shares, no contribution is required from any member exceeding the amount (if any) unpaid on the shares in respect of which he is liable as a present or past member'. However, limited liability acts merely as a default position. It can be \\"contracted around\\", provided creditors have the opportunity and the bargaining power to do so.See generally, PL Davies, An Introduction to Company Law (Clarendon 2002) ch 4 A bank, for instance, may not lend to a small company unless the company's director gives his own house as security for the loan (e.g., by mortgage). Just as it is possible for two contracting parties to stipulate in an agreement that one's liability will be limited in the event of contractual breach, the default position for companies can be switched back so that shareholders or directors do agree to pay off all debts. If a company's investors do not do this, so their limited liability is not \\"contracted around\\", their assets will (generally) be protected from claims of creditors. The assets are beyond reach behind the metaphorical \\"veil of incorporation\\". =Rules of attribution= While a limited company is deemed to be a legal person separate from its shareholders and employees, as a matter of fact, a company can only act through its employees, from the board of directors down. So there must be rules to attribute rights and duties to a company from its actors.See Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500 This usually matters because an aggrieved third party will want to sue whoever has money to pay for breach of an obligation,cf Stone & Rolls Ltd v Moore Stephens [2009] UKHL 39, where a thin majority of the House of Lords held that an illegal act by a shareholder would be attributed to the company even though a liquidator was now standing in the company's shoes and would therefore be barred by ex turpi causa non- oritur actio. and companies rather than their employees often have more money. Up until reforms in 2006 this area used to be complicated significantly by the requirement on companies to specify an objects clause for their business, for instance \\"to make and sell, or lend on hire, railway-carriages\\". If companies acted outside their objects, for instance by giving a loan to build railways in Belgium, any such contracts were said to be ultra vires and consequently void. This is what happened in the early case of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche.(1875) LR 7 HL 653 The policy was thought to protect shareholders and creditors, whose investments or credit would not be used for an unanticipated purpose. However, it soon became clear that the ultra vires rule restricted the flexibility of businesses to expand to meet market opportunities. Void contracts might unexpectedly and arbitrarily hinder business, so companies began to draft ever longer objects clauses, often adding an extra provision stating all objects must be construed as fully separate, or the company's objects include anything directors feel is reasonably incidental to the business.Cotman v Brougham [1918] AC 514 and Bell Houses v City Wall Properties [1966] 2 QB 656 Now the 2006 Act states that companies are deemed to have unlimited objects, unless they opt for restrictions.CA 2006 s 31 The 2006 reforms have also clarified the legal position that if a company does have limited objects, an ultra vires act will cause the directors to have breached a duty to follow the constitution under section 171. Therefore, a shareholder who disagreed with an action outside the company's objects must sue directors for any loss. Contracts remain valid and third parties will be unaffected by this alone.CA 2006 s 39; as a matter of agency law, however directors may have exceeded their authority. CA 2006 s 40 states third parties will lose protection if they have acted in bad faith with the knowledge that a company exceeded its capacity. Contracts between companies and third parties, however, may turn out to be unenforceable on ordinary principles of agency law if the director or employee obviously exceeded their authority. As a general rule, third parties need not be concerned with constitutional details conferring power among directors or employees, which may only be found by laboriously searching the register at Companies House.e.g. Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 119 ER 327, Mahony v East Holyford Mining Co (1875) LR 7 HL 869 In general, if a third party acts in good faith, then any contract, even one going beyond the constitutional authority of the director or employee with whom they strike a deal, is valid. However, if it would appear to a reasonable person that a company employee would not have the authority to enter an agreement, then the contract is voidable at the company's instance so long as there is no equitable bar to rescission. The third party would have a claim against the (probably less solvent) employee instead. First, an agent may have express actual authority, in which case there is no problem. Her actions will be attributed to the company. Second, an agent may have implied actual authority (also sometimes called \\"usual\\" authority), which falls within the usual scope of the employee's office.See Hely-Hutchinson v Brayhead Ltd [1968] 1 QB 549 Third, an agent may have \\"apparent authority\\" (also called \\"ostensible\\" authority) as it would appear to a reasonable person, creating an estoppel.See Freeman and Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 If the actions of a company employee have authority deriving from a company constitution in none of these ways, a third party will only have recourse for breach of an obligation (a warrant of authority) against the individual agent, and not to the company as the principal. The Companies Act 2006 section 40 makes clear that directors are always deemed to be free of limitations on their authority under the constitution, unless a third party acting in callous bad faith takes advantage of a company whose director acts outside the scope of authority. For employees down the chain of delegation, it becomes less and less likely that a reasonable contracting party would think big transactions will have had authority. For instance, it would be unlikely that a bank cashier would have the authority to sell the bank's Canary Wharf skyscraper. Problems arise where serious torts, and particularly fatal injuries occur as a result of actions by company employees. All torts committed by employees in the course of employment will attribute liability to their company even if acting wholly outside authority, so long as there is some temporal and close connection to work.e.g. Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22; see also R Stevens, 'Vicarious Liability or Vicarious Action' (2007) 123 Law Quarterly Review 30; Middleton v Folwer (1699) 1 Salk 282 and Ackworth v Kempe (1778) 1 Dougl 40 It is also clear that acts by directors become acts of the company, as they are \\"the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation.\\"Lord Haldane Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd [1915] AC 705; see also, Bolton v Graham & Sons Limited, per Lord Denning, \\"A company may in many ways be likened to a human body. It has a brain and nerve centre which controls what it does. It also has hands which hold the tools and act in accordance with directions from the centre... (the) directors and managers represent the directing mind and will of the company and control what it does. The state of mind of these managers is the state of mind of the company and is treated by the law as such.\\" But despite strict liability in tort, civil remedies are in some instances insufficient to provide a deterrent to a company pursuing business practices that could seriously injure the life, health and environment of other people. Even with additional regulation by government bodies, such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Environment Agency, companies may still have a collective incentive to ignore the rules in the knowledge that the costs and likelihood of enforcement is weaker than potential profits. Criminal sanctions remain problematic, for instance if a company director had no intention to harm anyone, no mens rea, and managers in the corporate hierarchy had systems to prevent employees committing offences.e.g. Tesco Supermarkets v Nattrass [1972] AC 153 One step toward reform is found in the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. This creates a criminal offence for manslaughter, meaning a penal fine of up to 10 per cent of turnover against companies whose managers conduct business in a grossly negligent fashion, resulting in deaths. Without lifting the veil there remains, however, no personal liability for directors or employees acting in the course of employment, for corporate manslaughter or otherwise.See Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 830 The quality of a company's accountability to a broader public and the conscientiousness of its behaviour must rely also, in great measure, on its governance. =Piercing the veil= If a company goes insolvent, there are certain situations where the courts lift the veil of incorporation on a limited company, and make shareholders or directors contribute to paying off outstanding debts to creditors. However, in UK law the range of circumstances is heavily limited. This is usually said to derive from the \\"principle\\" in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd.Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd [1897] AC 22 In this leading case, a Whitechapel cobbler incorporated his business under the Companies Act 1862. At that time, seven people were required to register a company, possibly because the legislature had viewed the appropriate business vehicle for fewer people to be a partnership.See R Grantham, 'The Doctrinal Basis of Company Law' (1998) 57 Cambridge Law Journal 554, 560 Mr Salomon met this requirement by getting six family members to subscribe for one share each. Then, in return for money he lent the company, he made the company issue a debenture, which would secure his debt in priority to other creditors in the event of insolvency. The company did go insolvent, and the company liquidator, acting on behalf of unpaid creditors attempted to sue Mr Salomon personally. Although the Court of Appeal held that Mr Salomon had defeated Parliament's purpose in registering dummy shareholders, and would have made him indemnify the company, the House of Lords held that so long as the simple formal requirements of registration were followed, the shareholders' assets must be treated as separate from the separate legal person that is a company. There could not, in general, be any lifting of the veil.See also, Lee v Lee's Air Farming Ltd Whitechapel High Street, where Aron Salomon, the most famous litigant in company law, went insolvent. This principle is open to a series of qualifications. Most significantly, statute may require directly or indirectly that the company not be treated as a separate entity. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, section 214 stipulates that company directorsOr \\"shadow directors\\", defined under IA 1986 s 251 as \\"a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act\\". See Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd [1994] BCC 161. must contribute to payment of company debts in winding up if they kept the business running up more debt when they ought to have known there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency. A number of other cases demonstrate that in construing the meaning of a statute unrelated to company law, the purpose of the legislation should be fulfilled regardless of the existence of a corporate form. For example, in Daimler Co Ltd v Continental Tyre and Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd,Daimler Co Ltd v Continental Tyre and Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd [1916] 2 AC 307 the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 said that trading with any person of \\"enemy character\\" would be an offence. So even though the Continental Tyre Co Ltd was a \\"legal person\\" incorporated in the UK (and therefore British) its directors and shareholders were German (and therefore enemies, while the First World War was being fought). There are also case based exceptions to the Salomon principle, though their restrictive scope is not wholly stable. The present rule under English law is that only where a company was set up to commission fraud,e.g. Re Darby, ex parte Brougham [1911] 1 KB 95 or to avoid a pre-existing obligation can its separate identity be ignored. This follows from a Court of Appeal case, Adams v Cape Industries plc.[1990] Ch 433. Heavily doubted by Lord Mance in VTB Capital plc v Nutritek Int Corp [2013] UKSC 5, [127] 'they include obiter observations and are anyway not binding in this court'. A group of employees suffered asbestos diseases after working for the American wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Industries plc. They were suing in New York to make Cape Industries plc pay for the debts of the subsidiary. Under conflict of laws principles, this could only be done if Cape Industries plc was treated as \\"present\\" in America through its US subsidiary (i.e. ignoring the separate legal personality of the two companies). Rejecting the claim, and following the reasoning in Jones v Lipman,Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832, where to avoid an order for specific performance, Mr Lipman sold his house to a company. Russell J held that this attempt to avoid a pre-existing obligation meant the court could ignore the separate legal identity of the company and award specific performance as a remedy anyway. the Court of Appeal emphasised that the US subsidiary had been set up for a lawful purpose of creating a group structure overseas, and had not aimed to circumvent liability in the event of asbestos litigation. The potentially unjust result for tort victims, who are unable to contract around limited liability and may be left only with a worthless claim against a bankrupt entity, has been changed in Chandler v Cape plc so that a duty of care may be owed by a parent to workers of a subsidiary regardless of separated legal personality.[2012] EWCA Civ 525. E McGaughey, 'Donoghue v Salomon in the High Court' (2011) 4 Journal of Personal Injury Law 249, on SSRN. See also Connelly v RTZ Corp Plc [1998] AC 854 and Lubbe v Cape Plc [2000] 1 WLR 1545. However even though tort victims are protected, the restrictive position remains subject to criticism where a company group is involved, since it is not clear that companies and actual people ought to get the protection of limited liability in identical ways. An influential decision, although subsequently doubted strongly by the House of Lords,See Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional Council (1978) SLT 159; see also, The Albazero [1977] AC 774, 807; Re A Company [1985] 1 BCC 99421; Bank of Tokyo Ltd v Karoon [1987] AC 45n, 64; cf Canada Safeway Ltd v Local 373, Canadian Food and Allied Workers (1974) 46 DLR (3d) 113, and contrast Dimbleby & Sons Ltd v National Union of Journalists [1984] 1 All ER 751 was passed by Lord Denning MR in DHN Ltd v Tower Hamlets BC.DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council [1976] 1 WLR 852; see also Littlewoods Mail Order Stores v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1969] 1 WLR 1214; Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 1 WLR 991 Here Lord Denning MR held that a group of companies, two subsidiaries wholly owned by a parent, constituted a single economic unit.This terminology follows from AA Berle, 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343, and is a concept used in German company law. See C Alting, 'Piercing the corporate veil in German and American law - Liability of individuals and entities: a comparative view' (1994‚Äì1995) 2 Tulsa Journal Comparative & International Law 187. Because the companies' shareholders and controlling minds were identical, their rights were to be treated as the same. This allowed the parent company to claim compensation from the council for compulsory purchase of its business, which it could not have done without showing an address on the premises that its subsidiary possessed. Similar approaches to treating corporate \\"groups\\" or a \\"concern\\" as single economic entities exist in many continental European jurisdictions. This is done for tax and accounting purposes in English law, however for general civil liability the rule still followed is that in Adams v Cape Industries plc. It is very rare for English courts to lift the veil.See C Mitchell, 'Lifting the Corporate Veil in the. English Courts: An Empirical Study' (1999) 3 Company, Financial and Insolvency Law Review 15. The liability of the company is generally attributed to the company alone. =Capital regulations= Because limited liability generally prevents shareholders, directors or employees from being sued, the Companies Acts have sought to regulate the company's use of its capital in at least four ways. \\"Capital\\" refers to the economic value of a company's assets, such as money, buildings, or equipment. First, and most controversially, the Companies Act 2006 section 761, following the EU's Second Company Law Directive,Second Company Law Directive 2012/30/EU art 6 requires a ‚Ç¨25,000 minimum requires that when a public company begins to trade, it has a minimum of ¬£50,000 promised to be paid up by the shareholders. After that, the capital can be spent. This is a largely irrelevant sum for almost any public company, and although the first Companies Acts required it, since 1862 there has been no similar provision for a private company. Nevertheless, a number of EU member states kept minimum capital rules for their private companies, until recently. In 1999, in Centros Ltd v Erhvervs- og Selskabsstyrelsen(1999) C-212/97, [36]-[38] the European Court of Justice held that a Danish minimum capital rule for private companies was a disproportionate infringement of the right of establishment for businesses in the EU. A UK private limited company was refused registration by the Danish authorities, but it was held that the refusal was unlawful because the minimum capital rules did not proportionately achieve the aim of protecting creditors. Less restrictive means could achieve the same goal, such as allowing creditors to contract for guarantees. This led a large number of businesses in countries with minimum capital rules, like France and Germany, to begin incorporating as a UK \\"Ltd\\". France abolished its minimum capital requirement for the SARL in 2003, and Germany created a form of GmbH without minimum capital in 2008.GmbHG ¬ß5a However, while the Second Company Law Directive is not amended, the rules remain in place for public companies.For support for minimum capital, on the basis that it prevents frivolous incorporations, see H Eidenmueller, B Grunewald and U Noack, 'Minimum Capital in the System of Legal Capital' in M Lutter (ed), Legal Capital in Europe (2006) European and Company Financial Law Review, Special Volume 25 A 1903 stock certificate of a circus business, Barnum & Bailey, showing an issue price of ¬£1 a share. The American business' founder, P. T. Barnum was known for his phrase \\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\" The second measures, which originally came from the common law but also went into the Second Company Law Directive, were to regulate what was paid for shares. Initial subscribers to a memorandum for public companies must buy their shares with cash,CA 2006 s 584 though afterwards it is possible to give a company services or assets in return for shares. The problem was whether the services or assets accepted were in fact as valuable to the company as the cash share price otherwise would be. At common law, In re Wragg Ltd said that any exchange that was \\"honestly and not colourably\\" agreed to, between the company and the purchaser of shares, would be presumed legitimate.In re Wragg Ltd [1897] 1 Ch 796, per Lindley LJ. This was based on a heavily laissez faire viewpoint: \\"We must not allow ourselves to be misled by talking of value. The value paid to the company is measured by the price at which the company agrees to buy what it thinks it worth its while to acquire. Whilst the transaction is unimpeached, this is the only value to be considered.\\" Later on it was also held that if the assets given were probably understood by both parties to have been insufficient, then this would count as a \\"colourable\\" taint, and the shares could be treated as being not properly paid for.cf In re White Star Line Ltd [1938] Ch 458 and Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd [2001] 2 BCLC 773 The shareholder would have to pay again. This laissez faire approach was changed for public companies. Shares cannot be issued in return for services that will only be provided at a later date.CA 2006 s 585, and Directive 2012/30/EU art 7 Shares can be issued in return for assets, but a public company must pay for an independent valuation.CA 2006 ss 593-597 and Directive 2012/30/EU art 10 There are also absolute limits to what a share can be bought for in cash, based on a share's \\"nominal value\\" or \\"par value\\". This refers to a figure chosen by a company when it begins to sell shares, and it can be anything from 1 penny up to the market price. UK law always required that some nominal value be set, because it was thought that a lower limit of some kind should be in place for how much shares could be sold, even though this very figure was chosen by the company itself.Ooregum Gold Mining Co of India v Roper [1892] AC 125 invented the common law rule that shares cannot be issued at a discount on their nominal value. Mosely v Kofffontein Mines Ltd [1904] 2 Ch 108 held this also applied to bonds convertible into shares. Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474 held that options attached to shares issued at nominal value to buy later, if the share price rose, did not infringe the rule. Every share, therefore, is still required to have a nominal value and shares cannot be sold at a price lower.CA 2006 s 542 and Directive 2012/30/EU art 8. CA 2006 ss 588-9, subsequent holders of shares are jointly liable with a previous owner for any contravention of the Act unless they are a bona fide purchaser. Under CA 2006 ss 584-7, the court can grant relief if just and equitable considering how much value is actually conferred. In practice this has meant companies always set nominal values so low below the issue price, that the actual market price at which a share ends up being traded is very unlikely to plummet so far. This has led to the criticism for at least 60 years that the rule is useless and best abolished.See Gedge Committee, Report of the Committee on Shares of No Par Value (1954) Cmd 9112 and Company Law Review Steering Group, The Strategic Framework (1999) 'the requirement that shares should have a nominal value has become an anachronism.' The FTSE 100 Index, here between 1969 and 2013, indicates value that traders in the stock market perceive the UK's top 100 companies to have, given the dividends they will pay out. Dividends can only be paid on profits above a company's \\"legal capital\\": the initial total shareholders contributed when they bought their shares. The third, and practically most important strategy for creditor protection, was to require that dividends and other returns to shareholders could only be made, generally speaking, if a company had profits. The concept of \\"profit\\" is defined by law as having assets above the amount that shareholders, who initially bought shares from the company, contributed in return for their shares. For example, a company could launch its business with 1000 shares (for public companies, called an \\"IPO\\" or initial public offering) each with a nominal value of 1 penny, and an issue price of ¬£1. Shareholders would buy the ¬£1 shares, and if all are sold, ¬£1000 would become the company's \\"legal capital\\". Profits are whatever the company makes on top of that ¬£1000, though as a company continues to trade, the market price of shares could well be going up to ¬£2 or ¬£10, or indeed fall to 50 pence or some other number. The Companies Act 2006 states in section 830 that dividends, or any other kind of distribution, can only be given out from surplus profits beyond the legal capital.CA 2006 ss 830-831 and Directive 2012/30/EU art 15 It is generally the decision of the board of directors, affirmed by a shareholder resolution, whether to declare a dividend or perhaps simply retain the earnings and invest them back into the business to grow and expand.Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008 Sch 3, para 70. Sch 3 para 4, also allows shareholders the instruction right to get the dividends paid out with a 75% vote. The calculation of companies' assets and liabilities, losses and profits, will follow the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the UK, but this is not an objective, scientific process: a variety of different accounting methods can be used which can lead to different assessments of when a profit exists. The prohibition on falling below the legal capital applies to \\"distributions\\" in any form, and so \\"disguised\\" distributions are also caught. This has been held to include, for example, an unwarranted salary payment to a director's wife when she had not worked,Re Halt Garage [1982] 3 All ER 1016, Oliver J and a transfer of a property within a company group at half its market value.Aveling Barford Ltd v Period Ltd [1989] BCLC 626, Hoffmann J A general principle, however, recently expounded in Progress Property Co Ltd v Moorgarth Group Ltd is that if a transaction is negotiated in good faith and at arm's length, then it may not be unwound,[2010] UKSC 55 and this is apparently so even if it means that creditors have been \\"ripped off\\". If distributions are made without meeting the law's criteria, then a company has a claim to recover the money from any recipients. They are liable as constructive trustees,CA 2006 ss 847 which probably mirrors the general principles of any action in unjust enrichment.See J Payne, 'Unjust Enrichment, Trusts and Recipient Liability For Unlawful Dividends' (2003) 119 LQR 583 This means that liability is probably strict, subject to a change of position defence, and the rules of tracing will apply if assets wrongfully paid out of the company have been passed on. For example, in It's A Wrap (UK) Ltd v Gula[2006] EWCA Civ 544 the directors of a bankrupt company argued that they had been unaware that dividend payments they paid themselves were unlawful (as there had not in fact been profits) because their tax advisers had said it was okay. The Court of Appeal held that ignorance of the law was not a defence. A contravention existed so long as one ought to have known of the facts that show a dividend would contravene the law. Directors can similarly be liable for breach of duty, and so to restore the money wrongfully paid away, if they failed to take reasonable care.In re Exchange Banking Company or Flitcroft‚Äôs Case (1882) LR 21 Ch D 519 and Bairstow v Queen's Moat Houses plc [2001] EWCA Civ 712 After a leveraged buyout of the leading UK football team, the Glazer ownership of Manchester United plunged the club into debt,See, for example, M Moritz, 'Manchester United opens window on murky world of leveraged buy-outs' (27 June 2010) Daily Telegraph a thing that would have been more difficult before prohibitions on financial assistance for share purchase were relaxed in 1981. Legal capital must be maintained (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed \\"in disguise\\") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and will be able to pay its debts.CA 2006 ss 641-644 If this turns out to be a negligent statement, the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to claw back any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary.CA 2006 ss 645-653 The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest.CA 2006 s 646(4) There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions,Second Company Law Directive 2012/30/EU art 46 however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel preferential shares before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering \\"the position of the company itself as an economic entity\\".See Re Chatterley-Whitfield Collieries Ltd [1948] 2 All ER 593, per Lord Greene MR. Further Re Saltdean Estate Co Ltd [1968] 3 All ER 829, cf Re Northern Engineering Industries plc [1994] 2 BCLC 704 Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law,Trevor v Whitworth (1887) 12 App Cas 409 but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits.CA 2006 ss 684-690 and 735. See Culross Global SPC Ltd v Strategic Turnaround Master Partnership Ltd [2010] UKPC 33, a Cayman Islands mutual fund could suspend share redemptions under its articles, but not suspend payment of redemption proceeds after giving a valid redemption notice. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits. Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution.CA 2006 ss 714-717 Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back pro rata.Listing Rule 12.4.2-3 How many shares are retained by the company as treasury shares or cancelled must be reported to Companies House.CA 2006 s 707 From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they \\"dodge\\" the Exchequer.e.g. R Dobbs and W Rehm, 'Debating Point: Are share buybacks a good thing?' (28 June 2006) Financial Times The fourth main area of regulation, which is usually thought of as preserving a company's capital, is prohibition of companies providing other people with financial assistance for purchasing the company's own shares. The main problem which the regulation was intended to prevent was leveraged buyouts where, for example, an investor gets a loan from a bank, secures the loan on the company it is about to buy, and uses the money to buy the shares.See Greene Committee, Company Law Amendment Committee Report (1925-1926) Cmnd 2657 ¬ß30 and Jenkins Committee, Report of the Company Law Committee (1962) Cmnd 6707 ¬ß173 It was seen as a capital problem in the sense that if the venture proved unsustainable, all the company's assets would be seized under the mortgage terms, even though technically it did not reduce a company's capital.cf PL Davies and S Worthington, Principles of Modern Company Law (2012) 360, 13-44 A leveraged buy out, in effect, is the same as a bank giving someone a loan to buy a house with a 100 per cent mortgage on that house. However, in a company's case, the bank is likely to be only one among a large number of creditors, such as employees, consumers, taxpayers, or small businesses who rely on the company's trade. Only the bank will have priority for its loan, and so the risk falls wholly on other stakeholders. Financial assistance for share purchase, especially indemnifying a takeover bidder's loan, was therefore seen as encouraging risky ventures that were prone to failure, to the detriment of creditors other than the bank. It was prohibited from 1929.Companies Act 1929 s 45 The prohibition remains in regard to public companies,Second Company Law Directive art 25 and CA 2006 ss 677-678 however the Companies Act 1981 relaxed the restrictions and the Companies Act 2006 section 678, following various sources of academic criticism, repealed the prohibition for private companies altogether. It became possible to \\"take private\\" a public company (on its purchase, change the company from a plc to an Ltd). The result has been a growing number of leveraged buyouts, and an increase in the private equity industry of the UK.J Armour, 'Share Capital and Creditor Protection: Efficient Rules for a Modern Company Law' (2000) 63(3) Modern Law Review 355, 374, also noting that \\"LBOs do have the capacity to harm creditors\\" and some are motivated by \\"asset stripping\\" even though empirical studies suggest gains to other groups are high. Corporate governance Tough corporate governance reform, the CDDA 1986, disqualified the directors in Re Barings plc (No 5),[1999] 1 BCLC 433 after a rogue trader brought down Barings Bank, unsupervised, from the Singapore office. Corporate governance is concerned primarily with the balance of power between the two basic organs of a UK company: the board of directors and the general meeting. The term \\"governance\\" is often used in the more narrow sense of referring to principles in the UK Corporate Governance Code. This makes recommendations about the structure, accountability and remuneration of the board of directors in listed companies, and was developed after the Polly Peck, BCCI and Robert Maxwell scandals led to the Cadbury Report of 1992. However, put broadly corporate governance in UK law focuses on the relative rights and duties of directors, shareholders, employees, creditors and others who are seen as having a \\"stake\\" in the company's success. The Companies Act 2006, in conjunction with other statutes and case law, lays down an irreducible minimum core of mandatory rights for shareholders, employees, creditors and others by which all companies must abide. UK rules usually focus on protecting shareholders or the investing public, but above the minimum, company constitutions are essentially free to allocate rights and duties to different groups in any form desired. =Constitutional separation of powers= The constitution of a company is usually referred to as the \\"articles of association\\".See CA 2006 s 17. Prior to CA 2006, the constitution was also composed of a \\"memorandum of association\\", which contained basic company information and was unalterable. Now the \\"memorandum\\" merely refers to a document signed by initial shareholders at a company formation under CA 2006 s 8. Companies are presumed to adopt a set of \\"Model Articles\\",See the Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/3229) with differing provisions for private and public companies, previously known as \\"Table A\\". unless the incorporators choose different rules.CA 2006 s 20 The Model Articles set out essential procedures for conducting a company's business, such as when to hold meetings, appointment of directors, or preparing accounts. These rules may always be changed, except where a provision is a compulsory term deriving from the Companies Act 2006, or similar mandatory law. In this sense a company constitution is functionally similar to any business contract, albeit one that is usually variable among the contracting parties with less than consensus. In Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd,[2009] UKPC 10, [16]; cf Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw [1940] AC 701 Lord Hoffmann held that courts construe the meaning of a company's articles in the same way as any other contract, or a piece of legislation, mindful of the context in which it was formulated.See also, Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 WLR 896 So in this case, the appropriate construction of a company's articles led to the implication that a director could be removed from office by shareholders (and did not have a job for life), even though a literal construction would have meant no person possessed the two classes of shares required to remove that director under the articles. Even if companies' articles are silent on an issue, the courts will construe the gaps to be filled with provisions consistent with the rest of the instrument in its context, as in the old case of Attorney General v Davy where Lord Hardwicke LC held that a simple majority was enough for the election of a chaplain.(1741) 26 ER 531 A board of directors is accountable to the general meeting. These are the two essential organs of all UK companies. Typically, a company's articles will vest a general power of management in the board of directors, with full power of directors to delegate tasks to other employees, subject to an instruction right reserved for the general meeting acting with a three quarter majority. This basic pattern can theoretically be varied in any number of ways, and so long as it does not contravene the Act, courts will enforce that balance of power. In Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame,[1906] 2 Ch 34 a shareholder sued the board for not following a resolution, carried with an ordinary majority of votes, to sell off the company's assets. The Court of Appeal refused the claim,The shareholder, Mr McDiarmid, brought the claim as a derivative action in the name of the company, given the rule in Foss v Harbottle (1843) 67 ER 189 presupposed a majority of shareholders could litigate since the articles stipulated that a three quarter majority was needed to issue specific instructions to the board. Shareholders always have the option of gaining the votes to change the constitution or threaten directors with removal, but they may not sidestep the separation of powers found in the company constitution.See John Shaw & Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw [1935] 2 KB 113, Greer LJ, 'The only way in which the general body of the shareholders can control the exercise of the powers vested by the articles in the directors is by altering their articles, or, if the opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove.' Though older cases raise an element of uncertainty,Macdougall v Gardiner (1875) 1 Ch D 13, holding that a director's refusal to take a poll of shareholders, validly requested under the company's articles, was not actionable because it was a \\"mere internal irregularity\\". This decision was not clearly based on any authority, and appears contradicted by the modern theory of construction. See also P Davies, Gower and Davies' Principles of Modern Company Law (8th edn Sweet and Maxwell 2008) 72; RJ Smith (1978) 41 MLR 147 the majority opinion is that other provisions of a company's constitution generate personal rights that may be enforced by company members individually. Of the most important is a member's right to vote at meetings. Votes need not necessarily attach to shares, as preferential shares (e.g., those with extra dividend rights) are frequently non-voting. However, ordinary shares invariably do have votes and in Pender v Lushington Lord Jessel MR stated votes were so sacrosanct as to be enforceable like a \\"right of property\\".(1877) 6 Ch D 70; cf Ashby v White (1703) 92 ER 126 Otherwise, the articles may be enforced by any member privy to the contract.See Eley v Positive Government Security Life Assurance Co Ltd (1876) 1 Ex D 88; but cf Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep-Breeders' Association [1915] 1 Ch 881 Companies are excluded from the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, so people who are conferred benefits under a constitution, but are not themselves members, are not necessarily able to sue for compliance.The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 s 6, excludes the Companies Acts from its scope; however the rule of privity is unsteady on orthodox principles, see Smith and Snipes Hall Farm Ltd v River Douglas Catchment Board [1949] 2 KB 500 Partly for certainty and to achieve objectives the Act would prohibit, shareholders in small closely held companies frequently supplement the constitution by entering a shareholders' agreement.See Russell v Northern Bank Development Corp Ltd [1992] 1 WLR 588 By contract shareholders can regulate any of their rights outside the company, yet their rights within the company remain a separate matter. =Shareholder rights= In the Companies Act 2006 there is no duty to maximise profits for shareholders,cf CA 2006 s 172, which requires directors \\"promote the success of the company\\" for the benefit of members with regard to stakeholders (but at no point refers to shareholders). This said, members usually are shareholders, and because shareholders tend to monopolise voting rights, directors invariably follow shareholder interests. There is, however, no legal duty. and shareholders have few rights, because the word \\"shareholder\\" (those who usually invest capital in a company) is rarely used. Instead, \\"members\\" have rights in UK company law. Anybody can become a company member through agreement with others involved in a new or existing company. However, because of the bargaining position that people have through capital investment, shareholders typically are the only members, and usually have a monopoly on governance rights under a constitution. In this way, the UK is a \\"pro-shareholder\\" jurisdiction relative to its European and American counterparts. Since the Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment, chaired in 1945 by Lord Cohen, led to the Companies Act 1947, as members and voters in the general meeting of public companies,In closely held, private companies, the mandatory removal right in CA 2006 s 168 is qualified by the majority House of Lords decision in Bushell v Faith [1970] AC 1099, holding that a company's articles could allow a shareholder's votes to triple if facing removal as a director. This followed the Cohen Report's recommendations. shareholders have the mandatory right to remove directors by a simple majority,CA 2006 s 168, previously Companies Act 1985, section 303, implemented in the Companies Act 1947, following recommendations of the Cohen Committee, Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment (1945) Cmd 6659. See EM Dodd, 'The Cohen Report' (1945) 58 Harvard Law Review 1258 while in Germany,See Aktiengesetz 1965 ¬ß76. This is the Vorstand, or the \\"executive\\" of the company that carries out all functions of management, rather than the Aufsichtsrat or supervisory council, which appoints it and is in turn elected by shareholders and employees. and in most American companies (predominantly incorporated in Delaware) directors can only be removed for a \\"good reason\\".See Delaware General Corporation Law s 141(k) and Ralph B. Campbell v. Loews, Inc 134 A.2d 852 (1957); for a comprehensive critique, see AA Berle and GC Means, The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932) Shareholders will habitually have the right to change the company's constitution with a three quarter majority vote, unless they have chosen to entrench the constitution with a higher threshold.CA 2006 s 283 (special resolution definition), ss 21-22 (amending the constitution) Shareholders with support of 5 per cent of the total vote can call meetings,CA 2006 ss 303-305, as amended by Companies (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2009/1632 Pt 2, reg 4 and can circulate suggestions for resolutions with support of 5 per cent of the total vote, or any one hundred other shareholders holding over ¬£100 in shares each.CA 2006 s 314 Categories of important decisions, such as large asset sales,UKLA Listing Rule 10. approval of mergers, takeovers, winding up of the company, any expenditure on political donations,CA 2006 ss 366-368 and 378 require a resolution, itemising the money to be donated, be passed by shareholders for any political contributions over ¬£5000 in 12 months, lasting a maximum of four years. share buybacks, or a (for the time being) non-binding say on pay of directors,CA 2006 s 439; other transactions where directors have a conflict of interest that require binding approval of shareholders are ratification of corporate opportunities, large self dealing transactions and service contracts lasting over two years. are reserved exclusively for the shareholder body. =Investor rights= The London Stock Exchange, at Paternoster Square, lists most public companies. Shareholder voting rights are not yet exercised by elected representatives of economic investors, and are mostly appropriated by asset managers with potential conflicts of interest.See PL Davies and S Worthington, Gower and Davies' Principles of Modern Company Law (2016) 15-27 'Conflicts of interest and inactivity'. E McGaughey, 'Does Corporate Governance Exclude the Ultimate Investor?' (2016) 16(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 221. While shareholders have a privileged position in UK corporate governance, most are themselves, institutions - mainly asset managers - holding \\"other people's money\\" from pension funds, life insurance policies and mutual funds.See PL Davies and S Worthington, Gower and Davies' Principles of Modern Company Law (2016) 15-27 'Conflicts of interest and inactivity'. A Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) Book V, ch 1, para 107 and LD Brandeis, Other People's Money And How the Bankers Use It (1914) Shareholding institutions, who are entered on the share registers of public companies on the London Stock Exchange, are mainly asset managers and they infrequently exercise their governance rights.E McGaughey, 'Does Corporate Governance Exclude the Ultimate Investor?' (2016) 16(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 221 and RC Nolan, 'Indirect Investors: A Greater Say in the Company?‚Äô (2003) 3(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 73 In turn, asset managers take money from other institutional investors, particularly pension funds, mutual funds and insurance funds, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through pensions, are beneficiaries from the returns on shares. Historically, institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. Under the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241 to 243 require that pension fund trustees are elected or appointed to be accountable to the beneficiaries of the fund, while the Companies Act 2006 section 168 ensures that directors are accountable to shareholders. However, the rules of contract, equity and fiduciary duty that operate between asset managers and the real capital investors have not been codified. Government reports have suggested,Hampel Committee, Committee on Corporate Governance: Final Report (1998) para 5.7, 'The right to vote is an important part of the asset represented by a share, and in our view an institution has a responsibility to the client to make considered use of it.' Also Cadbury Report, Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance (1992) para 6.12 and case law requires,Butt v Kelson [1952] Ch 197, Lehman Brothers International (Europe) v CRC Credit Fund Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 917, [171] and Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan [1991] EWCA Civ 11, Dillon LJ, 'it is accepted that... the assets and moneys in question are trust moneys held on trust for all or some of the would-be investors (\\"the investors\\") who paid moneys to BCI or associated bodies for investment, and are not general assets of BCI.' that asset managers follow the instructions about voting rights from investors in pooled funds according to the proportion of their investment, and follow instructions entirely when investors have separate accounts.Discussed by E McGaughey, 'Does Corporate Governance Exclude the Ultimate Investor?' (2016) 16(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 221 and see further RC Nolan, 'Indirect Investors: A Greater Say in the Company?‚Äô (2003) 3(1) Journal of Corporate Law Studies 73 Some institutional investors have been found to work \\"behind the scenes\\" to achieve corporate governance objectives through informal but direct communication with management,See BS Black and JC Coffee, 'Hail Britannia?: Institutional Investor Behavior Under Limited Regulation' (1994) 92 Michigan Law Review 1997-2087 although an increasing concern has developed since the global financial crisis that asset managers and all financial intermediaries face structural conflicts of interest and should be banned from voting on other people's money entirely.See in the US, Dodd Frank Act of 2010 ¬ß957 (banning broker dealers from voting without instructions on any important issue, including director elections) and the Swiss, Verordnung gegen √ºberm√§ssige Verg√ºtungen bei b√∂rsenkotierten Aktiengesellschaften 2013 (banning banks from voting on behalf of any company investor, and placing a duty instead on pension funds to be active in their voting). Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other people's money, are bound by fiduciary obligations, deriving from the law of trusts and obligations to exercise care deriving from the common law. The Stewardship Code 2010, drafted by the Financial Reporting Council (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting. The aim is to make directors more accountable, at least, to investors of capital. =Employees' rights= While it has not been the norm, employee participation rights in corporate governance have existed in many specific sectors, particularly universities, and many workplaces organised as partnerships.Discussed in E McGaughey, 'Votes at Work in Britain: Shareholder Monopolisation and the 'Single Channel' (2018) 47(1) Industrial Law Journal 76 and E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 11. In university corporations, see the Oxford University Act 1854 ss 16 and 21, Cambridge University Act 1856 ss 5 and 12. Also the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, ss 20(2) and 85, and Sch 4, para 4. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977, all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first \\"codetermination\\" laws in the world.See also the South Metropolitan Gas Act 1896 s 19, Port of London Act 1908 s 1(7), Iron and Steel Act 1967, Sch 4, Part V, Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 s 2(8), Post Office Act 1977 s 1 However, as many of those Acts were updated, the Companies Act 2006 today still has no general requirement for workers to vote in the general meeting to elect directors, meaning corporate governance remains monopolised by shareholding institutions or asset managers. By contrast in 16 out of 28 EU member states employees have participation rights in private companies, including the election of members of the boards of directors, and binding votes on decisions about individual employment rights, like dismissals, working time and social facilities or accommodation.See M Weiss (ed) et al., Handbook on employee involvement in Europe (Kluwer 2004). For the most developed example, see in German labour law the Mitbestimmungsgesetz 1976 and the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz 1972 ¬ß87. Member states with no participation rights are Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and the United Kingdom. At board level, UK company law, in principle, allows any measure of employee participation, alongside shareholders, but voluntary measures have been rare outside employee share schemes that usually carry very little voice and increase employees' financial risk. Crucially, the Companies Act 2006 section 168 defines \\"members\\" as those with the ability to vote out the board. Under section 112 a \\"member\\" is anybody who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members' register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work. A company could write its constitution to make \\"employees\\" members with voting rights under any terms it chose. Universities in the UK are generally required to give staff members a right to vote for the board of managers at the head of corporate governance, such as in the Oxford University Act 1854, or the Cambridge University Act 1856.Oxford University Act 1854 ss 16 and 21, Cambridge University Act 1856 ss 5 and 12; cf King's College London Act 1997 s 15, though since amended. Discussed in E McGaughey, 'Votes at Work in Britain: Shareholder Monopolisation and the 'Single Channel' (2016) ssrn.com In addition to national rules, under the European Company Statute, businesses that reincorporate as a Societas Europaea may opt to follow the Directive for employee involvement.See Employee Involvement Directive 2001/86/EC An SE may have a two-tiered board, as in German companies, where shareholders and employees elect a supervisory board that in turn appoints a management board responsible for day-to-day running of the company. Or an SE can have a one tiered board, as every UK company, and employees and shareholders may elect board members in the desired proportion.See generally, PL Davies, 'Workers on the Board of the European Company?' (2003) 32(2) Industrial Law Journal 75 An \\"SE\\" can have no fewer employee participation rights than what existed before, but for a UK company, there is likely to have been no participation in any case. In the 1977 Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy(1977) Cmnd 6706; see also Lord Donovan, Report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers' Associations (1965‚Äì1968) Cmnd 3623, ¬ß¬ß997-1006, where the minority favoured worker directors in principle. the Government proposed, in line with the new German Codetermination Act 1976, and mirroring an EU Draft Fifth Company Law Directive, that the board of directors should have an equal number of representatives elected by employees as there were for shareholders. But reform stalled, and was abandoned after the 1979 election.See KW Wedderburn, 'Employees, Partnership and Company Law' [2002] 31(2) Industrial Law Journal 99, a minor duty that could not be legally enforced was CA 1985 s 309, requiring directors to act in shareholders and employees' interests, now reflected in CA 2006 s 172 Despite successful businesses like the John Lewis Partnership and Waitrose that are wholly managed and owned by the workforce, voluntary granting of participation is rare. Many businesses run employee share schemes, particularly for highly paid employees; however, such shares seldom compose more than a small percentage of capital in the company, and these investments entail heavy risks for workers, given the lack of diversification.Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 s 31, and PJ Purcell, 'The Enron Bankruptcy and Employer Stock in Retirement Plans' (11 March 2002) CRS Report for Congress =Directors' duties= Directors appointed to the board form the central authority in UK companies. In carrying out their functions, directors (whether formally appointed, de facto, or \\"shadow directors\\"See Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd [1994] BCC 161; CA 2006 s 251; a shadow director is typically a bank or a dominant shareholder, according to whose directions a director is accustomed to act.) owe a series of duties to the company.See Percival v Wright [1902] Ch 401, Peskin v Anderson [2001] 2 BCLC 1 and CA 2006 s 170; directors do not, generally, owe duties to shareholders or any other group directly. But duties may arise in tort, Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 830. Also, when approaching insolvency directors may owe duties to creditors, e.g. West Mercia Safetywear Ltd v Dodd [1988] BCLC 250 and Colin Gwyer and Associates Ltd v London Wharf (Limehouse) Ltd [2003] 2 BCLC 153. There are presently seven key duties codified under the Companies Act 2006 sections 171 to 177, which reflect the common law and equitable principles. These may not be limited, waived or contracted out of, but companies may buy insurance to cover directors for costs in the event of breach.CA 2006 ss 232-235; while a director may not have to pay for breach of duties, they will not be able to avoid negative publicity and possibly appearing in court should the insurance company choose to contest the claim. The remedies for breaches of duty were not codified, but follow common law and equity, and include compensation for losses, restitution of illegitimate gains and specific performance or injunctions. The first director's duty under section 171 is to follow the company's constitution, but also only exercise powers for implied \\"proper purposes\\". Prior proper purpose cases often involved directors plundering the company's assets for personal enrichment,e.g. Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Maxwell (No 2) [1993] BCLC 814 or attempting to install mechanisms to frustrate attempted takeovers by outside bidders,e.g. Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd [1967] Ch 254 and Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd [1974] AC 832 such as a poison pill.e.g. Criterion Properties plc v Stratford UK Properties LLC [2004] UKHL 28; nb the UK Takeover Code Rule 21 voids any measure, without shareholder approval, with the effect of frustrating a takeover bid. This is reflected in the Takeover Directive 2004/25/EC, art 9(2). Such practices are improper, because they go beyond the reason for which directors were delegated their power. The all-important duty of care is found in section 174. Directors must display the care, skill and competence that is reasonable for somebody carrying out the functions of the office, and if a director has any special qualifications an even higher standard will be expected. However, under section 1157 courts may, if directors are negligent but found to be honest and ought to be excused, relieve directors from paying compensation. The \\"objective plus subjective\\" standard was first introduced in the wrongful trading provision from the Insolvency Act 1986,For the old and abandoned approach of the pure subjective standard, see Re Cardiff Savings Bank [1892] 2 Ch 100; In re Brazilian Rubber Plantations and Estates Ltd [1911] 1 Ch 425; Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co [1925] Ch 407 and applied in Re D'Jan of London Ltd.[1994] 1 BCLC 561 The liquidator sought to recover compensation from Mr D'Jan, who failing to read an insurance policy form, did not disclose he was previously the director of an insolvent company. The policy was void when the company's warehouse burnt down. Hoffmann LJ held Mr D'Jan's failure was negligent, but exercised discretion to relieve liability on the ground that he owned almost all of his small business and had only put his own money at risk. The courts emphasise that they will not judge business decisions unfavourably with the benefit of hindsight,See Lord Hardwicke LC in The Charitable Corporation v Sutton (1742) 26 ER 642 and Lord Wilberforce in Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821 however simple procedural failures of judgment will be vulnerable. Cases under the Company Director Disqualification Act 1986, such as Re Barings plc (No 5) show that directors will also be liable for failing to adequately supervise employees or have effective risk management systems, as where the London directors ignored a warning report about the currency exchange business in Singapore, where a rogue trader caused losses so massive that it brought the whole bank into insolvency. The duty to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest for fiduciaries has been engrained in law since the financial crisis following the South Sea Bubble of 1719. The central equitable principle applicable to directors is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest,See Boardman v Phipps [1966] UKHL 2 without disclosure to the board or seeking approval from shareholders. This core duty of loyalty is manifested firstly in section 175 which specifies that directors may not use business opportunities that the company could without approval. Shareholders may pass a resolution ratifying a breach of duty, but under section 239 they must be uninterested in the transaction. This absolute, strict duty has been consistently reaffirmed since the economic crisis following the South Sea Bubble in 1719.See Keech v Sandford (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61, Whelpdale v Cookson (1747) 1 Ves Sen 9; 27 ER 856, Ex parte James [1803-13] All ER Rep 7, Parker v McKenna (1874) LR 10 Ch App 96 and Bray v Ford [1896] AC 44 For example, in Cook v Deeks,[1916] 1 AC 554, [1916 UKPC 10] (PC) three directors took a railway line construction contract in their own names, rather than that of their company, to exclude a fourth director from the business. Even though the directors used their votes as shareholders to \\"ratify\\" their actions, the Privy Council advised that the conflict of interest precluded their ability to forgive themselves. Similarly, in Bhullar v Bhullar,[2003] EWCA Civ 424 a director on one side of a feuding family set up a company to buy a carpark next to one of the company's properties. The family company, amidst the feud, had in fact resolved to buy no further investment properties, but even so, because the director failed to fully disclose the opportunity that could reasonably be considered as falling within the company's line of business, the Court of Appeal held he was liable to make restitution for all profits made on the purchase. The duty of directors to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest also exists after a director ceases employment with a company, so it is not permissible to resign and then take up a corporate opportunity, present or maturing, even though no longer officially a \\"director\\".e.g. Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley [1972] 1 WLR 443, CMS Dolphin Ltd v Simonet [2001] 2 BCLC 704, In Plus Group Ltd v Pyke [2002] EWCA Civ 370, and Foster Bryant Surveying Ltd v Bryant [2007] EWCA Civ 200 The purpose of the no conflict rule is to ensure directors carry out their tasks like it was their own interest at stake. Beyond corporate opportunities, the law requires directors accept no benefits from third parties under section 176, and also has specific regulation of transactions by a company with another party in which directors have an interest. Under section 177, when directors are on both sides of a proposed contract, for example where a person owns a business selling iron chairs to the company in which he is a director,See Aberdeen Railway Co v Blaikie Brothers (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 it is a default requirement that they disclose the interest to the board, so that disinterested directors may approve the deal. The company's articles could heighten the requirement, say, to shareholder approval.See CA 2006 s 180(1)(b) and Imperial Mercantile Credit Association v Coleman (1871) LR 6 Ch App 558, Costa Rica Railway Company v Forwood [1901] 1 Ch 746, Motivex v Bulfield Ltd [1988] BCLC 104, 117 and Boulting v ACTAT [1963] 2 QB 606, 636 If such a self dealing transaction has already taken place, directors still have a duty to disclose their interest and failure to do so is a criminal offence, subject to a ¬£5000 fine.CA 2006 ss 182-183 While such regulation through disclosure hovers with a relatively light touch, self dealing rules become more onerous as transactions become more significant. Shareholder approval is requisite for specific transactions with directors, or connected persons,Under CA 2006 ss 252-254, a \\"connected person\\" includes family members, and companies, partnerships and trusts where the director has a large stake. when the sum of money either exceeds 10% of the company and is over ¬£5000, or is over ¬£100,000 in a company of any size. Further detailed provisions govern loaning money.See CA 2006 ss 197-214 On the question of director remuneration where the conflict of interest appears most serious, however, regulation is again relatively light. Directors pay themselves by default,e.g. Model Articles, art 22, and cf Guinness plc v Saunders [1990] 2 AC 663 but in large listed companies have pay set by a remuneration committee of directors. Under section 439, shareholders may cast a vote on remuneration but this \\"say on pay\\", as yet, is not binding. Finally, under section 172 directors must \\"promote the success of the company\\". This somewhat nebulous provision created significant debate during its passage through Parliament, since it goes on to prescribe that decisions should be taken in the interests of members, with regard to long term consequences, the need to act fairly between members, and a range of other \\"stakeholders\\", such as employees,cf CA 1985 s 309, which stipulated that shareholders and employees interests had to be considered. No cases were ever brought under this provision. Older cases such as Hutton v West Cork Railway Co (1883) 23 Ch D 654 and Parke v Daily News Ltd [1962] Ch 927 suggested directors of insolvent companies could not protect employees, though this had been reversed by statute, IA 1986 s 187 and CA 2006 s 247 (Power to make provision for employees on cessation or transfer of business) suppliers, the environment, the general community,CA 2006 s 172(1)(a)-(f) and creditors.CA 2006 s 172(3) Many groups objected to this \\"enlightened shareholder value\\" model, which in form elevated the interests of members, who are invariably shareholders, above other stakeholders. However, the duty is particularly difficult to sue upon since it is only a duty for a director to do what she or \\"he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company\\".CA 2006 s 172(1) Proof of subjective bad faith toward any group being difficult, directors have the discretion to balance all competing interests, even if to the short term detriment of shareholders in a particular instance. There is also a duty under section 173 to exercise independent judgment and the duty of care in section 174 applies to the decision making process of a director having regard to the factors listed in section 172, so it remains theoretically possible to challenge a decision if made without any rational basis.cf Regentcrest plc v Cohen [2001] 2 BCLC 80 Only registered shareholders, not other stakeholders without being members of the general meeting, have standing to claim any breach of the provision. But section 172's criteria are useful as an aspirational standard because in the annual Director's Report companies must explain how they have complied with their duties to stakeholders.CA 2006 s 419 Also, the idea of whether a company's success will be promoted is central when a court determines whether a derivative claim should proceed in the course of corporate litigation. =Corporate litigation= Litigation among those within a company has historically been very restricted in UK law. The attitude of courts favoured non-interference. As Lord Eldon said in the old case of Carlen v Drury,(1812) 1 Ves & B 154, 158 \\"This Court is not required on every Occasion to take the Management of every Playhouse and Brewhouse in the Kingdom.\\" If there were disagreements between the directors and shareholders about whether to pursue a claim, this was thought to be a question best left for the rules of internal management in a company's constitution, since litigation could legitimately be seen as costly or distracting from doing the company's real business. The board of directors invariably holds the right to sue in the company's name as a general power of management.e.g. Model Articles, art 3 So if wrongs were alleged to have been done to the company, the principle from the case of Foss v Harbottle,(1843) 67 ER 189 was that the company itself was the proper claimant, and it followed that as a general rule that only the board could bring claims in court. A majority of shareholders would also have the default right to start litigation,cf Alexander Ward v Samyang [1975] 2 All ER 424 and Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London & Suffolk Properties Ltd [1989] BCLC 100 but the interest a minority shareholder had was seen as relative to the wishes of the majority. Aggrieved minorities could not, in general, sue. Only if the alleged wrongdoers were themselves in control, as directors or majority shareholder, would the courts allow an exception for a minority shareholder to derive the right from the company to launch a claim. Derivative claims are used by shareholders against directors alleged to have breached their duties of care or loyalty, exemplified in current litigation against BP plc executives for losses connected to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill catastrophe. In practice very few derivative claims were successfully brought, given the complexity and narrowness in the exceptions to the rule in Foss v Harbottle. This was witnessed by the fact that successful cases on directors' duties before the Companies Act 2006 seldom involved minority shareholders, rather than a new board, or a liquidator in the shoes of an insolvent company, suing former directors. The new requirements to bring a \\"derivative claim\\" are now codified in the Companies Act 2006 sections 261‚Äì264.For highly instructive comparison in the US, see Joy v North, 692 F 2d 880 (1981). Another model for a derivative claim in the German Aktiengesetz ¬ß 148, whereby 1% of shareholders, or those holding at least ‚Ç¨100,000 in shares, can bring a claim. Section 260 stipulates that such actions are concerned with suing directors for breach of a duty owed to the company. Under section 261 a shareholder must, first, show the court there is a good prima facie case to be made. This preliminary legal question is followed by the substantive questions in section 263. The court must refuse permission for the claim if the alleged breach has already been validly authorised or ratified by disinterested shareholders,See CA 2006 s 239, stipulating that a breach of duty can only be ratified by disinterested shareholders. It also appears that disinterested shareholders would not, however, be competent to ratify fraudulent behaviour, contrary to public policy. or if it appears that allowing litigation would undermine the company's success by the criteria laid out in section 172. If none of these \\"negative\\" criteria are fulfilled, the court then weighs up seven \\"positive\\" criteria. Again it asks whether, under the guidelines in section 172, allowing the action to continue would promote the company's success. It also asks whether the claimant is acting in good faith, whether the claimant could start an action in her own name,CA 2006 s 263(3) whether authorisation or ratification has happened or is likely to, and pays particular regard to the views of the independent and disinterested shareholders.CA 2006 s 263(4), and see Smith v Croft (No 2) [1988] Ch 114 This represented a shift from, and a replacement of,The pre-2006 case law may still be indicative of the present law, however since according to CA 2006 s 260(2) a claim can only be brought \\"under this Chapter\\", the sole rules for derivative actions are contained in ss 260-264. the complex pre-2006 position, by giving courts more discretion to allow meritorious claims. Still, the first cases showed the courts remaining conservative.e.g. Mission Capital plc v Sinclair [2008] EWHC 1339 (Ch) and Franbar Holdings Ltd v Patel [2008] EWHC 1534 (Ch) In other respects the law remains the same. According to Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2),[1975] QB 373 minority shareholders will be indemnified for the costs of a derivative claim by the company, even if it ultimately fails. While derivative claims mean suing in the company's name, a minority shareholder can sue in her own name in four ways. The first is to claim a \\"personal right\\" under the constitution or the general law is breached.e.g. Pender v Lushington (1877) 6 Ch D 70, cf Macdougall v Gardiner (1875) 1 Ch D 13 If a shareholder brings a personal action to vindicate a personal right (such as the right to not be misled by company circularsSee Prudential Assurance v Newman Industries Ltd [1982] Ch 204. The duty to not mislead arises from the law of tort, and negligent misstatement.) the principle against double recovery dictates that one cannot sue for damages if the loss an individual shareholder suffers is merely the same as will be reflected in the reduction of the share value. For losses reflective of the company's, only a derivative claim may be brought.See further, Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1, Giles v Rhind [2002] EWCA Civ 1428, Gardner v Parker [2004] 2 BCLC 554 The second is to show that a company's articles were amended in an objectively unjustifiably and directly discriminatory fashion. This residual protection for minorities was developed by the Court of Appeal in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd,[1900] 1 Ch 656 where Sir Nathaniel Lindley MR held that shareholders may amend a constitution by the required majority so long as it is \\"bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole.\\" This constraint is not heavy, as it can mean that a constitutional amendment, while applying in a formally equal way to all shareholders, has a negative and disparate impact on only one shareholder. This was so in Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd,[1951] Ch 286 where the articles were changed to remove all shareholders' pre-emption rights, but only one shareholder (the claimant, Mr Greenhalgh, who lost) was interested in preventing share sales to outside parties.See also, Brown v British Abrasive Wheel Co [1919] 1 Ch 290, Sidebottom v Kershaw, Leese & Co Ltd [1920] 1 Ch 154, Dafen Tinplate Co Ltd v Llanelly Steel Co (1907) Ltd [1920] 2 Ch 124, Shuttleworth v Cox Bros and Co (Maidenhead) [1927] 1 Ch 154, Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw [1940] AC 701 and Citco Banking Corporation NV v Pusser's Ltd [2007] UKPC 13 This slim set of protections for minority shareholders was, until 1985, complemented only by a third, and drastic right of a shareholder, now under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(g), to show it is \\"just and equitable\\" for a company to be liquidated. In Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd,[1973] AC 360 Lord Wilberforce held that a court would use its discretion to wind up a company if three criteria were fulfilled: that the company was a small \\"quasi-partnership\\" founded on mutual confidence of the corporators, that shareholders participate in the business, and there are restrictions in the constitution on free transfer of shares. Given these features, it may be just and equitable to wind up a company if the court sees an agreement just short of a contract, or some other \\"equitable consideration\\", that one party has not fulfilled. So where Mr Ebrahmi, a minority shareholder, had been removed from the board, and the other two directors paid all company profits out as director salaries, rather than dividends to exclude him, the House of Lords regarded it as equitable to liquidate the company and distribute his share of the sale proceeds to Mr Ebrahimi. The most numerous type of case in company litigation involves unfair prejudice petitions in closely held businesses. The drastic remedy of liquidation was mitigated significantly as the unfair prejudice action was introduced by the Companies Act 1985. Now under the Companies Act 2006 section 996, a court can grant any remedy, but will often simply require that a minority shareholder's interest is bought out by the majority at a fair value. The cause of action, stated in section 994, is very broad. A shareholder must simply allege they have been prejudiced (i.e. their interests as a member have been harmed) in a way that is unfair. \\"Unfairness\\" is now given a minimum meaning identical to that in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd. A court must at least have an \\"equitable consideration\\" to grant a remedy. Generally this will refer to an agreement between two or more corporators in a small business that is just short of being an enforceable contract, for the lack of legal consideration. A clear assurance, on which a corporator relies, which would be inequitable to go back on, would suffice, unlike the facts of the leading case, O'Neill v Phillips.[1999] 1 WLR 1092 Here Mr O'Neill had been a prodigy in Mr Phillips' asbestos stripping business, and took on a greater and greater role until economic difficulties struck. Mr O'Neill was then demoted, but claimed that he should be given 50 per cent of the company's shares because negotiations had started for this to happen and Mr Phillips had said one day it might. Lord Hoffmann held that the vague aspiration that it \\"might\\" was not enough here: there was no concrete assurance or promise given, and so no unfairness in Mr Phillips' recanting. Unfair prejudice in this sense is an action not well suited to public companies,See Re Blue Arrow plc [1987] BCLC 585 when the alleged obligations binding the company were potentially undisclosed to public investors in the constitution, since this would undermine the principle of transparency. However it is plain that minority shareholders can also bring claims for more serious breaches of obligation, such as breach of directors' duties.e.g. Bhullar v Bhullar [2003] EWCA Civ 424 Unfair prejudice petitions remain most prevalent in small companies, and are the most numerous form of dispute to enter company courts.e.g. O'Donnell v Shanahan [2009] EWCA Civ 751 But if to hold directors accountable dispersed shareholders do not engage through voting, or through litigation, companies may be ripe for takeover. Corporate finance and markets London's new central business district, Canary Wharf was formerly a major centre of the world's shipping trade at West India Quay. While corporate governance primarily concerns the general relative rights and duties of shareholders, employees and directors in terms of administration and accountability, corporate finance concerns how the monetary or capital stake of shareholders and creditors are mediated, given the risk that the business may fail and become insolvent. Companies can fund their operations either through debt (i.e. loans) or equity (i.e. shares). In return for loans, typically from a bank, companies will often be required by contract to give their creditors a security interest over the company's assets, so that in the event of insolvency, the creditor may take the secured asset. The Insolvency Act 1986 limits powerful creditors ability to sweep up all company assets as security, particularly through a floating charge, in favour of vulnerable creditors, such as employees or consumers. If money is raised by offering shares, the shareholders' relations are determined as a group by the provisions under the constitution.See Borland‚Äôs Trustee v Steel Brothers & Co Ltd [1901] 1 Ch 279 The law requires disclosure of all material facts in promotions, and prospectuses. Company constitutions typically require that existing shareholders have a pre-emption right, to buy newly issued shares before outside shareholders and thus avoid their stake and control becoming diluted. Actual rights, however, are determined by ordinary principles of construction of the company constitution.See Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd [2009] UKPC 10 A host of rules exist to ensure that the company's capital (i.e. the amount that shareholders paid in when they bought their shares) is maintained for the benefit of creditors. Money is typically distributed to shareholders through dividends as the reward for investment. These should only come out of profits, or surpluses beyond the capital account. If companies pay out money to shareholders which in effect is a dividend \\"disguised\\" as something else, directors will be liable for repayment. Companies may, however, reduce their capital to a lower figure if directors of private companies warrant solvency, or courts approve a public company's reduction. Because a company buying back shares from shareholders in itself, or taking back redeemable shares, has the same effect as a reduction of capital, similar transparency and procedural requirements need to be fulfilled. Public companies are also precluded from giving financial assistance for purchase of their shares, for example through a leveraged buyout, unless the company is delisted and or taken private. Finally, in order to protect investors from being placed at an unfair disadvantage, people inside a company are under a strict duty to not trade on any information that could affect a company's share price for their own benefit. =Debt finance= *Corporate bonds to raise capital, determined by contract *Priorities on insolvency through security, IA 1986 ss 40, 115, 175, 176A, 386, Sch 6 and SI 2003/2097 *Fixed charge and floating charge, Re Spectrum Plus Ltd [2005] UKHL 41 *Registration of charges, CA 2006 ss 738, 860-877 =Equity finance= Companies limited by shares also acquire finance through 'equity' (a synonym for the share capital). Shares differ from debt in that shareholders rank last in insolvency. The main justification for shareholders' residual claim is that, unlike many creditors (though not large banks) they are capable of diversifying their portfolio. Taxation of profits on shares can also be treated differently with a different tax rate (under the Income Tax Act 2007) to capital gains tax on debt (which falls under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). This makes the distinction between shares and debt important. In principle, all forms of debt and equity arise from contractual arrangements with a company, and the rights which attach are a question of construction.Birch v Cropper (1889) 14 App Cas 525, preferential shareholders presumed to be entitled to distribution on winding up like other shareholders, as constitution did not say otherwise. Alliance Perpetual Building Society v Clifton [1962] 1 WLR 1270, whether shares are ordinary or preference shares. For instance, in Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd the House of Lords held that when the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was passed, preferential shareholders were entitled to no extra, special share of assets upon winding up: construction of the terms of the shares entitled them to extra dividends, but without special words to the contrary, shareholders were presumed equal otherwise.[1949] UKHL 3 For anyone to become a member of a company under the Companies Act 2006 section 33, the contract for shares must simply manifest the intention to do so.Borland‚Äôs Trustee v Steel Brothers & Co Ltd [1901] 1 Ch 279, per Farwell J, 'A share is the interest of a shareholder in the company measured by a sum of money, for the purpose of liability in the first place, and of interest in the second, but also consisting of a series of mutual covenants entered into by all the shareholders inter se in accordance with s 16 of the Companies Act, 1862. The contract contained in the articles of association is one of the original incidents of the share.' However, beyond this, the dividing line between shares and debt is more a matter of standard practice than law.cf CMAR 2008 Sch 1 para 22 and Sch 3 para 43 It is legally possible to become a member of the company without being a shareholder, simply by being accepted and registered on the members' register.CA 2006 ss 112-113 It is also possible to be a shareholder without being a member immediately.CA 2006 s 779, by having a warrant, entitling a holder to shares on delivery, or a letter of allotment, but not yet being on the register. It is standard practice that shareholders have one vote per share,CA 2006 s 284, one share gets one vote, subject to the articles but occasionally shareholders (particularly those with preferential dividend rights) do not have votes, and debt holders and others may have votes without having shares. It is even possible for creditors to contract to be subordinated behind shareholders in insolvency ‚Äì it is just unlikely, and strongly discouraged by the regulatory framework. Shares are also presumed to be transferable to other people, although like other rights, the right to trade is subject to the company‚Äôs constitution.CA 2006 s 544 Modern portfolio theory suggests a diversified portfolio of shares and other asset classes (such as debt in corporate bonds, treasury bonds, or money market funds) will realise more predictable returns if there is prudent market regulation. To give people shares initially there is formally a two step process. First, under CA 2006 section 558, shares must be \\"allotted\\", or created in favour of a particular person. Second, shares are \\"issued\\" by being \\"transferred\\" to a person. In practice, because shares are not usually 'bearer shares' (i.e. the share is a physical piece of paper), the \\"transfer\\" simply means that the person‚Äôs name is entered on the register of members.CA 2006 ss 112-114 Under CA 2006 sections 768 and 769, a certificate that evidences the share issue should be given by the company within two months. In a typical company constitution, directors are entitled to issue shares as part of their general management rights,CMAR 2008 Schs 1 and 3 para 3 although they have no power to do so outside the constitution. An authorisation must state the maximum number of allottable shares and the authority can only last for five years.CA 2006 ss 549-551 The main reason to control directors' power over share allotments and issues is to prevent shareholders' rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, existing shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days to decide whether to buy.CA 2006 s 562(5) There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564‚Äì567, for issuing bonus shares, partly paid shares, and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by special resolution (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570‚Äì571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a 'Statement of Principles' issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors' Pre- emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (2008). This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights on a rolling basis for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a clawback) at no more than 5% of share capital each year.See also Paul Myners, Pre-Emption Rights: Final Report (2005) DTI, .pdf =Market regulation= ;Prospectuses *Listing Directive 2001/34/EC arts 42 ‚Äì 51 *Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ss 74-8 *R v International Stock Exchange, ex parte Else [1993] QB 534 *Prospectus Directive 2003/71/EC, amending the Listing Directive *Transparency for Listed Companies Directive 2004/109/EC *Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Part VI *Derry v Peek (1889) L R 14 App Cas 337 ;Insider dealing *Criminal Justice Act 1993 ss 52-64 crime of insider trading *Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 s 397 (criminal provision on misleading information) s 118 (civil wrong of market abuse, no false or misleading information for participants in secondary trading markets), s 119 (FSA Code of Market Conduct), s 120 (legitimate circulation of price sensitive information, e.g. compliance with listing and takeover rules) *Directive 2003/6/EC on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) and its implementing Directive 2003/124/EC on the definition and public disclosure of inside information and the definition of market abuse *Re an Inquiry under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 [1988] 1 AC 660 *Rigby and Bailey v R [2006] 1 WLR 306 =Accounts and auditing= *Enron and Sarbanes‚ÄìOxley Act of 2002 *Companies Act 2006 ss 495‚Äì497, true and fair view of company in accounts. *UK Corporate Governance Code, audit committees *Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK) *Chartered Institute of Management Accountants *British qualified accountants *Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC *Directive 84/253/EEC, art 24 *International Accounting Standards Board *Auditing Practices Board *Companies Act 2006 ss 532‚Äì536, auditor liability *Re Kingston Cotton Mill Co (No 2) [1896] 2 Ch 279 *Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co [1951] 2 KB 164 *Formento (Stirling Area) Ltd v Selsdon Fountain Pen Co Ltd [1958] 1 WLR 45, Denning LJ *Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 *Morgan Crucible Co v Hill Samuel Bank Ltd [1991] 1 Ch. 259 *Galoo Ltd v Bright Grahame Murray [1994] 1 WLR 1360 *South Australia Asset Management Co v York Montague [1997] AC 191 =Mergers and acquisitions= The market for corporate control, where parties compete to buy controlling stakes in companies, is seen by some as an important, although perhaps limited, mechanism for the board of directors' accountability. Because individual shareholders may not be as likely to act collectively as a majority shareholder, the threat of a takeover when a company share price drops, heightens the prospect that a director is removed from office by an ordinary resolution under CA 2006 section 168. Since 1959 the UK has taken the approach that directors, particularly of public companies, should do nothing with the effect of frustrating a takeover bid, unless shareholders approve it by a majority at the time of the takeover. Rule 21 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers consolidates this now.For an historical overview of the Takeover Panel's background and the non-frustration principle, see J Armour and DA Skeel Jr., 'Who Writes the Rules for Hostile Takeovers, and Why? ‚Äì The Peculiar Divergence of US and UK Takeover Regulation' (2007) 95 Georgetown Law Journal 1727 Typical takeover defence tactics, routinely found in US corporate law, led by Delaware, include issuing extra shares to everyone but a takeover bidder to dilute their stake unless the bidder has the board's consent to buy shareholders' shares (a \\"poison pill\\"), paying a takeover bidder to go away (\\"greenmail\\"), merely selling a key company asset to a friendly third party, or engaging in large share buyback schemes. In the US, defensive tactics must merely be employed in good faith, and be proportionate to the threat posed with regard to factors like the offer price, timing and effect on the company's stakeholders.See Cheff v. Mathes, 41 Del. Ch. 494, 199 A.2d 548 (S. Ct. 1964), Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co. 493 A.2d 946 (Del. 1985) and Paramount Communications, Inc. v. Time Incorporated, Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) ¬∂ 94,514; aff'd 571 A.2d 1140 (Del. 1989) Moreover, Delaware directors can often only be removed for a \\"good reason\\" (fought out in court) with a board classified into directors a third of whom will be removable in any given year.See DGCL ¬ß141(k) This makes hostile takeovers very difficult, unless a bidder promises the incumbent board large golden parachutes in return for their consent. After much debate, the EU's newly implemented Takeover Directive decided to leave member states the option under articles 9 and 12 of whether to mandate that boards remain \\"neutral\\".Takeover Directive 2004/25/EC arts 9(2) and 12 UK directors, like those at Cadbury facing the takeover from Kraft,See L Lucas and A Rappeport, 'Mergers and acquisitions: A bitter taste' (23 May 2011) Financial Times. When Kraft broke public promises to keep 500 jobs in the Somerdale plant it was criticsed by the Takeover Panel. are unable to use corporate powers to block takeover bids and enrich themselves, but this potentially leaves employees vulnerable to job cuts, or reductions in environmental or ethical standards. Even with the UK's non-frustration principle directors always still have the option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that the bidder may have ulterior motives that are bad for the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid,See Gething v Kilner [1972] 1 All ER 1166 but not merely recommend the highest offer.Re a Company No. 008699 of 1985 [1986] BCLC 383 The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd[1967] Ch 254 the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring the bidder would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power to issue shares creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict.Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821, per Lord Wilberforce The result is that even though directors may wish to protect employees and stakeholders from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable notice, dismissal only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996.ERA 1996 ss 86, 94 and 135 Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006TUPER 2006 SI 2006/246 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given. The Takeover Panel's Code, an example of principles based self-regulation, requires equal treatment and good information for shareholders, including consideration of the effects on employees. Beyond rules restricting takeover defences, a series of rules are in place to partly protect, and partly impose obligations on minority shareholders. Under CA 2006 section 979 when a takeover bidder has already acquired 90 per cent of a company's shares it can \\"squeeze out\\" or compulsorily purchase the minority's shares at the same price per share as paid for the rest of the takeover. Only if a court determines that price is \\"manifestly unfair\\" (and market prices are presumed fair) can the shareholder object,Re Grierson Oldham and Adams Ltd [1968] Ch 17 or if the whole arrangement is merely a trick for incumbent shareholders to expropriate a minority they find undesirable,Re Bugle Press Ltd [1961] Ch 270 or it can be shown that shareholders had been given insufficient information to properly evaluate the offer.Fiske Nominees Ltd v Dwyka Diamond Ltd [2002] EWHC 770; 2 BCLC 123 Conversely section 983 allows minority shareholders to require that their stakes are bought out. Further standards apply to listed companies under the Takeover Code. The Code contains six principles for takeover bids. Shareholders in the same class should be equally treated, there must be time for them to adequate information including consequences for employees, the board must act in the company's whole interests not their own, false markets and share prices should not artificially fluctuate, bids should only be announced when bidders can follow through with money, and a bid should not distract the business longer than reasonable. Following on from these principles are 38 rules, designed to flesh out in legal terms the \\"common sense\\" standards embodied in the 6 principles. The Takeover Panel administers the Code, and enforces it. Originally established in 1968 as a private club that self-regulated its members' practices, was held in R (Datafin plc) v Takeover Panel[1987] QB 815 to be subject to judicial review of its actions where decisions are found to be manifestly unfair. Despite a handful of challenges, this has not happened.ex parte Guinness plc [1990] 1 QB 146, the Panel was found to be 'insensitive and unwise' no action.

Osorio was born in Seville, and is thought to have died there. Very little is known of his life. He was a pupil and imitator of Murillo, and it has been suggested that some of the works attributed to the latter were painted by Osorio. We know that he was regarded by Murillo as his friend, that he was a close acquaintance of Juan Garzon, with whom he worked; that he was at one time secretary and later on president of the Academy of Sevillo, and that while in that city he had a high reputation. This reputation, it is said, was somewhat discounted after his death, because it was considered that some of his copies of Murillo's works were so accurate that he should have signed the master's name. It was in fact suggested that two of his copies had been accepted as genuine works by Murillo. On the other hand, these statements are declared by one Spanish author to have been made only with a view of discrediting Osorio. He and Murillo are said to have worked together in the Capuchin church in Cadiz. His principal work was painted for the church of Saint Martin at Madrid, and represents the Prophet Elijah. There are pictures by him in the museums in Cadiz and Seville, the latter dealing with the Order of St. Francis. A work representing St Catherine, which is preserved in Cadiz, is said to have had a special devotion for St. Philip Neri, and to have been buried in the church dedicated to that saint.

Ralph was left 1s. in his father's will in 1761.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24827/?back=,24817,24826&_fromAuth=1 Ralph moved to Bath in around 1761, and settled there until at least 1771, occasionally attending on Gainsborough and his family (including ‚Äì in 1771 ‚Äì his elder daughter Mary, whom Thomas hoped Ralph had cured to a recurring illness which all other doctors had told him was hereditary). He later moved to Reading. His son was captain Isaac Schomberg.

Growing up in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the oldest brother, Alvah, born 1853, was the first to take up photography sometime in the mid-1880s after time spent as a farm laborer. He brought his brother Walter into the profession and together they began taking and selling photographs in southern New England and the Hudson Valley. In 1888 they set up a studio in Turners Falls, Massachusetts, and occasionally employed their youngest sibling, George. In the summers, Walter and George toured, settling in a town for a week or more, taking photographs and selling the prints at three for a dollar. Alvah, on the other hand, ran the Turners Falls studio, staying there until 1894 when his business collapsed, a victim of the Depression of 1893. In 1896 Alvah returned to photography and joined his brothers on the road. They took pictures across New England, particularly in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. They specialized in selling affordable, easily produced photographs, creating a record of the lives of ordinary people, many of whom would never have had a formal studio photograph taken. By 1902 the brothers decided to end their touring life. The last photographs known by Alvah were in 1906 or 1907; he died in Ashfield in 1919. Walter and George moved to other business ventures. George died in 1925, and Walter in 1945. The Howes brothers took more than 20,000 images, many of which were restored in a conservation effort in the early 1980s.

Shown are part of Alexander Calder's red \\"Hats Off\\" and, in the distance, David Wynne's \\"Grizzly Bear\\" (at left). Two other works can be seen in the distance. The Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens is a collection of 45 pieces of outdoor sculpture at the PepsiCo world headquarters in Purchase, New York. The collection includes work from major modern sculptors including Auguste Rodin, Henry Moore, Alexander Calder, and Alberto Giacometti. The collection, which also features works by Henri Laurens, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Richard Erdman, Jean Dubuffet, and Claes Oldenburg, focuses on major 20th-century art. The sculpture \\"gardens\\" mostly consist of park-like landscaping, including lawns, trees, ponds, and fountains, as well as landscaped gardens with a topiary, tended hedges, flower beds and water-lily ponds. Antman, Rachel A., \\"Day Trip: Modern Sculptures, Outdoors And Free\\", article in the \\"Escapes\\" section of The New York Times, September 29, 2006, accessed January 9, 2007 The sculpture collection is meant to \\"exist in harmony on approximately of carefully tended landscape\\", according to a PepsiCo pamphlet about the gardens, and expansion of the collection occurred after the headquarters had been built and the gardens had begun to take shape. The gardens themselves were, in turn, designed with regard to the sculpture in the collection, and all were meant by the former PepsiCo chairman and founder of the gardens, Donald M. Kendall, to help create an atmosphere of \\"stabiity, creativity and experimentation that would reflect his vision of the company\\", according to the pamphlet. Kendall continued to be involved with the collection and the gardens after he stepped down as leader of the company.\\"The Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens\\", a pamphlet distributed by PepsiCo at the Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens Visitors Center, picked up on December 5, 2008 As of May 2017, the gardens are open on weekends from 10 AM to 4 PM. Description of the site The site, built partly on a former polo field, with the enormous, three-story headquarters building in the center, surrounded by bushes, vast lawns, streams on the east and west, gardens and bushes dispersed around the site, and a pond in the back. Parking (with separate lots for employees and visitors) is hidden behind trees, mostly on the east side. From above, the headquarters building is shaped like seven squares, connected by their corners and forming a cross with an inner cross-shaped courtyard, open at the north side (the front of the building, facing Anderson Hill Road). The building's square blocks rise from the ground \\"into low inverted ziggurats\\", according to the pamphlet, with each of the three floors having strips of dark windows topped by strips of tan-white concrete or stone. At the entrance, a long, straight drive leads up to the building. Where the courtyard meets the driveway, the PepsiCo corporate flag flies together with the flag of the United States. A strip of lawn and rows of trees extend down the open, north arm of the cross-like courtyard, ending in the center, where a large fountain with David Wynne's \\"Girl with a Dolphin\\" is surrounded by a wide paved area. The three closed arms each have sunken gardens with trees, bushes and, in the middle arm, a small pond, together with sculptures, none of which are monumental. Surrounding the building, and seen in distant vistas, are monumental sculptures and nearby gardens with small ponds. The vast south lawn allows the viewer to take in the full size of the structure, and the lower ground enhances the height of the building, an effect lessened on the north (entrance) side by trees and a more level approach. Visitor access and nearby art The sculpture garden is open to the public, and a visitor's booth is in operation during the spring and summer, according to the PepsiCo Web site, although a The New York Times article reported that it was open from March to November. When the center is closed, visitors may get a map of the gardens from a security guard at the headquarters entrance. Web page titled \\"PepsiCo: Overview\\" at the PepsiCo Web site, accessed January 9, 2007 No admission is charged for entrance, and parking is free. According to The New York Times, as of September 2006, the sculpture garden is open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., April to October, and from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., November to March. Visitors can take Metro-North commuter trains to White Plains or Rye, and then take a taxi to the headquarters. The No. 12 bus from the White Plains railroad station stops at the headquarters. \\"PepsiCo World Headquarters\\" is a seven-building complex designed by Edward Durrell Stone. Across the street (Anderson Hill Road) from the headquarters, more modern art can be seen at the Neuberger Museum of Art on the campus of Purchase College of the State University of New York.

Kendall, who was chief executive officer of PepsiCo when the company moved in 1970 from Manhattan to the site in suburban Purchase. Kendall \\"sought to create an atmosphere of stability, creativity and experimentation. He envisioned as essential to that ambience a museum without walls, where works of art could be enjoyed by the employees, the community and the public,\\" according to an article in The New York Times. Kendall himself selected the sculptures. When the new site was officially dedicated on October 2, 1970, Kendall said he wanted to create \\"one of the greatest modern sculpture exhibits in the world\\". At the time, Kendall said he wanted the gardens to have works by \\"all of the major sculptors of the modern period.\\"No byline, \\"New PepsiCo Headquarters dedicated in Westchester\\", article, The New York Times, October 2, 1970, retrieved December 14, 2008 The original landscape design was created in the late 1960s just before PepsiCo moved to the property, by E. D. Stone Jr., son of Edward Durell Stone, the architect of the headquarters. The younger Stone had about 6,000 trees from 38 species plus thousands of flowering bulbs planted. Web page titled \\"February 2005 The Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens\\" at the Dig It! magazine Web site, accessed January 9, 2007 Originally, only eight pieces of artwork were in the sculpture garden. Employees liked the idea so much that Kendall decided to enlarge the collection. As late as 1991, after Kendall had stepped down as CEO, he was still overseeing the collection. From 1981 to 1985, landscape designer Russell Page redesigned the gardens to harmonize them with the sculptures. He added intimate gardens and walks. Since 1985, a third landscape designer, Francois Goffinet, has been in charge of garden development. The sculpture garden was closed for renovations from 2012 through 2017. Maintenance In 1991, The New York Times published a feature article on maintenance of the garden. An employee monitors the sculptures with weekly inspections, driving around in a golf cart \\"outfitted with brooms, brushes, a ladder, calipers, thermometers and a can of Pepsi.\\" Nature and pollution can threaten the artwork. In the spring, birds like to nest in a work by Nevelson, chipmunks prefer the mysterious inner spaces of Judith Brown's \\"Caryatid\\", a welded steel sculpture made of automobile parts. At one point, carpenter bees started chewing into Robert Davidson's \\"Totems,\\" a Western red cedar sculpture. Removing bird guano is a constant task. The huge model statue of a bear was a favorite target for some. The piece \\"Grizzly Bear\\" by David Wynne faces harm even from the temperature. \\"When the sun hits that black rock during the day the temperature can go up to 120 degrees on the surface, and drop to 40 degrees at night,\\" according to Douglass Kwart, a freelance objects conservator who was overseeing the conservation program at PepsiCo as of 1991. \\"That change puts the stones through tremendous stress, because of contraction. Water is absorbed into the stone and driven out, absorbed and driven out again.\\" As of 1991, maintenance staff at the garden wrote up a weekly report on each piece of sculpture after observing each for damage.

History of Hancock County, Indiana: its people, industries and institutions History A post office named Kinder was established on the present site of Carrollton (Finly), on or near there, on April 28, 1847. Its name was changed to Carrollton on January 26, 1869. The post office was maintained until September 30, 1905, when it was taken away and mail was delivered by a rural carrier from Fountaintown, two miles (3 km) southeast. Carrollton was then without a post office until October 13, 1912, when it was reestablished under the name of Finly, in honor of Congressman Finly Gray. A rural route from this post office was started on March 1, 1915. Before the completion of the railroad in 1869, the mail was delivered by a star carrier, who made two trips per week between Indianapolis and Rushville, as set forth under the history of mails at New Palestine. The original plat of the town of Carrollton was surveyed by Hiram Comstock, on February 28, 1854, and contained thirty-two lots. The Reverend M.S. Ragsdale platted the only addition to the town on August 23, 1870. The little town has borne more names than any other town in the county. Originally it was known as Kinder. After the name of the post office was changed to Carrollton in 1869, the town was given that name. The railroad and express companies adopted the name of Reedville for their stations. When the post office was reestablished in 1913, the name Finly was added to the list. The residents usually referred to their town as \\"Tailholt,\\" upon which Indiana author James Whitcomb Riley (1849‚àí1916) seized and, with poetic genius, immortalized the town. Geography Finly is located at .

The organization existed in multiple forms throughout the history of the Ethiopian Empire from its foundation in 1270 by Emperor Yekuno Amlak, to the overthrow of the monarchy and Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 by members of the Ethiopian army. Due to the country's position along multiple trade routes and its maintenance of independence against multiple Islamic and colonialist invasions lead to multiple conflicts against numerous major countries including the Ottomans, Egyptians, British, and Italians. European contact with the Ethiopians in the 1500s brought the first firearms to the country although attempts to arm the imperial army with gunpowder weapons did not happen until the early 1800s. The Ethiopians attempted to develop modern weapons internally, but after a British expedition to the country resulted in the death of an emperor and an Ethiopian defeat, the empire increased its importation of weaponry. The method of raising a national army was also altered in the 1800s with a centralized permanent field army being established. Unlike the majority of non-European armies, the Ethiopian army was able to successfully modernize in the late 19th century and saved the country from European colonialism until another Italian invasion in the 1930s. After regaining independence in 1941, the military saw massive modernization programs under the guidance of the British and Americans and served minor roles in international conflicts until internal conflicts diverted Ethiopia's foreign policy. Historical overview=Pre-modernization= In 1306, diplomatic envoys from Ethiopia arrived in Rome seeking diplomatic relations. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias completed the first circumvention of the African continent reaching India and opening relations between the Portuguese and multiple African countries, including Ethiopia. In 1488, Ethiopian diplomats arrived in Lisbon, Portugal and Jesuit missionaries came to Ethiopia where they remained until their expulsion by Emperor Fasilides in 1632. On 9 April 1520, a Portuguese embassy led by Ambassadors Dom Rodrigo de Lima and Mateus, and included missionary Francisco √Ålvares, arrived in Massawa to negotiate with Emperor Dawit II over the possibility of an alliance against Muslim countries. On 21 February 1543, the Portuguese aided the Ethiopians defeat the Adal Sultanate at the Battle of Wayna Daga ending the fourteen year Abyssinian‚ÄìAdal war. In 1557, the Ottoman Empire invaded Ethiopia and conquered Massawa and other areas along the Red Sea coast. The Ottomans would remain in the area until 1863, when Isma'il Pasha became the Governor of the Egypt Eyalet and declared a Khedivate that was later recognized in 1867. By 1875, Isma'il had expanded his control to Berbera and Harar during the Ethiopian‚ÄìEgyptian War, but following his deposition by the British and the Ethiopian victory in the war the areas were returned to their control. In 1884, the Bogos in Eritrea were returned to the Ethiopians through liquidations of Egypt by the British and Harar was conquered by Menelik II in 1886. In 1887, the Sudanese Mahdist State invaded the Gojjam and Begemder provinces as a part of the Mahdist War. From 9 to 10 March 1889, Emperor Yohannes IV met the Mahdists at the Battle of Gallabat where the Mahdists were defeated, but Yohannes IV was fatally wounded and died on 10 March. Due to the instability of the region from the Mahdist invasions the Ethiopians were unable to do anything to prevent the Italian colonization of Eritrea which took access to the Red Sea away from them. The first firearms arrived in Ethiopia arrived during Dawit's reign and aided the Ethiopians against Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's invasion. In 1828, Ras Sabagardis, the chief of the Tigray Province, sent his English servant to Bombay, Egypt, and England with requests for firearms and one hundred light cavalry. In India the servant found a surplus of outdated matchlocks belonging to the East India Company and Foreign Secretary Henry John Temple and the directors of the East India Company approved the transfer of 3,000 matchlocks in 1831. In 1839, Sahle Selassie, the King of Shewa, imported several cannons and was later given a mill to manufacture gunpowder by the French in 1840. British Expedition Sebastopol mortar was an early attempt at creating modern weaponry inside Ethiopia In 1855, Tewodros II became the emperor and had the goal of unifying the Ethiopians into a centralized state in order to establish the country as a regional power. In 1856, he defeated Negus Haile Melekot, who ruled over the semi-autonamous Shewa region, and started military campaigns against the Oromo along the Red Sea coast. During the 1860s, he used European missionaries to work in road construction and on building a siege weapon. Tewodros II also centralized the military by creating a permanent standing army from its historical practice of temporarily raising regional armies to create a national army. He also created a military hierarchy with titles going upward from commanders of ten, fifty, one thousand, and larger amounts of soldiers. Tewodros II also created an arsenal of modern weaponry in Magdala with 11,063 rifles, 875 pistols, 481 bayonets, 83,563 bullets, 15 cannons, 7 mortars, and 55 cannon shells. The Sebastopol, a massive mortar created at the Gafat foundry, was a prized weapon, but when it was used against the British it misfired and was unable to be used. In 1864, Tewodros II imprisoned British consul Charles Duncan Cameron and multiple missionaries and ignored British ultimatums sent ordering his release. The British sent an army, equipped with modern military supplies and artillery, under the leadership of Robert Napier to free Cameron. On 10 April 1868, Ethiopian infantry armed with rifles and spears met the British at the Battle of Magdala and were easily defeated. Tewodros II later committed suicide after negotiations with the British had failed, but the British left after freeing Cameron and the missionaries having no intention of conquering Ethiopia. =Modernization= Ethiopian soldiers at the Battle of Adwa First Italo-Ethiopian War During the latter half of the 19th century the size of the Ethiopian field army rose dramatically. The largest army raised by Tewodros II during his reign was 15,000. In 1873, Emperor Yohannes IV raised an army of 32,000 soldiers, by 1876, he raised an army of 64,000 soldiers, and by 1880, he raised an army of 140,000 soldiers with 40,000 armed with rifles. While serving as the King of Shewa, Menelik II raised 80,000 soldiers in 1878, although only 4,000 had rifles, but by the time of the first war with the Italians he raised an army of 150,000 soldiers with the majority being equipped with modern weapons. In 1879, Alfred Ilg arrived in the court of Menelik, seeking employment similar to Werner Munzinger who had helped Khedive Isma'il Pasha with the modernization of the Khedivate of Egypt, and aided in the modernization of Ethiopia's infrastructure and military. In 1887, the Ethiopian army was estimated to consist of over 145,000 soldiers with 88,000 infantry and 57,000 cavalry. The soldiers were armed with 71,000 firearms and 28,000 breechloaders. On 3 June 1884, the Hewett Treaty was signed between Britain, Egypt and Ethiopia that allowed the Ethiopians to occupy parts of Eritrea and allowed the Ethiopian goods to pass in and out of Massawa duty-free. From the British viewpoint, it was highly undesirable for the French to replace the Egyptians in Eritrea as that would increase the amount of French naval bases on the Red Sea that could interfere with British shipping heading through the Suez Canal, but the British did not want the financial burden of ruling Eritrea so they looked for another country to replace the Egyptians. The Hewett treaty seemed to suggest that the land in Eritrea would be given to the Ethiopians as the Egyptians pulled out. After initially encouraging the Emperor Yohannes IV to move into Eritrea to replace the Egyptians, London decided to have the Italians move into Eritrea. In his history of Ethiopia, Augustus Wylde wrote: \\"England made use of King John Emperor Yohannes as long as he was of any service and then threw him over to the tender mercies of Italy...It is one of our worst bits of business out of the many we have been guilty of in Africa...one of the vilest bites of treachery\\". In 1885, the Italians took over Massawa and Beilul and despite protests made by Menelik to Queen Victoria the Italians remained in the area. On 20 October 1887, the Italians and Ethiopians signed a treaty of friendship and alliance where both nations declared themselves allies, and the Italians promised to give weapons to the Ethiopians and to not annex more of their territory. The Treaty of Wuchale was signed on 2 May 1889, and another convention was held on 1 October 1889. The Treaty of Wuchale further expanded diplomatic relations between the countries, but despite the Italians recognizing Menelik as the Emperor of Ethiopia in the treaty the Foreign Affairs ministry sent telegrams to thirteen other countries describing Ethiopia as an Italian protectorate on 11 October 1889. The Ethiopians criticized the Italians as the Amharic and Italian versions of the treaty were not proper translations. The Kingdom of Italy attempted to enforce their version of treaty onto the Ethiopians during the First Italo-Ethiopian War, but were defeated due to military support given by the Russian and French through modern weaponry and supplies. In 1895, Nikolay Leontiev organized the delivery of 5,000,000 cartridges, 30,000 rifles, 5,000 sabers, and a few cannons from the Russians to the Ethiopian army. Leontiev later served as a military adviser at the Battle of Adwa and later organized the first modernized army battalion of the Ethiopian army in February 1899. Count Leontiev is spy or adventurer... Nikolay Stepanovich Leontiev Interlude Prince Regent Haile Selassie in London during his tour of Europe In 1883, the French arrived in modern-day Djibouti and established a protectorate although the border between the French colony and Ethiopia would not be formalized until 1897. On 13 December 1906, the British, French, and Italians signed a Tripartite Treaty regarding economic activities in Ethiopia and also regulated the sale of weapons to the Ethiopians, which had before lacked any, with patrols in the Red Sea to enforce the weapon regulations. In 1920, the French attempted to have the weapons embargo lifted, but the Italians and British refused although the French would smuggle outdated weaponry through French Somaliland. In 1911, around 60,000 stands of arms and 6,000,000 cartridges taken by the Japanese from Port Arthur during the Russo- Japanese War were sold to Ethiopia. In 1905, the Ethiopians signed a weapons treaty with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. On July 27, 1914, the Ethiopians and Austro-Hungarians made an agreement and paid for the transfer of 120 cannons from the Austrians to Ethiopians. However, the following day the Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia starting World War I and preventing the full transfer of the cannons. World War I During World War I the Ethiopian Empire remained neutral, but made attempts to side with the Entente Powers which were stopped by the Italians. Kaiser Wilhelm II attempted to convince the Ethiopians to join the Central Powers. Leo Frobenius and Salomon Hall were sent in attempts to enter Ethiopia, but were arrested in Italian Eritrea. Frederick Wilhelm von Syburg, the German ambassador to Ethiopia, attempted to convince the Ethiopians into joining the war through promises of access to the Red Sea, but was unsuccessful. In 1915, Enderase Haile Selassie offered to give the Entente Powers 200,000 soldiers to aid in the defense of Egypt or to participate in the Middle Eastern theatre against the Ottoman Empire. At the time the Ethiopian army was in possession of 800,000‚Äì1,000,000 rifles produced in Germany and Belgium after 1911. In 1918, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau asked Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando on Selassie's behalf over the acceptance of 2,000 Ethiopian soldiers to fight in the war, but Orlando rejected the offer. Following the Russian Revolution and collapse of the Russian Empire, former imperial military officers came to Ethiopia to train the Ethiopians. Interlude In 1917, Selassie established the Machine Gun Guards under the leadership of G√§br√§ Yohannes Wold√§ M√§dhen, who had served in the British army in Kenya as a NCO. In 1919, veterans of the East African campaign from World War I were assigned to serve in the unit. In 1924, the unit was issued grand uniforms after Selassie's tour throughout Europe and the unit was reorganized as the Imperial Bodyguard in 1928, with 5,000 guards. During the 1920s Selassie sent military officers to be trained by the French at Saint-Cyr and had the members of his imperial bodyguard trained by Belgian military officers. During the Interwar period the majority of the world started disarmament projects, but Ethiopia did not and at one point held the fourth largest army in the world with over 500,000 soldiers behind the Soviet Union, China, and France. In November 1922, Haile Selasssie watched an air show of the British Royal Air Force in the Aden Province. After watching the show Selassie made attempts to create an air force and on 18 August 1929, a Potez 25-A2 was delivered to Addis Ababa and a Junkers W 33c was delivered on 5 September.Harold Marcus, Haile Sellassie I: The Formative Years (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1996), p. 50 In 1928, around 2,000 unemployed German and Austrian men traveled to Ethiopia under the leadership of Herr Wodosch with the promise of receiving three acres of land and a cow after joining the Ethiopian army. In 1931, Emperor Selassie asked the Japanese to accept an ambassador extraordinary delegation to be sent to Japan. The delegation, consisting of Teferi Gebre Mariam, Araya Abeba, and Daba Birrou, left Addis Ababa on September 30, 1931, with a Japanese diplomat and left Djibouti on October 5, to sail to Japan. The delegation toured Japan to inspect the Japanese Army and to learn how Ethiopia could modernize its country in a way similar to the Japanese. The Ethiopian delegation left Japan on December 28, and arrived in Addis Aaba on January 29, 1932. Second Italo-Ethiopian War American propaganda poster during World War II On 5 December 1934, a border skirmish between the Ethiopians and Italians occurred at Welwel where 107 Ethiopians and 21 Italians were killed. The Ethiopians asked for the United States to apply the Kellogg‚ÄìBriand Pact against the Italians, but they refused. The Ethiopian army was in possession of outdated infantry weapons, 10‚Äì11 million rifle cartridges, four tanks, and thirteen planes against the more numerous and technologically advanced Italian Army and air force. The army consisted of 40,000 regular soldiers and 500,000 irregular soldiers all with poor equipment with the nucleus of the army being the 7,000 royal guardsmen trained by Belgium officials. The weapons regulations and embargo that had been applied to Ethiopia since 1906 had hurt the Ethiopians with their army lacking munitions and supplies. Orders were placed for aircraft from Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Germany, but were not delivered before the war started. Shortly before the war started military officials from Belgium and Sweden came to aid in the training of the Ethiopian army. Swedish Major General Eric Virgin helped to train Ethiopian infantry and artillery until he was sent back to Sweden on 1 October 1935, two days before the Italian invasion. In January 1935, a modern military school in Holeta Genet was created with the assistance of the Swedish with the intention of training military officers in modern military techniques over a span of sixteen month classes, but the first class was unable to graduate before the Italian invasion. Nazi Germany gave material support to the Ethiopians with 16,000 rifles, 600 machine guns, 3 airplanes, and 10 million rounds of ammunition as F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler wanted the Italians to be weakened before he attempted the Anschluss with the Federal State of Austria. Fifty foreign mercenaries joined the Ethiopian forces, including Trinidadian pilot Hubert Julian, an official Swedish military mission under Captain Viking Tamm, the White Russian Feodor Konovalov and the Czechoslovak writer Adolf Parlesak. Several Austrian Nazis, a team of Belgian Fascists and Cuban mercenary Alejandro del Valle also fought for Haile Selassie. Many of these officers and volunteers were military advisers, pilots, doctors or supporters of the Ethiopian cause. Fifty mercenaries fought in the Ethiopian army and another fifty people were active in the Ethiopian Red Cross or non-military activities. The Italians later attributed most of the relative success achieved by the Ethiopians to foreigners or ferenghi and the Italian propaganda machine magnified the number to thousands, to explain away the Ethiopian Christmas Offensive of late 1935. On 3 October 1935, 100,000 soldiers of the Italian Army commanded by Marshal Emilio De Bono attacked from Eritrea without prior declaration of war. The Italians used chemical weapons, in violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, effectively against the Ethiopian army, whose uniform consisted of light desert clothing and mostly barefoot soldiers. Chemical weapons were used in multiple battles and against thirteen towns from 22 December 1935 to 7 April 1936. In 1936, Addis Ababa was taken by the Italians and the last battle between the Italians and Ethiopians occurred on 19 February 1937. Shortly before the fall of Addis Ababa to the Italians Haile Selassie had fled from Ethiopia on board the British light cruiser HMS Enterprise (D52). In a memorandum submitted to the Paris Peace Conference in 1946, the Ethiopian government stated that 275,000 soldiers had been killed in action, 78,5000 were killed in hostilities during the occupation from 1936 to 1941, 17,800 women and children killed by the Italian bombings, 30,000 were killed in the reprisal massacre in Addis Ababa in mid-February 1937, 35,000 died in concentration camps, 24,000 people were killed in obedience to orders from summary courts, 30,000 people died after their villages had been destroyed, for a grand total of 760,300 civilian and military deaths as a result of the war and ensuring Italian occupation. In addition to the Italian war crimes in violation of the Geneva Protocol and civilian massacres the Ethiopians engaged in war crimes. Some captured Italian soldiers and Eritrean Ascari were castrated as per Ethiopian military tradition. The Ethiopian army also utilized expanding bullets which had been prohibited by the 1899 Hague Convention. Post‚ÄìWorld War Two On 20 January 1941, Selassie entered Gojjam returning to Ethiopia after five years in exile. On 5 May 1941, Selassie entered Addis Ababa, and the remaining Italian soldiers in the country surrendered by January 1942. Following the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941, Selassie started a campaign to transform the country into a more centralized monarchical state and modernization of the country's military with the ancient military hierarchy being abolished. In 1942, a military treaty was signed between Ethiopia and Britain where the British would provide military missions to assist in training and organizing an Ethiopian army that would be effective at restoring order and for the British to exercise control over the country's main cities and police the capital. Selassie also organized a Territorial Army that would serve to defeat the guerrilla organizations throughout the country, but the army never advanced past policing local areas. The British Military Mission to Ethiopia (BMME) under the leadership of General Stephen Butler aided in the training and rearmament of the Ethiopians. By 1942, the reorganized Ethiopian army was in possession of 250 horses, 2,100 mules, two artillery batteries, an armored car regiment of 205 soldiers, and 148 officers were trained in methods similar to those at the Royal Military College. By 1958, the army was in possession of rifles from the British, Czechoslovak, Italians, and Americans, 500 carbines, 590 machine guns, 432 mortars, 20 old Czechoslovak light tanks and 5 M24 Chaffees, 28 armored cars, 90 field artillery, 12 old antitank weapons, and 120 heavy mortars. The Imperial Bodyguard had 3,100 soldiers spread across seven battalions by 1946, and would continue to be the main focus of the Ethiopian army until an attempt coup by the organization against Selassie in 1960. After the Italian armies were defeated in North and East Africa the British started selling the captured Italian weapons to the Ethiopians, but at high prices resulting in the army limiting its purchases to small arms. In 1944, the Ethiopians rejected arm sales from the British due to price gouging and started buying military supplies from the Americans although the United States could only sell a fraction of the requested supplies. In 1947, the sale of 10,000 outdated rifles was easily approved by the British War Office due to their being over 290,000 tons of them being stored in Egypt. After the Ethiopian- American Mutual Defense Agreement was signed in 1953 the United States sent $3,800,000 worth of small arms, field artillery, and military vehicles to Ethiopia. The budget for defense and internal security was expanded by forty percent. The air force was trained by Swedish officers, a small coastal navy was organized under the supervision of Norwegian naval officers, Israeli advisers trained paratroopers, Indian officers staffed a military school in Harer, and officers in the Ethiopian army were sent to attend schools in the United States, Britain, and Yugoslavia. From 1953 to 1970, the United States gave Ethiopia $147 million in military aid and was the main receipt of all American military aid to Africa. In 1960, the United States made a secret agreement with Ethiopian to help train and equip an army of 40,000 soldiers to fight against the Somali Republic and rebels in Eritrea. The United States was given the Kagnew Station in 1953, where over 3,000 Americans were later sent to staff the naval communications and satellite systems base there. An investigation by the United States Senate in 1970 uncovered the military agreements between Ethiopia and the United States. However, by 1973, the Ethiopians were no longer prioritized by the United States, which decreased its military aid and presence at military bases throughout the country. On 13 December 1960, the Imperial Bodyguard attempted a coup d'√©tat while Selassie was outside of the country. Prince Amha Selassie and twenty cabinet ministers were captured by the coup members, but the main army remained loyal to the emperor. When Selassie returned to Addis Ababa on 17 December, the army defeated the coup. Following the 1960 coup by the Imperial Bodyguard and the threat of an independent Somalia the army was enlarged to over 28,000 soldiers by 1962, and over 30,000 the next year. In 1966, the army had been expanded to over 38,000 soldiers and a five-year plan was started in 1968 to further expand the army to over 46,000 soldiers. Military activity (1950‚Äì1974) Ethiopian soldiers in the Kagnew Battalion during the Korean War In 1941, the British occupied Italian East Africa and placed Eritrea under British Military Administration. In 1947, the treaty officially declaring peace between Italy and the Allies was ratified. It included a clause stating that if the Allies were unable to find a solution on what to do with the former Italian colonies within a year, the matter would be brought to the United Nations General Assembly. On 15 September 1948, the Allies brought the fate of Italy's three colonies in Somalia, Libya, and Eritrea to the General Assembly and on 21 November 1949, it was decided that Eritrea would be given to Ethiopia. On 15 September 1952, the United Nations voted forty six to ten, with four abstaining, in favor of a federation between Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 1955, the Imperial Ethiopian Navy was formed as the country now had access to the Red Sea via Eritrea.Gray, Randal, ed., Conway‚Ä≤s All the World‚Ä≤s Fighting Ships 1947‚Äì1982, Part II: The Warsaw Pact and Non-Aligned Nations, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1983, , p. 304. On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea starting the Korean War. In 1951, three battalions of Ethiopian soldiers were sent, under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonels T√§shom√§ Ergt√§u, Asfaw Andarg√© and Wold√§ Yohannes Sheta, to aid the South Koreans. Following the armistice two more battalions were sent. In 1960, four battalions were sent to join the United Nations forces during the Congo Crisis, but they saw no action. Ethiopia's participation in peacekeeping efforts ended in the 1960s, as the army had to focus on the Eritrean revolts and Somali border skirmishes. Derg In February 1974, the military overthrew the government of Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold. In April, the army arrested twenty five officials on corruption charges and attempted to detain fifty other officials. On 28 June 1974, the Derg, the a committee of low-ranking military officers and enlisted men, was formed. On the same day the army arrested more officials who had been members of the previous government for attempting to prevent reform attempts by Prime Minister Endelkachew Makonnen. The leadership of the military stated that they had no plans to overthrow either Emperor Selassie or Prime Minister Makonnen. However, on 22 July, Makonnen was arrested by the orders of the military. On September 12, 1974, the Derg deposed Emperor Haile Selassie, ending the monarchy which had been established in 1270. The army of the Ethiopian Empire was reorganized into the army of the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia and later into that of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. Following the collapse of the communist dictatorship, the military was reorganized again into the Ethiopian National Defense Force; the navy was eventually disbanded in 1996.

They were large tracts of prairie-like land, with only grass and small bushes. For the first decades of settlement, no one would live on the barrens because they were considered too far from the timber needed to build homes, fires, fences, and other necessities. The barrens were also swept by annual field fires, which would burn off most of the growth. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early nineteenth century, settlers began to discover that because of the fires, the barrens were among the most fertile farmlands in the state, and they quickly filled with landholders. As settlement increased, the settlers were able to stop and prevent the wild fires that hindered forest growth and by the start of the 20th century, much of the barrens that were uninhabited began to grow up in Forrest, as it has remained until modern times.

For most of the 20th century, this genus was merged with the Old World scops owls in Otus, but nowadays it is again considered separately based on a range of behavioral, biogeographical, morphological, and DNA sequence data. Screech owls are restricted to the Americas. Some species formerly placed with them are nowadays considered more distinct (see below for details). The related barn owl does, as well. alt= Description Similar to other owls, the screech owl females are larger than the males of their species. They have a compact size and shape. They are small and agile, and about 7 to 10 inches tall and have a wingspan around 18 to 24 inches. They have prominent, wide-set feather tufts with bright yellow/green eyes. They have different brownish hues with whitish, patterned underside. This coloration helps them get camouflage against the tree bark. Ecology and behavior Screech owls hunt from perches in semiopen landscapes. They prefer areas that contain old trees with hollows; these are home to their prey, which includes insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice, and small birds. Screech owls have a good sense of hearing, which helps them locate their prey in any habitat. They also possess well-developed raptorial claws and a curved bill, both of which are used for tearing their prey into pieces small enough to swallow easily. They usually carry their prey back to their nests, presumably to guard against the chance of losing their meal to a larger raptor. Screech owls are primarily solitary. During the late winter breeding season, however, males make nests in cavities, sometimes reusing abandoned nests of other animals, to try to attract females. The females select their mate based on the quality of the cavity and the food located inside. During the incubation period, the male feeds the female. These birds are monogamous, with biparental care. The young of most screech owls are altricial to semialtricial. Northern screech owls are found in eastern states, such as New Jersey and New York. The screech owls are named for their piercing calls. Their normal territorial call is not a hoot as with some owls, but a trill consisting of more than four individual calls per second given in rapid succession (although the sound does not resemble screeching or screaming). They also have a kind of \\"song\\" used in courtship, and as a duet, between members of a pair. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. The distinctness of many species of screech owls was first realized when vastly differing calls of externally similar birds from adjacent regions were noted. Evolution, taxonomy, and systematics The genus was introduced by German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. The type species is the eastern screech owl (Megascops asio). The evolutionary relationships of the scops and screech owls are not entirely clear. What is certain is that they are very closely related; they may be considered sister lineages which fill essentially the same ecological niche in their allopatric ranges. A screech owl fossil from the Late Pliocene of KansasSpecimen UMMP 50982, a partial left coracoid from Fox Canyon: Ford (1966). (which is almost identical to eastern and western screech owls) indicates a longstanding presence of these birds in the Americas, while coeval scops owl fossils very similar to the Eurasian scops owl have been found at S'Onix on Majorca. The scops and screech owl lineage probably evolved at some time during the Miocene (like most other genera of typical owls), and the three (see below) modern lineages separated perhaps roughly 5 million years ago. Note, no reliable estimate of divergence time is known, as Otus and Megascops are osteologically very similar, as is to be expected from a group that has apparently conserved its ecomorphology since before its evolutionary radiation. Like almost all scops and screech owls today, their common ancestor was in all probability already a small owl, with ear tufts and at least the upper tarsus (\\"leg\\") feathered. However that may be, the hypothesis that the group evolved from Old World stock is tentatively supported by cytochrome b sequence data. The screech owls also have a different placement of the procoracoid (less of an anterior incline) and coracoid bones compared to other New World owls. =The splitting of Otus sensu lato= alt= While late-19th- century ornithologists knew little of the variation of these birds, which often live in far-off places, with every new taxon described a few differences between the Old and New World \\"scops\\" owls became more and more prominent. Namely, the scops owls give a whistling call or a row of high-pitched hoots with fewer than four individual hoots per second. This call is given in social interaction or when the owl tries to scare away other animals. The screech owls, though, are named for their piercing trills of more than four individual notes per second, and as noted above, they also have a kind of song, which is absent in the scops owls. A few other differences are seen, such as brown coloration below being common in scops owls and almost never seen in screech owls, but the difference in vocalizations is most striking. By the mid-19th century, Otus was becoming identified as encompassing more than one genus. First, in 1848, the screech owls were split off as Megascops. Subsequently, the highly apomorphic white-throated screech owl of the Andes was placed in the monotypic genus Macabra in 1854. Gymnasio was established in the same year for the Puerto Rican owl, and the bare-legged owl (or \\"Cuban screech owl\\") was separated in Gymnoglaux the following year; the latter genus was sometimes merged with Gymnasio by later authors. By the early 20th century, the lumping together of taxa had come to be preferred. The third edition of the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) checklist in 1910, placed the screech owls back in Otus. Although this move was never unequivocally accepted, it was the dominant throughout most of the 20th century. In 1988, attempts to resolve this were made by re-establishing all those genera split some 140 years earlier at subgenus rank inside Otus. Still, the diversity and distinctness of the group failed to come together in a good evolutionary and phylogenetic picture, and until the availability of DNA sequence data,t this could not be resolved. In the mid- to late 1990s, preliminary studies of mtDNA cytochrome b across a wide range of owls found that even the treatment as subgenera was probably unsustainable and suggested that most of the genera proposed around 1850 should be accepted. Though some debate arose about the reliability of these findings at first, they have been confirmed by subsequent studies. In 2003, the AOU formally accepted the genus Megascops again. The bare-legged owl was also confirmed as distinct enough to warrant separation in its own genus. Furthermore, the white-throated screech owl was recognized as part of an ancient lineage of Megascops ‚Äì including also the whiskered screech owl and the tropical screech owl, which previously were considered to be of unclear relationships ‚Äì and indeed its call structure is not too dissimilar from the latter. Its distinct coloration, approximated in the southern whiskered screech owl (Megascops trichopsis mesamericanus), is thus likely the result of strong genetic drift. Additionally, a population of the tropical screech owl from northern Colombia has recently been proposed as the Santa Marta screech owl (Megascops gilesi) to the IOC. =Species= alt= Western screech owl (Megascops kennicottii) morph individuals of the tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba) The genus contains 23 species: * Eastern screech owl, Megascops asio * Western screech owl, Megascops kennicottii * Balsas screech owl, Megascops seductus * Pacific screech owl, Megascops cooperi * Whiskered screech owl, Megascops trichopsis * Tropical screech owl, Megascops choliba * West Peruvian screech owl, Megascops roboratus * Koepcke's screech owl, Megascops koepckeae * Bare-shanked screech owl, Megascops clarkii * Bearded screech owl, Megascops barbarus * Rufescent screech owl, Megascops ingens * Cinnamon screech owl, Megascops petersoni * Cloud-forest screech owl, Megascops marshalli * Tawny-bellied screech owl, Megascops watsonii * Middle American screech owl, Megascops guatemalae * Vermiculated screech owl, Megascops vermiculatus * Foothill screech owl, Megascops roraimae * Choc√≥ screech owl, Megascops centralis * Yungas screech owl, Megascops hoyi * Black- capped screech owl, Megascops atricapilla * Long-tufted screech owl, Megascops sanctaecatarinae (construed with the name argentinus) * White-throated screech owl, Megascops albogularis * Santa Marta screech owl, Megascops gilesi ReferencesFurther reading  * Category:Symbols of Hades * Category:Taxa named by Johann Jakob Kaup ","title":"Screech owl"},{"id":"15138525","text":"Ferdinand von Miller (the elder) Ferdinand von Miller (18 October 1813 ‚Äì 11 February 1887) was a German artisan who is noted for his furtherance of bronze founding. Biography Von Miller was born in F√ºrstenfeldbruck. After a sojourn at the academy in Munich and a preliminary engagement at the royal brass foundry, Miller traveled to Paris in 1833, where he learnt from Soyer and Blus the varied technique necessary for bronze working. He also visited England and the Netherlands, and after his return to Munich worked under his teacher and uncle Stiglmayr, whom the Crown Prince Ludwig had induced to devote himself to bronze foundry work and to the establishment of the Munich foundry as a state institution. Miller soon took his uncle's place, and upon the death of the latter was appointed inspector of the workshop. He soon won for it a worldwide reputation, and for himself a fortune and position of influence. The casting of the Bavaria statue (1844‚Äì55) especially brought him fame. Commissions came to him from far and near. He cast the statue of Herder, and the double statue of Goethe and Schiller, for Weimar, and also the figures of Duke Eberhard in Stuttgart, of Berzelius in Stockholm and two Washington monuments, by Mills in Boston and Crawford in Richmond, Virginia. He also cast the gate of the Capitol in Washington. In 1874 Miller was elected to the directorate of the society of art industries. The Munich exhibition of art and crafts in 1876 was reportedly largely Miller's work. He sought to win over artists to a general exhibition of German art in alliance with handicrafts. Drawing rooms, cabinets, boudoirs, sitting rooms and chapels were arranged so as to form in their grouping a whole by having art and trade appliances put into the place for which they were intended. Where this was not possible, a partition or a wall would be placed with picturesque effect in some adjoining room. Miller established a center of exhibition and sale for the society, and procured himself a home especially for the social intercourse of artists and art craftsmen. In 1840 he married Anna P√∂sl (1815‚Äì1890), daughter of the Chancellor of the regional government of Landshut, who bore him 14 children, including Ferdinand Freiherr von Miller, Oskar von Miller and Fritz von Miller. He died in Munich, and was buried in the Alter S√ºdfriedhof in the same city.

Most Pakistani trucks have an augmented rooftop to increase space for decoration. The backs of Pakistani trucks are often intricately decorated. Truck art is a popular form of regional decoration in the Indian subcontinent, with Indian and Pakistani trucks featuring elaborate floral patterns and calligraphy. Pakistani decorated trucks servicing Afghanistan came to be known as jingle trucks by American troops and contractors. \\"Jingle truck\\" origin The term jingle truck comes from United States military slang, coined by servicemen in Afghanistan, although it may date to the British colonial period. The term came to be because of the \\"jingle\\" sound that the trucks make due to the chains hanging from the bumpers of the vehicles. Practice Many trucks and buses are highly customized and decorated by their owners. External truck decoration can cost thousands of dollars. The decoration often contains elements that remind the truck drivers of home, since they may be away from home for months at a time. The art is a mode of expression for the truck drivers. Decoration may include structural changes, paintings, calligraphy and ornamental-decor like mirror work on the front and back of vehicles and wooden carvings on the truck doors. Depictions of various historical scenes and poetic verses are also common. Outfitting is often completed at a coach workshop. Chains and pendants often dangle off the front bumper.Pakistan's Dazzling 'Jingle Trucks' Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (www.rferl.org). June 14, 2017.

Nafees Ahmad Khan, a truck art artist in Indore, is well known throughout India and has been designing one truck every day for over thirty-two years. One of the most prominent truck artists is Haider Ali. Trained by his father from his youth, he first came to international attention in 2002 when he painted a Pakistani truck as part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. =Regional styles= In India, the Delhi- based artist Tilak Raj Dhir states that the slogans he adds to his truck art, which is prevalent throughout the National Capital Region, often change with the socio-political atmosphere. Truck art in Hindi and Urdu is sometimes called Phool Patti.Many local buses in Pakistan are decorated with truck art. In Pakistan, Karachi is a major city centre for truck art, though there are other hubs in Rawalpindi, Swat, Peshawar, Quetta and Lahore. Trucks from Balochistan and Peshawar are often heavily trimmed with wood, while trucks from Rawalpindi and Islamabad often feature plastic work. Camel bone ornamentation and predominance of red colours is commonly seen on trucks decorated in Sindh. Influence Truck art decorates the fa√ßade of business in Peshawar, Pakistan. Truck art has extended beyond the decoration and ornamentation of trucks into other forms and media. =Cars= Though cars are not traditionally decorated in South Asia, there are examples of cars embellished in a truck art style. In 2009, The Foxy Shahzadi, a 1974 VW Beetle decorated in a truck art style, travelled from Pakistan to France in a 25-day journey. In the Indian city of Mumbai, some drivers decorate their taxis in a truck art style. =Fashion= The lively colours of Pakistani trucks have inspired some fashion designers. The Italian fashion company Dolce & Gabbana used truck art-inspired displays in a 2015 campaign.

He was the son of Shams al-Din 'Ali. Biography Nizam al-Din gained the throne of Sistan after his father's death in 1438 or 1439. During his reign he spent a significant amount of time at the court of the Timurids at Herat. Some time after Abu Sa'id's capture of Khurasan in 1458, Nizam al-Din was summoned by the Timurid to Herat. There he was given one of Abu Sa'id's sisters in marriage.Bosworth, p. 460 In 1468 Abu Sa'id undertook a military campaign against the Aq Qoyunlu Turkmen of Azerbaijan. Nizam al-Din participated in this operation, leading a part of the army of Sistan. Ultimately the campaign ended in disaster; both Abu Sa'id and Nizam al-Din captured by the Aq Qoyunlu, who went on to briefly occupy Herat. The Turkmen leader Uzun Hasan imprisoned Nizam al-Din for six months. He eventually released him and restored him as governor of Sistan, while also giving him land grants in parts of Fars and Kerman.Bosworth, p. 462 Ultimately the Timurids under Husayn Bayqarah managed to retake Herat, but Nizam al-Din may also been compelled to pay tribute to Uzun Hasan for a while.Bosworth, pp. 462-3 The last years of Nizam al-Din's rule were marred by internal discord. The malik had grown wary of the power of his commander-in- chief (sipahsalar) Mir Sayyid Ahmad and his five sons, who held several governorships in parts of Sistan. In around 1475 Nizam al-Din led a campaign to assert his authority over the Garmsir region and Makran, with Mir Sayyid Ahmad and his sons participating. When the Mihrabanid army reached the Helmand River Nizam al-Din planned to arrest the sipahsalar and his family, but they were warned about the plot and managed to flee. Mir Sayyid Ahmad and his sons traveled to Herat, where they met with the Timurid Husayn Bayqarah. They managed to convince him to revoke the grant for Nizam al-Din's governorship of Sistan and to give the governorship to Husayn Bayqarah's son Badi' al-Zaman instead.Bosworth, p. 463 Nizam al-Din decided that an attempt to resist in Sistan itself would be futile, since Mir Sayyid Ahmad had a large degree of support in the province. He therefore made his way to the southern frontier region of Sistan, where he commanded the loyalty of several fortresses, and set up his base there. In c. 1478 he was invited by the people of Zirih to return to Sistan, but was repulsed by the forces of Badi' al-Zaman and Mir Sayyid Ahmad. In 1480 the people of Zirih again tried to convince Nizam al-Din to return, but the malik became ill and died. His military commanders then elected his eldest son Shams al-Din Muhammad as his successor. NotesReferences *Bosworth, C.E.

This is achieved primarily through the development and maintenance of a comprehensive statewide emergency management plan. OEM is responsible for coordinating the efforts of the federal government with other state departments and agencies, county and municipal governments and school boards, and with private agencies that have a role in emergency management. Mission The mission of OEM is to minimize the effects of attack, technological and natural disasters upon the people of Oklahoma by preparing, implementing and exercising preparedness plans, assisting local government subdivisions with training for and mitigation of disasters, and by coordinating actual disaster response/recovery operations. Leadership The Department is under the supervision of the Oklahoma Secretary of Safety and Security and under the executive control of the Department's Director. Under Governor Kevin Stitt, Michael C. Thompson is serving as Secretary (since 2011) and Mark Gower is serving as Director (since January 2019). The Director of Emergency Management is appointed by the Governor of Oklahoma with the advice and consent of the Oklahoma Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor. The Director is head of the Department as well as the chief advisor to the Governor on emergency management. Agency Director - Mark Gower Administrative Services Director/Executive Assistant - Sid Smith-McCormick Chief Financial Officer - Sandy Henry Director of Operations - Steve Palladino Recovery Programs Director - Alden Graybill EOC Manager - Putnam Reiter Grants Program Manager - Bonnie McKelvey Public Information Manager - Keli Cain Individual Assistance Officer - Luke Pratt Public Assistance Officer - Mike Teague State Hazard Mitigation Officer - Matthew Rollins Functions  The Department of Emergency Management (OEM) is the lead agency on all matters related to responding to and mitigation threats caused by natural disasters. To perform this function, the Department works closely with the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety, the Oklahoma State Department of Health, the Oklahoma National Guard, and the Oklahoma Office of Homeland Security. During times when the Governor of Oklahoma declares a state of emergency due to natural disasters, all of these agencies report to and receive orders from the Governor through OEM. These relationship only applies however when the state of emergency is from a disaster. During non-disaster time, the Department of Public Safety, which is responsible for general law enforcement of the State through the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, is the Governor's chief public safety agent. OEM reports to the Office of Homeland Security, during emergencies or otherwise, on all matters related to homeland security or an act of terrorism. The State Health Department is the lead agency on disasters caused by the spread of infectious diseases or bioterrorism. The National Guard, under the direction of the Adjutant General of Oklahoma, becomes the lead agency on any matter (emergency management related or otherwise) whenever the Governor so directs or when the Governor declares martial law. History The Department of Emergency Management was originally created as the Department of Civil Defense by legislative action in 1951. Soon after its creation, the Civil Defense agency and the Department of Emergency Resources Management were combined into one unified disaster aid organization, known as the Oklahoma Department of Civil Emergency Management. The Department of Emergency Management was created in 2003 during the term of Governor Brad Henry by the Oklahoma Emergency Management Act of 2003. Today it is the central point of contact for coordination of four closely allied functions: Hazard Mitigation, Community Preparedness, Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery. Programs and Services The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Managements provides two programs for Oklahoma citizens: Individual Assistance/Human Services Program and Public Assistance Program. In addition to these two programs, OEM provides three services to help with mitigation and preparedness for disasters: Safe Schools 101, OK- WARN, and incident hotline. The Individual Assistance Program/Human Services Program is predicated on connecting citizens individually and local/small business owners with OEM. This program guarantees that all local Oklahoma communities are up to date on all services available and technology in all four phases of disaster. In order to simplify this process, OEM uses a process of stages that ensures the most productive way for the program to benefit all communities. The four stages are coordination (connects with organizations), Activation (training), Respond (Plan in place for sustainability after disaster strikes), and Engage (oversight of all operations). In coordination with OEM there are other organizations who help with this program including The American Red Cross, Oklahoma Department of Human Services, and FEMA. The Public Assistance Program is primarily a funding program to ensure that funds are accessible to Oklahoma and local Oklahoma governments from federal funds. These funds can also be provided to nonprofit organizations who participate in disaster relief. The Process starts with FEMA which specifically approves public assistance programs. These programs receive their money either from federal funds or grants. The available funds are given from these programs to the State of Oklahoma, which then distributes the funds to local community applicants (Oklahoma local communities must apply for federal money with reason for aid). Most of these funds are used to rebuild infrastructure damage from disasters. The Safe Schools 101 service is a voluntary option to all schools in Oklahoma that allows for volunteer expert architects and engineers to assess the structure of schools and the possibility for the implementation for safe rooms. This service was implemented by the OEM after the deadly 2013 tornado outbreak that directly affected fifty-four schools in Oklahoma. Oklahoma Weather Alert Remote Notification (OK-WARN) is a weather alert system that specifically was created to benefit the deaf and hard-of-hearing. With the fear of deaf and hard-of- hearing not being able to access knowledge of incoming weather events. OK-WARN provides these Oklahoma citizens with current weather events via specific pagers or email.

He is most notable as a constant attendant at the court of Peter III and Alfonso III of Aragon. He may be the same person as the Peironet who composed poems with Peter III. Salvatge wrote the third piece in a five-piece cycle of sirventes written in Summer 1285. Early in the summer Bernart d'Auriac inaugurated the political debate by coming to the defence of the \\"three kings\\" Philip III of France, Philip of Navarre, and Charles of Valois, who claimed the Crown of Aragon. Under the direction of the French king they invaded Catalonia in the so-called \\"Aragonese Crusade\\". After Peter III of Aragon responded to Bernart, Pere responded to Peter in the short piece Senher, reys qu'enamoratz par. Pere appears to have gotten his nickname from his occupation as a caballero salvaje or cavaller salvatge in the king's house. As such, he acted as messenger and herald. Among his duties was directing the battle cry when the king's armies went to war. Pere is first mentioned by name in 1280 as a juglar del rey (\\"jongleur of the king\\"). In April 1286 he was charged with distributing compensation in precious metal and money to the other jongleurs who had assisted in Peter's coronation (in 1276). He was still alive in June 1287 when Alfonso III ordered proceedings against some men accused of kidnapping Pere's daughter. Sources *Riquer, Mart√≠n de.

The group was one of the first bands signed to Tragic Hero Records. Background=Scapegoat (1999‚Äì2003)= Justin Driscoll, Dan Royer, and Dan Hitselberger began playing together in early 1998. After many months and several vocalists, the trio united with Kit Walters and invited him to be their permanent vocalist, deciding on the band name \\"Scapegoat.\\" After playing together for more than a year, the quartet entered the studio to begin recording tracks for what would become their debut album Two On One. With the successful release of Two on One the group began playing shows in and around the Charlotte-Metro area. During this growing success the band was forced, due to a pre-existing trademark, to change their name from \\"Scapegoat\\" to \\"Sckapegoat\\" to avoid legal action. By 2002, the band had gained a large following and had written much new material for a new album. Released in early 2003, their second album Element of Design was well received in the Charlotte music scene. Element of Design cemented the band as a staple of the Charlotte music scene.Local Band Network - Scapegoat =These Cards We're Dealt (2004)= Just a few months after the release of Element of Design the band entered the studio once again to record These Cards We're Dealt. The album signified a shift in the stylistic approach that Scapegoat brought to their music. With the release of These Cards We're Dealt the band moved away from what they saw as a \\"stagnant music industry\\" and created a whole new genre incorporating the same energy and brutality that Scapegoat was known for with layered melodies and vocal harmonies.Scapegoat - Band Biography and mp3s/songs,Hardcore Music/Emo Music/Screamo Music/Metal Music/Punk Rock Music Band Profile / Emo Music Bands mp3 / Indie Rock Bands - free mp3 music downloads / Stream free Mp3 Audio Files @ Stereokiller.com These Cards We're Dealt was released in early 2004 and has sold close to 10,000 copies since February 2004. 2004 also brought the addition of guitarist Spencer Bensch. In 2005 the band acquired the trademarked name \\"Scapegoat\\" allowing them to resume playing under their original moniker. =Let Our Violins Be Heard and Zombie Dog= With Spencer Bensch added to the line-up, the band entered the studio again to record what would become Let Our Violins Be Heard. Continuing to build on the genre established with These Cards We're Dealt, Let Our Violins Be Heard was also the band's first release on Raleigh based record label Tragic Hero Records on October 22, 2005. The album would eventually garner attention with a national release through Tragic Hero in July 2006.Niner Online - FOUND: Great rock music Re-entering the studio to record new music, the band has taken a decidedly different approach with their latest album, Zombie Dog. Evolving on the same layered melodies and compositions that solidified their fame in their home state, Zombie Dog is a decidedly harder album and was released nationally by Tragic Hero Records on January 22, 2008. In 2009 The band re-released \\"These Cards We're Dealt\\" on Zestone Records in Japan and Tragic Hero (USA). Soon after Scapegoat toured Japan to support the re-release and 2008's Zombie Dog.

She is the Joseph L. Buttenweiser Professor of Social Science in the Department of Anthropology at Columbia University in New York City. She specializes in ethnographic research in the Arab world, and her seven books cover topics including sentiment and poetry, nationalism and media, gender politics and the politics of memory. Early life and education Abu-Lughod's father was the prominent Palestinian academic Ibrahim Abu-Lughod. Her mother, Janet L. Abu- Lughod, n√©e Lippman, was a leading American urban sociologist. She graduated from Carleton College in 1974, and obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 1984.  Career  Lughod's body of work is grounded in long-term ethnographic research in Egypt, and is especially concerned with the intersections of culture and power, as well as gender and women's rights in the Middle East. Between the late 1970s and the mid-1980s, while she was still a graduate student, Lughod spent time living with the Bedouin Awlad 'Ali tribe in Egypt. She stayed with the head of the community, and lived in his household alongside his large family for a cumulative two years. Her first two books, Veiled Sentiments: Honor and Poetry in a Bedouin Society and Writing Women's Worlds, are based on this fieldwork. Both books draw on her experiences living with the Bedouin women and her research into their poetry and storytelling. She explores the way that ghinnawas, songs in a poetic form that she compares to haiku and the blues, express the cultural \\"patterning\\" of the society, especially with regard to the relations between women and men. Abu-Lughod has described a reading group that she attended while teaching at Williams College ‚Äì its other members included Catharine A. MacKinnon, Adrienne Rich, and Wendy Brown ‚Äì as a formative engagement with the field of women's studies and a major influence on these early books. Abu-Lughod spent time as a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study, with Judith Butler, Evelyn Fox Keller, and Donna Haraway. She also taught at New York University, where she worked on a project, funded by a Ford Foundation grant, intended to promote a more international focus in women's studies. Her 2013 book, Do Muslim Women Need Saving? investigates the image of Muslim women in Western society. It is based on her 2002 article of the same name, published in American Anthropologist. The text examines post-9/11 discussions on the Middle East, Islam, women's rights, and media. Abu-Lughod gathers examples of the Western narrative of the \\"abused\\" Muslim women who need to be saved, and explains how the international focus on \\"saving\\" these women perpetuates racist ideas of Muslim societies as barbaric. Abu-Lughod further explains how the narrative of saving Muslim women has been used as a way to justify military interventions in Muslim countries. She deftly questions the motives of feminists who feel that Muslim women should be saved from the Taliban all the while supporting injustices occurring on a structural scale in their own countries.She argues that Muslim women, like women of other faiths and backgrounds, need to be viewed within their own historical, social, and ideological contexts. The book suggests that religion is not the main factor in global inequality, suggesting instead that the most significant sources are poverty and governmental abuses coupled with global tensions. Abu-Lughod's article and subsequent book on the topic have been compared to Edward Said and Orientalism. Abu-Lughod serves on the advisory boards of multiple academic journals, including Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society and Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies. = Awards and honors = In 2001, Abu-Lughod delivered the Lewis Henry Morgan Lecture at the University of Rochester, considered by many to be the most important annual lecture series in the field of anthropology.http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=524051 She was named a Carnegie Scholar in 2007 to research the topic: \\"Do Muslim Women Have Rights? The Ethics and Politics of Muslim Women's Rights in an International Field.\\" She has held research fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, Fulbright, and the Mellon Foundation, among others. An article from Veiled Sentiments received the Stirling Award for Contributions to Psychological Anthropology. Writing Women's Worlds received the Victor Turner Award. Carleton College awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2006.

He is founder and director of the architecture and design firm, Andreas Vogler Studio.  Early life  Andreas Vogler was raised in Basel, Switzerland. After several semesters of studies in Art History and Literature, Vogler worked as an interior designer with Alinea AG in Basel. In 1988‚Äì1994 he studied architecture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule) in Zurich spending one exchange semester at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence (RISD) in the United States and graduated with a diploma project for an energy-independent, pre-fabricated Weather Station on the Weissfluhjoch/Arosa.  Career  In 1995 he worked for Ingenhoven Architects in D√ºsseldorf, and from 1995 to 1996 for Richard Horden Associates, now Horden Cherry Lee Architects in London. Later he became teaching and research assistant at the institute of Professor Richard Horden at the Technical University of Munich until 2002. There he was teaching microarchitecture and initiated and led several design studios for aerospace architecture, focusing on habitability on board the International Space Station, and on studies for future habitats on Mars together with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA. The students involved were able to test their prototypes in parabolic test flights at NASA Johnson Space Center. During the time at the Technical University of Munich Vogler published several papers about space architecture and submitted several prize-winning architectural competition entries. In 2003‚Äì2005 he worked as Guest Professor at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture in Copenhagen conducting research on prefabricated housing. In 2004 he taught at The University of Hong Kong. In 2005- 2006 he was part of the Concept House research group at the Delft University of Technology. Vogler has spoken at numerous international conferences on the topics of aerospace architecture and technology transfer to architecture and sustainability in architecture. He organized international conference sessions and led workshops on a variety of related themes. In 2008 he and Vittori taught an undergraduate course in Industrial Design at the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University Iuav of Venice. He is a member of the Bavarian Chamber of Architects (ByAK- Bayerische Architektenkammer), the Deutscher Werkbund, and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.  Architecture and Vision  In 2002 Vogler started to collaborate with the Italian architect, Arturo Vittori, with whom he founded in 2003 Architecture and Vision, an international and multidisciplinary studio working in architecture and design, engaged in the development of innovative solutions and technology transfer between diverse fields for aerospace and terrestrial applications. In 2006, a prototype of the extreme environment tent, DesertSeal (2004), became part of the permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York, after being featured in SAFE: Design Takes on Risk (2005), curated by Paola Antonelli. In the same year, the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago selected Vogler and Vittori as \\"Modern-day Leonardo's\\" for its Leonardo da Vinci: Man, Inventor, Genius exhibition. In 2007, a model of the inflatable habitat MoonBaseTwo (2007), developed to allow long-term exploration on the Moon, was acquired for the collection of the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago in Chicago while MarsCruiserOne (2007), the design for a pressurized laboratory rover for human Mars exploration, was shown at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, as part of the exhibition \\"Airs de Paris\\" (2007). In 2011 the sculpture AtlasCoelestisZeroG was inaugurated on board of the International Space Station.  Andreas Vogler Studio  In January 2014, Vogler formed the Andreas Vogler Studio, an international and multidisciplinary firm working in architecture, transportation, and design, located in Munich, Germany.

It is not an interbank network but uses the pre-existing girocard network. With more than 7000 ATMs, the cooperating banks' ATM networks form the third largest ATM network in Germany.Cash Group Homepage The cooperation was founded in 1998 and is generally not open to other members. Its primary competitor in Germany is CashPool. Background Most banks in Germany, while connected through the girocard network, charge ATM usage fees for customers of other banks. Prior to 1998, the charge was fixed to 4,00 DM (2,05 ‚Ç¨) or 1%, whichever was higher. However, this agreement was terminated by the Sparkassen (public banks), who jointly operate the largest German ATM network, arguing that the cost of operating ATMs was unfairly laid on them when virtual banks entered the market. As a consequence, banks now had to deal with different ATM usage charges from other banks but were legally required to make definite quotes to their customers. Most of them simply charged their customers with the estimated maximum fee and pocketed the difference, which dramatically raised the ATM fees for banking customers. Finally, in 1998, the five large German private banks formed Cash Group to counter the bad press resulting from the increase in ATM fees, waiving ATM usage fees within the Group and thus for customers of the Group's member banks. After its formation, other German banks tried to become members of Cash Group but no other bank was accepted by the existing members, except new subsidiaries of the so-called big five. Therefore, in 2000, several smaller German banks founded CashPool as an answer to Cash Group. Today, CashPool is Cash Group's primary competitor in Germany. However, with more than 2,500 ATMs, and 29 member institutions it is significantly smaller. Norisbank GmbH, one of the current members of Cash Group, originally was a member of CashPool.

Thompson (March 20, 1894 ‚Äì October 9, 1977) was an American aviator of World War I. Flying as a gunner on a French aircraft in February 1918, he became the first member of the United States military to shoot down an enemy aircraft. Kiffin Rockwell achieved an earlier aerial victory as an American volunteer member of the French Lafayette Escadrille in 1916. Early life Thompson was born in West Plains, Missouri. When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, he was a senior in electrical engineering at the University of Missouri. The school announced that seniors who joined the military before graduation would receive their diplomas in June. So he enlisted in the Army and, after basic training at Fort Riley, Kansas, in June he was sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia for training in the Coast Artillery Corps. On the train coming into Norfolk he saw an airplane in the sky ‚Äî the first he had ever seen. When he got the opportunity, he went to the flying field, the Curtis School at Newport News, and asked if he could take a ride. Thomas Scott Baldwin, who had been a famous performer in his own balloons and dirigibles, was in charge and said yes. The plane was a Curtiss JN-4 Jenny and the pilot was Edward Stinson, a prominent flyer at the time who later founded the Stinson Aircraft Company. Stinson did a number of aerobatic maneuvers, including looping the loop five times in a row. Thompson said that the only thing that kept him from falling out of the plane at the top of the last loop was the lap belt. By the time he landed, he had decided to apply for duty in the Air Service. World War I He arrived in France in September and was assigned to the United States 1st Aero Squadron for training as an observer. The commander was Major Ralph Royce, who became a general in the Army Air Forces during World War II. The training took place from a field in Amanty. The French day bombardment squadron Br.123, which flew the Breguet 14 B2, was nearby at Neufch√¢teau aerodrome, and Royce was occasionally able to send one of his men along with the French on a raid. Croix de guerre 1914‚Äì1918 ribbon with palm First aerial victory On February 5, 1918, the 1st Aero Squadron had not yet begun combat operations, and Thompson visited a French unit with a fellow member of the 1st Aero Squadron. Both were invited to fly as gunner- bombardiers with the French on a bombing raid over Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. After they had dropped their bombs, the squadron was attacked by Albatros D.III fighters. Thompson shot down one of them. This was the first aerial victory by any member of the U.S. military. He was awarded the Croix de guerre with Palm for the action. In May, he was assigned to the new 12th Aero Squadron at Ourches-sur-Meuse airdrome, commanded by Capt. Lewis H. Brereton. On July 28, now flying from a farm field near La Fert√©-sous-Jouarre, he was in another memorable battle. While doing artillery spotting during a battle near Ch√¢teau- Thierry, his Salmson 2 A2 was attacked by four Fokker D.VIIs from what had been Richthofen's Flying Circus but was by then under the command of Hermann G√∂ring. Thompson shot down the first two planes that attacked him, but a bullet from the third hit his machine gun and disabled it. He was then hit in the leg, and his pilot was hit in the stomach by an exploding bullet. The pilot managed to crash land the plane before he died of his wounds. Thompson dug the bullet out of his leg with a pocket knife. The pilot who shot them down was the famous German ace Erich L√∂wenhardt, who at the time was second only to Richthofen in victories. The uniform that Thompson was wearing when he shot down the Albatros D.III and the bullet he dug from his leg are on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Post-war life After the war Thompson worked for several years as an engineer at McCook Field, the predecessor of today's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He then became a high school mathematics teacher. During World War II he taught preflight and meteorology. He maintained an interest in aviation and in 1940 he received U.S. Patent No. 2,210,642 for a tailless flying wing. He died in Dayton, Ohio at age 83.

Seitz from the 1902 book Popular American Composers by Frank L. Boyden. Roland Forrest Seitz (1867‚Äì1946) was an American composer, bandmaster, and music publisher. For his many march compositions he earned the sobriquet ‚ÄúThe Parade Music Prince‚Äù. Early life and education He was born Roland Forrest Seitz on June 14, 1867 on a farm in Shrewsbury Township near Glen Rock, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of eight children of William and Magdalena Zeigler. Despite an early interest in music, Roland started work as a printer‚Äôs apprentice at the weekly Glen Rock Item. He joined the family band performing on the flute; and then the Glen Rock Band performing first on the euphonium and then the cornet. In 1894 at age 27, Seitz enrolled in the Dana Musical Institute in Warren, Ohio. (Dana is now part of Youngstown State University). Roland graduated from Dana in 1898. Career Seitz returned to Glen Rock to teach wind and percussion as well as perform in the town band and soon became their conductor. By 1901, under Seitz, the band was selected to perform at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Beginning with New York Journal published in 1897, Seitz composed nearly fifty marches. One of these marches, Grandioso (1901), is often featured in parades. Grandioso incorporates a theme from the fourteenth of Franz Liszt‚Äôs Hungarian Rhapsodies. Additional well-known marches include Brooke‚Äôs Chicago Marine Band (1901), Brooke‚Äôs Triumphal (1904), Salutation (1914), and University of Pennsylvania Band (1900). On November 21, 1930, John Philip Sousa conducted the University of Pennsylvania Band at the student quadrangle in Seitz's march for the band. Afterwards, Sousa said: \\"That is one of the best band marches, aside from my own productions, I have ever conducted\\". Seitz also opened a music publishing business in Glen Rock. His catalog included compositions by many famous march composers including W. Paris Chambers, Harold Josiah Crosby, Charles E. Duble, Frank H. Losey, George Rosencrans, and Charles Sanglea. In 1908, Seitz became the first to publish seventeen-year-old Karl L. King‚Äôs compositions. Roland‚Äôs company was purchased by Southern Music in 1964. Seitz married Mattie A. in 1902. They had two children, Charlotte J. (1904-1999) and Nevin H. Seitz (1906-2003). Roland Seitz retired to live with his daughter Charlotte J. Zelley in Union City, New Jersey in 1944. He died age 79 from a heart attack there on December 29, 1946. \\"Grandioso\\" (or \\"March Grandioso\\") is played by both the University of Texas \\"Showband of the Southwest\\" and the Texas Tech \\"Goin' Band from Raiderland\\" at every home football game of both teams.

At one point, he produced about 85% of the state's potato crop, \\"'Potato King' Is Dead; George Shima, Japanese Who Made Millions, Dies of a Stroke,\\" New York Times. March 28, 1926 which earned him the nickname \\"The Potato King\\".Kim, Hyung- chan. (1999). Born in Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan, he entered a preliminary course at the Tokyo Commercial School (now Hitotsubashi University), but failed the entrance examination for the regular course. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1889 determined to learn English, the subject that gave him the most trouble on the exam. Upon his arrival, he changed his name to George Shima. He first worked as a domestic servant in San Francisco, then became a migrant farm laborer in the Sacramento Delta for a while. Soon afterward, he turned his eye to management, when he began supplying Japanese farm workers to white farmers. By the late 1890s, he leased some land and began his own farming operations. He was successful enough to purchase some inexpensive swampland (considered undesirable by white American farmers) in the San Joaquin Delta. After draining and diking the land, he found that potatoes grew best in that type of soil, and using corporate management techniques and the latest agricultural technology, began to corner the market in potatoes. By 1913, he had in production and by 1920, he had 85% of the market share with his \\"Shima Fancy\\" brand, valued at more than $18 million ($ today). His business success did not bring him respite from racism, however. In 1909, while trying to purchase a home in Berkeley, he was actively opposed by real estate agents and other homeowners. Despite being the subject of such newspaper headlines as \\"Yellow Peril in College Town\\", Shima became active in the community, donating $500 to the local YMCA, and gradually won over his neighbors.Kawakami, Kiyoshi K. (May 8, 1913), \\"How California Treats the Japanese\\" in Still, the opposition he encountered led him that same year to become the first president of the Japanese Association of America and to unsuccessfully fight the passing of the California Alien Land Law of 1913, which was written to prevent Asians from owning land. In 1926, while on a business trip to Los Angeles, he suffered a stroke and died. That same day he was awarded the Fourth Rank Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan.Yoshimura, Toshio. (1981). George Shima, Potato King and Lover of Chinese Classics, p. 53 He received the award from Hirohito, later known as Emperor Sh≈çwa.Although his father, the Emperor Taish≈ç, was nominally on the throne until his death on December 25, 1926, Hirohito had served as regent to his mentally disabled father since 1921. At his funeral, David Starr Jordan, the president of Stanford University, and James Rolph, the Mayor of San Francisco, both served as pallbearers. Shima is buried in Japanese Cemetery in Colma, California. The Shima Center at San Joaquin Delta College honors his legacy. Yoshinobu Hirotsu, a fellow resident of Shima's hometown of Kurume, also raised several hundred thousand yen to set up a life-sized monument to him in a park there in 1999. See also * John P.

It consists of three cabins constructed between 1870 and 1896: Esta Cabin, Tophouse, and Wisteria Cabin. It not only displays weavings, but has active education and resident artist programs. The organization participates in several local festivals, giving demonstrations of spinning, dyeing, and weaving. It is the biggest repository of original and classic textile patterns in the United States.Volunteer with Little Loomhouse - Louisville, KY Among the history of the cabins have been the visits of past First Ladies of the United States, and the creation of the song Happy Birthday to You. However, it is in constant state of defending against deterioration.  Esta Cabin  Esta Cabin The Esta Cabin encapsulates the history of the Loomhouse, and is the cabin where the song \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" was first sung.KET - History: Little Loomhouse The cabin was first built by a Beoni Figg in 1870 as a business office for his charcoal, lumber, and quarries interests. It has been enlarged since then from a two-room cabin. One of these enhancements replaced the vertical split log siding with board and batten.Happy Birthday Song In 1939 Lou Tate acquired the cabin and based her weaving business there, living on the property until her death in 1979. On a visit in the 1940s while still the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt crushed a floorboard, which she later signed; it is now lost. While visiting the Loomhouse, Mrs. Roosevelt bought woven mats that would see use in the White House. Displays of weaving decorate the interior.Esta Cabin  Other cabins  Wisteria, which houses the office and giftshop, was built in 1895 and similarly became endangered. In fact, it had to be closed for years due to erosion damage; in 1986, Jefferson County Judge/Executive Harvey Sloane helped in a rededication ceremony celebrating the restoration of the cabin.Wisteria Cabin Tophouse Cabin The Tophouse was built as a summer home for the well-to-do Sam Stone Bush in 1896. It was made of oak harvested from the hill upon which it stands. It was acquired by Tate in 1939 for using her looms. Since that time it has been used for looms, save during World War II when supplies dwindled, and she rented out the cabin for both funding and providing a defense worker's family a place to live. Although endangered by development in the 1960s and 1970s, it still stands today as the home of the looms from which the Little Loomhouse gains its name, and where weaving is still taught.Tophouse  Collective history  Looking downhill at the cabins For many years the Loomhouse has sold a small portable table loom designed by First Lady Lou Henry Hoover, wife of President Herbert Hoover. In his 1948 visit to Louisville, Frank Lloyd Wright praised both the cabins and the setting. In 1940, he described it as \\"board-and-batten summer houses, set down in the dignity of nature\\".Nold, Chip. Insiders' Guide to Louisville, Kentucky & Southern Indiana, 2nd p.154 In 2007, the cabins were deteriorating. Stefanie Buzan put it succinctly: \\"They weren't built to last this long.\\"* Problems include tree trimming, sagging floors, and preventing the cabins from falling down the side of Kenwood Hill by using reinforcements. It is hoped that a second edition of Buzan's book will raise funds for these needed repairs, as the money made normally by the Loomhouse is not enough for the needed repairs.Pike, Bill. \\"Preserving the Loomhouse: Iroquois, Kenwood history re-issued to pay for repairs.\\" Louisville Courier-Journal.

The comic book series deals with what the main characters of the franchise, Connor MacLeod and Duncan MacLeod, do concerning happenings from the films and television series. It spawned a second comic book mini-series, Highlander: Way of the Sword. =Plot= The initial issues (issues 0-4) deal with Connor MacLeod after the events that took place in the first Highlander film. Although the Kurgan has been defeated, some of those who followed him still seek to bring about some of his plans. Connor also deals with battling within himself for control over the impulses and emotions he received from the Dark Quickening of the Kurgan (issues 6-9). The last story arc (issues 10-12) introduces Duncan MacLeod and has him assisting his kinsman Connor in defeating the followers of the Kurgan. The separate plot line issues (Dark Quickening and The Coldest War, Armageddon) were bound into three separate trade paperbacks by Dynamite Entertainment.Trade Paperback =Reception= Critical reaction to the Highlander comics has been mixed to positive, more favorable in general than the film sequels to the original Highlander, which have mostly received negative reviews (with the exception of the animated film Highlander: The Search for Vengeance, which has received mostly favorable reviews). Michael Bailey of Comics Bulletin was \\"pleasantly surprised,\\" and felt that \\"this could turn out to be a really neat story.\\" Bailey praised the story, saying, \\"I always felt that Connor's story was pretty much done with [after the first film, but] reading this first issue, I am seeing where Connor's story can continue,\\" but felt that artist Lee Moder \\"wasn't the right choice for this world.\\"Highlander #1 review, Michael Bailey, Comics Bulletin, December 19, 2006 Dave Baxter of Broken Frontier praised Moder's artwork, calling it \\"fluid, well-executed, [and] flawlessly paced,\\" as well as the writing by Jerwa and Oeming, in particular their \\"above-average, rhythmic dialogue and a fabulous use of the more obscure characters and sequences from the film.\\" Baxter criticized the \\"lackluster plot,\\" however, as well as the fact that the comic \\"manages to ignore entirely the continuity of the first film's premise and especially its conclusion, [creating its] own \\"alternative\\" Highlander universe.\\" Baxter added, \\"Why another alternative Highlander universe? [A]fter three sequels and a long-running TV show, is it really necessary to produce more of the same?\\"Highlander #1 review , Dave Baxter, Broken Frontier, October 29, 2006 Though the comic's sales figures have dropped slowly since release,\\"Dynamite discusses sales and hopes with fans\\", Dynamite Entertainment Dynamite Entertainment released a follow-up comic series, titled Highlander: Way of the Sword. =Collections= The series is being collected as trade paperbacks: * Volume I (collects Highlander #0-5, 140 pages, January 2008, softcover , hardcover ) * Volume II (collects Highlander #6-9, 120 pages, February 2008, softcover ) * Volume III:Armageddon (collects Highlander #10-12, 80 pages, July 2008, softcover ) Highlander: Way of the Sword Highlander: Way of the Sword is a four-issue, monthly comic book limited series that was published by Dynamite Entertainment from 2007 to 2008.Official Site It is Dynamite's second Highlander comic, it followed the publisher's previous 13-issue miniseries, and was published from 2006 to 2007.Initial 12 Issue run This comic is a prequel to the 1986 movie and has no direct connection to the TV series. =Plot= It draws inspiration from the Highlander, the franchise about Immortals battling each other throughout history. The comic book centers around Connor MacLeod's search for the sword of his mentor Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, after losing it in the ocean to The Kurgan by accident. He eventually retrieves the sword just before the events of the first Highlander film. =Synopsis= In 1804 Connor served on the H.M.S. Victory, against Napoleon's troops and fought with The Kurgan, who was on board a French vessel. Connor stabbed Kurgan but before he could take his head, the mainmast fell down and the ship sank. The Kurgan revived and took Connor's Masamune (sword) as his own then he walked away over the bottom of the ocean. Connor had lost his Masamune and would spend decades looking for it. In 1966 Connor received a message from his old friend Ian who had found his sword, it was in the hands of Antonio Direnzo, an illegal art dealer. Connor and Ian got to Paris, but shortly after they arrived Connor sensed an Immortal, it was Guerin Billuad, who challenged Connor; the two agreed to meet at Point Royal the following night. Connor and Ian walked around the City in order to find clues as to where the sword would be sold; eventually Connor met Elizabeth Direnzo, the sister of Antonio. The two got along, and she invited him to an illegal antiques auction. When Connor came back to his motel room he found Ian dead, killed with a sword. Connor suspected Guerin and searched for him. Guerin and Connor fought; the fight, however, was broken off when they got on holy ground. Elizabeth appeared and invited the two inside. At the auction Connor sensed more Immortals like his old friend Sunda Kastagir, but also Toshiro Nakayata who had already bought the Masamune before the auction had even begun. Connor decided to wait and get the sword back later. The next day Connor and Guerin had their final fight and Connor took the head of his opponent. Before that, however, Guerin revealed that he was not Ian's killer. Connor went back to Elizabeth and had a good time. The next day Toshiro killed Antonio and went back to Japan. Connor left Elizabeth in Italy, and followed Toshiro to Japan. Connor cut off Toshiro's hand and took the Masamune back, after which Toshiro swore to take revenge and had his hand replaced by a prosthesis. Later Connor and Elizabeth are in Florence planning their future, as Connor feels another Immortal nearby; it is Toshiro, who is angry. Connor takes his Masamune and fights Toshiro, but is disarmed. Elizabeth tries to kill Toshiro but is killed by him. In his rage Connor defeats Toshiro and beheads him with his own protese. Elizabeth is buried next to her brother and Connor leaves, to find his own destiny.

Educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, Cotton inherited his title from his father when he was ten years old. Although his father, grandfather, godfather, uncle and brother- in-law were admirals, and he was named after a naval battle, Cotton decided to join the army. After a brief career as a cavalry officer, he devoted the rest of his life to sport and gambling. He drove a London to Brighton stagecoach at one time, and was also a deputy lieutenant, militia captain, and magistrate for Cambridgeshire. Cotton married on his deathbed, and the baronetcy became extinct when he died. Early life Madingley Hall Cotton was born at Madingley Hall near Cambridge, and was the eldest surviving son of Sir Charles Cotton, 5th Baronet and Philadelphia Cotton (the daughter of Admiral Sir Joshua Rowley). Cotton's father was an admiral who saw active service during the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars and was unable to spend much time with his family at Madingley Hall.L. M. Munby 1976 Madingley Hall. Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 14‚Äì19 Cotton was named after his godfather, the Earl of St Vincent (who had taken his title from the Battle of Cape St Vincent). Cotton had an elder brother who had died in infancy, two elder sisters, Philadelphia and Maria, and a younger brother, Charles. In 1812 Cotton's father, who was by then commander-in-chief of the Channel Fleet, collapsed and died at Plymouth, and 10-year-old Cotton inherited the baronetcy.Cotton, Sir St Vincent, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, John D. Pickles, Retrieved 13 January 2008 Cotton was educated at Westminster School and in 1820 enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford although he didn't graduate. In the summer of 1820 he toured Scotland on horseback with a cousin and a friend; the highlight of the tour was a visit to Fingal's Cave. Cotton's coming of age in October 1822 was celebrated by three days of festivities at Madingley.Cambridge Chronicle, 11 October 1822, p 3 The following year he was appointed deputy lieutenant of Cambridgeshire and a captain in the Cambridgeshire Militia.The Bury and Norwich Post, 29 October 1823 Army career and sporting life Although he came from a naval family, Cotton was happier on horseback or driving horses and decided to join a cavalry regiment, the 10th Hussars or Light Dragoons. He served in Portugal as a lieutenant but was retired on half-pay in 1830 after three years. On his return to England he took up a life of sport and gambling, and became a well- known figure at sporting events and Crockford's. He hunted in Leicestershire, played cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club, and attended race meetings and boxing matches where he was known as Vinny Cotton, Sir Vincent Twist, or the Baronet. On occasion he was involved in brawls, and was once quoted as advising brawlers to \\"pitch into the big rosy men, but if you see a little lemon-faced nine-stone man, have nothing to do with him\\". In 1836, having lost much of his fortune at the gaming tables, he bought the Age stagecoach which ran between London and Brighton. Cotton drove the coach for two years, before his mother's ill health caused him to return to Madingley.The Standard, 1 November 1838 Later life and marriage In his later years Cotton divided his time between his home in London and the Madingley estate. He was a magistrate for Cambridgeshire in the 1840s.The Standard, 13 January 1844 Gambling debts forced him to sell or mortgage much of his property. After his mother's death in 1855, Cotton left Madingley and lived in London on a modest allowance from his sister. His health declined and he suffered a stroke which left him partially paralysed. He died on 25 January 1863, aged 61. The day before his death he had married his mistress, Hephzibah Dimmick. Cotton was buried in Brompton Cemetery, where he was joined by his widow ten years later. With Cotton's death the baronetcy became extinct, his younger brother, a naval officer, having died in 1828 and his uncle and heir also having died before him. Contrary to what is sometimes said, the Madingley estate had not been completely gambled away, and went to Cotton's sister Maria who was married to Admiral Sir Richard King.E. Rayner 1974 Sir St Vincent Cotton of Madingley Hall Cambridgeshire, Huntingdon and Peterborough Life, April 1974: 31‚Äì32 In his prime, tall and of athletic build, Cotton cut a fine figure of a man. His mother and sisters remained loyal to him through thick and thin, and his nephews enquired after \\"dear Uncle Vinney\\" when writing home from the Crimea War. After his death a magazine said that \\"for all his foibles and weaknesses a better-hearted fellow never breathed\\".

The facility was a primary (stage 1) pilot training airfield operated under contract by the John Wilson Glider School provided elementary and advanced glider training to Army aviation cadets of the 28th Army Air Forces Glider Training Detachment until its deactivation on 18 February 1943.

According to the rubric accompanying his only song in troubadour manuscript C,A 14th-century manuscript from Occitania, now filed as BN f.f. 856 in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Paris. he was Mayestre Matieus de Caersi, that is, a Master of Arts from Quercy, possibly Cahors. He is not to be identified with the Matheus who composed a tenso with Bertram de Gordon in 1212. Matieu's lone surviving song is Tant suy marritz que no.m puese alegrar (\\"I am so afflicted that I cannot be happy\\"), a planh on the death of James I of Aragon (died 26 August 1276). It is often compared and contrasted with another planh on James' death composed by Cerver√≠ de Girona, Si per tristor, per dol no per cossir. Cerver√≠'s piece is direct and almost personal, as the troubadour asks the Virgin Mary to show as much mercy to James as he showed on earth, referring to his establishing the Mercedarian Order in Barcelona. Matieu, on the other hand, is moralising and religious. He is also self- concerned, as he asks James' sons to continue to protect him. The merits of both works have been debated by critics. Structurally, Matieu imposes coblas capfinidas on what is otherwise the metric and rhyme form used by Raimbaut de Vaqueiras in Ara pot hom conoisser e proar. The pieces also has two tornadas. The first plays on the fact that James died a day after the feast day of James, son of Zebedee (Santiago Matamoros): de dos Jacmes dobla festa.ns remanha [Dieu] (\\"from two James God has given us a double festival\\"). Earlier Matieu had compared the sorrow of the people of James' lands as like that of the Britons bemoaning the loss of King Arthur: ben devetz aitant de dol aver cum per Artus agron silh de Bretanha.

He also served as a Privy Councillor of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt (Oder), commonly called the Viadrina. Biography Bishop von Blumenthal was born at Horst, administratively now part of Heiligengrabe. He negotiated the second marriage of Joachim II, Elector of Brandenburg, to the Catholic Hedwig of Poland. Known in his lifetime as the \\"Pillar of Catholicism\\", he used his position as Chancellor of the Viadrina to combat the Reformation. He acquired the respect of his opponents, including the Margrave Joachim II himself, for his principled stand against reforms which he believed to be wrong and opposed by every legal means possible. For this, Luther said he should be \\"generally hated\\". However, some of his opponents were not so respectful. He was twice besieged in his palaces by Protestant brigands; once at F√ºrstenwalde by the robber-baron Nickel von Minkwitz, an event which drew Martin Luther into the controversy, and once at Ratzeburg. At F√ºrstenwalde the Bishop escaped through a window in disguise, while his brother Matthias held the place. As Prince-Bishop of Ratzeburg he was the last Catholic sovereign ruler in northern Germany, and as Bishop of Lebus the only Bishop in Brandenburg during the Protestant Reformation to die a Catholic.

The Health Emergency Act along with the Oklahoma Emergency Management Act of 2003 form the primary state laws regarding emergency management. The Health Emergency Act was signed into law by Governor Brad Henry on August 29, 2003 In General The Health Emergency Act grants state and local officials the authority to provide care, treatment, and vaccination to persons who are ill or who have been exposed to transmissible diseases during a catastrophic health emergency as well as the authority to separate affected individuals from the population at large to interrupt disease transmission. The Act provides for ensuring the needs of infected or exposed persons are properly addressed to the fullest extent possible, given the primary goal of controlling serious health threats and allows state and local officials the ability to prevent, detect, manage, and contain health threats without unduly interfering with civil rights and liberties. =Health Emergency Task Force= The Health Emergency Act created the Oklahoma Catastrophic Health Emergency Planning Task Force for the purpose of preparing a plan for responding to a catastrophic health emergency in the state. Such plan must be annually updated by the Task Force. The Task Force consists of the following seventeen members: * The Cabinet Secretary of Health, who serves as chair * The State Commissioner of Health * The Commissioner of Public Safety * The Oklahoma Attorney General * The Administrative Director of the Courts; * The Director of Emergency Management * Two members of the Oklahoma Senate appointed by the President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate * Two members of the Oklahoma House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives * The Director of the Tulsa City-County Health Department * The Director of the Oklahoma City-County Health Department * The Oklahoma State Fire Marshal * A representative of the Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision to be appointed by the State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision; * A representative of the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners to be appointed by the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners; * A representative of the Governor of Oklahoma to be appointed by the Governor; * A person appointed by the Governor representing a statewide organization representing hospitals; * A representative of the Oklahoma Nurses Association to be appointed by the Oklahoma Nurses Association; and * A representative of the Oklahoma Psychological Association to be appointed by the Oklahoma Psychological Association. Gubernatorial emergency powers After consulting the Commissioner of Health, the Governor of Oklahoma may declare a state of catastrophic health emergency. By declaring such an emergency, the Governor automatically convenes the Oklahoma Legislature into special session. During a state of catastrophic health emergency, the Governor may utilize all available resources of the state government and its political subdivisions to respond to the catastrophic health emergency and may mobilize all or any part of the Oklahoma National Guard into service of the state. The Commissioner of Health, under the direction of the Governor, has primary jurisdiction for planning and executing disaster mitigation, response, and recovery for the state. At any time, the Commissioner of Health may request assistance from Commissioner of Public Safety in enforcing his order regarding response, and the Commissioner of Public Safety may in turn request the assistance of the National Guard in enforcing the Commissioner of Health's orders.

He was the father of William Melmoth (1710‚Äì1799), a Commissioner of Bankrupts.http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/authorrecord.php?action=GET&recordid;=33042 Life and career Melmoth was admitted to the Inns of Court to begin his training as a barrister at Clifford's Inn on 15 April 1686, and then transferred to Inner Temple on 30 May 1689 and from there he was called to the Bar on 29 May 1693. Records show that he was admitted as a \\"gentleman.\\" On his admission to the Bar he was called to take the Test Act oath that served as an oath of allegiance to William III and Mary IIThe 1673 Act enforced abjuring transubstantiation, invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass. and the Protestant succession, he was troubled by Jacobite non-juror concerns of legitimacy. He wrote to John Norris, the religious writer, to ask whether swearing allegiance to an usurper might not make him an accessory to the usurpation. However, Melmoth did take the oath, and in 1699 he moved to Lincoln's Inn, working mostly in chancery cases. He married, and this wife died around 1699 and left him property. He married again, a woman named Catharine, by 1710, and the two had four daughters and two sons to survive infancy. Among these was William Melmoth the Younger.http://www.history.ac.uk/publications/office/comms-bankrupts Writings As a high churchman, he was pleased with the accession of Queen Anne in 1702. He was active in the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge and greatly concerned with the lasciviousness and \\"impiety\\" of the English stage. He wrote, anonymously, to rail against stage performances, including correspondence with Daniel Defoe and the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison. It was during these years of 1703‚Äì1711 that Melmoth composed The Great Importance. The Great Importance of a Religious Life Consider'd was published for the first time in 1711. Melmoth published the book anonymously. Like William Law's later A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life (1728), Melmoth's book emphasized personal renewal and religious awakening. Instead of focusing on social ills and matters of politics or polity, Melmoth focused on the individual Christian and urged a revitalized faith. The book was immediately successful and was translated into French and Welsh within a year. Melmoth's authorship of the book was not definitely asserted until his son did so in 1797. However, the work sold exceptionally well, having a staggering thirty editions by 1797 and selling 420,000 copies between 1766 and 1784 alone. Melmoth wrote pamphlets and short works for publication, anonymously, throughout his public life, but he was only an occasional author. In 1719, he was made a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn and was soon recognised as one of the leading chancery counsel of the day. He devoted considerable energies to the physical and financial improvement of the Inn and continued to work up until a few days before his death on 6 April 1743.

It is located in Campania, Italy. History=Early days= In the summer of 1951, a new NATO southern command was established in Naples, Italy called Headquarters Allied Forces, Southern Europe (AFSOUTH). With American high school age students arriving in the command, a small facility was set up in October 1951. Beginning with 7‚Äì8 students, it was set up in a spare storage room in the Hotel Britannique in downtown Naples, where many of the families lived. This school program functioned through University of Nebraska high school correspondence courses. It was named the American Forces Dependents High School, Naples, Italy or AFDHS,NI. During the summer and autumn of 1951, more students arrived and the school was relocated to the Albergo Sant‚ÄôElmo, then the NATO Officers‚Äô Club in the Vomero section of Naples. This school of 15‚Äì18 students operated until August 1952. High School proctors during this period were Mr. Albert Trimarchi and Mr. Bob Newton. The first graduate of the school was Stewart A. Ring. On October 1, 1952 a standard Department of Defense School was opened in the same location, the Albergo Sant‚ÄôElmo, with about 45 students. There were five students in the graduating class that year. =Official opening= In 1953 members of the senior class suggested that the school be named in honor of Admiral Forrest Sherman, the United States Chief of Naval Operations, who had died suddenly during that school year during a visit to Naples. The school opened in the fall of 1953 as Forrest Sherman High School. The Ring brothers, Bill and Stewart, suggested the school colors of green and white, after the colors of Coronado High School in San Diego, California. Both brothers had attended Coronado High School prior to their father being assigned to Naples in the summer of 1951. They also suggested the school mascot, the Wildcat, which continues to be the Naples High School mascot. According to the end of year publication, Ciao, there were 58 students that year with four graduating seniors. Due to an increase in enrollment the high school was moved to a larger building on Via Manzoni in the Posillipo section of the city beginning with the 1953‚Äì54 school year. That year grades 1‚Äì12 were contained in this building under the name Forrest Sherman Schools. 1960 marked the move of Forrest Sherman High School to another building further down Via Manzoni, across the street from the Scuola Svizzera, an international school run by the Swiss government. The panoramic view from the front of the school, overlooking the entire bay of Naples, with Mt. Vesuvius in the background, is perhaps the best view from any DoD school in the world. The school remained in this building until 1982. Eventually it included seventh and eighth grades and enrollment increased to almost 600 students. In the autumn of 1967, the sixth fleet flagship was assigned to Gaeta, Italy, having moved from Villefrance, France. Students in grades 9‚Äì12 from Gaeta began attending Naples American High School that fall. In 1982, the high school moved to the Agnano facility, called the ‚Äúhorseshoe,‚Äù because of its distinctive shape. That year all the elementary students were combined in the school complex at Pinetamare, twenty miles north of Naples. In 1984, the name of the school was changed to Naples High School, in accordance with DoDDS policy to have school names better reflect their locations. =Later years= During the mid-1990s construction was begun on a new US Navy Support Site north of Naples, near Gricignano di Aversa, which would eventually include all the support services located in Agnano and a large housing complex. New elementary and high schools were the first buildings opened at the US Navy Support Site. In August 1997 Naples Elementary School and Naples High Schools opened at the US Navy Support Site and welcomed 950 elementary and 560 high school students. =Present day= Naples High School continues the use of the traditional colors of green and white and the Wildcat mascot. Children of all NATO nationalities are accepted from the families assigned to Allied Joint Force Command Naples (JFC Naples, formerly AFSOUTH) and American installations in the greater Naples and Gaeta area. Students from the following nations have attended our school in recent years: Bosnia, Bulgaria, Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and the USA. Naples American High School has transitioned through the years from one room in a hotel to its present modern facility with Internet connectivity in every classroom. School programs have moved from correspondence courses to such state of the art courses as the Cisco Networking Academy, Computer Services and Support, and advanced placement courses in English, Mathematics, Science, History, Computer Programming, and Art. Support services are provided in English, reading, mathematics, and learning strategies. Students who are ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù and show academic potential are provided support through the AVID program. Study trips, athletic competitions, and honors workshops insure that students enjoy life beyond the classroom in the culturally rich environment in which families are located in Italy. In 1994 the school added the Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC) to the curriculum. The first instructors were Captain Mike Gruelli, USN (Ret) and MGYSGT Mike Copeland, USMC (Ret). Captain Gruelli retired and was relieved by LT. Rod Light, USN (Ret) in 1997 when the school moved to the support site. MGYSGT Copeland left in 2008 and was replaced by SCPO Vincent Gilfoy, USN (Ret). LT. Rod Light also retired and was relieved by CDR Niels Mateo, USN (Ret) in 2015. The unit has been very successful over the years earning many trophies in Exhibition Drill, Rifle Team, Academics and Orienteering. For a number of years, it hosted a sailing club with 6 sunfish sailboats. The unit has taken Unit Achievement or Distinguished Unit every year since 2004. It currently has 65 cadets (2016).Naplesnjrotc.org For the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, Naples Athletics were Division II champions for Cross Country, Boys Volleyball, Girls Soccer, and Softball. In the fall of 2010, the Boys Volleyball team lost to Aviano in the semi-finals and placed third in the Mediterranean District. Boys Cross Country were Division II Champions and Girls Cross County came second in the Division II Championships. Cheerleading, Girls Soccer, and Softball also won Division II Championships during the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. The Boys Cross Country Team kept their title of European Champions during their 2011‚Äì2012 year also. Before the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, the continuing success of Naples teams in Division II and its increasing size caused DODEA Athletics to move Naples up to Division I in every sport except for football. Although no Naples team has won a title yet (as of winter 2016), Girls Volleyball, Cheer, Tennis, Wrestling, and Basketball have had teams or individual athletes place 2nd or 3rd in Division I level competition.

The name is used for a variety of different groups of nematodes, some of which also have other common names; what they have in common is that they migrate to their hosts' lungs or respiratory tracts, and cause bronchitis or pneumonia. The lungworm will gradually damage the airways or lung tissue by inciting an inflammatory reaction inside the tissue. Ultimately, the parasites survive and reproduce in the respiratory tissues. The category is thus more a descriptive than a precisely taxonomic one. The most common lungworms belong to one of two groups, the superfamily Trichostrongyloidea or the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, but not all the species in these superfamilies are lungworms. The lungworms in the superfamily Trichostrongyloidea include several species in the genus Dictyocaulus which infest hoofed animals, including most common domestic species. Different species are found in cattle and deer (D. viviparus), donkeys and horses (D. arnfeldi), and sheep and goats (D. filaria). These animals have direct life- cycles. The lungworms in the superfamily Metastrongyloidea include species that infest a wider range of mammals, including sheep, goats and pigs but also cats and dogs. These include Metastrongylus elongatus (apri), found in pigs; Oslerus osleri found in dogs; and Aelurostrongylus abstrusus found in cats. Some of these have indirect, and complex, life-cycles; several of them involve slugs or snails as intermediate hosts, where the habit of sniffing at slug trails, or even licking them, causes the parasite egg to enter the dog's respiratory tract. In the case of A. abstrusus the cat is normally infected by eating a bird or rodent that has itself eaten the original host.  Lifecycle  The general life cycle of a lungworm begins with an ingestion of infective larva/e. The infective larvae then penetrate the intestinal wall where larvae migrate into the lungs through the bloodstream. The infected larvae reside in the lungs until the development into an adult lungworm. The eggs of the adult hatch thus producing L1 larvae. The eggs or L1 larvae that reside in the lungs are coughed up and then ingested back into the stomach and released into the environment via the feces. Infected wildlife or dogs will quickly contaminate their environment with many lungworm larvae increasing the risk for reinfection or for infection to others.  Symptoms  The most common symptom is coughing and other typical symptoms are wheezing and weight loss. These symptoms are caused by larvae that reside in the lungs where immunity develops and the accumulation of mucus cause blockage of the airway into the lungs.  Diagnosis  If an animal is suspected of lungworm infection, there are many ways to detect this parasitic infection such as performing one or more of the following techniques: a complete medical history including lung auscultation (stethoscope examination), doing a chest X ray, fecal examination for detection of ova or larvae, examination of respiratory secretions for ova or larvae, and/or a complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of increase in eosinophils, While examination of feces is more commonly performed in cattle as a diagnostic, transtracheal wash cytology can occasionally yield lungworm eggs in infected animals.https://vetrecordcasereports.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001001  Treatment  Lungworm infestations can cause significant distress to the animal but are usually treatable with drugs. If infected with lungworm parasite, an anti- parasite drug must be administered. In the case of a severe reaction, an anti- inflammatory drug of corticosteroids may be given for a brief period (3 to 10 days). To treat tissue inflammation, Prednisone is usually given (5‚Äì10 days). However, there are some side effects such as increased urination or appetite. The drugs fenbendazole or moxidectin are usually administered to kill the parasite. There are several different lungworm parasites that have been identified. Although they all originate from the lungworm parasite, they are treated somewhat differently and requires a combination of various drugs to treat the parasite.  Prevention  Repeat chest X-rays in 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. Also, recheck a fecal sample to monitor for the presence of larvae or ova in 2 to 4 weeks. This will confirm if the parasite is still living inside the respiratory tissue.

It combined a LINC computer with a PDP-8 in one cabinet, thus being able to run programs written for either of the two architectures. Architecture Running LINC-8 The LINC-8 contained one PDP-8 CPU and one LINC CPU, partially emulated by the PDP-8. At any one time, the computer was in either 'LINC mode' or 'PDP-8 mode' - both processors could not run in parallel. Instructions were provided to switch between modes. In the LINC-8, all interrupts were handled by the PDP-8 CPU, and programs that relied on the interrupt architecture of the LINC could not be run. The LINC was a 12-bit ones' complement accumulator machine, whereas the PDP-8, while also a 12-bit accumulator machine, operated in two's complement arithmetic. Memory addressing on the two architectures was also different. On the LINC, the full address space was divided into 1024-word segments, two of which were selected for use at any one time: the instruction field and the data field. Direct access of data in the instruction field was possible using 10-bit addresses. The data field could only be indirectly addressed. The Instruction field and Data field are theoretically capable of being chosen from up to 32 areas of 1K 12-bit words each as the maximum architecture is 32K total words. As a practical matter, few LINC-8 systems ever were expanded to 8K total. Memory expansion is accomplished first by adding PDP-8 memory extension hardware and extended memory instructions and a few minor LINC processor modifications to address the memory beyond the basic 4K total. Once this is accomplished, 4K memory \\"wings\\" can be added in a daisy-chained buss arrangement, which in theory could be expanded out as many as 7 times to implement the entire 32K. As a practical matter, it is always difficult to implement on the \\"regular\\" PDP-8, and, in the case of the LINC-8, it became necessary to slow down the CPU slightly just to add on the first additional 4K. Thus, as a practical matter, LINC-8 memory segments are limited to segment 0-3, or perhaps 0-7 on the few 8K implementations. However, basic 4K machines cannot address beyond 0-3 while extended memory models could attempt to address segments 0-37 octal even if non-existent memory. By convention, the segment 0 area is not available for normal fully emulated LINC operations. This is because the PDP-8 program usually known as PROGOFOP is loaded there to handle all interrupts, traps, etc. It is possible to write a program for a \\"partial\\" LINC CPU, meaning using only the hardware that actually exists. Whenever an operation is performed that it cannot handle, the PDP-8 operation resumes. However, the LINC operation could have been terminated for a variety of reasons. As such, it is always recommended that PROGOFOP be loaded when attempting to use \\"complete\\" LINC programs on this system. Many operating systems were written for this machine; some were essentially slightly modified versions designed for the original LINC CPU it is partially based on. Bootup conventions allowed an image of a custom version of PROGOFOP to first be loaded, followed by executing tape instructions to load the LINC-based operating system. In some cases, the bootup procedure was accomplished manually right on the LINC console switches; later systems self- started the system after loading PROGOFOP. Other operating systems are actually more generic and are designed to mostly ignore the LINC side of things. These are PDP-8-only systems, although perhaps custom configured for the vagaries of the specifics of a LINC-8. In some cases, this means that they cannot be run on any other machine; in other cases, the LINC-8 merely represented a normal variation of drivers off of an otherwise non-descript PDP-8 system. An advantage of a PDP-8-based system is that PROGOFOP is superfluous here. If needed, the PDP-8 system could load PROGOFOP as well as a user program primarily LINC-oriented to get at the laboratory peripherals. The LINC convention of the entire first 1K being unavailable reserved for PROGOFOP is exchanged for the far smaller PDP-8 convention of reserving only 07600-07777 or the last 128-word page of the first 4K of the machine. This corresponds to a small reserved area at the end of LINC segment 3 in exchange for much greater overall flexibility. The PDP-8 divided its memory into 128-word pages. An instruction could reference the current page, that being the page where the instruction itself was located, or page 0, the 128 words of memory at addresses 0-127. Indirect addressing could be used to produce 12-bit addresses. If more than 4K memory is implemented, the indirect addressing is extended to include the Data Field, thus it is possible to access any location indirectly in 32K maximum. Again, hardware limitations of the LINC-8 make it hard to achieve a total size of more than 8K total. Also implemented is the Instruction Field, making it possible to load larger programs into the same addressing space the Data Field controls. Transfer of control can be either direct or indirect as required. The new address is determined by first setting the new Instruction Field value, and then executing a JMP or JMS instruction into the new field's corresponding 12-bit address, thus effecting a 15-bit address overall. The computer included a number of LINC peripherals, which were controlled by special LINC mode instructions. These devices included analog inputs in the forms of knobs and jacks, relays for control of external equipment, LINCtape drives (the predecessor of the DECtape), an oscilloscope- like cathode ray tube under program control, as well as a Teletype Model 33 ASR. Actually, the CRT is a specially modified unit based on a standard Tektronix oscilloscope modified to only be driven by D-A converters and an intensifier interface; there are no sweep circuits as found in conventional oscilloscopes. Most of the modifications involve custom highly stripped down plug in modules, which also house the actual knobs hooked to the lowest A-D channels. Arguably, this is the precursor to the modern mouse interface; some software utilized knob twirling in a manner that would later suggest the two- dimensional form of a mouse; these are knobs controlling only one parameter at a time, etc. Some of these peripherals are simulated and are actually peripherals of the PDP-8. Any unimplemented operation stops the LINC CPU and interrupts the PDP-8 processor to handle the specifics. Most notably, the LINCtape is actually a PDP-8 peripheral; the tape class of LINC instructions are trapped and interrupt the PDP-8 which then emulates how a real LINC or PDP-12 would carry out the specifics of the latest tape instruction. Pressing a variety of keys on the seemingly present LINC console all cause PDP-8 interrupts; PROGOFOP is designed to emulate the functions as they would appear on the original LINC. An interesting feature is the FETCH/EXEC stop, which is implemented in all hardware in the LINC and PDP-12. The hardware, when enabled, continuously monitors instruction execution until specific conditions are met. This will cause a PDP-8 interrupt stalling the LINC program. Simulated console operations can be used to examine memory or make other changes, such as pressing the simulated DO key. The DO key executes any one instruction on the left switch register while the right switch register may have to also be set in the case of double word instructions such as most of the tape class. Booting certain operating systems consists of executing a tape read instruction directly from both sets of switches pressing the simulated DO key followed by pressing the simulated START 20 switch. In essence, the LINC-8 implements all of the functions of the console panel of the \\"real\\" LINC, then uses the PDP-8 to simulate most of them. Purpose The LINC-8 was built as a laboratory computer. It was small enough to fit in a laboratory environment, provided modest computing power at a low price, and included hardware capabilities necessary to monitor and control experiments. The LINCtape magnetic tape drive, designed by Wesley A. Clark for the LINC, was suitable for handling in a laboratory environment, and the tapes could be carelessly pocketed, dropped, or even pierced and cut without losing the data stored on them. Current status In 1969, DEC improved upon the LINC-8 with the PDP-12, a similar combination computer for lab use, and the LINC-8 was cancelled. Few LINC-8 computers were ever built, numbering only in the low hundreds, and so the model is a rare sight today. As of 2008, a project to emulate the LINC-8 on modern hardware is underway within the Update computer society at Uppsala University.

After a brief career as a music therapist, she attended Amsterdam Conservatory in 2006. With classmates she started FIDAN, a band that combined jazz with folk music from Turkey and Azerbaijan. Dalfidan sings lyrics in English, German, and Turkish. The band's name comes from the Turkish word for twig or branch. As her main influences and source of inspiration she mentions the Azeri singer and pianist Aziza Mustafa Zadeh and the Portuguese singer Maria Jo√£o. Zadeh developed a blend of jazz, modern, and Azeri traditional music called mugam jazz. In 2008 she performed a series of concerts with the Tineke Postma Group, extending into the first half of 2009. She worked with an ensemble called Gandhi Bazaar led by Ned McGowan. This group assembled five musicians with backgrounds in jazz, classical, Indian, Turkish, and flamenco music. The Gandhi Bazaar concert tour was commissioned by the Dutch Fund for the Performing Arts and some of the compositions were created to accompany texts by the Dutch-Iranian poet Nafiss Nia.

It is popular in the Arab world, particularly the Levant and Egypt, and especially among Palestinians. In addition, variants are found in Turkey, Greece, and the Balkans, as well as in the South Caucasus. In Arabic, kunƒÅfa may refer to the string pastry itself, or to the entire dessert dish. In Turkish, the string pastry is known as tel kadayƒ±f, and the cheese-based dessert that uses it as k√ºnefe. In the Balkans, the shredded dough is similarly known as kadaif, and in Greece as kataifi, and is the basis of various dishes rolled or layered with it, including dessert pastries with nuts and sweet syrups. One of the most well-known preparations of kanafeh is knafeh nabulsiyeh, which originated in the Palestinian city of Nablus, and is the most representative and iconic Palestinian dessert. Knafeh nabilsiyeh uses a white-brine cheese called Nabulsi. It is prepared in a large round shallow dish, the pastry is colored with orange food coloring, and sometimes topped with crushed pistachio nuts. Etymology English borrows the word from Levantine and Egyptian Arabic so widely transliterates it as kanafeh, kenafeh, knafeh, kunafah, kunafeh, konafa, kunafa, and similar variations. Its form renders kunƒÅfa in Roman script. Its ultimate origin is debated. Some sources state that it comes from the Coptic Egyptian word kenephiten, a bread or cake. Early attestations are found in Egyptian stories in Alf layla·∫ó wa-layla·∫ó, the One Thousand and One Nights. Another view is that it comes from a Semitic root with a meaning of side or wing, from the Arabic kanafa, to flank or enclose. According to etymologist Sevan Ni≈üanyan, the Turkish term tel kadayƒ±fƒ± (string-pancake or string-cr√™pe), referring to the vermicelli-like pastry often used in kanafeh and other dishes, is based on the Arabic word qatayif (a pancake or cr√™pe). It appears in 1501 in a Turkish- Persian dictionary. History Traditional kunafa maker in Cairo A common story is that the dish was created, and prescribed by doctors, to satisfy the hunger of caliphs during Ramadan. The story is variously said to have happened in Fatimid Egypt, or in the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria. It is also reported to have been mentioned in writing as early as the 10th century, and to be of Fatimid origin. However, dishes mentioned in historical texts are not necessarily the same as the modern versions of kanafeh. Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century Kitab al-Tabikh (Book of Dishes), a collection of Arabic and Persian recipes and food advice of the Abbasid caliphs, mentions neither the word kunƒÅfa, nor a description of the dish as it is known today. However, it does feature a chapter on desserts made with the related qatƒÅyif, meaning cr√™pes, from which the Turkish word kadayƒ±f and Greek word kata√Øfi derive. In one recipe, qatƒÅyif are stuffed with nuts, deep-fried, and topped with honey- sugar syrup, which is essentially unchanged in today's version. Also described are large thin cr√™pes resembling fabric, called ruqƒÅq, cooked on a round sheet of metal called a tƒÅbaq, layered with fruit, and drenched with sugar. The 13th-century anonymous Kitab al tabikh fi-l-Maghrib wa-l-Andalus (Book of Dishes from Mahgreb and Al-Andalus) uses the word kunƒÅfa to describe a cr√™pe made with thin batter on an Indian pan or \\"mirror\\" (the tƒÅbaq), and says it is equivalent to ruqƒÅq. It also gives a recipe for Abbasid QatƒÅyif (the cr√™pes being called musahhada in Al-Andalus), which uses the same batter, but the kunƒÅfa is made thinner, \\"like a fine tissue\\". It gives a number of dessert recipes for kunƒÅfa, where the cr√™pes are served layered with fresh cheese, baked, and topped with honey and rose syrup; or cut up into shreds like rose leaves and cooked with honey, nuts, sugar, and rosewater. See also contents and footnotes. Ibn al-Jazari gives an account of a 13th-century market inspector who rode through Damascus at night, ensuring the quality of kunƒÅfa, qatƒÅ'if, and other foods associated with Ramadan, during the Mamluk period. In the later Middle Ages, a new technique was created, with thin batter being dripped onto the metal sheet from a perforated container, creating hair-like strings. A mid-15th-century Ottoman Turkish translation of Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi's Kitab al-Tabikh added several new contemporary recipes, including one for this kadayif, though it does not specify where it originated. This became the basis for the modern kunafa/kanafeh. It is fried together with butter and fillings or toppings such as nuts, sweetened cheese, or clotted cream, and mixed with rosewater and sugar. The pastry spread from the Arab lands to neighboring countries including Iran and Greece, and to Turkey where the string pastry itself is known as tel kadayƒ±f (\\"string cr√™pes\\"), also used in related pastries such as dolma kadayif. Preparation mbrwma (twined) kanafeh There are many types of Kanafeh pastry: * khishnah (, rough): crust made from long thin noodle threads. * na'ama (, fine): semolina dough. * mhayara (, mixed): a mixture of khishnah and na'ama. *mbrwma (, twined): It is prepared with noodle. The pastry is heated in butter, margarine, palm oil, or traditionally semneh and then spread with soft white cheese, such as Nabulsi cheese, and topped with more pastry. In khishnah kanafeh the cheese is rolled in the pastry. A thick syrup of sugar, water, and a few drops of rose water or orange blossom water is poured on the pastry during the final minutes of cooking. Often the top layer of pastry is tinted with red food coloring (a modern shortcut, instead of baking it for long periods of time). Crushed pistachios are sprinkled on top as a garnish. Variants= Kanafeh Nabulsieh = A siniyyeh (tray) of Kanafeh Kanafeh Nabulsieh originated in the Palestinian city of Nablus, hence the name Nabulsieh. Nablus is still renowned for its kanafeh, which consists of mild white cheese and shredded wheat surface, which is covered by sugar syrup.Cuisine Institute for Middle East Understanding In the Levant and Egypt, this variant of kanafeh is the most common. =Kadayƒ±f and k√ºnefe= Turkish k√ºnefe and Turkish tea In the Hatay region of Turkey, which was formerly part of Syria and has a large Arab population, the pastry is called k√ºnefe and the wiry shreds are called tel kadayƒ±f. A semi-soft cheese such as Urfa peyniri (cheese of Urfa) or Hatay peyniri (cheese of Hatay), made of raw milk, is used in the filling. In making the k√ºnefe, the kadayƒ±f is not rolled around the cheese; instead, cheese is put in between two layers of wiry kadayƒ±f. It is cooked in small copper plates, and then served very hot in syrup with clotted cream (kaymak) and topped with pistachios or walnuts. In the Turkish cuisine, there is also yassƒ± kadayƒ±f and ekmek kadayƒ±fƒ±, none of which is made of wiry shreds. =Ri≈üt…ô X…ôtayi= This Azerbaijani variant is prepared in Tabriz, Iran. \\"Ri≈üt…ô X…ôtayi\\", and is typically cooked in Ramadan in the world's biggest covered Bazaar of Tabriz. It is made with chopped walnuts, cinnamon, ginger, powder of rose, sugar, rose water and olive oil. =Kadaif= Greek kataifi In this variant, called also (kata√Øfi) or (kada√Øfi) in Greek, the threads are used to make various forms of pastries, such as tubes or birds' nests, often with a filling of chopped nuts as in baklava. World records The world's largest plate of the dessert was made in Antakya, Turkey, in 2017. The tray of k√ºnefe measured 78 meters long, and weighed 1550 kilograms. A previous record attempt was made by rival Nablus in 2009, with a 75-meter tray, weighing 1,350 kilograms. Neither attempt was officially listed as breaking the record; according to the website of the Guinness World Records, there is no current record holder for the title.

It is managed by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, and most of it is an Iron Age hillfort, which is a Scheduled Monument.  History  The top of the hill is ringed by the ramparts of an Iron Age hill fort. In the centre a copse of beech trees contains the site of the 12th-century chapel of St. Catherine. There is also a mizmaze, probably cut between 1647 and 1710.Hampshire Treasures Vol. 4 P.83, Hampshire County Council The hill was cut off from the Itchen water meadows for over a hundred years by the construction of the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway in the 1890s and the Winchester By-pass (A33) in the 1930s. The railway closed in the 1960s and the road was removed following construction of the M3 motorway to the east through Twyford Down in the 1990s. Whilst this reunited the hill with its historic setting to the west, it is now largely cut off from the hills to the east. The routing of the original by- pass to the east of Winchester had been controversial and its replacement by the M3 led to a large-scale protest (see main article Twyford Down protest). The hill was where the game of Winchester College football was played after being moved from Kingsgate Street and before moving to its modern form on canvases around the school. In 1922, money raised by The Old Wykehamist Lodge of Freemasons hosting the Public Schools Lodge's Council Festival was used to buy the hill and donate it to the college.History of the new Museum at Winchester College Geology Looking SW from the top of St. Catherine's Hill water meadows Structurally, St. Catherine's Hill is part of the Winchester anticline. This is an upfold in the chalk at the western end of the South Downs. In the Winchester area the core of the anticline has eroded to expose older rocks in Chilcomb, Bar End and Winchester itself, leaving a near complete ring of inward-facing chalk scarp slopes including Magdalen (Morn) Hill to the north, Chilcomb Down and Telegraph Hill to the east, Deacon Hill, Twyford Down and St. Catherine's to the south and Oliver's Battery to the west. Whilst the highest part of the main ring of hills (which reaches up to at Cheesefoot Head) is of the 'Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation', St. Catherine's is of the slightly older 'New Pit Chalk Formation'. Both date from the Turonian stage of the Upper Cretaceous. St. Catherine's Hill is separated from the higher Twyford Down by the dramatic dry valley known as Plague Pits Valley to the east and south, and truncated by the valley of the River Itchen to the west.Booth K.A., 2002, Geology of the Winchester district, British Geological Survey, (booklet to accompany BGS 1:50,000 map sheet 299)Winchester, British Geological Survey 1:50,000 Map Series, Sheet 299, NERC, 2002, References Category:Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust Category:Winchester Category:Hills of Hampshire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Hampshire Category:Hill forts in Hampshire Category:Nature reserves in Hampshire Category:Winchester College Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Hampshire ","title":"St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire"},{"id":"15139522","text":"Ulf Kristiansen (born March 311, 1969) is a Norwegian painter and video- artist.

Born (according to Forrer) in Breglia near Como or (according to older records) in Lugano, his date of death is unknown. He was first active in Milan, then in Mantua, from 1608 in Florence, from which latter period we possess his first signed medal. Here he was maestro delle stampe della monete. In 1609 he became well known by his medals commemorating the marriage and the accession of Cosimo II. In 1609 and 1610 he cut the dies for the thalers and the \\"medals of merit\\" conferred by the grand duke. According to Kenner, it is not necessary to suppose that he gave up his connexion with the Florentine court at this time, because, in the following years, he struck medals for the court in Mantua, as well as coins for Guastalla and Castiglione, especially as he was again working in Florence in 1614 (certainly in 1615). The medals, which he made after 1620 for Prince Vincenzo II of Mantua, may very well also have been struck at Florence. His further sojourn in Tuscany seems to have been rendered distasteful to him by intrigues. About 1623 he moved to Rome, where he became die-cutter at the Papal mint in place of J. A. Moro, who died in 1625. Here he made a great many coins and medals for Urban VIII (1623‚Äì44), Innocent X (1644‚Äì55), and Alexander VII (1655‚Äì57). His last works date from 1664. As it seems strange that Molo should, at the age of eighty-four, still continue working with unabated strength, it is thought that another artist of his name - perhaps his son - continued Gasparo's work. Indeed, we find in 1639 a G. D. Molo, who might have been a son of Gasparo and who apparently died young; but it is more likely that Gasparo founded a school in Rome, and that his engravers worked according to his instructions and in his style, but passed off their works under his name and with his signature. One of his numerous pupils was his successor at the Mint, Hamerani (Hameran, a German), the founder of the long-lived Hamerani family of artists. As long as cast medals were generally used, public interest in the portrait predominated, and the reverse was usually neglected; this changed with the introduction of the stamping technique. We know only a few cast medals of Molo; he preferred the stamped medal. It seems that he was responsible for new ideas in stamping technique. Sources * cites **Kenner in Jahrb. der kunsthistor.

Mitchell, 170 Mo. 633, 71 S.W. 175 (1902), is a precedent-setting decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri which is part of the body of case law involving the prosecution of failed attempts to commit a crime. In United States law, cases involving failed criminal attempts can bring up interesting legal issues of whether the crime was unsuccessful due to factual impossibility or to legal impossibility.  Background  Mistakes of fact was rarely an adequate defense at common law. In the United States, 37 states have ruled out mistake of fact as a defense to charges of attempt. Mistakes of law have proved a more successful defense. = Mistakes of fact= A \\"factual\\" impossibility occurs when, at the time of the attempt, the facts make the intended crime impossible to commit, even though the defendant is unaware of this when the attempt is made. In People v. Lee Kong, 95 Cal. 666, 30 P. 800 (1892), a case from the Supreme Court of California, the defendant was found guilty of attempted murder for shooting at a hole in the roof, believing his victim to be there, and indeed, where his victim had been only moments before but was not at the time of the shooting. Another case involving the defense of factual impossibility is the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision in Commonwealth v. Johnson, 167 A. 344, 348 (Pa. 1933), in which a wife intended to put arsenic in her husband's coffee but by mistake added the customary sugar instead. Later, she felt repentant and confessed her acts to the police. She was arrested, tried, and convicted of attempted murder. In United States v. Thomas, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 278 (1962), the United States Court of Military Appeals held that men who believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman were guilty of attempted rape, even though the woman was actually dead at the time the sexual intercourse took place. = Mistakes of law = An act that is considered legally impossible to commit is traditionally considered a valid defense for a person prosecuted for a criminal attempt. An attempt is considered to be a \\"legal\\" impossibility when the defendant has completed all of his intended acts, but those acts fail to fulfill all the required common law elements of a crime. Mistake of law has proved a successful defense. An example of a legally failed attempt is a person who shoots a tree stump; that person can not be prosecuted for attempted murder as there is no manifest intent to kill by shooting a stump. The underlying rationale is that attempting to do what is not a crime is not attempting to commit a crime. However, \\"legal\\" and \\"factual\\" mistakes are not mutually exclusive. A borderline case is that of a person who shot a stuffed deer, thinking it was alive. That person was originally convicted for attempting to kill a protected animal out of season, but in a debatable reversal, an appellate judge threw out the conviction on the basis that it is no crime to shoot a stuffed deer out of season.  Facts of the case  In Mitchell, the defendant fired shots into a room at night where his intended victim usually slept, intending to murder the victim. One bullet struck the victim's usual pillow. But the defendant did not know that the victim was sleeping elsewhere that particular night. Using these circumstances (that the bed was empty), the defendant pleaded not guilty on the grounds that the intended crime was factually impossible to commit, as there was no victim in the room into which he fired. At trial, the defendant was found guilty of attempted murder. The fact that the intended crime was impossible for the defendant to commit was not considered a defense for the charge of attempting to commit a felony, in this case murder. The defendant then appealed his judgment of conviction and sentence.  Decision  On appeal, the Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed Mitchell's conviction and sentence, holding that the objective itself was criminal in nature and only a circumstance unknown to the defendant prevented its completion. The court held that a person who shoots into the bed of another person on purpose, believing that person to be in the bed, is guilty of attempted murder. The court ruled that \\"when the consequences sought by a defendant are forbidden by law as criminal, it is not defense that the defendant could not succeed in reaching his goal because of circumstances unknown to him.\\"  Significance  This case is part of a body of law developed in the United States on the issue of how to handle attempt cases. In most United States jurisdictions, the defense that the act was a factual impossibility is not a valid defense. A case similar to this one is State v. Moretti 52 N.M. 182, 244 A.2d 499 (1968), in which the defendant agreed to perform a (then illegal) abortion upon a female undercover officer. Although the female police officer was not pregnant, the Supreme Court of New Mexico upheld the conviction: With few exceptions, all cases in which an attempt to commit a felony was impossible to carry out because the defendant was mistaken in fact have been categorized as factually impossible and the conviction was upheld on appeal.

The offensive consisted of a number of joint Coalition and Iraqi Army operations throughout northern Iraq as well as in the southern Baghdad Belts. The northern operation was designated Operation Iron Harvest. Its objective was to hunt down the remaining 200 Al-Qaeda extremists remaining in the province of Diyala following the end of the previous offensive. The operation also included targeting insurgent elements in Salah ad-Din province and Nineveh province. The southern operation was designated Operation Marne Thunderbolt and targeted insurgent safe havens in the belts to the south-east of Baghdad, particularly the Arab Jabour region. Additionally, Phantom Phoenix's aims were the remaining car, truck and suicide bomb networks in Baghdad as well as al- Qaeda‚Äôs financial network. Background In mid-October 2006, al-Qaeda announced the creation of Islamic state of Iraq (ISI), Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.183 replacing the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC) and its al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). According to Lt General Raymond Odierno, the goal of the operation was to provide security for the nine major cities in Iraq, with an emphasis on securing Baghdad. The operation built on the previous two major operations, Operation Phantom Thunder and Operation Phantom Strike, which were launched at the conclusion of the US troop build-up in June 2007, in order to eliminate insurgent safe havens throughout the Baghdad Belts and secure the population of Baghdad. =Coalition military units involved= MNF-I chart showing the focus of Operation Phantom Phoenix Multi-National Division-North *4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (BCT), 2nd Infantry Division - Diyala province. *3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment - Nineveh province. *1st BCT, 10th Mountain Division - Kirkuk area *1st BCT, 101st Airborne Division - Salah ad-Din province.

Following up on Operation Iron Reaper launched in November 2007, Iron Harvest consisted of two sub-operations: Operation Raider Harvest, carried out by the 4th BCT of the 2nd Infantry Division in Diyala province; and operation Warrior Harvest, carried out by the 1st BCT of the 10th Mountain Division in Kirkuk province (formerly At-Ta'mim province). During the first month of the operation, a contingent of US Marines supported the 4th BCT of the 2nd Infantry Division (Operation Raider Harvest). They were requested from MNF-W to provide support with MRAPs and ground forces. They assisted in conducting cordon-raids, convoy operations, patrols, and worked with US Army Special Forces. In the lead up to the operation an information blackout aimed at most of the MNF-I's New Iraqi Army comrades was implemented--it has been reported that the Iraqi army had previously used unencrypted forms of communications including regular cellphones and radio.U.S. Attack in Iraq Is No Surprise to Many Insurgents New York Times, 9 January 2008Six US troops die in Iraq blast BBC News, 9 January 2008 Following the communications blackout, American troops began a major offensive to drive Sunni insurgents from strongholds in the Diyala and Salah ad-Din provinces. Despite the preemptive measures, insurgents are believed to have gained prior knowledge of the operation plans and pulled out before the Americans arrived. It has been speculated by MNF-I commanders that militants may have been tipped off by communications leaks or by the visible movements of troops and machinery preceding the operation. However some insurgents remained in the province to engage the coalition troops in a possible attempt to delay further advances. Seven American battalions, accompanied by Iraqi Army units, advanced into a area in the northern Diyala River valley. Decoy operations were attempted in Baqubah and Wajihiya to the south to mislead the insurgents however advance units noticed an unusual number of women and children fleeing south in cars in the days before the operation. Insurgent fighters left the villages days before but some remained behind or returned to plant car bombs. During fighting in Diyala over the course of 24 hours up to 24 insurgents were killed and ten captured. In Salah ad-Din at the same time three US soldiers were killed and two wounded after their vehicle hit an IED.9 US Soldiers Killed in Iraq in 2 Days Associated Press, 10 January 2008 On the second day of the operation American troops involved in the operation suffered further casualties.

Also on the same day there was an attempted attack on the governor of Diyala province. Three security personnel were killed and two wounded when a bomb exploded at his residence. By day 16, Coalition troops cleared a key route between Baghdad and Baqubah of improvised explosive devices. The area of the road between Khan Bani Sa‚Äôad and Baqubah had been so heavily covered in IEDs that vehicles had to take other routes to get back and forth from Baghdad and Baqubah. It was also confirmed that 41 of all the insurgents killed in Diyala by then during the operation were al-Qaeda in Iraq operatives.Multi-National Force - Iraq - Iraqi Army, MND-North Soldiers open key route between Baghdad and Baqubah On day 19, Iraqi Security Forces, advised by US Special Forces, detained an extremist leader and a terrorist financier in separate operations in Safwan, Iraq. Iraqi and US forces also detained the leader of an extremist group believed to be responsible for mortar and explosive projectile attacks against Iraqi and Coalition Forces. By 10 February 2008 Coalition forces and Iraqi Security Forces had conducted 74 different operations at the company level and above as part of Iron Harvest. Seventy high-value individuals were captured or killed, in addition to hundreds of other lower-level enemy fighters. 430 weapons caches, 653 IEDs, 42 HBIEDs, 35 VBIEDs, and 3 VBIED factories were all found and cleared.Operation Iron Harvest  Institute for the Study of War On day 42, Iraqi army and police forces backed by US aircraft and fighters from local anti-Al-Qaida Awakening Council group carried out a raid at dawn on insurgent hideouts on the open areas near Lake Tharthar, 120 km north of Baghdad in Salah ad-Din province, on Saturday, killing 10 suspected insurgents, including a local leader, and capturing 4 others, a provincial police officer said.

The older bomber was dressed in traditional garb and allowed to enter the funeral freely. = Fighting in Ninawa and Kirkuk = As part of Operation Phantom Phoenix, security operations were conducted against Al-Qaeda's last major urban stronghold in the city of Mosul. An offensive was started in late January. A day after Iraqi reinforcements began arriving in the region, five US soldiers were killed when an American patrol was ambushed in the city. The offensive also included operations in the cities of Tal Afar and Kirkuk, also major urban centers in the north of the country. Operations were also conducted in the north-western Jazeera Desert between Mosul and the Syrian border, focusing on the towns of Baji and Sinjar. By late April Coalition forces had made small gains in the north and intelligence reports suggested that Al-Qaeda was regrouping and infiltrating squads of suicide bombers into Baghdad from the north. In mid-May, a major Iraqi military operation codenamed Operation Lion's Roar (later renamed to Operation Mother of Two Springs) was conducted in Mosul which resulted in the capture of 1,480 insurgents, 300 of them wanted suspects. The operation ended by late May and with it the Ninawa and Kirkuk provinces were declared secured by the Iraqi Army. However, in early June remnant insurgent forces conducted a string of suicide bombings in the north leaving dozens of people dead, many of them members of the security forces. The US military also came under attack in the Hawija area, south of Kirkuk, leaving four soldiers dead and 20 more wounded in two separate attacks within a four-day period. By late that month it was reported that all security gains made by the security forces during operation Lion's Roar had disintegrated. Insurgents managed to re-enter the city and gunmen were seen roaming the streets in force. =Southern Iraq= On 8 January, Operation Marne Thunderbolt was launched by Multi-National Center (MND-C) and was the largest operation carried out by the 3rd Infantry Division to date. Its objective was to eliminate al Qaida in Iraq safe havens in Arab Jabour. The operation was spearheaded by the 5th squadron of the 7th Cavalry regiment. It is notable for the unusual amount of air power used during the operation. US soldiers and Sunni Arab tribesmen scan for enemy activity in a farm field in southern Arab Jabour, following an air assault as part of Operation Browning, 20 January 2008 On day three of the offensive two B-1 bombers and four F-16 fighters carried out massive air-strikes on Arab Jabour, a Sunni district on the southern outskirts of Baghdad. Arab Jabour, a mainly rural district, was one of a few areas of Baghdad that remained under the control of insurgents after Operation Law and Order the previous year. The planes dropped 47 bombs on targets in Arab Jabour in ten separate strikes. The entire raid lasted for ten minutes and the total tonnage of the bombs was 40,000 pounds (18,100 kg).US launches massive Iraq air raid BBC News, 10 January 2008 The 40 targets hit in the huge barrage of air-strikes consisted mainly of large weapons caches, explosives, tunnels and powerful roadside bombs buried deep underground ‚Äì key defensive elements for Al Qaeda in Iraq insurgents reported Army Col. Terry Ferrell. After the raids ground operations followed up and 12 suspected insurgents were captured near Arab Jabour. On day 14, US warplanes pounded suspected Al-Qaeda havens and weapons caches in Arab Jabour for the third time since the operation began, hitting more than 30 targets in a 35-bomb blitz, the military said. The mainly Sunni Arab Jabour rural area was hit with bombs weighing a total of 19,000 pounds (9,000 kilograms) during the air raids, which aimed to destroy roadside bombs arms caches, and Al-Qaeda havens a military statement said. The raid follows two previous air strikes in the same area on 10 and 16 January. A total of nearly 100 targets were hit with a combined weight of 98,000 pounds of bombs during the three air strikes.DefenseLink News Article: Coalition Completes Aerial Bomb Blitz of Al Qaeda Sanctuary On 15 February 2008, MND-C transitioned from Marne Thunderbolt to Marne Grand Slam. During the initial phase of the operation, the 3rd BCT of the 3rd Infantry Division established a new Combat Outpost in Salman Pak, an area that was a stronghold of the Republican Guard before the war. Coalition forces also established a government center in the area and introduced hundreds of thousands of dollars in micro-grants to rebuild local markets.DefenseLink News Article: Operation ‚ÄòMarne Grand Slam‚Äô Produces Military, Civic Success On 15 March, the Iraqi Army, with support from a US Military transition team from the 3rd Infantry Division, launched Operation Marne Rugged in the Tigris River valley southeast of the Arab Jabour and Salman Pak regions. The goal of the operation was to secure the approaches to MND-C's area of operations, particularly to control river crossings given the poor condition of bridges and canals in the area.Multi-National Force - Iraq - Operation Marne Rugged Kicks Off South of Baghdad On 10 April, Iraqi Army soldiers discovered 33 bodies in a mass grave in Mahmudiyah.

Heavy casualties were sustained on both sides. Although the Coalition military suffered just over 60 dead, the Iraqi security forces and the Awakening Councils forces suffered more than 770 dead and more than a dozen missing or captured. The insurgents suffered almost 900 dead and more than 2,500 were captured. Diyala province had been almost entirely cleared of insurgent forces. On 29 July, the Iraqi security forces started their own offensive in Diyala province and stated the operation would last for two weeks and will result in the final establishing of law and order in the province. However, in the north the situation was totally different. After Coalition operations initially beat back the insurgents in the northern Ninawa and Kirkuk provinces the rebels came back and heavy fighting was still going on for the north by the end of operation Phantom Phoenix with the security forces still not being able to overcome the last insurgent stronghold in the north, Mosul.

Following graduation was commissioned an officer in the United States Marine Corps in Vietnam, where he served as a platoon commander in 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines. On March 16, 1967, Castille was conducting a search and destroy mission with his company in Duc Pho, Quang Ngai Province, when they came under attack from a Viet Cong battalion. During the fighting Castille was seriously wounded and fell, unable to move. One of his Marines, Angel Mendez, shielded him and then carried him to friendly lines, which were more than seventy-five meters away. During this action Mendez was hit in the shoulder, and two of his comrades rushed to help him with Castille, but Mendez refused to let go of Castille and chose to act as rear man. Mendez continued to shield his lieutenant with his own body until he was mortally wounded. For his actions Mendez was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and promoted to sergeant.

In 1985 he was elected District Attorney of Philadelphia and served from January, 1986 through 1991, when he ran for Mayor of Philadelphia. He narrowly lost in the Republican primary to former Democratic Mayor Frank Rizzo by 47,523 votes (36.45%) to 46,094 (35.35%). Prior to his election to the Supreme Court, he was in private practice as a civil litigator for Reed Smith Shaw & McClay in Philadelphia. He was elected to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1993. On January 14, 2008, Castille was sworn in as Chief Justice of Pennsylvania. He retired at the mandatory age of 70 on March 16, 2014. Castille was elected to membership in the American Law Institute in 2014. While Chief Justice, in his capacity as head administrator of the Pennsylvania courts, he hired Jeffrey B. Rotwitt to act as the courts' attorney in a project to build a new family courthouse in Philadelphia County. Journalists at The Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that Rotwitt was simultaneously acting as a business partner of the construction project's developer and was therefore involved on both sides of the transaction. Castille later claimed to have been duped by Rotwitt. In 2012, Castille, a Republican, cast the deciding vote against the Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission's redistricting map, siding with his Democratic colleagues. In his opinion, Castille wrote that the map split too many municipalities. He also wrote the unanimous opinion upholding the LRC's revised redistricting maps in 2013. As district attorney, Castille frequently sought the death penalty, a point he used during his campaign for the Supreme Court. Castille personally authorized seeking the death penalty against Terry Williams, who had killed two men who sexually abused him as a child, but the sentence was overturned 25 years later because the prosecution deliberately withheld key facts. Castille's Supreme Court reinstated the sentence in 2015. On June 9, 2016, the US Supreme Court concluded in Williams v. Pennsylvania, that \\"Chief Justice Castille's failure to recuse from Williams's case presented an unconstitutional risk of bias.\\" Awards and decorations Among Ron Castille's awards and decorations are the following: *60px Bronze Star (with Combat Valor Device) *60px Purple Heart *60px Navy Presidential Unit Citation *60px Navy Unit Commendation *60px Combat Action Ribbon *60px National Defense Service Medal *60px Vietnam Service Medal *60px Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross *60px Vietnam Campaign Medal See also * Angel Mendez NotesReferences * Official State of Pennsylvania Supreme Court profile External Links * with Ron Castille by Stephen McKiernan, Binghamton University Libraries Center for the Study of the 1960s, July 16, 1997 Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania Category:Chief Justices of Pennsylvania Category:District Attorneys of Philadelphia Category:American prosecutors Category:American amputees Category:Pennsylvania Republicans Category:United States Marine Corps personnel of the Vietnam War Category:United States Marine Corps officers Category:People from Miami Category:Auburn University alumni Category:University of Virginia School of Law alumni Category:American politicians with physical disabilities ","title":"Ronald D.

Early childhood Williams is a New York painter with roots in the American South. He spent his early childhood in Spring Lake, North Carolina.David Driskell, \\"An Unending Visual Odyssey\\". =New York: late 1950s= After the family's move to the North, his art talent was recognized by the head of a local community center, who gave him a room there to use as a studio. He attended the School of Industrial Art in Manhattan (now the High School of Art and Design), which held many of its classes at the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1962 Williams entered Pratt Institute to study painting. During his junior year, he won a summer scholarship to The Skowhegan School of Art and received a National Endowment for the Arts traveling grant. College years He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in 1966 and studied at The Skowhegan School of Art. In 1968 he received a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree from Yale University School of Art and Architecture. Williams quickly gained attention from the mainstream art world. The Museum of Modern Art acquired his composition \\"Elbert Jackson L.A.M.F., Part II\\" in 1969, and by 1970 his work was being exhibited at the Fondation Maeght in the south of France. =Art school= After his formal education at Pratt Institute and Yale University in the 1960s in the visual arts curriculum, he investigated the physical boundaries one finds uncommon to explorations in the science of color, setting for himself the standard of achieving in his work an inherent completeness out of the reach of other painters. =The late 1960s= Trane, 1969, col. Studio Museum in Harlem In 1969 he participated in The Black Artist in America: A Symposium, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He also took part in numerous exhibitions including the Studio Museum in Harlem's Inaugural Show, X to the Fourth Power, and New Acquisitions held at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1970 Williams was commissioned by the Jewish Museum (New York), and the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas. =Founding the Artist-in-Residence at the Studio Museum= \\"The trustees of the Studio Museum in Harlem read my proposal, interviewed me and hired me to start an Artist-in-Residence program. That program had its start at the first site of the Museum over the liquor store on Fifth Avenue (2033 Fifth Avenue). It was a loft, a factory going out of business that had a lot of sewing machines in it. Mel Edwards and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program. That was the beginning. I wanted to create a context, namely an Artist-in-Residence program, through which money could be funnelled to artists which would allow them to ponder the kinds of issues and questions that come up in a graduate program.\\" Kinshasa Conwill, former director of the museum, says that the program \\"has become critical to the museum's identity and its contribution to the larger art arena.\\" =Reese Palley installation= Williams' first one- man show at New York's Reese Palley Gallery in 1971 resulted in the sale of every painting. The same year, the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited his work twice; collectors such as AT&T; and General Mills purchased his art; and his work was featured in both Life and Time magazines. Valerie J. Mercer The 1970s: new inspiration Williams returned home to the dusty unpaved roads of North Carolina for the inspiration of a new palette, one born of the luster and glow of mica, false gold, and fox fire from earth's pulsating cover. Williams' relief from color-field painting was celebrated in the new works completed between 1971‚Äì77, such as Equinox and Indian Summer. In 1975 William also took part in an artist in residence program at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. =FESTAC Festival= In 1977, Williams participated in the second World Festival of Black Arts and African Culture in Lagos, Nigeria (FESTAC). This festival brought together more than 17,000 artists of African descent from 59 countries. It was the largest cultural event ever held on the African continent. The 1980s=Early exhibitions= In 1982 Williams was included in Recent Acquisitions of the Schomburg Collection at the Schomburg Center in New York. In 1984 William took part in a show titled Since the Harlem Renaissance, which traveled to the University of Maryland, Bucknell University and the State University of New York at Old Westbury. It also traveled to the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York, and the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, Virginia. =1987: Exhibit at the Smithsonian= Equinox, 1987 In 1987 William received the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship.

The show organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and the Studio Museum in Harlem in New York traveled to eight major museums including the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, Fisk University, Duke University and Hampton Universities Art museums. =Jazz at Lincoln Center= In 1994 Williams participated in a Jazz at Lincoln Center program titled \\"Swing Landscapes: Jazz Visualized\\". The intent of the Jazz Talk program was to explore what it is about jazz that makes its colors, rhythms and characters so attractive to the painter's eye. Williams and author, Alfred Appel, Jr. discussed the influence of jazz on modern art. This program was part of a New York Citywide celebration honoring the artist Romare Bearden. Current events=Receives award for Lifetime Achievement= In 2005, Williams was invited to create a print at the Brandywine Workshop in conjunction with receiving the James Van Der Zee Award for Lifetime Achievement. Between July and late August he made five trips to Philadelphia, staying several days at a time. These trips yielded four editions and a number of unique hand-colored prints. The Brandywine Workshop located in Philadelphia was founded in 1972 to promote interest and talent in printmaking while cultivating cultural diversity in the arts. =Printmaking at Lafayette College= In 2006, Williams was a visiting scholar and artist in residence at Lafayette College's Experimental Printmaking Institute (EPI), which included Williams lecture about his work sponsored by the David L. Sr. and Helen J. Temple Visiting Lecture Series Fund.

The degree combines the study of global economics, history, politics and social relations with the study of languages and cultures in a rigorous multidisciplinary curriculum. In addition to a regional focus (Latin America, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia), Croft students select a thematic concentration on one of the following: global economics and business, international governance and politics, or social and cultural identity. Croft students, more commonly known as \\"Crofties\\", pursue advanced proficiency in one of ten foreign languages as an integral part of their studies: Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, or Spanish. The University of Mississippi has one of the nation's top Flagship Intensive Chinese programs, sponsored by the U.S. government. Chinese - Modern Languages Department - The University of Mississippi The Intensive Arabic program also expects students to reach levels of proficiency similar to those in a flagship program. Accelerated language programs are available in German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The Croft Institute for International Studies at The University of Mississippi was established in 1997 with major financial support from the Joseph C. Bancroft Charitable & Educational Fund. The Croft Institute's first full year of operation was the academic year 1998/99. The Croft Institute offers ten Croft scholarships of $8,000 dollars for four years to entering students each year. It also offers several other scholarships. Admission to the Institute is selective.  Director  The Executive Director of the Croft Institute is Dr. Oliver Dinius, a professor of modern Latin American History. His research focuses on the history of social and economic development, above all in 20th-century Brazil. He earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University. Dr. Will Schenck is the Associate Director of the Croft Institute. He received his BA in History summa cum laude from Boston College in 1999. He completed his Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures at Boston College with a concentration in French and Italian Medieval Literature in 2008 and holds a Masters in French Literature and Civilization from the University of Paris III in France. During their free time, both directors can be found swimming in the Turner Center.  Faculty  There are currently 14 Croft professors with joint appointments in the departments of Anthropology, Economics, History, Modern languages, Political Science, and Sociology. Other faculty from those and other disciplines (including law and mathematics) regularly offer classes for the Croft Institute. These professors are all active researchers in their fields and have published many books and articles in their areas of specialization.  Students  The Croft Institute currently has 219 students (East Asia: 45, Europe: 91, Latin America: 54, Middle East: 29). The average ACT score of the Croft student body is 31. A group of 13 students, 3 from each cohort and one member-at-large, represent the program as the Croft Senate. The group hosts biweekly meetings, plans events (most notably, Crom), promotes philanthropy, and serves as a communication pathway between students and faculty.  Alumni  The majority of Croft alumni will obtain one or more graduate degrees at some point in their careers, typically a Masters or J.D., but occasionally a doctorate or even medical degree. About half of graduates work in the private sector, while the rest are split between education, the non-profit sector, and local, state, and national governments. In the private sector, they work for large public corporations, small start-ups, and everything in between, serving as managers, analysts, marketers, entrepreneurs, and more. Many of our graduates go on to study law and work as attorneys or legal counsel. In the field of education, about half of our alumni are professors, teachers and researchers, while the other half are administrators or advisors. The Croft graduates who work for non-profit organizations are involved in fields ranging from the arts, the environment, international development, and education to health care, human rights, and legal services. Many of our alumni who work in the public sector serve in our nation's military, while others work for the State Department, Congress, and other federal, state, local, or international agencies. Alumni can join an extensive alumni network upon graduation and are encouraged to offer insight to current students, whether through a mentorship program, webinars, or Croft- hosted speaking events.

Saylor (born December 14, 1946) is the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania. He is a member of the Republican Party. Prior to his election to the Supreme Court, he served as a judge of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. He was born in Meyersdale, Somerset County, Pennsylvania. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Virginia in 1969, a Juris Doctor from the Columbia University School of Law in 1972, and a Master of Laws from the University of Virginia School of Law in 2004. Saylor worked as a prosecutor in Somerset County from 1972 to 1982, before serving as a Director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Consumer Protection from 1982 to 1983. He was First Deputy Attorney General for Pennsylvania from 1983 to 1987, and served on the Superior Court of Pennsylvania from 1993 to 1997. Saylor began service as a justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on January 1, 1997, and became Chief Justice in 2015, when Ronald D. Castille left the court on reaching the mandatory retirement age. In August 2018, Saylor wrote for the majority when it found that the criminal conviction of a rapper for making a song entitled \\"Fuck the Police\\" did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because, he determined, the song contained true threats.. According to Common Pleas Judge Barry Feudale, Saylor complained to him that African American former Supreme Court Justice Cynthia Baldwin had \\"caused us a lot of trouble when she was on the Supreme Court because of her minority agenda.‚Äù In a 2019 affidavit, Feudale, who presided over the grand jury that indicted Jerry Sandusky during the Penn State child sex abuse scandal when Baldwin was the general counsel for Pennsylvania State University, suggested that Saylor was using alleged technical errors Baldwin had made during the case as a pretext for disciplinary hearings that were actually intended as harassment.

It was the third building to serve as the courthouse for Marengo County, Alabama, out of a total of five purpose-built courthouses. The courthouse was the site of a notable event on 9 October 1890 when nationally infamous train-robber and outlaw Reuben Houston \\"Rube\\" Burrow was shot and killed in the street in front of the building. History After Marengo became a county in 1818, the first building to serve as a courthouse was a simple one-room log cabin. This was too small to meet the needs of the county and on 25 May 1825 the county commissioners met and resolved to have a new two-story structure built on Cahaba Avenue, Linden's business district at that time. This second courthouse was finished in 1827 and was used until it burned in 1848. This saw the construction of the third building in 1850, on the site of the old. The new building would serve as the courthouse continuously, except for a brief period during Federal Reconstruction when the county seat was moved to Demopolis, until 1902. In 1902, the county commissioners decided that a much larger courthouse was needed. They also decided that a better location was needed, as the business district of Linden had shifted to a location about a mile to the southeast. A new three-story Richardsonian Romanesque style courthouse with a five-story clock tower was then built at the corner of North Main Street and East Coats Avenue, leaving the old courthouse for use as a public school. In 1915 the building was purchased by the Missionary Society of Linden Baptist Church, for use as a church. In 1949 the building was sold to the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization for use as a meeting hall. From the 1960s until the present the building has sat largely empty and unused.

Two days later when he sees her husband neglects her just before going to a concert on the ship, he goes and tells her they should run away together because they love each other. She explains she can't because she is ill. She gives him a box that he shall only open sometime later, when she tells him to by letter.

The original line-up split up in the mid-1980s, but the band carried on into the 1990s. History The band was formed in 1980 by drummer Paul \\"Hammy\\" Halmshaw and guitarist Simon Mooney, both students at Thornhill High School, and the line-up was completed by Simon \\"Semi\\" Bridgewater (vocals) and Nicky Djorjevic (bass Guitar).Glasper, Ian (2006) The Day The Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980-1984, Cherry Red Books, , p. 402-7 They took the name Instigators on the suggestion of Ritchie Calvert of the band Disintegrated. The band's first live performance was in summer 1982. Influences on the band included Crass and Flux of Pink Indians. Djorjevic left to be replaced by \\"Tompo\\", who only lasted a few months, playing on the band's first demo, before being replaced himself by Simon \\"Tab\\" Elsey. Bridgewater also left for a short time and later became a Web Developer, his replacement Daz Dean. The band's demo got the band a support slot for Flux of Pink Indians in November 1982, and they recorded two further demos, all three getting released on a cassette on Halmshaw's Peaceville Records label, gaining the band more fans. Barbara Drye also added some further input into the band by singing a couple of songs with 'Aggression' been one of them. The band were given another support slot in May 1983, opening for Subhumans in Bradford, a performance that was recorded by Subhumans vocalist Dick Lucas and released through his Bluurg label. Bluurg also released the band's first EP, The Blood is on Your Hands, which reached number 21 on the UK Independent Chart.Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 120 The 1985 LP release Nobody Listens Anymore increased their popularity, reaching number 18 on the Indie Albums Chart, and securing them a spot on Pusmort's Cleanse the Bacteria compilation LP. Bridgewater left later that year after an argument, and the band recruited Andy \\"Tez\\" Turner (formerly of Xpozez) as his replacement. Halmshaw and Elsey also soon left, with Mooney and Turner continuing with Andrew \\"Trimble\\" Turnbull (Also formerly of Xpozez) on bass guitar and Steve \\"Cuzzy\\" Curran on drums. The band's sound changed with the new line-up, taking on a more American influence. They went on to tour Europe and the United States and continued into the 1990s.

In 1604, he was appointed picture maker to the heir to the throne, Prince Henry; and in 1607, serjeant-painter to King James I ‚Äì a post he shared with John De Critz.Strong, Roy C. \\"Elizabethan Painting: An Approach Through Inscriptions, 1: Robert Peake the Elder\\", The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 105, No. 719 (February 1963), 53‚Äì57 (retrieved 12 January 2008). Peake is often called \\"the elder\\", to distinguish him from his son, the painter and print seller William Peake (c. 1580‚Äì1639) and from his grandson, Sir Robert Peake (c. 1605‚Äì67), who followed his father into the family print-selling business.In the accounts for Prince Henry's funeral, Robert Peake is called \\"Mr Peake the elder painter\\" and William Peake \\"Mr Peake the younger painter\\". Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 155. ‚Ä¢ Peake‚Äôs grandson Sir Robert Peake (sometimes wrongly called his son) was knighted by King Charles I during the English Civil War. The Parliamentarians captured him after their siege of Basing House, which was under his command. Walpole, Anecdotes of Painting, 221. Peake was the only English-born painter of a group of four artists whose workshops were closely connected. The others were De Critz, Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, and the miniature painter Isaac Oliver. Between 1590 and about 1625, they specialised in brilliantly coloured, full-length \\"costume pieces\\" that are unique to England at this time.\\"There is nothing like them in contemporary European painting\\". Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 41. It is not always possible to attribute authorship between Peake, De Critz, Gheeraerts and their assistants with certainty.Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 41. Career=Early life and work= Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers (see below under Paintings) Peake was born to a Lincolnshire family in about 1551.Hearn, Dynasties, 186. He began his training on 30 April 1565 under Laurence Woodham,Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 153. who lived at the sign of \\"The Key\\" in Goldsmith's Row, Westcheap.\\"The Key\\" would have been a sign, identifying Woodham's shop and house, as was usual before street-numbering. He was apprenticed, three years after the miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard, to the Goldsmiths‚Äô Company in London.It was once assumed that Peake was much younger than Hilliard: in 1969, art historian Roy Strong called him Hilliard‚Äôs \\"most important follower among the younger generation\\" (The English Icon, 19). Edmond, \\"New Light on Jacobean Painters\\", 74. He became a freeman of the company on 20 May 1576. His son William later followed in his father's footsteps as a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company and a portrait painter.Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 153. Peake's training would have been similar to that of John de Critz and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, who may have been pupils of the Flemish artist Lucas de Heere.Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 43. Peake is first heard of professionally in 1576 in the pay of the Office of the Revels, the department that oversaw court festivities for Elizabeth I. When Peake began practising as a portrait painter is uncertain.Weiss (2001 and 2006) judges Peake's earliest attributed works to be the portraits of Arthur, Lord Grey de Wilton, and Humphrey Wingfield, dated 1587, following Strong's English Icon of 1969. The portrait of Anne Knollys attributed to Peake in the Berger Collection at the Denver Art Museum, however, bears Peake's characteristic inscription and is dated 1582. According to art historian Roy Strong, he was \\"well established\\" in London by the late 1580s, with a \\"fashionable clientele\\".Strong, English Icon, 225. Payments made to him for portraits are recorded in the Rutland accounts at Belvoir in the 1590s.Strong, \\"An Approach Through Inscriptions\\", 53. A signed portrait from 1593, known as the \\"Military Commander\\", shows Peake's early style. Other portraits have been grouped with it on the basis of similar lettering. Its three-quarter-length portrait format is typical of the time. =Painter to Prince Henry= In 1607, after the death of Leonard Fryer,Fryer had been serjeant-painter since 1595. Peake was appointed serjeant-painter to King James I, sharing the office with John De Critz, who had held the post since 1603. The role entailed the painting of original portraits and their reproduction as new versions, to be given as gifts or sent to foreign courts, as well as the copying and restoring of portraits by other painters in the royal collection. In addition to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, such as the painting of banners and stage scenery.Gaunt, Court Painting in England, 53. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake's work is not recorded there, it seems as if De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.Perrin, W. G., The Autobiography of Phineas Petit, NRS (1918), p.77, & Appendix v., pp.207-210, painting account Prince Henry, c. 1610. His foot rests on a shield bearing the device of the Prince of Wales, a title conferred on him the same year. In 1610, Peake was described as \\"painter to Prince Henry\\", the sixteen-year-old prince who was gathering around him a significant cultural salon. Peake commissioned a translation of Books I-V of Sebastiano Serlio's Architettura, which he dedicated to the prince in 1611. Scholars have deduced from payments made to Peake that his position as painter to Prince Henry led to his appointment as serjeant-painter to the king. The payments were listed by the Prince's household officer Sir David Murray as disbursements from the Privy Purse to \\"Mr Peck\\". On 14 October 1608, Peake was paid ¬£7 for \\"pictures made by His Highness‚Äô command\\"; and on 14 July 1609, he was paid ¬£3 \\"for a picture of His Highness which was given in exchange for the King‚Äôs picture\\". At about the same time, Isaac Oliver was paid ¬£5.10s.0d. for each of three miniatures of the prince. Murray's accounts reveal, however, that the prince was paying more for tennis balls than for any picture.Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 153. In April 1509, the prince paid ¬£8 for tennis balls, in May ¬£7.10s.0d., and in June ¬£8.14s.0d . Peake is also listed in Sir David Murray's accounts for the period between 1 October 1610 and 6 November 1612, drawn up to the day on which Henry, Prince of Wales, died, possibly of typhoid fever,Letter writer John Chamberlain (1553‚Äì1628) recorded: \\"It was verily thought that the disease was no other than the ordinary ague that had reigned and raged all over England. . . . The extremity of the disease seemed to lie in his head, for remedy whereof they shaved him and applied warm cocks and pigeons newly killed, but with no success\\". Letter to Dudley Carleton, 12 November 1612. Chamberlain Letters, 67‚Äì68. ‚Ä¢ Historian Alan Stewart notes that latter-day experts have suggested enteric fever, typhoid fever, or porphyria, but that poison was the most popular explanation at the time. Stewart, Cradle King, 248. at the age of eighteen: \\"To Mr Peake for pictures and frames ¬£12; two great pictures of the Prince in arms at length sent beyond the seas ¬£50; and to him for washing, scouring and dressing of pictures and making of frames ¬£20.4s.0d\\".Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 154. The relatively high price for the two pictures of the prince in arms (armour) may have been due to the use of gold or silver on the details. Peake is listed in the accounts for Henry's funeral under \\"Artificers and officers of the Works\\" as \\"Mr Peake the elder painter\\". For the occasion, he was allotted seven yards of mourning cloth, plus four for a servant. Also listed is \\"Mr Peake the younger painter\\", meaning Robert's son William, who was allotted four yards of mourning cloth.Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 155. After the prince's death, Peake moved on to the household of Henry's brother, Charles, Duke of York, the future Charles I of England. The accounts for 1616, which call Peake the prince's painter, record that he was paid ¬£35 for \\"three several pictures of his Highness\\".Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 174. On 10 July 1613, he was paid ¬£13.6s.8d. by the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, \\"in full satisfaction for Prince Charles his picture\\", for a full- length portrait which is still in the Cambridge University Library.Hearn, Dynasties, 189. =Death= Peake died in 1619, probably in mid-October. Until relatively recently, it was believed that Peake died later. Erna Auerbach, Tudor Artists, London, 1954, p. 148, put his death at around 1625, for example. The catalogue for The Age of Charles I exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1972, p. 89, suggested Peake was active as late as 1635. His will was made on 10 October 1619 and proved on the 16th.Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 170, 212. The date of his burial is unknown because the Great Fire of London later destroyed the registers of his parish church, St Sepulchre-without- Newgate.Edmond, \\"New Light on Jacobean Painters\\", 74. Artist William Larkin‚Äôs records were burned at the same time. This was a time of several deaths in the artistic community. Nicholas Hilliard had died in January; Queen Anne, who had done so much to patronise the arts, in March; and the painter William Larkin, Peake's neighbour, in April or May.Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 170. Though James I reigned until 1625, art historian Roy Strong considers that the year 1619 \\"can satisfactorily be accepted as the terminal date of Jacobean painting\\".Quoted by Edmond, \\"New Light on Jacobean Painters\\", 74. Paintings Inscription on the portrait of Anne Knollys It is difficult to attribute and date portraits of this period because painters rarely signed their work, and their workshops produced portraits en masse, often sharing standard portrait patterns. Some paintings, however, have been attributed to Peake on the basis of the method of inscribing the year and the sitter's age on his documented portrait of a \\"military commander\\" (1592), which reads: \\"M.BY.RO. PEAKE\\" (\\"made by Robert Peake\\").See Strong, \\"An Approach Through Inscriptions\\", 53‚Äì7, and The English Icon, 225‚Äì54. Art historian Ellis Waterhouse, however, suspected that the letterer may have worked for more than one studio.Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 42‚Äì3. =Procession Picture= The Procession Picture (detail), c. 1600 The painting known as Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601, or simply The Procession Picture (see illustration), is now often accepted as the work of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it \\"one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age\\".Strong, Cult of Elizabeth, 17. It is an example of the convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an icon, portraying her as much younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, \\"[t]his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of herself to her adoring subjects\\". George Vertue, the eighteenth-century antiquarian, called the painting \\"not well nor ill done\\".Vertue's Notebooks, quoted by Strong, Cult of Elizabeth, 20. Strong reveals that the procession was connected to the marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen's six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600.Strong, Cult of Elizabeth, 23‚Äì30. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir.Strong, Cult of Elizabeth, 41. The castles alluded to are Chepstow and Raglan on the Welsh borders. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen's Horse in 1601.For a detailed analysis, see Strong, \\"The Queen: Eliza Triumphans\\", in The Cult of Elizabeth, 17‚Äì55. Peake clearly did not paint the queen, or indeed the courtiers, from life but from the \\"types\\" or standard portraits used by the workshops of the day. Portraits of the queen were subject to restrictions, and from about 1594 there seems to have been an official policy that she always be depicted as youthful. In 1594, the Privy council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen be found and destroyed, since they caused Elizabeth \\"great offence\\".Strong, Gloriana, 147. ‚Ä¢ Haigh, Elizabeth I, 153‚Äì54. The famous Ditchley portrait (c. 1592), by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, was used as a type, sometimes called the \\"Mask of Youth\\" face-pattern, for the remainder of the reign. It is clear that Gheeraerts' portrait provided the pattern for the queen's image in the procession picture.Strong, Gloriana, 148. Other figures also show signs of being traced from patterns, leading to infelicities of perspective and proportion.Strong, Gloriana, 155. Princess Elizabeth, later Queen of Bohemia, 1606; her grandson inherited the English throne as George I. =Full-length portraits= At the beginning of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation.Christopher Brown, \\"The Turn of the Sixteenth Century\\", in Hearn, Dynasties, 171. Peake was one of those who met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.John Sheeran, Biography of Robert Peake at the Tate Collection (retrieved 1 January 2008) In 1603, he painted a double portrait, now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, of the prince and his boyhood friend John Harington, son of Lord Harington of Exton (see above). The double portrait is set outdoors, a style introduced by Gheeraerts in the 1590s, and Peake's combination of figures with animals and landscape also foreshadows the genre of the sporting picture. The country location and recreational subject lend the painting an air of informality. The action is natural to the setting, a fenced deer-park with a castle and town in the distance. Harington holds a wounded stag by the antlers as Henry draws his sword to deliver the coup de gr√¢ce. The prince wears at his belt a jewel of St George slaying the dragon, an allusion to his role as defender of the realm. His sword is an attribute of kingship, and the young noble kneels in his service.Kitson, British Painting, 1600‚Äì1800, 13. ‚Ä¢ Strong English Icon, 234. The stag is a fallow deer, a non-native species kept at that time in royal parks for hunting. A variant of this painting in the Royal Collection, painted c. 1605, features Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, in the place of John Harington and displays the Devereux arms.Strong, English Icon, 246.The coats-of-arms of the principals shown hanging from branches may reflect knowledge of the work of Lucas Cranach the Elder, who frequently used this motif, and painted portraits of Saxon and Habsburg princes hunting. In the same year, Peake also painted his first portrait of James I's only surviving daughter, Elizabeth. This work, like the double portrait, for which it might be a companion piece, appears to have been painted for the Harington family, who acted as Elizabeth's guardians from 1603 to 1608.Hearn, Dynasties, 185. It was the custom for royal children to be raised in the homes of noble families. Elizabeth lived with the Harington family at Coombe Abbey, near Coventry. Lord Harington died at Worms in 1613 on his way back from escorting her to Heidelberg with her new husband Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Lady Harington attended Elizabeth at Heidelberg from 1616 almost until her own death in 1618. In the background of Elizabeth's portrait is a hunting scene echoing that of the double portrait, and two ladies sit on an artificial mound of a type fashionable in garden design at the time.Hearn, Dynasties, 185. Peake again painted Henry outdoors in about 1610. In this portrait, now at the Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed as a young man of action, about to draw a jewel- encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.Hearn, Dynasties, 187‚Äì88. Maria never married; she entered a Franciscan convent in 1629. James I's daughter Elizabeth was also a valuable marriage pawn. She too was offered to Savoy, as a bride for the Prince of Piedmont, the heir of Charles Emanuel. The exchange of portraits as part of royal marriage proposals was the practice of the day and provided regular work for the royal painters and their workshops. Prince Henry commissioned portraits from Peake to send them to the various foreign courts with which marriage negotiations were underway. The prince's accounts show, for example, that the two portraits Peake painted of him in arms in 1611‚Äì12 were \\"sent beyond the seas\\".Hearn, Dynasties, 188. ‚Ä¢ Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 154. Time was revealed after cleaning. A surviving portrait from this time shows the prince in armour, mounted on a white horse and pulling the winged figure of Father Time by the forelock.Hearn, Dynasties, 188. Art historian John Sheeran suggests this is a classical allusion that signifies opportunity. The old man carries Henry's lance and plumed helmet; and scholar Chris Caple points out that his pose is similar to that of Albrecht D√ºrer's figure of death in Knight, Death and the Devil (1513).Caple, Objects, 88‚Äì91. ‚Ä¢ Knight, Death and the Devil, by Albrecht D√ºrer, 1513 He also observes that the old man was painted later than other components of the painting, since the bricks of the wall show through his wings. When the painting was restored in 1985, the wall and the figure of time were revealed to modern eyes for the first time, having been painted over at some point in the seventeenth century by other hands than Peake's. The painting has also been cut down, the only original canvas edge being that on the left.Caple, Objects, 88‚Äì91. ‚Ä¢ Unrestored version of Henry, Prince of Wales, on Horseback =Lady Elizabeth Pope= Lady Elizabeth Pope, wearing a draped mantle and matching turban, c. 1615 Peake's portrait of Lady Elizabeth Pope may have been commissioned by her husband, Sir William Pope, to commemorate their marriage in 1615. Lady Elizabeth is portrayed with her hair loose, a symbol of bridal virginity.Brides of the time are often described as appearing \\"in their hair\\". For example, John Chamberlain wrote to Alice Carleton that Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset, was \\"married in her hair\\" to her second husband Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, having recently divorced her first husband, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, on the grounds of his impotence. Letter to Alice Carleton, 13 December 1613. Chamberlain Letters, 116. ‚Ä¢ See also Stewart, Cradle King, 113. She wears a draped mantle‚Äîembroidered with seed pearls in a pattern of ostrich plumes‚Äîand a matching turban. The mantle knotted on one shoulder was worn in Jacobean court masques, as the costume designs of Inigo Jones indicate. The painting's near-nudity, however, makes the depiction of an actual masque costume unlikely.Chirelstein, \\"Lady Elizabeth Pope: The Heraldic Body\\", in Renaissance Bodies, 36‚Äì59. ‚Ä¢ Ribeiro, Fashion and Fiction, 89. Loose hair and the classical draped mantle also figure in contemporary personifications of abstract concepts in masques and paintings. Yale art historian Ellen Chirelstein argues that Peake is portraying Lady Elizabeth as a personification of America, since her father, Sir Thomas Watson, was a major shareholder in the Virginia Company.Chirelstein, \\"Lady Elizabeth Pope: The Heraldic Body\\", in Renaissance Bodies, 36‚Äì59. =Assessment= Prince Charles, as Duke of York, commissioned for the University of Cambridge, 1613 In 1598, Francis Meres, in his Palladis Tamia, included Peake on a list of the best English artists. In 1612, Henry Peacham wrote in The Gentleman's Exercise that his \\"good friend Mr Peake\\", along with Marcus Gheeraerts, was outstanding \\"for oil colours\\".He also judged that Nicholas Hilliard and Isaac Oliver were \\"inferior to none in Christendom for the countenance in small\\" (miniature portraits). Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 168. Ellis Waterhouse suggested that the genre of elaborate costume pieces was as much a decorative as a plastic art. He notes that these works, the \\"enamelled brilliance\\" of which has become apparent through cleaning, are unique in European art and deserve respect. They were produced chiefly by the workshops of Peake, Gheeraerts the Younger, and De Critz. Sheeran detects the influence of Hilliard's brightly patterned and coloured miniatures in Peake's work and places Peake firmly in the \\"iconic tradition of late Elizabethan painting\\". He employed techniques from European Mannerism and followed the artificial and decorative style characteristic of Elizabethan painting.Eras of Elegance - the Elizabethan Era By the time he was appointed serjeant-painter in 1607, his compelling and semi-naive style was somewhat old fashioned compared with De Critz and other contemporaries.Art Gallery of New South WalesTate Britain However, Peake's portraits of Prince Henry are the first to show his subject in ‚Äòaction‚Äô poses.Review of The Lost Prince: The Life & Death of Henry Stuart by C D Nesbitt Sheeran believes that Peake's creativity waned into conservatism, his talent \\"dampened by mass production\\". He describes Peake's Cambridge portrait, Prince Charles, as Duke of York as poorly drawn, with a lifeless pose, in a stereotyped composition that \\"confirms the artist's reliance on a much repeated formula in his later years\\". Art historian and curator Karen Hearn, on the other hand, praises the work as \\"magnificent\\" and draws attention to the naturalistically rendered note pinned to the curtain. Peake painted the portrait to mark Charles's visit to Cambridge on 3 and 4 March 1613, during which he was awarded an M.A.‚Äîfour months after the death of his brother.Edmond, \\"New Light on Jacobean Painters\\", 74. Depicting Prince Charles wearing the Garter and Lesser George, Peake here reverts to a more formal, traditional style of portraiture.Hearn calls it \\"a return to the frozen grandeur of mainstream continental court portraiture\\". Hearn, Dynasties, 188. The note pinned to a curtain of cloth of gold, painted in trompe-l'≈ìil fashion, commemorates Charles's visit in Latin.The Latin inscription translates: \\"Charles, we the Muses, since you deigned to agree to both, have both welcomed you as our guest and painted you in humble duty. Visiting the University in the tenth year of his father's reign over England, on 4 March, he was enrolled in the ranks of the Masters and admitted in this Senate House by Valentine Carey Vice-Chancellor\\". Hearn, Dynasties, 188. X-rays of the portrait reveal that Peake painted it over another portrait. Pentimenti, or signs of alteration, can be detected: for example, Charles's right hand originally rested on his waist. Gallery File:Anne Knollys by Robert Peake.jpgPortrait of Anne Knollys, 1582.

His wife Alma was called the \\"great grandmother of San Francisco\\". His 1912 Mansion is in Pacific Heights and is San Francisco Landmark #197.  Life and career  Spreckels was born in San Francisco, California. His parents were Anna Christina Mangels and Claus Spreckels, founder of the Spreckels Sugar Company. At the age of 12, Adolph studied abroad in Hanover, Germany for two years, returning to San Francisco to finish his studies. When the company was founded in 1881, he was named a vice- president. Spreckels succeeded his father as company president upon the latter's death in 1908. He was intensely loyal to both his father and his brother John. In 1884, he shot Michael H. de Young, co-founder of the San Francisco Chronicle, supposedly because of an article in that newspaper suggesting his sugar company defrauded its shareholders. Spreckels pleaded temporary insanity to the charge of attempted murder and was acquitted. The California Palace of the Legion of Honor was championed by his wife Alma and paid for from the Spreckels fortune. It was merged with the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in 1972 to become the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Besides the sugar company, Spreckels was president of the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway, vice-president of both the Western Sugar Company and the Oceanic Steamship Company, as well as a director of the Sunset Monarch Company. In addition to his business enterprises, Spreckels served as a San Francisco Park Commissioner and was heavily involved in the development of Golden Gate Park. Spreckels Lake, in the park, is named after him. Spreckels Organ Pavilion in San Diego's Balboa Park, housing the largest outdoor pipe organ in the world, was also built by Spreckels and his brother John. Furthermore, John commissioned Spreckels Organ in the Palace of the Legion of Honor in tribute to Adolph, who died before it was completed. Thoroughbred racing Spreckels was also fond of horse racing and owned and bred a number of race horses, most famously Morvich, the first California-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby (1922). Family He and Alma de Bretteville were married on May 11, 1908, after a five-year courtship. They had three children, daughter Alma Emma, son Adolph Bernard, Jr., and another daughter, Dorothy Constance. After the birth of their last daughter, Spreckels' health began to deteriorate due to syphilis he had contracted before his marriage. He had known about the disease and had kept it secret from his wife, but fortunately for her during their intimate years it had been in a latent, non-contagious state. Spreckels died in 1924 from pneumonia.  Spreckels Mansion  The family's c.1912 mansion, located at 2080 Washington Street in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, is most recently the home of novelist Danielle Steel. The mansion was designed by George A. Applegarth and Kenneth A. MacDonald Jr.. in the French Baroque style. The chateau was designated as San Francisco Landmark #197 on June 9, 1990.

From 1929 through 1936, he appeared in twenty-four films. He was in 1938's The Law West of Tombstone. In 1940, he portrayed \\"RCMP Sergeant Dave King\\", the role becoming one of his most notable successes. The first was King of the Royal Mounted, a 12-part 1940 serial adaptation of Zane Grey's King of the Royal Mounted. He starred in several Royal Canadian Mounted Police films, including the serials The Yukon Patrol and King of the Mounties. He is best remembered for these today. In 1946 and 1947, he portrayed Red Ryder in seven films, replacing Wild Bill Elliott in that role. The following year, he became \\"Rocky Lane\\" in Western films. Between 1940 and 1966, Lane made eighty-two film and television series appearances, mostly in westerns. Between 1947 and 1953, he made over 30 B-movie westerns (as \\"Rocky\\" Lane) with his faithful horse 'Black Jack'. His last roles were in voice over acting, including providing the speech for Mister Ed (1961‚Äì1966). He was never credited on- screen for providing the voice for Mister Ed. In 2003, he won the TV Land Award posthumously for the category \\"Favorite Pet-Human Relationship\\" as Mr. Ed.IMDb profile for Allan Lane  Death  Lane died in California of cancer in 1973, at age 64. In popular culture Between 1965 and 1968 a celebrity comic was created around Rocky Lane's cowboy persona, written and drawn by Brazilian comics artist Primaggio Mantovi. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mantovi_primaggio.htm Selected filmography * Not Quite Decent (1929) as Jerry Connor * The Forward Pass (1929) as Ed Kirby * Love in the Rough (1930) as Johnson * Madame Satan (1930) as Zeppelin Majordomo (uncredited) * Night Nurse (1931) as Intern (uncredited) * The Star Witness (1931) as Young Deputy at the Leeds Home (uncredited) * Honor of the Family (1931) as Joseph * Expensive Women (1931) as Party Boy with Bobby (uncredited) * Local Boy Makes Good (1931) as Runner with a Bad Knee (uncredited) * The Famous Ferguson Case (1932) as Reporter (uncredited) * The Tenderfoot (1932) as Actor (uncredited) * Week-End Marriage (1932) as Office Clerk (uncredited) * Winner Take All (1932) as Monty - Joan's Friend (uncredited) * Miss Pinkerton (1932) as Herbert Wynn (scenes deleted) * Crooner (1932) as Heckler on Dance Floor (uncredited) * A Successful Calamity (1932) as Polo Player (uncredited) * The Crash (1932) as Geoffrey's Associate (uncredited) * One Way Passage (1932) as Friend of Joan's (uncredited) * Laughing at Trouble (1936) as John Campbell * Stowaway (1936) as Richard Hope * Step Lively, Jeeves!

He was coach of the South Africa national rugby union team from 2008 to 2011, after successes with the South African U19 and U21 squads, and the first-ever non-white to be appointed to the position.Jones, Stephen. \\"Springboks' first black coach faces uphill task: As Peter de Villiers took charge of South Africa, it was feared he may weaken the side to fulfil the role into which he has been cast\\", The Sunday Times, 13 January 2008. Accessed 13 January 2008. He enjoyed mixed successes, managing South Africa to winning the 2009 Tri Nations, a test series win over the British and Irish Lions and a memorable first victory over New Zealand in Dunedin. However he also became known for his controversial off-field comments. South Africa finished bottom in the 2010 and 2011 Tri Nations, and following a quarter final defeat to Australia in the 2011 Rugby World Cup did not renew his contract. Early coaching career He coached amateur club Tygerberg in 1996 and 1997, and the Western Province Disas in 1997. In 1998, he enjoyed his first major appointments as assistant coach for Western Province in the Currie Cup and also the South Africa national under-19 side, which he took to third in the 1999 Under 19 Rugby World Championship. He took the Falcons through the 2002 and 2003 Currie Cup campaigns before going on to coach the South Africa national under-21 rugby union team between 2004 and 2006. In the 2004 Under 21 Rugby World Championship, South Africa finished third, but won in 2005 and came second in 2006. In 2007, De Villiers was appointed coach of the Emerging Springboks and led them to the title of the 2007 Nations Cup. Springboks Following the acrimonious conclusion of Jake White's tenure as Springbok coach, after South Africa's Rugby World Cup victory in France in November 2007, De Villiers was short-listed for the role along with three other candidates, including successful Bulls coach Heyneke Meyer. Cheeky Watson, Neil de Beer and Koos Rossouw were the people that were driving his campaign for election with Koos Rossouw being the major funder. In January 2008, De Villiers was appointed as the first ever non-white coach of the Springboks, but South African Rugby Union (SARU) President Oregan Hoskins indicated that his rugby credentials were not the sole motivation for the appointment: \\"We have made the appointment and taken into account the issue of transformation when we made it. I don't think that tarnishes Peter; I'm just being honest with our country.\\"\\"Transformation\\" refers to the transition of rugby union in South Africa from a sport dominated by whites during the apartheid era, to a multi-cultural sport in the post-apartheid era. The appointment was not met with universal acclaim. \\"We have seven lean years ahead,\\" predicted former Springbok captain Corn√© Krige.Quoted in Van Dijk 2008, p. 80. De Villiers achieved an early fillip, however, in convincing John Smit to stay on as Springbok captain, but there followed a period of jaundice as Gert Smal and Eugene Eloff refused to be considered as his assistants. Going into February, De Villiers's contract, offering him R200,000 less than his predecessor, was still unsigned. Contractual negotiations broke down in March when he insisted on the final word on team selection. When SARU duly amended its constitution later that month, De Villiers finally gave his signature. The Springboks' first training squad under De Villiers, comprising 42 players, included sixteen of colour. Dick Muir and Gary Gold were named assistant coaches shortly thereafter. Controversy arose again, however, when Ricky Januarie was dropped for \\"disciplinary reasons\\". Going into the Tri Nations, De Villiers's 28-man squad included ten of colour and took two victories against Wales (43‚Äì17 and 37‚Äì21) and one against Italy (26‚Äì0) in Incoming Tours. Following the Springboks' 19‚Äì8 defeat at the hands of the All Blacks, De Villiers accused them of cheating. Several months later, in an interview with SA Sports Illustrated, he declared, > I know the game. Technically, I'm very strong. When I said the All Blacks > were cheaters in the first Test in Wellington, I picked up some of the > technical stuff they did wrong in the scrums and how they played outside of > the laws and how they used that to good effect. I also picked up that, > instead of standing a metre apart in the line-outs, they stood a metre and a > half apart so that we couldn't compete; and anything outside of any law is > cheating.Quoted in Van Dijk 2008, pp. 78‚Äì80. The side lost again, 16‚Äì9, to Australia not long after, but this time De Villiers cast no doubt over the probity of his opponents. In the after match interview De Villiers claimed there was a lot he could learn from the Australian team. He subsequently took his team to a historic triumph in Dunedin, trumping the All Blacks 30‚Äì28 before thrashing Argentina with nine tries in a score of 63‚Äì9. In April 2009 he expressed shock that the captains of England, Scotland and Wales had been left out of the Lions squad for the 2009 British & Irish Lions tour to South Africa. On 27 June 2009, after South Africa had defeated the Lions in the 2nd Test of the Series, de Villiers attracted criticism when he defended his blindside flanker, Schalk Burger, against charges of eye gouging, despite clear television evidence showing the offence had occurred. De Villiers said \\"I don't think it should have been a card at all. For me and for everybody, this is sport.\\". Even after Burger received an 8-week suspension from the IRB on 29 June, De Villers continued to defend him, saying \\"I have watched the television footage, and am still convinced that nothing he did was on purpose. He is an honourable man ‚Äì he never meant to go to anyone's eye\\". However, later the same day, after a meeting with SARU, he apologised, saying \\"It was never my intention to suggest that I condone foul play. That is the last thing I would ever do and I apologise for that impression.\\" His belated apology did not bring an end to the controversy, with numerous figures in International rugby continuing to criticise him, including Lions player Brian O'Driscoll, who said \\"To hear the South Africa coach talk about gouging being part of the game was semi- repulsive\\", and \\"regardless of the apology he may have submitted ‚Äì it's essentially bringing the game into disrepute\\". Following an 11‚Äì9 defeat to Australia in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final, De Villiers confirmed that he will not resign, rather he will see out the rest of his contract that will expire in December 2011 and he will not be signing a new deal. He said, \\"I enjoyed it. I was in a privileged position to be able to contribute to my country. South African rugby is in a good state and will move forward after this.\\"  Comments and controversy  De Villiers is known for his rather colourful comments, which have landed him in hot water on many occasions. One of his more controversial comments featured a decidedly racial overtone. In June 2009 shortly after the first test between the Springboks and British and Irish Lions at Loftus Versveld in Pretoria, De Villiers was quoted as saying: > What I've learned in South Africa is that if you take your car to a garage > where the owner is a black man and he messes up then you'll never go back to > that garage again. If the owner's a white man you say, 'ah, he made a > mistake', and you go back. In June 2009, shortly after the second test between the Boks and the Lions, flanker Schalk Burger received an eight-week ban for eye-gouging Lions wing Luke Fitzgerald. De Villiers responded to the incident by reminding the press that \\"rugby is a contact sport, and so is dancing\\". He went on further by saying: > Why don't we go to the nearest ballet shop, get some tutus and get a dancing > shop going? (Then there will be) no eye-gouging, no tackling, no nothing and > we will enjoy it! De Villiers‚Äô lively remarks eventually culminated in a rebuke by South African Minister of Sport, Makhenkesi Stofile, who told De Villiers to \\"keep his mouth shut\\" and \\"sober-up\\". In the 2011 Rugby World Cup year, De Villiers received much criticism especially from New Zealanders over comments he made about Super Rugby debutant Sonny Bill Williams, in which he described his offloading oriented game as \\"nonsense\\" and a bad example for rugby playing children, who were wasting their time seeking to imitate it. Springbok prop Tendai \\"Beast\\" Mtawarira has questioned whether former national coach Peter de Villiers was competent for the role he occupied between 2008 and 2011. Mtawarira, who made his Springbok debut under De Villiers' guidance in 2008, made the startling revelation in his new autobiography, Beast, which will be on sale from July. \\"He was a fantastic coach of the Junior Springboks, but I think at the high level he was probably lucky that a very good group of players was handed over to him,\\" Mtawarira writes in the book. Mtawarira was referring to the fact that De Villiers had inherited Jake White's 2007 World Cup winning team with senior players like Victor Matfield, Fourie du Preez, Schalk Burger, John Smit, Bakkies Botha, Danie Rossouw, Jean de Villiers, Jaque Fourie, Bryan Habana and JP Pietersen ruling the roost. Mtawarira added: \\"His methods and approach didn't really work with the Springboks, and as players we had to be careful what we said to the media. What you said would get back to Peter and affect your place in the team. The media did not like Peter and thought he was a bit of a clown. \\"There's no doubt that he was happy to be at the forefront of a team that could operate on its own steam. Most of the work was done by the players, with (assistant coaches) Dick (Muir) and (Gary) Gold very influential.\\" During the 2019 Rugby World Cup tournament in Japan De Villiers publicly announced that he no longer supported the Springbok rugby team because of the inclusion of Eben Etzebeth, who was accused of racist remarks before the start of the tournament. The remarks backfired on De Villiers and he tried, in vain, to explain his remarks. South African supporters demanded that he no longer parade in the Springbok blazer, which he wears on all promotional photos, since he no longer supports the team. He had to eat humble pie when the Springboks went on to win the World Rugby Cup trophy, beating England 32-12 in the final, and tried to quell the stormy waters by congratulating the Springboks on their win. It is believed to have had a serious effect on his \\"master classes\\" which he offered to would-be rugby coaches.  Record as Springbok Coach  The Springboks won 30 of their 48 matches under the helm of De Villiers. The 62.5% win percentage includes a 47% win percentage against the All Blacks, having played them 11 times and losing 6 matches, one of which was 40-7. A record defeat at the time. De Villiers is the first Springbok coach since Nick Mallet to have a 100% win record over the All Blacks in a single year (2009). De Villiers is also the first coach since Nelie Smith to have secured a series win over the British and Irish Lions. De Villiers was hired by Zimbabwe on a two-year contract in February 2018 - for a reported R115 000 per month salary - with the aim of getting the country back to the Rugby World Cup for the first time since 1991. Not only did Zimbabwe fail to make the 2019 World Cup, they were nearly relegated from Africa‚Äôs top- tier competition, and was fired shortly thereafter.

She was a contralto concert singer and she managed his estate and guarded his legacy after his death as his only surviving child. She was married first to Ossip Gabrilowitsch, then to Jacques Samossoud after Gabrilowitsch's death. She wrote biographies of Gabrilowitsch and of her father. In her later life, she became a Christian Scientist. Childhood Clara was the second of three daughters born to Samuel Clemens and his wife Olivia Langdon Clemens in Elmira, New York. Her older sister Susy died when Clara was 22. Her brother Langdon died as an infant before she was born. Her younger sister was Jean. Clara had a serious accident as a child while riding a toboggan; she was hurled into a tree, resulting in a severe leg injury that almost led to amputation. Early career Twain with his daughter Clara and her friend. Clara lived in Vienna with her parents from September 1897 to May 1899 where she cultivated her voice for the concert stage. Her voice was characterized as unusually sweet and attractive. She also studied piano in 1899 under Theodor Leschetizky, who had been a pupil of Carl Czerny. In December 1900, she was invited by the people of Hartford to perform at a grand concert given by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She studied for several years under masters in Europe before making her professional debut in Florence. She made her American debut as a contralto concert singer on the evening of September 22, 1906 at the Norfolk Gymnasium in Norfolk, Connecticut, assisted by violinist Marie Nichols. She rented Edgewood there in 1905, and she used the proceeds from the concert to purchase a memorial window for her mother in the Norfolk Church of the Transfiguration. Charles Edmund Wark (1876-1954) was a classical pianist from Cobourg, Ontario, and he became Clemens' piano accompanist from the winter of 1906 to late in 1908. Clemens and Nichols also continued to perform together, including a series of concerts in London and Paris in 1908. On May 30, Clemens debuted in London at a benefit concert, raising money for American girls to attend Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Marriage and inheritance Clemens went for a sleigh ride on December 20, 1908 with Russian concert pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch who was staying with her father at his residence \\"Innocence at Home\\" in Redding, Connecticut.The house was later renamed \\"Stormfield.\\" \\"Mark Twain on 'Innocence at Home,' Grover Cleveland, and God,\\" Shapell Manuscript Foundation, n.d. Retrieved 12 June 2018. The horse was frightened by a flapping newspaper and it bolted, causing Gabrilowitsch to lose control. The sleigh overturned at the top of a hill near a drop, throwing Clemens out. Gabrilowitsch saved both her and the horse from plunging over the edge, spraining an ankle in his exertions. He returned Clemens home unharmed except for the shock of the accident. Twain biographer Michael Shelden doubts the truth of this heroic tale and suggests that the story was planted in the press to quiet rumors that Clara was having an affair with Charles Wark, her former accompanist and a married man.Shelden, M.: Mark Twain: Man in White. Random House, 2010 Snapshot taken at the marriage of Clara Clemens and Ossip Gabrilowitsch (from left to right: Samuel Clemens, Jervis Langdon, Jean Clemens, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Clara Clemens, Rev. Dr. Joseph Twichell) Theodor Leschetizky was training Gabrilowitsch in Vienna in 1899, and he introduced him to Clemens. They were married on October 6, 1909 in the drawing room at Stormfield, the Clemens home, with her father's friend Rev. Joseph Twichell presiding.) Her father said that the engagement was not new, having been \\"made and dissolved twice six years ago\\". He also said that the marriage was sudden because Gabrilowitsch had just recovered from a surgical operation which he had undergone in the summer and they were about to head off to their new house in Berlin where he would begin his European season. Samuel Clemens died on April 21, 1910, leaving his estate to be equally divided between his surviving daughters in a will dated August 17, 1909. His daughter Jean Clemens had drowned in the bathtub on December 24, 1909 after having an epileptic seizure. Clara inherited the entire estate, which provided quarterly payments of interest to keep it \\"free from any control or interference from any husband she may have.\\" On July 9, Clara announced that she was donating her father's library to the Mark Twain Free Library, consisting of nearly 2,500 books. On August 19, 1910, Clara's only child Nina was born at Stormfield. Nina Gabrilowitsch (1910‚Äì1966) was Twain's last descendant, and she died January 16, 1966 in a Los Angeles hotel. She had been a heavy drinker, and bottles of pills and alcohol were found in her room.Mark Twain Online Later life Clara Clemens with her husband Ossip Gabrilowitsch On April 23, 1926, Clara played the title role in a dramatization of Twain's novel Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc at Walter Hampden's Broadway theater. This adaptation and her performance were not very well received by critics. It was again produced in 1927, opening on April 12 for a series of special morning and afternoon performances at the Edyth Totten Theatre. Gabrilowitsch was conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra from 1918 until 1935, when he fell ill. He entered the Henry Ford Hospital on March 25, 1935, where he stayed until he was released to his home to convalesce on September 28. He died at home on September 14, 1936 age 58. Clara married Jacques Samossoud on May 11, 1944, a Russian-born symphony conductor 20 years her junior. They were married in her Hollywood home. Clara explored eastern religions for several years before embracing Christian Science, although there is some question as to her seriousness and commitment to it. She wrote Awake to a Perfect Day on the subject, published in 1956. She also published biographies of her father (My Father, Mark Twain in 1931) and of her first husband (My Husband: Gabrilowitsch in 1938). She objected in 1939 to the release of her father's Letters from the Earth, but she changed her stance and allowed them to be published shortly before her death on November 20, 1962.

Litfin was the first victim to be killed by East German border troops, the first to succumb to gunshot wounds, and was the first male victim. Biography G√ºnter Litfin was born on 19 January 1937 in Berlin, Nazi Germany, along with a twin brother, Alois, who was murdered by a Nazi physician during the Second World War.Der Kommunismus ist ein Schei√ühaufen ohne Ende! (Communism is a turd heap without end!), Focus Online, October 9, 2014 Litfin lived in East Germany, in the borough of Wei√üensee of East Berlin, and like his father Albert (a butcher) was a member of the illegal local branch of the Christian Democrats Union, the centre-right West German political party. A tailor by trade, Litfin was a Grenzg√§nger (cross-border commuter) working near the Zoological Garden in West Berlin. On 13 August 1961, the border between East Berlin and West Berlin was abruptly closed by East Germany, effectively trapping him in East Berlin. Shortly before the border was closed, Litfin had found an apartment in Charlottenburg, West Berlin, closer to his workplace, and on 12 August, only the day before, he had driven to Charlottenburg with his brother J√ºrgen to furnish his new apartment. Litfin's intention to escape East Germany was abruptly halted the next morning, as road blocks had already been placed and the first barbed wire fences of the Berlin Wall were built. Death On 24 August, at around 4pm, Litfin attempted to illegally escape by swimming from Humboldthafen, a small harbour in the River Spree, on a planned route through a small canal branching off from the river westwards into West Berlin.Short portrait of G√ºnter Litfin at Chronik der MauerShort portrait of G√ºnter Litfin at Berlin Wall Memorial However, upon crossing the railway bridge that constituted the border, Litfin was discovered by officers of the East German transportation police, and was ordered to immediately swim back. Litfin lifted his hands from the water to exit the river on the West Berlin side, and was then shot and killed. Litfin was buried at the St. Hedwig Cemetery, in Wei√üensee, on August 31, 1961. The presence of Stasi personnel at the burial ensured that the truth behind his death was not openly revealed. According to his brother J√ºrgen, the funeral was \\"a farce\\" since most at the mourning knew that his brother‚Äôs death was no accident, and that he had been killed for trying to leave East Germany. Aftermath In memory of G√ºnter Litfin, as well as all other victims of the Wall, a memorial was established in 1992 on the initiative of J√ºrgen Litfin (G√ºnter Litfin's younger brother). It is located in the watchtower of the former \\"Kieler Eck\\" on the Berlin-Spandauer Schifffahrtskanal.Zorniges Gedenken an den ersten Mauertoten (Angry remembrance of the first Berlin Wall victim), Rheinische Post, August 10, 2011, page A6.

One of the crosses at the White Crosses memorial site next to the Reichstag building is devoted to him. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent reunification of East and West Germany, the Berlin Regional Court found the border guard accused of shooting Litfin to be guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced him to 18 months prison, which was suspended.

It was discovered on 13 January 1983 by American astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory in the United States. It is named after the California Institute of Technology.  Orbit and classification  Caltech orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8‚Äì3.5 AU once every 5 years and 8 months (2,058 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 31¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Goethe Link Observatory in 1957, extending the body's observation arc by 26 years prior to its official discovery at Palomar.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS taxonomy, Caltech is a Xc-type asteroid, which transitions between the core X and carbonaceous C types. = Rotation period = Between 2006 and 2012, a total of 3 rotational lightcurves of Caltech were obtained from photometric observations by Italian amateur astronomers Silvano Casulli and Federico Manzini as well as at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a concurring rotation period of 12.99 hours with a brightness variation between 0.16 and 0.27 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Caltech measures between 50.83 and 61.07 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.048 and 0.06. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0438 and a diameter of 57.88 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 12.2.  Naming  This minor planet is named after the California Institute of Technology, Caltech, which is the owner and operator of the discovering Palomar Observatory. The discovery was made with the 0.46-m Schmidt telescope, the first telescope installed on Palomar. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 September 1983 ().

Gottlieb Samuel Studer In September 1843 he made the first ascent of the Wildhorn (3,248 m) in the Bernese Alps. Together with the geologist Theodor Simler and Dr Melchior Ulrich, Studer was inspired by the establishment of the British Alpine Club in 1857 to form a Swiss counterpart. This led to the founding on 19 April 1863 of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) at a meeting in the Bahnhofbuffet Olten, the railway restaurant in the Swiss town of Olten. The club was 'a broader and more democratic association than the Alpine Club'.Claire Engel, Mountaineering in the Alps, London: George Allen and Unwin, 1971, p. 136 Studer was president of the Bern section of the SAC from 1863‚Äì1873, and he was honorary president from 1873 to his death. In 1866 Studer left the service of the state and dedicated himself to the history of Alpine exploration. The years 1869‚Äì1871 were spent writing √úber Eis und Schnee, a three-volume history of the climbing of the Swiss Alps. Over the course of 60 years Studer climbed 650 summits, in the Bernese Alps, the Pennine Alps, the Dauphin√©, the Tyrol, the Pyrenees and Norway.

According to German manga scholar Jaqueline Berndt, the depiction of cats as young girls spread to other manga series from Wata no Kunihoshi. It is described by Masanao Amano as not just a simple animal fable but a story in which psychological and mental states are highly differentiated. The movie of Wata no Kunihoshi has been praised as a \\"hidden gem\\" for its complex characterization, philosophical story, and gorgeous animation. The soundtrack of Richard Clayderman's piano music is praised by Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements as striking exactly the right tone for the romantic mood. The depiction of Chibi-neko's self-image as a catgirl was seen by a reviewer at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews as a metaphor for adolescence.

The Emergency Management Act and the Catastrophic Health Emergency Powers Act together form the primary state laws regarding emergency and disastrous situations that may occur in the state. The Emergency Management Act was signed into law by Governor Brad Henry on May 29, 2003. Giving the Emergency Volunteers a say in their towns when disastrous situations occur. Purposes of the Act The Emergency Management Act declares its purposes: The Emergency Management Act: * Created of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management (OEM) * Authorized of the creation of local organizations for emergency management in the counties and incorporated municipalities of this state * Provided for the formulation and execution of an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for the state * Conferred upon the Governor and upon the executive heads or governing bodies of the political subdivisions of the state emergency powers * Provided for the rendering of mutual aid among the political subdivisions of the state and with other states to cooperate with the federal government with respect to carrying out emergency management functions and hazard mitigation * Provided sufficient organization to meet, prevent or reduce emergencies in the general interest and welfare of the public and the state. The Emergency Management Act declared the policy of Oklahoma to be that all emergency management and hazard mitigation functions of the state are to be coordinated to the maximum extent with the comparable functions of the federal government, of the other states and localities, and of private agencies of every type, to the end that the most effective preparation and use may be made of available workforce, resources and facilities for dealing with disaster and hazard mitigation. Each state agency, board, commission, department or other state entity having responsibilities either indicated in the state Emergency Operations Plan must have written plans and procedures in place to protect individual employees, administrators and visitors from natural and man-made disasters and emergencies occurring at their work place. All such plans and procedures are made in concurrence with OEM, which is responsible for establishing an OEM Guidebook titled the \\"Emergency Standard Operating Procedures\\". Each state agency, board, commission, department or other state entity must provide an annual report on the status of their emergency management program to OEM. OEM then must compile and integrate all reports into a report to the Governor and Legislature on the status of state emergency preparedness. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) is officially declared to be the standard for incident management in Oklahoma. All on-scene management of disasters and emergencies shall be conducted using the Incident Command System (ICS). Gubernatorial emergency powers Under the Emergency Management Act, the Governor of Oklahoma gains vast and comprehensive emergency powers. However, the emergency powers provided to the Governor are operative only during the existence of a natural or man-made emergency. The existence of such an emergency must be proclaimed by the Governor through executive declaration or by the Legislature by concurrent resolution for the Governor to exercise such powers. Any emergency, whether proclaimed by the Governor or by the Legislature, may be terminated by the proclamation of the Governor or by the Legislature with a concurrent resolution terminating such emergency. Upon an emergency being declared, the Governor must activate the Emergency Operations Plan. This allows the Governor to assume direct regulatory control over all essential resources of the state. It is then the responsibility of the Governor to determine the priorities of such resources and allocate them as he deems necessary. The Emergency Management Act defines \\"resources\\" as: In exercising his emergency powers, the Governor is empowered to (limited) rule by decree in the realm of public security. The Emergency Management Act requires the Governor \\"to enforce all laws, rules and regulations relating to emergency management\\" and grants him the authority to assume \\"direct operational control of any or all emergency management forces\\" in the state. Such forces include the Oklahoma National Guard, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, and local police and sheriff departments. As such, the Governor has the authority to make, amend, and rescind necessary orders and rules to carry out the provisions of the Emergency Management Act. If, in the Governor's opinion, an evacuation of any or all of the population of any disaster stricken or threatened area within the state is necessary, the Governor is empowered to take such steps as are necessary for the evacuation as well as the receipt and care of such evacuees. The Act grants the Governor the power to: To enforce his orders, the Governor gains the power of emergency gubernatorial dismissal. Should any public official exercising power under the Oklahoma Constitution willfully fail to obey any order, rule or regulation issued by the Governor, the Governor may remove said official from office. Such removal, however, can only become effective after charges have been served to the affected official and the official has been given an opportunity to defend himself/herself. Pending the preparation and disposition of charges, the Governor may suspend such official for a period not exceeding thirty days. Any vacancy resulting from gubernatorial emergency dismissal or suspension is filled by an appointment made by the Governor. The appointee serves until the office can be filled as otherwise provided by law. The only officers not subject to this emergency removal process are the statewide executive offices, the Justices of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and the members of the Oklahoma Legislature. However, these officers do not possess the power to prevent the Governor from fulfilling his duties pursuant to the Emergency Management Act.

Local emergency management programs All counties of the state are required to have a qualified emergency management director and all towns and cities are required to develop an emergency management program. A city or town may either have an emergency management director or create an agreement with their county for emergency management services. Regardless of level, the local emergency management director is responsible for the organization, administration, and operation of all such local organizations for emergency management within the director's territorial limits. Each local emergency management organization must develop, maintain and revise, as necessary, a local emergency operations plan for the jurisdiction. Each plan shall address the emergency management system functions of preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. Such plan must be based upon a hazard and risk assessment for the jurisdiction and include provisions for evacuation of all or a portion of the jurisdiction based upon such risk in the event any disaster necessitates the evacuation of its citizens. Each Emergency Management Director is responsible for all aspects of emergency management in his or her jurisdiction. Such duties include conducting hazard analysis detailing risks and vulnerabilities; annually updating the existing all-hazard local Emergency Operations Plan (EOP); conducting and arranging for necessary training of all relevant personnel; conducting annual exercises to evaluate the plan; managing resources; determining shortfalls in equipment, personnel and training; revising the EOP as necessary; establishing and maintaining an office of emergency management; communication and warnings; conducting or supervising damage assessment and other pre- and post-disaster-related duties. All local fire departments, law enforcement departments and other first response agencies must notify their respective local Emergency Management Director of all significant events occurring in the jurisdiction. Emergency Management Directors shall promptly report significant events to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. Each city, town, or county in which any disaster occurs has the authority to declare a local emergency. The city, town, or county must combat such disaster, protecting the health and safety of persons and property, and providing emergency assistance to the victims of such disaster. Each jurisdiction is authorized to exercise the emergency powers vested to it under the Emergency Management Act without regard to time- consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the performance of public work, entering into contracts, the incurring of obligations, the employment of temporary workers, the rental of equipment, the purchase of supplies and materials, and the appropriation and expenditure of public funds. However, constitutional mandatory requirements must still be followed.

Reyes became a television news pioneer in the 1960s when he began one of South Florida's first Spanish-language newscasters. His first 15-minute news show, News En Espa√±ol, debuted on WTVJ on August 28, 1960 at 6:45 am, at a time when Spanish-language broadcasts were rare in the Miami metropolitan area. His original broadcasts were aimed at making news accessible to the growing Spanish-speaking, Miami-based Cuban exile community. Early life Reyes was born in Cuba, where he worked as a child actor, radio performer and singer. He obtained a law degree from the University of Havana before moving to the United States. Spanish-language news Manolo Reyes, who resided in the Miami area in the 1950s and 1960s, realized that there were no television news shows aimed at the growing Cuban exile community, especially after the Communist takeover of Cuba by Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution. Despite his limited English, Reyes pitched his idea to the founder of WTVJ, Mitchell Wolfson, and Miami television pioneer Ralph Renick. Renick and Woflson agreed to let Reyes tape a test show. The station had to have the test show critiqued by a University of Miami linguistics professor because no one at WTVJ (Channel 4) spoke Spanish at the time. Wolfson agreed to broadcast Reyes' Spanish- language news segments. Reyes' first 15-minute news show, News En Espa√±ol, debuted on August 28, 1960. News En Espa√±ol aired on weekdays at 6:45 am, just before the Skipper Chuck Show, and at 1 am, just before the WTVJ's sign-off for the night. Spanish-speaking viewers, especially the Cuban exile community, were delighted by Reyes's news show, despite the difficult viewing times. Conversely, non-Spanish speakers were equally outraged by the broadcast of an all-Spanish show. Reyes' newscast was so popular that it was gradually expanded. His initial assignments for the station usually involved coverage of Miami's arriving Cuban refugees. Reyes remained at WTVJ for 19 years and was promoted to the station's Latin America news editor. Reyes also became a regular contributor on the WTVJ's well-known English-language show The Ralph Renick Report. He also began contributing nationally on Walter Cronkite's CBS Evening News. He left television after 19 years. He obtained a second law degree from the University of Miami before becoming an executive director at Mercy Hospital in Miami. He remained at that position for nearly 20 years until his retirement in 2005. Reyes was honored for his pioneering work in television by the Miami Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 1991. Community work Reyes founded a number of Miami community organizations including the YMCA Jose Mart√≠, the Cuban Sertoma Club, and the Spanish Post of Veterans of Foreign Wars. He also served on the board of directors several other organizations, including the Hialeah-Miami Springs Chamber of Commerce, Easter Seals, the United Way and Barry University. Awards Reyes was the recipient of several awards for his work in the media and nonprofit arenas, as well as the greater Miami-Dade community including... *An Emmy Award for broadcast journalism. *The Key to the City of Hialeah *The Key to the City of Key West *The Archbishop Hurley Award *Pentagon Award for Human Goals Death Manolo Reyes died of complications from Parkinson's disease on January 3, 2008 at the age of 83. His funeral was held at Saints Peter & Paul Roman Catholic Church in Miami. Reyes was survived by his wife Graciela, three children, Manolo Jr., Charlie and Grace, 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

An often cited and legally significant case is that of R v Hollingshed.. This case involved the interpretation of Australia‚Äôs obligations under an international treaty when it had not been applied by law into Australia as affecting the treatment of a prisoner. He embarked on a full and frank discussion of the New South Wales prison system. Whilst he held that the treaty could be used to interpret the criminal law, he declined to hold that being held in ‚Äúisolated protective custody‚Äù was unlawful under international obligations. (2001) 24(1) University of New South Wales Law Journal 17. Retrieved 4 August 2010. Miles dealt with a claim for compensation for injuries suffered by a female complainant slipping on the floor at a supermarket. The complainant, aged 58, alleged that she had been deprived from potentially earning an income as a prostitute at a brothel. The complainant produced a number of young men who were prepared to testify that they were disappointed that the complainant had not been available as a prostitute. Miles declined to award any damages.‚ÄúObiter Dictum‚Äù, Newsletter Edition.

The forest complex designated as a biosphere reserve in 2004 by UNESCO. The KDN complex is the last large remaining rainforest in Sri Lanka other than Sinharaja. This forest area has been identified as one of the floristically richest areas in South Asia. The forest complex is situated 35 km northwest of city of Galle. The rain forest is a major catchment area for two of the most important rivers in southern Sri Lanka, the Gin and Nilwala Rivers. This biosphere reserve harbors many plants and animal species endemic to Sri Lanka. Physical features The biosphere consists series of parallel mountain ranges and valleys. The elevation ranges from 60 m to 425 m above sea level. Mean annual temperature is 27.0 ¬∞C while annual temperature variation is 4 ¬∞C-5 ¬∞C. The forest receives a substantial rainfall of 3,750 mm. Many ancient taxonomic groups of Gondwana are present in these rain forests. They also relates to Indomalayan plants and animals. Hydrological features The forest complex act as an important catchment area for many rivers and streams flow through the area. The forest is the source for Gin River, which flows west to the forest and for Nilwala river which flows east to the forest. Kanneli, Nanikiththa and Udugama are the smaller streams of Kanneliya while Homa dola and Gal bandi dola are sourced by Nakiyadeniya and Deiyagala. Flora The KDN forest complex shows a degree of floral endemicity, as 17 percent of lowland endemic floral species are confined to this forest area. Of 319 woody plants recorded in the area, about 52 per cent is endemic. The vegetation of KDN complex represents Sri Lanka lowland rain forests. The floral communities dominated by Shorea-Dipterocarpus-Mesua (Sinhalese \\"Doona- Hora-Na\\") are common in emergent layer of the forest. Numerous medicinal plants are found in these forests. They include Coscinium fenestratum (Sinhalese \\"Weniwelgata\\"), Salacia reticulata (\\"Kothala Himbutu\\"), and Tinospora cordifolia (\\"Rasakinda\\"). Lycopodium squarrosum (\\"Kuda hadaya\\"), and Lycopodium phlegmaria (\\"Maha hadaya\\") are among the rare plants the forest complex harbors. The near-threatened Palaquium hinmolpedda (\\"Hinmolpedda\\") is also found here. Fauna Some 220 faunal species recorded from the KDN forests and forests around the KDN. This includes 41 endemic species. The forest complex is home to 86 species mammals. This includes 4 species of shrews, 5 rodents, one carnivore and 2 primates. Out of 26 endemic birds of Sri Lanka, 20 of them can be seen in KDN forest complex. Sri Lanka spurfowl, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka grey hornbill, red-faced malkoha, orange- billed babbler, Sri Lanka blue magpie are some of them. 20 percent of Sri Lanka's endemic freshwater fishes inhabit in the waters of Gin River and Nilwala River, which sourced by the springs of Kanneliya-Dediyagala- Nakiyadeniya. Among the forests' herpetofauna are 36 species of snakes, 17 endemic species belonging to 6 families. A total of 23 species of lizards recorded in these rain forests. Human imprint and conservation 10,000 people live in 78 villages around the forest complex. Forestry, collection of non-timber products, rice cultivation, tea, rubber and cinnamon plantations, animal husbandry and other forms of agriculture and cottage industries are main economic activities take place around the forest. Nugegoda, Rajagala and Dediyagala hermitages situated within the forest. The forest complex was subjected to logging, until suspending in 1988. Fortunately the diversity of species and plants remains largely intact. A forest corridor between Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the KDN forest complex is being planned for facilitate animal movement between the two forests. Green-billed coucal, Sri Lanka blue magpie, ashy-headed laughingthrush and white-faced starling are the bird species listed as endangered. 27 percent of floral species are listed vulnerable, and 45 percent are in the rare plants category.

In 1955, McMichael and his wife Signe (died July 4, 2007) began collecting Canadian paintings by the Group of Seven and other Canadian artists, such as Tom Thomson. In 1965, McMichael donated his collection and his house in Kleinburg, northwest of Toronto, with 14 acres of land to the Province of Ontario under the terms of a formal Agreement. The Agreement stated that the Government of Ontario would maintain the Collection and its special character in perpetuity and give the McMichaels lifelong membership on the Collection‚Äôs advisory committee, which controlled acquisitions. McMichael soon realized that he was losing control over the art acquisition process. In 1981 he resigned as director and after addressing the government through petitions and private representations, he sued the government in 1996 for breach of contract arguing that the Crown corporation, which managed the Collection, had reneged on the terms of the gift Agreement. The lawsuit culminated in a decision of the trial judge, Justice Peter Grossi of the Ontario Court‚Äôs General Division on November 15, 1996 in favour of the McMichaels. The decision, however, was appealed by the government in 1997. As of 2009, the collection contained some 6,000 Canadian works.

However, this tradition is no longer practice since the mid 1900s and face tattoo can only be seen on elderly women. Beginning in the early 21st century, many of the K'Cho people have migrated to many different parts of the world including United States, Australia, Denmark, Norway, New Zealand, Malaysia, and many others. Based on a translated conversation with a group of elderly women with tattooed faces (2016): * A girl would decide when she was ready to have her face tattooed. She would take an offering to the woman who gave the tattoos. * The entire face could be tattooed in as little as an hour. The time depended on how many breaks the girl needed, since it is a painful procedure. The time is estimated, since they did not have clocks in those days.

It is one of the townships of Chin State of West Myanmar. There are 6 Chin major tribes living in the Matupi township such as Matu, Mara, Dai, Zotung, Lautu and Khumi. Matupi, formerly known as Batupuei or Batu Village before it was promoted to the status of township, occupies a large portion of land and includes over 100 major villages in the southern part of Chin State. According to some local experts from Batu tribe, who settlement in Ngala ward, the name Matupi is derived from Batupuei (Badupi); however, due to misreading of the spellings: Ba into Ma and Puei into Pi in Burmese characters, however this theory is kept in discussion. Matupi appeared to be the widely used name without any historical significance in its terminology. The Matupi (Chin) tribe is one of the biggest tribes among the Kuki-Chin-Mizo. From the very beginning of all the Chins, including Kuki, Mizo, Zomi, Naga, Laimi, and Asho, Kcho and Khumi lived on the hillsides or riverbanks, constituting villages or groups. Among the villages, Matupi (formerly known as Batu Village) was the biggest and most populous. The British Gazette mentioned that there were over 1,000 houses including paddy barns in the village of Batupuei in the period between 1900 and 1930. Hakha book recorded that during those days ‚ÄúMatupi‚Äù was the biggest and most populous village in the Chin Hills. Geography=Location= Matupi township is located at the western part of Myanmar. The town is situated between latitudes 21.36'57.93 north and longitude 93.26'21.09 east. Matupi township is bordered on all sides: to the east by the Magwe division; to the south by Mindat Township; to the south-west by Paletwa township; to the north-west by Mizoram State, India; and to the North by Thantlang and Hakha townships. =Environment= The whole region is made up of high hills and deep valleys, and there is hardly any plain or plateau. Matupi township measures about from north to south, from east to west. It has an area of about . The township sits at above sea level. The highest mountain located in the township is Awtaraw Mountain (9,009 feet), and the second highest is Lukil Mountain standing at (8,408 feet), followed by Mount Kaisitlang, which is also in the region. Most streams in the township are fed by water from the hills and mountain ranges. The famous rivers of the township are Bunglong (Lemro) and Bawinu Rivers. The streams or rivers contain rapids and whitewater, thus are not suitable for navigation. Only small boats and canoes can travel in certain sections, mainly downstream. The famous streams are Pengsawng, Kadi, Leatsa, Tilak, Tisi and Vawmpu Streams. Bungtla waterfall, the famous waterfall of Chin state, is located in Matupi township. Awisi lake, well known in Matupi township, is located near Rhueng village. =Weather= December and January are the coldest months of the year with a mean temperature of around 10‚àí20 ¬∞C, the winter months are generally colder and windy. April is the hottest month at a mean of 37 ¬∞C. The total rainfall is about every year. Occasionally the temperature can drop to 2 ¬∞C. =Agriculture= Matupi is rich in plant life and vegetation. About one- eighth of Matupi is covered by tropical and sub-tropical forests, containing palm and bamboo among others. Areas of the forest have been cleared for cultivation but many scrub forests, high grass areas and reeds remain. Dogs, pangolin, porcupines, tigers, leopards, bears, many species of monkeys, and other species thrive across the region forests. The hornbill is one of the most famous birds found in the forests of Matupi township. Agriculture is the most essential and profitable industry in the Matupi Township, employing more than 90% of the population. The usual crops include rice, wheat, corn, millet, pulses, oilseeds, coffee, oranges, damson, potatoes, and natural fibres. However, Matupi still depends on the import of rice supplies from the lowlands. Although the primary occupation is agriculture, it is not well developed due to the scarcity of large valleys and plains. Shifting cultivation is still prevalent. Terraced cultivation is slowly being introduced along the hillsides. Due to difficult terrain, human labor is the main driving force of work done. Teak and other hardwoods are found at elevation below 900 meters. Above 900 meters there are oaks and pines. Teak, pines, canes, resin and turpentine are important forest products. Since electricity is not available in most villages, people depend on the wood for cooking. Forestry is also an imperative resource of income. Transportation The main roads from Matupi are: one that goes to Mindat (102 miles long) and the other one goes to Hakha township (173 miles long). Then the distance between Matupi and Paletwa are 135 miles and three furlongs as well. Depending on the weather, there are buses that go back and forth between Pakokku located in Magway or Magwe Division and Matupi on a weekly basis. There may be even times when buses would go back and forth between Matupi and Pakokku more than once a week. Minibuses from Pakkokku's Junction 8 bus station depart for Matupi most mornings starting at 7am, passing through Mindat. The road is paved and windy to Mindat and then semi-paved and much more bumpy from Mindat to Matupi. Motion sickness medicine is recommended, if needed. The front seat can be requested when purchasing your ticket. The minibuses also return from Matupi to Pakokku each morning. The minibus from Pakokku to Matupi takes 12 to 18 hours depending on weather, engine trouble, etc. Minibuses often caravan in group of 2 to 4 or more in order to support each other in case of engine trouble, etc. between Mindat to Matupi. Two large bridges over rivers have been constructed in the past 18 months, increasing the accessibility between Pakokku and Matupi [as of May 2016]. From time to time, private cars would also go between Pakokku and Matupi and vice versa. Usually, as Matu people are friendly and considerate, you may even be able to hitch a ride with those traveling by privately owned cars just by simply asking them or by paying a small amount of money to help cover for the gas cost. Both roads leading to Matupi are not well-paved roads. Road near Mindat, which lies between Matupi and Pakokku. History Under British rule, the township was included in Hakha district Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs issued and ordered to be Matupi township on March 22, 1948. Batupuei refers to the inhabitants of Matupi, Chin State, Myanmar (Burma). Batu is an ethnic group in Southern Chin State, descendants of Batu, the first settler at Batu village; the group is also referred to as Batupuei‚Äî Batu being the name of a person (later it is known as a tribe) and 'Puei' meaning \\"great\\". The tribe migrated from Central Burma (Myanmar) or northern Matupi after moving place to place as the Chin people migrated from China. Kachin and Chin were siblings who were from Mongoloid in China. Some Chin people settled along the Chindwin River and Central Burma (Myanmar), while some continued to find the place too mountainous area and hilly. Those Chin People who lived in plain areas called themselves \\"Asho Chin\\" and those settling in Western Burma (Myanmar) called themselves \\"Hilly Chin\\". This Batu tribe is one of the Chin tribes which originated in Mongolian who were living on the delta of the Chindwin River, but then moved to western Burma. There were three other members among their siblings and Batu is one of them. Others are Lungngo or Tingpaw and Thaiphum. Each of them are settled in the present places and areas. This particular place became Batupuei, which was named Matupi officially later. These are the four wards in Matupi: Ngala Ward, Longvan ward, Khoboi ward, and Cangbong ward. Among these ward Ngala, Longvan and Khoboi ward are the major places where the following clans reside: Yungpoeih, Laithang, Tuimuk, Taknan, Rhinguet, Takluem, Thintuep, Hmanrhing, Thanghul, Rhalawk, Sampok, Tlungmaa, Thangkhoeng, Oitoe and Longla. These fourteen clans are called Batu. They speak the same language, Batu or Batupuei. This Batupuei (Matupi) is a main centre for all Matu people. Whenever the people of Batupuei shot wild animals such as tiger, bear and boar, they will call proudly saying \\"Khuih Haihdamca\\", showing the significance of their own braveness, glory and ability. Occupants The occupants in Matupi township is very diverse with many different Chin tribes residing in the area, thus making Matupi township a very popular place to be throughout Chin State. In the Matupi township, there are 6 major tribes namely Matu, Dai, Zotung, Lautu, Khumi and Mara (Miram). All these major tribes in the Matu township have their own unique culture and language, which is common in Chin State. For example, However, all these tribes also speak the Matupi language (\\"Nga La\\") dialect to communicate with the locals and majority of occupants in Matupi. According to 2009 registration, the total population of Matupi township was 50,580 and 6,630 houses in Matupi township. However the occupants of people in Matupi has increased overtime. The four wards in Matupi are Longvan ward, Ngala ward, Khoboi ward, and Cangbong ward. =Religious make-up= Christianity is adhered by an overwhelming majority (approximately 98% of the population) and the rest are mainly Buddhists or Animist. Many Matupi people have also served as missionaries and pastors in places like the United States, Australia, India, south-east Asia, and in the Pacific island nations. They also carry out missionary activity inside Myanmar. Due to the current political situations in Myanmar, hundreds of Matupi are scattered in Europe, the United States, Australia, India, East Asia and south-east Asia. Among Christians, Baptists are the predominant group constituting more than 60 percent of the township population. Christian Reformed, Catholics, Revivalists, Presbyterian, Seventh- day Adventist, The Church of The Living God (thlangbol) and Pentecostals are the other Christian denominations. Catholics are found in significant numbers in parts of the township.The churches in Matupi (Matupi kah thlangbol) as all Christian believers must be represent the locality in Matupi. Matupi is the fastest growing Christian area in Chin State. There is one Theological College in Matupi. \\\\- =Language= The people in Matu speak several Matupi dialects, and they generally call those dialects as \\"Matupi ol‚Äù or ‚ÄùMatu Lai‚Äù. Almost all the tribes of Matupi have their own dialect or language. The traditional languages do not have any script of their own. The Christian Missionaries used Roman script for these languages. Along with Chin Dialects in Myanmar, the Matupi dialect is distinctive, therefore some words are the same with other Chin dialects. However, the most common Matu dialect spoken in Matupi is the \\"Nga La\\" dialect, as the main occupants are the Batu people. The people of Matupi village call themselves \\"Matupi\\" (pronounced locally as Batupuei ). Most commonly used Matupi greetings are: \\"How are you doing?\\" (Na sa ding ah?) or \\"Have you eaten rice?\\" (Buh na caak coeng ah?). Other common sentences are \\"I thirst water\\" (Tui ka hal), \\"Have you slept?\\" (Na ip coeng ah), \\"Have u arrived?\\" (Na pha coeng ah) or \\"You are taking long\\" (Na rau lai), which is the Batu dialect or known as \\"Nga La\\" dialect. Among Chin Dialects in Myanmar, Matupi Chin dialect is unique. Some words are the same with other Chin dialects. Commonly, one type of Chin dialect can communicate with another type of Chin dialect (Haka dialect can be understood by Htantlang, Tiddim dialect can be used to communicate with Ton Zang dialect, etc.). The Matu dialect is moderate to learn and can be quite easy for some Chins to learn as it has similarity here and there with all other Chin dialects. =Appearance= The Matupi people are of vice-average tallness, having the stumpy facial features, the hair is straight, black, the color of the skin is brownish yellow. The eyes of the Matupi people are similar to the Mongolian outward appearance. =Tourism= Tourism is important, but largely limited due to insurgency but it has been now open for the tourists recently after the transforming of a new government. As of May 2016 the Mindat and Matupi area has been open to foreigners approximately 18 months more than ever. Travel to Matupi Township is mainly by car on poor roads that cut along the mountainsides and valleys. Due to stiff terrain and very rugged nature of the landscape, travel can be difficult. Landslides are common especially during the rainy season. In certain areas cars have to carry shovels to clear landslides and/or fallen rocks. Normally Matu villagers would travel daily on foot from village to village and/or to and from the farms. \\"Matupi is extremely amiable and affectionately beautiful. It is home to several tribes. The township has much to be explored. The virgin environments of the township are breathtakingly charming. You must visit Matupi Township to experience the panorama of nature, the tenderness and hospitality of the people, generous blossoms and bashful rivers making their ways through the rugged terrains. If you love nature, adventures, hiking, trail blazing, and are excited about tedious lifestyle...then a tour to Matupi Township would be a fantastic choice. Lovely drive through the Jungles & Villages will take you to the Gateway of the friendly people of Matupi.\\" The US government advises to reconsider travel to Matupi and issued a warning as of August 2020. Economic, education and social development potential Town Market The market is busy with many vendors 6am-8am, but may vary by sunrise time. [May, 2016] =Economic potentials= Matupi is located in a potential but untapped trade route between India and Myanmar. There is so much room for growth. Modernization of transportation and communication infrastructures are definitely required. Reliable, and affordable electricity is necessary in order to run local manufacturing and service industries as well as homes. Efficient utilization of hydroelectric power harnessed from local streams and waterfalls, and wind power by the establishment of wind farms need to be formulated and implemented. These modernization efforts will pave ways for establishment of hotels, motels, storage facilities for goods, reliable financial systems, saving trees from being used as firewood, and allow better competitive service for the benefit of local consumers. At the moment, due to various constraints and lack of well-implemented strategies for long-term improvement of the local economy, many local people must rely on government jobs, slash and burn agricultural tactics, and/or remittances that are sent by relatives living abroad. Potentials also include setting up businesses that tap into service, manufacturing, and agricultural industries. Service industries can be but are not limited to ecotourism, and establishment of non-governmental public service organizations or providers. Due to rampant deforestation that has taken place as a result of the need for firewood, for agricultural needs, or for economic consumption, there is a great need for reforestation projects. These start-up businesses as well as development projects can be supported through grants such as: Japanese Grass-Root Grant, NZ Aid, Australia Aid, Canada Fund, US Aid, Switzerland Fund, as well as other funds and grants from other governments, foundations, and entities. Potentials in manufacturing industries (cottage industry, small-scale industry, medium-scale industry) can include production of perfume, soap, shampoo, herbal tea, medicine (both herbal and non-traditional), cloth and blankets (traditional as well as non- traditional), handicrafts, furniture (both wood and cane), water bottling and other goods. These services in turn will provide jobs in the field of logistic, marketing, packaging, communication, and human resources. Since most of the needed raw materials are readily available, the industries would have an advantage in the cost factor, as well as reliable and timely procurement of raw materials. Demands for raw materials can, in turn, promote development of sustainable agriculture, horticulture, and other service related industries. Because of the weather and topography, Matupi's mild and cool climate is a blessing for those that want to have orchards, grow vegetables, flowers, medicinal plants, and other agricultural activities. As such, with the realization of reliable transportation network, farmers can grow orchards such as orange, tangerine, avocado, pear, peach and other fruits. The fruits can be marketed to Bangladesh, India, cities in Myanmar, and to foreign countries either as fresh products or after they have been canned, or simply as fruit jams, dried fruits, and fruit juice. Development of greenhouses will make it possible for growing vegetables, flowers and medicinal plants all-year round. The flowers and medicinal plants then can even be exported to foreign countries, use as raw materials for perfume, medicine, herbal tea, etc. Vegetables once available all year-round as a result of the green houses, will help fight nutrition deficiencies among the local population, export to markets in Myanmar or can be even be exported other countries if they are dried, canned, or bottled. These business activities in turn will support the local service industries. With fresh springs, and streams readily available, local enterprises in Matupi can set up water bottling plants using the local fresh springs and streams. The Pacific nation of Fiji has established a successful example in exporting bottled \\"Fiji Water\\" to nations abroad. All of the possibilities for economic development mentioned above cannot be materialized without the role and support of the newly elected leaders from both the state and central government. Henceforth, the newly elected leaders at both the state legislature as well as those in Pyidaungsu Hluttaw will have to prove their genuine commitment for the development of the whole country especially ethnic and nationality regions such as Chin State of which Matupi is a part. Establishing special economic zones (SEZ) in both the northern and southern regions of Chin state will not only alleviate the poverty of the people living in Chin State but will also boost the economic well-being of the whole country. Matupi has two main high schools: No. 1 Basic Education of Matupi and No 2. Basic Education of Matupi, the one is located at Longvan ward and the other is located at Cangbong ward.

The brick and brownstone tower, which was completed in 1890, generally is regarded as Kansas City's first skyscraper and was the first building in the city equipped with elevators. It was commissioned by the New York Life Insurance Company, which also used the same design for an identical building in Omaha that was completed in 1889. Several buildings around the world share its name. A centerpiece of the Library District and West Ninth Street/Baltimore Avenue Historic District neighborhoods, the building is located amidst other, historic structures: it is across Ninth Street from the Kansas City Club and just down Baltimore Avenue from the Central Library. Background The building was designed in 1885 by Frederick Elmer Hill of the New York City architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White. Hill, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1882, came to Kansas City in 1885 initially to oversee the construction of his design but ended up staying until 1901, during which time he designed some other notable buildings. From 1893 until 1895, he was involved in the design and construction of what is today Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral on nearby Quality Hill. Hill also designed Convention Hall. Built in Italianate Renaissance Revival style, the New York Life Building has a brick and brownstone exterior and an H-shaped footprint with ten-story wings flanking a twelve-story tower. A monumental bald eagle tending eaglets in a nest is perched above the main entry. The work was sculpted by Louis St. Gaudens and contains more than two tons of cast bronze. With an Italian granite atrium floor in the lobby, the building's location marked the first significant movement of the city south from its founding at the River Market along the Missouri River. The imposing structure also marked a dramatic change in the skyline of Kansas City, where the tallest buildings previously had been three or four stories.New York Life Building - kchistory.org - Retrieved January 9, 2009 In 1970, the New York Life Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.Jackson County National Register Listings - dnr.mo.gov - Retrieved January 8, 2008 In 1988, however, it was abandoned.

He was noted as a Coloured writer who wrote works in Afrikaans that dealt with racial discrimination and satirized the political situation.Albert S. G√©rard, European-language Writing in Sub-Saharan Africa, p. 224 Some collections include English poems, and he translated the Afrikaans poet N P van Wyk Louw into English. Life Adam Small was born on 21 December 1936 in Wellington. He matriculated in 1953 at the St Columbas High School in Athlone on the Cape Flats. He then attended the University of Cape Town where he studied for a degree in Languages and Philosophy. In 1963 he completed an MA (cum laude) in the philosophy of Nicolai Hartmann and Friedrich Nietzsche. During the same time period he studied at the University of London and the University of Oxford. Adam became a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Fort Hare in 1959, and in 1960 he was one of the academic founders of the University of the Western Cape (UWC) when he was appointed as the Head of the Philosophy Department. In the early 1970s he joined the Black Consciousness Movement. In 1973 he was pressured to resign from the UWC. This prompted a move to Johannesburg, where he became the Head of Student Body Services at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits). He returned to Cape Town in 1977, where he was Director of the Western Cape Foundation for Community Services until 1983. In 1984 he returned to the UWC as the Head of the Social Services Department, a position he held until his retirement in 1997. Recognition Small was awarded the Hertzog Prize in 2012 for his contribution to the drama genre. Although the award was well received for being long overdue, some controversy arose because the Academy, in making the award, broke one of their own rules stating that the prize can only be awarded to a writer who has published new and substantial work in a specific genre during the previous three years. Small's last play was published in 1983. One of his famous poems is called \\"Doemanie.\\" After decades spent out of the public eye, Small, on 14 September 2013, received a hero's welcome at the Breytenbach Centre in Wellington, where he was guest of honour at the centre's Poet Festival. He read a selection of poems from his latest anthology Klawerjas. In 2015 a new drama, Maria, Moeder van God, was broadcast on Radio Sonder Grense's yearly art festival programme.  Literary style  Small is known for his use of the Kaaps Afrikaans dialect, which is primarily associated with lower-class coloured speakers. This choice was attacked by many of his contemporary critics, due to a sense that he was allying himself with (white) Afrikaans interests and that he was allowing the community's specific language to be ridiculed. However, this choice makes him something of a literary pioneer in Afrikaans literary history. Small was also a member of the Sestigers, an influential South African literary group that was working in the 1960s. This group attempted to revolutionise the dominant literature by questioning the political, racial and sexual problems with the nation.

They had at least four children together, recorded as follows in their 1927 naturalization records in the United States: *Arthur (July 12, 1917 --June 1987) *Florence, born March 25, 1920 *Samuel E. (February 20, 1923--June 1987) *Joseph, born August 24, 1926 In later years, Matthew sometimes said that he came from Lagos, Nigeria. But, in his 1927 petition for naturalization, Matthew lists his place of birth as Spooner's Village, British West Indies. When he registered in 1942 with the US Selective Service during World War II, he listed his place of birth as St. Christopher, British West Indies. Immigration to the United States Matthew immigrated to New York City and arranged for his family to join him. In 1919, he founded the Commandment Keepers Congregation of the Living God in Harlem, a Black Hebrew movement. He was strongly influenced by the white Jews he had met. When he learned about the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, he began to identify with them. Matthew trained rabbis, who set up synagogues throughout the United States and the Caribbean. When interviewed, many of the older members of this community recall memories of their parents observing Jewish dietary laws, such as abstaining from pork or salting their meat. Matthew and his congregation were also strongly influenced by the pan-African philosophy of Marcus Garvey from Jamaica, and his black nationalist organization, the Universal Negro Improvement Association. Rabbi Arnold Josiah Ford composed the UNIA's Universal Ethiopian Anthem and its hymnal. He also led the UNIA band and conducted its choir. In his theory of Black Hebrews, Matthew believed that African-Americans were of the original Jews, descended from the Lost Tribes. He thought that white or European Jews were the descendants of the Khazars and had kept and preserved Judaism. Black Hebrews talked of regaining or returning to Judaism. Conservative and Orthodox Jews did not agree with his theory and believed that people either had to be descended directly from Jewish mothers, or undergo recognized conversion under Jewish authorities to be considered Jews. Matthew eventually concluded Black Jews, or Black Hebrews as in his congregations, would not be accepted by the white Jewish community. Matthew's congregation followed traditional Jewish law with selective variations. Men and women were seated separately, standard Orthodox Jewish prayer books were used, and the laws concerning Shabbat and kashrut were observed. Matthew incorporated his congregation in 1930, and it eventually moved to Brooklyn.Anthony B. Pinn, The African American Religious Experience in America (Google eBook), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, p. 84 There he established the Israelite Rabbinical Academy, where he taught and ordained rabbis in his movement. Wentworth Matthew's teachings are followed today by many Black Hebrews and Black Hebrew Israelites, which have developed along different lines. The latter reject whites altogether. Matthew believed that blacks who converted to Judaism were not converting, but rather \\"returning\\" to Judaism. Matthew applied and was rejected twice to become a member of the New York Board of Rabbis, as he did not satisfy their rules of Jewish descent or conversion by recognized Orthodox or Conservative courts. They resisted his introducing African, Caribbean or African-American practices into Jewish worship. According to a 2002 article by Rabbi Sholomo Ben Levy, also a Black Hebrew, after Matthew's death in 1973, there was little connection between Black Jews and white congregations in New York and elsewhere.Rabbi Sholomo Ben Levy, \\"The Black Jewish or Hebrew Israelite Community\\", Black-Jewish Relations, Virtual Jewish Library, accessed 12 April 2014 Legacy Rabbis ordained from the Israelite Rabbinical Academy in Brooklyn have become spiritual leaders of Black Hebrews in numerous cities. For instance, Capers Funnye, Jr. of Chicago studied with and was ordained by Levi Ben Levy, the spiritual leader of the Hebrew Israelite movement in Brooklyn from the Commandment Keepers tradition. In 1985 Funnye started as an assistant rabbi at the Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Chicago, which he now leads. It is the largest Black Jewish or Black Hebrew congregation in the US. He also underwent a conversion certified by a Conservative court of rabbis, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Jewish Studies and Master of Science in Human Service Administration from the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies in Chicago. He has worked for decades to build bridges with traditional Judaism. p. 48 In 1995 he was one of three founders of the Alliance of Black Jews, together with Robin founders from Boston and California. They sought to build bridges among all types of African-American Jews. It is no longer operating.

But he also criticized the Iraqi government for denying that it sent envoys to him to discuss the Battle of Basra (2008) in the week of 24 March 2008. The Iraqi government said the operation that began 25 March targeted criminals who had been carrying out indiscriminate attacks, burglaries and oil smuggling. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki called the Battle of Basra (2008) but said it exposed weaknesses in the security forces, including operational snafus and troop desertions that he said will be addressed and reviewed. He brushed off criticism that the widespread action was poorly planned, was politically motivated and failed to dislodge the renegade militias from their strongholds across Basra. Al-Maliki promised a major offensive targeting Al-Qaeda in Iraq in the northern city of Mosul. ** A Sadr City resident said mosque loudspeakers blared the call to protest. * 4 April ‚Äì Saleh al-Ageili, a spokesman for the Sadrist Movement, reported that Muqtada al-Sadr had called for peaceful demonstrations in Sadr City after prayers \\"to protest the campaign of raids carried out by the occupier.\\" * 7 April ‚Äì ** The Pentagon said it does not expect Gen. David Petraeus to recommend or predict additional U.S. troop cuts in Iraq, beyond the 20,000 U.S. troops returning home as the troop \\"surge\\" ends in July 2008, when he testifies before his \\"State of Iraq\\" report to the United States Congress on 8 April 2008 and 9 April 2008. After the surge ends in July 2008, there will be 15 U.S. combat brigade teams in Iraq, and roughly 140,000 American troops. ** White House spokesman Tony Fratto admitted the Battle of Basra (2008)-operation was not \\"an overall success\\" for Iraqi government forces. * 8 April ‚Äì ** Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of multinational forces in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker answered questions from key member of the United States Senate. All three leading presidential candidates‚ÄîDemocratic Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Republican Sen. John McCain ‚Äì questioned Petraeus and Crocker. ** Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of multinational forces in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, told the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services and the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that Iranian agents and weapons are fueling the ongoing strife there and that further U.S. troop withdrawals will have to wait. Although the last of the additional U.S. combat brigades dispatched in 2007 is scheduled to leave in June 2008, Petraeus said he would recommend against further withdrawals for at least 45 days. Future troop levels be based on conditions on the ground. In the seven months since their last appearance before Congress, U.S. and Iraqi forces made progress toward tamping down the violence but the progress was \\"fragile\\" and \\"reversible.\\" ** Petraeus told senators the Iraqi government's operation Battle of Basra (2008) \\"could have been better planned, and the preparation could have been better.\\" He said that once the forces got into Basra, \\"they ended up going into action more quickly than anticipated\\" and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki didn't follow his advice to move at a more careful pace. ** Opening the Senate hearings, the Armed Services Committee chairman, Carl Levin, said the United States must come up with a timeline for ending its involvement in Iraq. ** When asked by Republican Senator John Warner whether the Iraq War is making the U.S. safer, Petraeus stated that it would ultimately be up to history.Bennen, S.

She said it is \\"time to begin an orderly process of withdrawing our troops\\" from Iraq in order to focus on Afghanistan and other U.S. interests. ** Barack Obama, a member of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, questioned whether the conditions set by U.S. commanders for withdrawal would lead to a war that could last until 2028 or 2038. He called the invasion of Iraq a \\"massive strategic blunder\\" that allowed Al-Qaeda and Iran to spread their influence into Iraq, and said the United States should pressure Iraqi officials to settle the war by threatening to leave. Senator Barack Obama remarked, \\"if the definition of success is so high: no traces of Al Qaida and no possibility of reconstitution, a highly- effective Iraqi government, a democratic multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian functioning democracy with no Iranian influence, at least not of the kind that we don't like, then that portends the possibility of us staying for 20 or 30 years. If, on the other hand, our criteria is a messy, sloppy status quo but there's not huge outbreaks of violence, there's still corruption, but the country is struggling along, but it's not a threat to its neighbors and it's not an Al Qaida base, that seems to me an achievable goal within a measurable timeframe.\\" ** America's ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, said that the United States has to keep its forces in Iraq unless it wants Iran to have a free hand in Iraq. * 9 April ‚Äì Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of multinational forces in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker answered questions from United States House of Representatives members. * 10 April ‚Äì ** President George W.

Sheikh Fowzi Saad al-Obeidi called the killing an \\"act of provocation\\" after the \\"siege of Sadr City.\\" He was referring to the battles since 6 April 2008 involving members of al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia and Iraqi security forces dominated by a rival Shiite political movement, the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. That fighting started with the Battle of Basra (2008) and spread to other Shiite regions, including Sadr City and the Babil provincial capital of Hilla. The intra-Shiite fighting in Iraq that has killed hundreds of people in the past two weeks involved two main movements: members of the Mahdi Army militia loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr, and Iraqi security forces dominated by the chief political rival of the Sadrists, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. The al-Nuri assassination prompted officials to expand the daily curfew in Hilla. 17 people killed over 24 hours in airstrikes, fighting and attacks in areas wracked in recent weeks by fighting among Shiites. Witnesses and media reported heavy fighting between U.S.-backed Iraqi troops and al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia. U.S. troops working in support of Iraqi soldiers killed two snipers. At the same time at least six roadside bombs damaged vehicles in a U.S. Army convoy that was transporting barriers for a group of Iraqi Army soldiers establishing a checkpoint. ** Unmanned aerial vehicles targeted and killed six suspected insurgents in Basra. ** Suicide bombings killed at least four people‚Äîthree of them police. The first bombing was in Ramadi, the provincial capital of the predominantly Sunni Anbar province. At least three national police officers were killed. The second attack took place at a checkpoint about 20 km north of Baiji, the bomber and one other person a local Awakening Council were killed. Also, at least three people were killed in a mortar attack on Baghdad's Palestine Hotel. * 14 April ‚Äì Three people died in the nearby city of Tal Afar when a suicide attacker blew himself up at an Iraqi soldier's funeral. * 15 April ‚Äì A wave of bombings blamed on Al-Qaeda in Iraq-jihadists shook Baghdad, Baquba, Ramadi and Mosul, killing at least 60 people. Nonetheless, the overall violence in Baquba has decreased by 80 percent since June 2007. * 17 April ‚Äì A suicide bomber killed at least 15 people and wounded many others in a suicide attack on a crowd of mourners in Baquba, during the funerall of two members of a local group who had died fighting al-Qaeda in Iraq militants. * 22 April ‚Äì A female suicide bomber killed six people and wounded a dozen others when she blew herself up north of Baghdad according to Iraqi police. * 29 April ‚Äì In April 2008, the United States government accused an alleged Iranian-backed insurgency of launching attacks on Iraqi civilians and US-led multinational forces and claimed that approximately 90 percent of foreign militants entered Iraq through Syria, but again, provided no proof. \\"Iran and Syria must stop the flow of weapons and foreign fighters into Iraq, and their malign interference in Iraq,\\" U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said Monday in a report to the U.N.

It was released in Japan in August 2008, and was localized in English in 2011. The game was released in North America on February 13, 2014 as a downloadable game via the Nintendo eShop. This release includes updated graphics and visuals. The game was also included in an compilation for the Nintendo 3DS, Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3: Endo Mamoru's Legend, which released in Japan in December 2012. The game has spawned a franchise, with numerous sequels and other media. An Inazuma Eleven manga based on the games began serialization in CoroCoro Comic in May 2008, while an anime based on the games aired in October 2008. Mitsui has also created a collectible card game tie-in. Plot The main character, , is a very talented goalkeeper and the grandson of the late , one of the strongest goalkeepers in Japan and coach of the legendary football team, the Inazuma Eleven (though Endou is unaware of this). He is captain of his school's (Raimon Jr. High) football team, and dreams of competing in the Football Frontier tournament one day. The club is on the verge of disbanding, as the other members seem uninterested in training. One day, a mysterious forward named moves to Endou's school. Gouenji used to be the top striker at his old school, and has gained the attention of Teikoku Academy (led by team captain Yuto Kidou and principal Reiji Kageyama), the most prestigious school in the area. They come to Raimon and challenge them to a football match, despite Gouenji refusing to join Raimon's team. They are much more powerful than anticipated, and Raimon's out-of-practice players take a horrible beating. Gouenji decides to join the team to help them out, and his sudden appearance surprises Teikoku, which he uses as an opportunity to score a goal. As the first goal scored against Teikoku Academy in years, Kidou counts it as a win for Raimon and leaves with his team. The victory gets Raimon a lot of attention, allowing them access into the Football Frontier tournament, which they gladly accept. They prove themselves as a force-to-be reckoned-with, winning all of their matches and reaching the finals. Before the match, Kageyama uses the team's coach to spy on them, and orders him to kill them by draining the brake fluid from their bus. His plan is foiled by Natsumi Raimon the school counsellor's daughter, who promptly gets the teacher fired. At the match, Kageyama tries to kill them again by crushing them with girders. They survive thanks to a warning from Kidou, and Dark is promptly arrested by Detective Onigawara. The match goes on, and after a long battle, Raimon emerges victorious. The team then move onto the Football Frontier nationals, but learn they will be unable to compete without a coach. Detective Onigawara points Mark in the direction of a man named Seigou Hibiki, who used to be part of Raimon's team from forty years ago, the Inazuma Eleven. explains that the team was coached by Endou's grandfather Daisuke, and that they were an unstoppable soccer team. This excites Mark, until Hibiki tells him about how their run was ended when their bus crashed on the way to their last Football Frontier match, injuring the players and preventing them from competing. Despite his past, Hibiki agrees to be the team's coach, and also gets the team training with the now-elderly members of the Inazuma Eleven. This training helps them win their next few matches, along with the assistance of Kidou, who joins them after Teikoku is crushed by Zeus Junior High, who, unbeknownst to them, is being led by Kageyama. Zeus also continue to win all their games, each time leaving their opponents unable to continue. This means the final will be Raimon versus Zeus. When Raimon arrive at the stadium for the finals (which is a floating palace in the sky), they see the members of Zeus drinking a so-called 'ambrosia', which turns out to be filled with drugs to improve their abilities. The first half begins, and Zeus begin winning instantly thanks to the ambrosia; benching most of the players and scoring goal after goal. As the first half ends, Natsumi realises that the drinks are spiked, and goes to switch the drinks with regular water. Her plan succeeds, and Zeus are forced to play through the remainder of the game as a normal team, allowing Raimon to seize victory and win the Football Frontier. Gameplay By talking to Otonashi inside the team's clubroom, players can scout out other members of the school they want to add to their team, either by name/criteria, or by a 'connection map', which grows bigger the more players obtained from it. They can then locate them on the overworld and challenge them to a battle, which, if won, adds them to their party. Also, by talking to Natsumi in the clubroom, players can recruit people from the various teams they have beaten in the main story. There are nearly 1000 playable characters to collect, each with their own unique design, stats and abilities, but only 100 can be contained in a player's party at once. The other part of the game is the football matches themselves. Players control their team with the stylus, moving players and passing between teammates. Running into an opponent initiates a command duel, where the player can do things like dodge an opponent's attempt at a tackle, slide-tackle to take the ball away, or attempt to score a goal. The result of any of their players' actions in a duel are determined by their form, which is decided by their stats (Kick, Body, Control, Guard, Speed, Stamina, and Guts), the player's element (either Wood, Air, Earth or Fire, which work in a 'rock- paper-scissors'-like fashion), and the total number of players participating in an action. Matches either take the form of the aforementioned 4-a-side kickabouts against members of the school, or a full-scale 11-a-side game against one of the other teams competing in the tournaments. In full-size games, players can have up to five substitutes ready to switch in during a time-out. Before a match begins, players can change their team's formation using cards they've obtained by beating other teams and looking in chests. Winning matches grants teams experience points (which level up their players), prestige points (which are used to buy items in shops and to recover FP and TP), and friendship points (which are spent when scouting and recruiting new players), as well as recovery items, equipment, and formation cards. Instead of making standard movements in duels like dodging or shooting, players can also use special abilities that they learn either by levelling up or by using a special move manual. They are typically more powerful and effective than their normal counterparts, and can normally only be stopped by other moves, but cost TP (Technical Points) to use. These abilities include things like summoning a dragon to shoot the ball, or creating a giant hand of energy to save a shot with. Special moves also have elements, which give them a boost when used by a player of the same element. Sometimes, the victor of a duel can receive a foul, resulting in a free kick (or penalty). Other mid-match abilities include: time-outs, where the player can pause the match to plan movements or switch in subs and then initiate them after un-pausing; charges, where the player taps on a team-member rapidly to give them a speed boost (at the cost of Fitness Points, or FP); and firing-up, which boosts a team's overall performance.

It is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Paderborn. The bishop's seat is in Fulda Cathedral. History The history of the Diocese of Fulda goes back to the founding of a monastery by Saint Boniface in 744. Boniface named Saint Sturm the abbot of the monastery. On 4 November 751, Pope Zachary decreed that the monastery would not be under the control of any diocese but rather directly under the Pope. This special relationship with Rome is illustrated still today in the statue of Saint Peter that stands in the Cathedral. Because Boniface's expressly requested that his body be taken to Fulda after his death (rather than to Mainz or Utrecht), the area became a popular destination for pilgrims. Boniface, along with Sturm, were named the patron saints of the monastery and later of the diocese. Through gifts and donations, the monastery's influence grew ever stronger in the following centuries. Under Rabanus Maurus in the 9th century, the monastery became the scientific center of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1220, the abbey was elevated to an abbey-principality by Frederick II. In 1571, Jesuits settled in Fulda and made a considerable contribution to the efforts of the Counter-Reformation. During the reign of Prince-abbot Balthasar von Dernbach (1570-1576 and 1602-1606), the region was the site of extensive witch-hunts with 300 witch-trials carried out in three years. This number made Fulda one of the central areas of the early-modern European witch-hunts. On 5 October 1752, Pope Benedict XIV raised the abbey to the level of a diocese. In 1802, with the German mediatisation, the political principality of the diocese was dissolved, but the diocese itself remained. Prince-Bishop Adalbert von Harstall remained the bishop of the diocese until his death in 1814. After his death the diocese was overseen by an administrator rather than a bishop. The borders of the diocese were altered by papal bulls in 1821 and 1827. In 1857, the diocese was expanded to include the grand duchy of Saxe-Weimar. From 1873 to 1881, during the Kulturkampf, when Chancellor Otto von Bismarck attempted to lessen the political power of the church, the bishop's seat sat empty again. In 1929, the diocese lost some regions in the area of Frankfurt am Main to the diocese of Limburg, receiving the predominant Catholic commissariat in Heiligenstadt and the deanery of Erfurt from the diocese of Paderborn, itself elevated to archdiocese. The Diocese of Fulda then switched as suffragan from the Upper Rhenish Ecclesiastical Province to the new Paderbon-led Middle German Ecclesiastical Province. During the partition of Germany after World War II, it became much more difficult for the Bishop of Fulda, as well as the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, to conduct the business of his office in the parts of his diocese which lay in the eastern zone. Therefore, 1946 saw the appointment of the provost of the Erfurt Cathedral to the position of vicar general of the eastern sections of both the Fuldean and W√ºrzburger diocese. In 1953, he was made auxiliary bishop of the region. With the reordering of the Catholic Church in East Germany, in 1973, by decree of the Holy See, the East German regions of both diocese were reassigned to the Episcopal Office of Erfurt- Meiningen (). The leader of the Episcopal Office was an apostolic administrator and titular bishop. After an agreement between the Holy See and the German state of Thuringia, regarding the formation of the diocese of Erfurt on 14 June 1994, on 8 July, the Episcopal Office was made a diocese in itself by Pope John Paul II. Only the deanery of Geisa in the Thuringian Rh√∂n Mountains was returned to the diocese of Fulda, by virtue of their very close historical connection. One peculiarity is the curate of Ostheim, which according to church law as a historical part of Thuringia still belongs to the diocese of Fulda but, since 1945, has been administered by the diocese of W√ºrzburg.

In 1888 he published Das Neue Naturheilverfahren (The New Natural Healing), a book that became very popular and was translated into twelve languages. In 1895 Bilz founded a health spa at Radebeul that was soon expanded into a large sanitarium. In the early part of the 20th century, he constructed a Licht-Luft Bad (a large outdoor swimming pool) at the sanitarium (the \\"Bilzbad\\").

It resulted in the Treaty of London of 11 May 1867. The immediate occasion of the conference was the necessity of settling the status of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, which, after the downfall of the First Napoleon, had been added to the dominions of the King of the Netherlands as a separate and independent state and made a member of the German Confederation. Notwithstanding the dissolution of the confederation, Luxemburg continued to be occupied by Prussian troops, the French government insisting upon the removal of these troops and threatening war to enforce the demand. The conference was called to avert the new danger to the peace of Europe, and it solved the problem by the statesmanlike device of placing the Grand Duchy under the collective guarantee of the Great Powers as a permanently neutralized territory. The conference is notable for its clear recognition of the principle of neutralization and of the rights of a neutralized state, as well as the obligations incurred by the Powers joining in the collective guarantee. In an individual guarantee, such as that guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium, powers which signed the treaty would be bound to individually defend a nation's neutrality regardless of the actions of the other signatories. In a collective guarantee, such as this treaty with Luxemburg, the major signatories would act in concert or would not be required to act at all. The distinction between individual and collective guarantee resulted in some confusion when the Germans invaded both Belgium and Luxemburg in August 1914. Since Germany inherited Prussia's 1867 commitment to a collective guarantee, by invading Luxemburg it rendered impossible any joint action in defense of Luxemburg's neutrality. Britain was therefore not required to intervene to defend Luxemburg. However, since Belgium was individually guaranteed by the major powers (including Britain), the British government felt obliged to defend its neutrality against German invasion.

His views were republican and nationalist. He was also owner and captain of one of the first boats to sail under the tri-colour of the Irish Free State. O'Brien was a grandson of the Fenian William Smith O'Brien, and learned Irish. He was a ship builder and designer, and his notable boats include the Kelpie (used for gun running in 1914), the Saoirse (in which he circumnavigated the globe) and the A. K. Ilen (a Falkland Islands service ship, undergoing restoration). Early life Edward Conor Marshall O'Brien was born in Limerick on 3 November 1880. His grandfather was William O'Brien who was a member of Young Ireland; his grandfather and his aunt Charlotte Grace O'Brien both played roles in social reform. Robert Donough, his uncle, was an architect, and the painter Dermod O'Brien was his brother. O'Brien was educated in England at Winchester College and Oxford, and in Ireland in Trinity College.http://www.ilen.ie/what-we- do-2/ilen/ilens-history/ After his education he came back to Ireland and started practicing as an architect in 1903. According to the 1911 census he lived at 58 Mount Street, south County Dublin. Architect O'Brien was credited with two buildings in his lifetime: the Co-operative Hall in Co. Donegal and the People's Hall in Co. Limerick.http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/4061/O'BRIEN- EDWARDCONORMARSHALL#tab_works He was also known as a naval architect, having designed two ships, the Saoirse and the llen. He would later captain both of these ships himself. Across Three Oceans Cover of O'Brien's book Across Three Oceans O'Brien's boat Saoirse was reputedlyHolm, Donald (Don) (1974). The Circumnavigators: Small Boat Voyagers of Modern Times (Chapter 7). New York: Prentice-Hall. pp. xvi, 496. . the first small boat (42-foot, 13 metres long) to sail around the world, a journey that he documented in his book Across Three Oceans. O‚ÄôBriens voyage began and ended at the Port of Foynes, County Limerick, Ireland, where he lived.http://www.limerickleader.ie/what-s- on/features/o-brien-rode-wave-of-history-1-2187987 Saoirse, under O'Brien's command and with three crew, was the first yacht to circumnavigate the world by way of the three great capes: Cape Horn, Cape of Good Hope and Cape Leeuwin; and was the first boat flying the Irish tri-colour to enter many of the world's ports and harbours. He ran down his easting in the Roaring Forties and Furious Fifties between the years 1923 to 1925. Up until O'Brien's circumnavigation this route was the preserve of square-rigged grain ships taking part in the grain race from Australia to England via Cape Horn (also known as the clipper route). O'Brien's priority claim is contentious: Joshua Slocum, a Bostonian, was a single-handed yachtsman took that route, in 1895. Extreme weather forced Slocum to use some of the inshore routes between the channels and islands of Cape Horn and it is believed he may not have actually passed outside the Horn proper. Restoration of the Ilen O'Brien's seagoing experiences were put to use in his design of the A K Ilen which was built for the Falkland Islands as a service boat. In 1998 the Ilen returned to the site where it was first built, on the river Ilen near Baltimore in south-west Ireland, where it is currently undergoing a full restoration (expected to be completed by 2017). This task provided work-based learning for the students of the Ilen School. Gun running O'Brien had some involvement with gun running in 1914 on behalf of the Irish Volunteers, for political reasons (he was a home ruler) and because he had experience in sailing. He joined the Irish Volunteers on the boat the Kelpie, with George Mallory and Geoffrey Winthrop Young. On 26 July 1914, 900 guns were brought to Howth harbour.http://www.ilen.ie/what-we-do-2/ilen/the-gun-runner-1914/ He was also involved in bringing guns to Kilcoole beach on the Wicklow coast. After the gun running incidents, O'Brien served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7718929 Publications O'Brien authored a number of books which document his experiences of sailing, from which he distilled advice for other boat designers, builders and sailors. He also wrote novels on the nautical theme. ;Non-fiction * Across three oceans * From three yachts - a cruiser's outlook * The small ocean-going yacht * Yacht gear and gadgets * Sea-boats, oars and sails * The practical man's cruiser * On going to sea in yachts * Deep-water Yacht * Sea-boats, oars and sails * Voyage and Discovery (1933) ;Fiction * The Castaways * Two Boys go Sailing  Sources   *Life and ships of Conor O'Brien - documented on the A K Ilen restorer's website. *Conor O'Brien: Life, Works, Criticism, Notes *Foynes Yacht Club - History (paragraph 2 on Conor O'Brien and the Saoirse) References Category:Irish sailors Category:1880 births Category:1952 deaths ","title":"Edward Conor Marshall O'Brien"},{"id":"15142183","text":"Liahona may refer to: *Liahona (Book of Mormon), in the Book of Mormon, a brass ball of \\"curious workmanship\\" that provided directions for Lehi and his party while traveling *Liahona (magazine), a periodical published by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints *Liahona High School, a high school in Tonga owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints *Liahona Preparatory Academy, a private school in Pleasant Grove, Utah ","title":"Liahona"},{"id":"15142188","text":"Arabian, an example of a light riding horse A Lusitano, an example of a heavier-bodied riding horse A riding horse or a saddle horse is a horse used by mounted horse riders for recreation or transportation. It is unclear exactly when horses were first ridden because early domestication did not create noticeable physical changes in the horse. However, there is strong circumstantial evidence that horse were ridden by people of the Botai culture during the Copper Age, circa 3600-3100 BCE. The earliest evidence suggesting horses were ridden dates to about 3500 BCE, where evidence from horse skulls found at site in Kazakhstan indicated that they had worn some type of bit. Wear facets of 3 mm or more were found on seven horse premolars in two sites, Botai and Kozhai 1, dated about 3500‚Äì3000 BCE. It is theorized that people herding animals first rode horses for this purpose, presumably bareback, and probably used soft materials such as rope or possibly bone to create rudimentary bridles and hackamores. However, the earliest definitive evidence of horses being ridden dates to art and textual evidence dating to about 2000-1500 BCE.

During the final years of the American frontier, he became one of the most hunted in the Old West since Jesse James. From 1886 to 1890, he and his gang robbed express trains in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, the Indian Territory and Texas while pursued by hundreds of lawmen throughout the southern half of the United States, including the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. Biography=Early life= Born in Lamar County, Alabama on December 11, 1855, Rube Burrow worked on the family farm in Alabama until the age of 18 when he moved to Stephenville, Texas to work on his uncle's ranch. By all accounts, Burrow fully intended to become a rancher by saving up enough money to buy a spread of his own, marry and eventually start a family.Newton, Michael. Encyclopedia of Robbers, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 46-47) He attempted farming but his wife died of yellow fever in 1880, leaving him to care for two small children. He remarried in 1884 and moved to Alexander, Texas, but when his crops failed, he turned to robbing trains with his brother Jim in 1886. His unexpected turn to crime occurred on December 11, 1886 when he and his brother Jim teamed with W.L Brock, Leonard Brock, Henderson Brumley, and Nep Thornton to rob the Denver & Fort Worth Express while returning from a trip to the Indian Territory. Burrow and the other men waited at the train depot at Bellevue, Texas until the train arrived. Drawing their guns at the crew, in full view of the passengers, they entered the train, but were only able to collect $300 (the Fort Worth Daily Gazette reported the loss of $100.00 and ten to fifteen watches) as the passengers were able to hide most of their valuables by the time the outlaws passed through. In one of the cars, a U.S. Army sergeant of 24th Infantry Regiment (United States) and two privates were escorting two deserters in shackles. The passengers were able to persuade the sergeant not to fire at the outlaws, however he was later censured for cowardice by his superiors following the robbery. Meanwhile, Burrow had already begun planning his next holdup. =From Texas to Arkansas= Six months after their first robbery, Burrow and his gang boarded the Texas & Pacific Express heading eastbound from Benbrook, Texas June 9, 1887. Learning from their mistakes from the last holdup, Burrows had the engineer held at gunpoint and forced him to stop the train on a trestle outside the town. This was meant to discourage passengers, who would have to \\"brave the heights and meager footing\\" in order to interfere with the robbery. The loot was $1,350.00; from the mail car 3 registered letters were taken.Fort Worth weekly gazette., June 10, 1887, Page 6, Image 6 Although how much Burrow escaped with is not known, it was apparently enough for Burrows to rob a second train at the same spot on September 20, 1887. On the second occasion, news reports estimated Burrows and his gang escaped anywhere from $1,200The Austin weekly statesman., September 22, 1887, Image 1to between $12,000 and $30,000. On December 9, he and Jim Brock stopped the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railroad express train at Genoa, Arkansas. Despite the train being guarded by the Southern Express Company, the two men escaped with a Louisiana lottery payoff estimated to be between $10,000 and $40,000.Wichita eagle., December 11, 1887, Image 1 Because the Southern Express Company was a client of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the robbery came to the attention of Pinkerton detectives, lawmen and bounty hunters alike. Within five days, Pinkerton men came up with their first major lead. A deputy sheriff had reported that he had encountered three suspicious looking men on the day of the robbery. All three escaped, however one of the men left behind a raincoat which was eventually traced to a store in Dublin, Texas. The sales clerk identified the man who bought the coat as Jim Brock. Once in custody, Brock quickly confessed to participating in the robbery and named Burrow as the ringleader. Burrow was unknown to authorities, having no criminal record, and Brock insisted he did not know the whereabouts of his accomplice. The Pinkertons would get their second break when Brock received a letter from the outlaw leader. Burrow was not yet aware of Brock's arrest and detectives seized the opportunity to capture him. According to the return address, the letter was sent from Lamar County, Alabama and a posse was immediately sent to his homestead. Upon their arrival on January 8, 1888, they surrounded his home but found that Burrow had fled after being warned by his brother Jim at their approach. =On the run= Two weeks after making their escape, Rube and Jim Burrow were spotted by a conductor while riding on a Louisville & Nashville train in southern Alabama. Police surrounded the train when it arrived in Montgomery (or Nashville, Tennessee) and captured Jim after a brief gunfight. Rube Burrow was able to shoot his way out and escaped from the ambush alone. it was reported a printer named Neb Broy who attempted to pursue Rube received a bullet hole in the chest; during his escape Rube was involved in a second gunfight with a posse but escaped despite receiving birdshot wound in the neck.The sun., October 12, 1890, Page 15, Image 15 Jim was taken into custody and sent to jail in Texarkana where he would die from tuberculosis on October 5, 1888. On December 15, 1888, Burrow and S.C. Brock, aka Joe Jackson, robbed an Illinois Central express train at Duck Hill, Mississippi; when the conductor reported the robbery in progress, two passengers-Chester Hughes with a Winchester rifle and John Wilkenson with a revolver-rushed to the express car where Burrow was. In his posthumous confession, Burrow claimed to have killed Hughes, who in falling knocked the pistol out of Wilkinson's hand. Although Burrow was usually a cautious and detailed planner, he began to develop a reckless attitude which was further encouraged by his recent series of near escapes. Shortly after the gunfight at Montgomery, Burrow shot and killed Lamar County Postmaster Mose Graves in July 1889 during a heated argument when Graves demanded that Burrows sign for delivery of a package. The uncharacteristically cold-blooded murder of the postmaster turned the local residents against him and forced him to flee the county. Ironically, the package had contained a false beard Burrow had ordered to disguise himself. Burrow continued to rob trains despite being a wanted fugitive. In September of that year, he robbed the Mobile & Ohio express train near Buckatunna, Mississippi, and then the Northwestern Railroad train in Louisiana two months later. He was pursued by Pinkerton detectives following the robbery for two days across the Raccoon Mountains in Blount County, Alabama. The posse was forced to turn back after two trackers, [one of them William Penn Woodard; the other Harry Annerton], had been killed and three others seriously wounded. =Death= Becoming the sole subject of one of the most widespread manhunts in American history, Burrow would continue to elude authorities in the wilderness of Alabama hill country for another two years. On October 9, 1890,Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama, pages 2-3. Clanton, Alabama: Heritage Publishing Consultants, 2000. Rube Burrow was captured by two black men, Jesse Hildreth and Frank Marshall, with the help of two white planters, John McDuffie and Jeff \\"Dixie\\" Carter, at George Ford‚Äôs cabin, in Myrtlewood, Marengo County, Alabama on Dec 7, 1890. McDuffie had suspected Burrow would be in the area and warned Hildreth to be on the lookout. When Burrow showed up at Ford's cabin, Hildreth was inside and was able to get word back to McDuffie. Hildreth and Marshall jumped Burrow and held him for McDuffie and Carter. They took him to the jail in Linden, Alabama, with Burrow entertaining them all the way with funny stories. Rube offered Hildreth a hundred dollars if he would let him go. Hildreth said \\"I couldn't use it then, cause you'd kill me first\\". In the early morning hours of December 8, 1890, Burrow complained of hunger and talked his jailers into handing him his bag, which had some ginger snaps inside. It also contained a gun, and Burrow held it at the head of one of the guards. He escaped, locking two guards (including McDuffie) in his cell, and taking another guard with him to find Carter at Glass's store to get back money that had been taken from him. Burrow reportedly believed Dixie Carter was Nick Carter, the fictional detective. Carter was in the store, and when he came outside, he and Burrow exchanged gunfire. Afterwards, Burrow was dead in the street and Carter was wounded. Rube Burrow‚Äôs body was shipped by train back to Lamar County. It was reported that on a stop in Birmingham, thousands viewed the corpse and people snatched buttons from his coat, cut hair from his head, and even his boots were stolen. Burrow's father Allen Burrow met the train in Sulligent. It was reported that the train attendants threw the coffin at his feet. \\"It is Rube,\\" he reportedly said. Allen Burrow carried his son's body back to his home community near Vernon and buried him in Fellowship Cemetery.Picture of Burrow in a coffin In December 1890, accomplice Jackson committed suicide in the Jackson Penitentiary by jumping from his gallery to the floor. Accomplice Rube Smith was sentenced to 10 years in the Mississippi Penitentiary for the 1889 Buckatunna robbery, but was then tried again in Federal court for mail robbery, found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Ohio Penitentiary in January 1891 as inmate #21,849 and died April 20, 1895.The Express Gazette p. 108 The actor Paul Picerni played Burrow in a 1955 episode of the syndicated television series Stories of the Century, starring and narrated by Jim Davis.

She took part in the Battle of Valcour Island that delayed the British invasion. She was probably commissioned sometime early in August 1776, with a Captain Sumner in command. Early in October, she moved north with the other 14 ships of the American squadron. On the 11th, they met the vastly superior British squadron off Valcour Island in the northern reaches of the lake. The British discovered them in a shallow bay south of the island and moved in to begin a bombardment. By 11:00 that morning, the schooner Carleton and some gunboats had rowed to within gun range to open the shelling. The wind prevented the larger British vessels from getting into the fray. By 5:00 that afternoon when the British withdrew for the night, two of the larger American vessels were severely damaged and a third had to be run aground, burned, and abandoned. That night, Boston joined the remainder of the Americans in stealing away toward Crown Point to the south. The British discovered their flight on the morning of the 12th and struck out in pursuit. They did not finally catch the Americans until the morning of the 13th at a point just below Split Rock nearly halfway to their goal. A two-hour running fight ensued. Severely pressed, General Arnold took Congress and four of the gondolas into Buttonmold Bay on the eastern coast of the lake. There he unloaded small arms and destroyed the vessels by fire to prevent their capture. Boston was destroyed there on 13 October 1776.

It consists mostly of all-brick ranches and bungalow-style homes built in the 1940s and 1950s. Geography Mississippi Avenue at left marks the southern border of the neighborhood. At right is one of the Colorado driver's license offices. Athmar Park is bordered by Alameda Avenue on the north, Mississippi Avenue on the south, Federal Boulevard on the west and the South Platte River on the east. Four Denver parks, Aspgren, Huston Lake, Vanderbilt Park and Habitat Park are within the boundaries of Athmar Park. The eastern half of the neighborhood is lower in elevation than the west, with a sharp rise above the river beginning near Pecos Street and continuing the gradual climb in elevation toward the southwest. In contrast to the older grid-type streets found in many neighborhoods, Athmar Park has some streets that have long, flowing curves. One of Colorado's busiest driver's license offices is located in the neighborhood at 1865-C West Mississippi Avenue.Colorado Driver's Handbook, p. 33 Demographics In 2000, the racial breakdown of Athmar Park was 29.52% White, 0.84% African American, 0.43% Native American, 3.15% Asian, and 65.21% Hispanic or Latino.http://www.piton.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=CommunityFacts.Summary&Neighborhood;_ID=860 The publication of the 2010 United States Census, with a total population of 8,898, showed small changes in race and ethnicity with the population at 63% White or Hispanic/Latino, with 73% of that number claiming Hispanic ethnicity and 27% listing non-Hispanic ethnicity. Residents with Asian (3.5%), American Native (2.1%) and African American ethnicity (1.4%) make the remainder of the non-Hispanic population with 30% of them considering themselves \\"other\\" or \\"mixed\\". Parks=Huston Lake Park= Huston Lake Park is located in the center of the Athmar Park neighborhood between the streets of South Clay and South Vallejo, and the avenues of West Ohio and West Kentucky. With a variety of amenities including a bike and walking path, soccer and softball fields, tennis and basketball courts, and a children's play area, Huston Lake park provides many recreational resources for the local community. Named after one of the original land owners in the area, N.K. Huston, the park was originally the site of a patch of swampland called \\"Frenchie's Lake\\" which was used by early residents as a location to ice skate in the winter and swim in the summer. =Clifford Aspgren Park= Located at the eastern edge of the residential areas of Athmar Park, Clifford Aspgren park was named after a resident who served in the Colorado House of Representatives. =Vanderbilt Lake Park= Vanderbilt Lake Park contains both Habitat Park and Boy Scout Park and is part of the larger South Platte River Greenway.Catlett, Sharon R., Farmlands, Forts, and Country Life. The Story of Southwest Denver. 2007 It contains a sports fields complex and is part of a series of parks connected by the South Platte River biking and walking trail system. Until 2011, Habitat Park was the location of the Denver Municipal Animal shelter, which moved to a site in the Valverde neighborhood to the north of Athmar Park. History Historically, Athmar Park was annexed incrementally by the City of Denver. In 1902, the eastern edge of Athmar Park was annexed, along with the town of Valverde, from Zuni to the South Platte River border. In 1932, the area west of Zuni was annexed by the City of Denver. The area west of the town of Valverde, that had originally been in the hands of three different owners, was auctioned and purchased by Thomas and John R. McCusker in 1946 and developed into the subdivision of Denver named \\"Athmar Park\\".Athmar Park Perimeter Plan According to urban legend, the name \\"Athmar\\" originated from the combination of the names of the developers' two wives, Athea and Mary. In 1900, the northeast area of the neighborhood was rural and contained celery farms and wheat fields. Several of the original brick country homes still exist on W. Nevada Place, dating from the late 1880s to the early 1900s. 1395 W. Nevada Place dates to the late 1880s, and 1597 W. Nevada Place dates to 1912. The northwest portion of the neighborhood was originally called Mountainview. Many of the charming brick bungalows in this area of the neighborhood, each with a unique design, date from the 1920s and 1930s. After World War II, there was a major housing boom during which a large number of the neighborhood \\"tract\\" homes were built. Denver's first McDonald's restaurant was located in the neighborhood, at 2120 W. Alameda Avenue. The building is still there but hosts a different restaurant. The neighborhood was affected by a destructive flood in June 1965 when the S. Platte River flooded outside its banks. Flood waters reached up to the basketball hoops at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church school (1345 W. Dakota Ave.). Flood waters engulfed homes and businesses from the river all the way west into the 1400 blocks of the neighborhood. \\"The flooding along the South Platte River from Plum Creek to North Platte, Nebraska was the most destructive. The flood reached the South Platte River and the metropolitan areas of Denver by about 8 p.m. on June 16. The floodwaters spread to a half-mile or more in width. The peak discharge of the South Platte at Denver was 183 percent of the previous maximum during 67 years of record and historical information indicates that the 1965 discharge was the greatest since at least 1844. Many business, homes, industries, roads and highways were inundated. About 8,000 telephones were put out of service by the flood in the Denver area. More than half of these lines were not restored for several days. The Denver metropolitan area suffered extensive damage. The flood zone represented 67 percent of the industrial area in the city. While the flood passed rather quickly on the night of June 16, the floodwaters were piled high with debris such as house trailers, lumber and large butane storage tanks. Many of the bridges in the downtown area became plugged with debris and were washed out when they could no longer withstand the pressure. Other bridges held, but sustained excessive erosion damage. The floodwaters left behind several feet of mud and debris all along the South Platte flood plain. In Denver, the cleanup job took several months and cost the city over $1 million.South Platte & Arkansas Basins: June 14-20, 1965, The Weather and Climate Assessment Science Program Chatfield Reservoir was built in response to the 1965 flood. Athmar Park is the site of a branch library. Until 1999, the library was housed in a small storefront in the Athmar Shopping Center (1865 W. Mississippi Avenue). In 1999, the library was relocated into a remodeled stone building, formerly a church, located at the corner of West Mississippi Avenue and South Tejon Street at 1055 South Tejon Street. The Athmar branch library has a Robert Mangold wind sculpture that was formerly located at the Denver Art Museum. The neighborhood has six mosaic games tables created as a public art project by area residents and school children. The game tables are intended to provide gathering places and encourage interaction between area residents. Three mosaic game tables are located at Huston Lake Park and three in Aspgren Park. The game boards include chess, checkers and backgammon boards. They are surrounded by themed mosaics. At Huston Lake there are: :A mosaic quilt patch table commemorates the ladies of the Valverde Presbyterian Church who gathered every Tuesday for over 40 years to create quilts for the less fortunate :A mosaic flower table created by Valverde Elementary school children :A mosaic view of the mountains from Huston Lake created by neighborhood residents. The well-known Colorado oil painter and neighborhood resident, Brenda Hendrix, created the overall design of the mountain view table : At Aspgren Park there are: :A mosaic commemorating the 1965 flood :A mosaic all about \\"love\\" :A modern design mosaic. : Alameda Square Shopping Center, located at 2200 W. Alameda Avenue, was developed in 1959 as Denver's first outdoor mall. When first constructed, the mall included a Ben Franklin dime store, a bowling alley, a furniture store and doctor offices. The very popular Organ Grinder pizza parlor, with its famous two story organ, was located at the center. By 1990, the center was past its prime and declared a blighted site. The center was redeveloped by Brighton Corporation in 2009-11. A public art installation, \\"Geese\\", was created by the Colorado sculptor Fred Lunger as part of the project.

The native language is known as Maithili and its speakers are referred to as Maithils. The majority of the Mithila region falls within modern-day India, more specifically in the state of Bihar. Mithila is bounded in the north by the Himalayas, and in the south, west and east by the Ganges, Gandaki and Mahananda respectively. It extends into the southeastern Terai of Nepal. This region was also called Tirabhukti, the ancient name of Tirhut.Yadav, Yogendra P. date missing. Reading Asia: New Research in Asian Studies; Frans H√ºsken, Dick van der Meij; Chapter 12 ‚Äì The Maithili Language at page 240 Ancient history The name Mithila is believed to be derived from the King Mithi. He established Mithilapuri.Encyclopaedia of Hinduism. Nagendra Kumar Singh, p. 3239. Since he was born out of the body of his father, he was called Janaka. After this, the later kings of Mithila adopted the title Janaka. The most famous Janaka was Seeradhwaja Janaka, father of Sita. There were 52 kings in the dynasty of Janaka. The region was also known as Videha. The kingdom of Videha is mentioned for the first time in Yajurveda Samhita. Mithila, is mentioned in Buddhist Jatakas, the Brahamanas, the Puranas (described in detail in Brhadvisnu Purana) and various epics such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. However, according to the Shatapatha Brahmana, a chieftain named Videha Mathava migrated from the Saraswati Valley to Mithila during the Vedic period and established the Videha kingdom. This leads to confusion whether the Videha kingdom was established during the Vedic period or not, since one of the Janakas of Videha was also the father-in-law of King Rama, who ruled much earlier. Archaeological evidence is lacking to realistically assess the period of their migration. A list of kings is mentioned in Mahabharata and Jatakas. All the kings either adopted the title Videha or Janaka. Vedic period, Videha Kingdom During the Vedic period, Mithila was the centre of the Videha kingdom.Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, pages 13, 17 116-124, 141-143 The rulers of the Videha kingdom were called Janakas. c. 600 BCE‚Äìc. 300 BCE, Vajji Mahajanapada Following the fall of the Videhas, Mithila came under the control of the Vajji mahajanapada which was a confederacy of clans the most famous of which was the Licchavi.Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1972), Political History of Ancient India, University of Calcutta, Calcutta, pp. 106‚Äì113, 186‚Äì90 The capital was in the city of Vaishali in modern-day Bihar. Mithila under the Vajji's was eventually conquered by the king of Magadha, Ajatashatru. 6th century to 11th century: Pala and Sena rule Mithila was a tributary of the Pala Empire for almost three centuries. The rulers of the Pala Empire were followers of Buddhism and according to some texts, they were Kayasthas. Their capital is believed to be located at present town of Balirajgarh (Babubarhi-Madhubani district). The last king of the Pala Empire was Madanapala. Madanapal was a weak king, as he was defeated by Samanta Sena's army, eventually leading to the establishment of the Sena Dynasty. The founder of the Pala Empire was Gopala. He was the first independent Buddhist king of Bengal and came to power in 750 in Gaur by democratic election, which was unique at the time. He reigned from 750 to 770 and consolidated his position by extending his control over all of Bengal. His successors Dharmapala (r. 770-810) and Devapala (r. 810-850) expanded the empire across the northern and eastern Indian subcontinent. The Pala Empire eventually disintegrated in the 12th century under the attack of the Sena Dynasty. Sena Dynasty also belonged to the Kayastha community. They were ardent followers of Hinduism and hence, people of Mithila, themselves being followers of Hinduism, helped Samanta Sena in defeating Madanapala. Eminent scholar Vachaspati Mishra (from village Thardhi in Madhubani district) was from this period. 11th century to 14th century: Simroon/Karnata Dynasty The Karnata or Simroon dynasty was founded by Nanyadeva with the capital being in Simraon in Mithila. In the court of Hari Singh Deva the Royal Priest was Jyotirishwar, the author of Varna Ratnakar. Upon Ghiyasuddin Tughlak's invasion of Mithila (Tirhut), King Harisimhadeva, along with many Maithil Brahmins, fled to Nepal and founded a new dynasty in Nepal. The dynasty had six kings of note: * Nanyadeva - Nanya Singh Deva apart from being a great warrior, also had a keen interest in music. He classified and analyzed the Ragas and opines Madhya Laya is chosen for Hasya (humorous) and Sringar (libido) rasa, Bilambit is chosen for Karun (compassion) rasa and Drut is chosen for Veer (brave), Rodra (anger), Adbhut (marvellous) and Bhayanak (fearful) rasas. He wrote a treaty on music 'Saraswati Hridayalankar' which is preserved in the Bhandarkar Research Institute of Pune.http://www.mithilaonline.com/music.html accessed on 25 January 2008 Nanya Dev is also considered to be the \\"forgotten King of Mithila\\". * Gangadeva * Narsingh Deva * Ramsingh Deva * Shakti Singh Deva * Harisimhadeva - King Hari Singh Dev is the most famous. He was instrumental in initiating and implementing Panji Vyavastha or Panji Prabandha in Maithil Brahmins and Maithil Kayasthas (Karn Kayasthas). He was also great patron of art and literature. 14th to 16th century: Oiniwar Dynasty In 1325, following the collapse of the Karnat dynasty in 1324, Nath Thakur became the first Maithil ruler. The dynasty that followed from him was called Oiniwar Dynasty, and comprised a further 20 rulers. 1526 to 1577: period of anarchy Sikandar Lodhi made his son-in-law, Alauddin, the ruler of this area. During this period, Mughal Empire was beginning to take its root in Delhi. Alauddin was not a successful ruler and for next 50 years, anarchy prevailed in Mithila region. During this period the Gandhavariya Rajputs acquired power ruling various estates in the area particularly in Saharsa. When Akbar became emperor, he tried to bring normalcy to Mithila region. He came to the conclusion that only after a Maithil Brahmin was made King, peace can prevail and rent can be collected in Mithila. In 1577, Emperor Akbar declared Pt. Mahesh Thakkur as the ruler of Mithila. Pt. Mahesh Thakkur was of the mool, Kharaure Bhaur and hence that dynasty was called 'Khandwala Kul' and the capital was made at Rajgram in Madhubani District. 16th century to 20th century : Raj Darbhanga The Khandwala dynasty ruled as the Raj Darbhanga, beginning with Mahesh Thakur, who died in 1558. The last ruler was Kameshwar Singh, whose reign from 1929 came to an end in 1947 with the independence of India, when all the kingdoms merged with Union of India.

He served as the Director of UNC's Institute for the Arts and Humanities from 2006 to 2014 and the Director of UNC's Graduate School Royster Society of Fellows from 1998-2001. His work is situated at the intersection of political philosophy, cultural studies, and literary criticism. He is the author of six books and a co-editor of four more. McGowan's _Postmodernism and its Critics_ provides a guide to a range of postmodern thinkers (Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, and Edward Said among others) while also criticizing their anarchistic politics in the name of a robust communictarian understanding of democracy. He pursues that account of democracy in four subsequent books: the first on Hannah Arendt's productive critique of today's diminished understanding of politics; the second on the role of intellectuals in contemporary society; the third his articulation of the principle values and commitments of the \\"American liberalism\\" of FDR and John Dewey, and the fourth his return to the pragmatist philosophical tradition to offer the case for liberal democracy.
