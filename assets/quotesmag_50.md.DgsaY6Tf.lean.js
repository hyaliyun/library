Early life Bert Maitland was born at Surry Hills, New South Wales, the son of Duncan Mearns Maitland and Emily, n√©e Dalgety. He attended Newington College (1883‚Äì1887)Newington College Register of Past Students 1863‚Äì1998 (Syd, 1999) pp125 and went up to the University of Sydney in 1888 from whence he graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine and Chirurgery with first- class honours in 1892. Medical career After graduation he became a resident medical officer at Sydney Hospital and in 1893 a senior R.M.O. The following year Maitland began private practice in Elizabeth Street, Sydney and in 1895 he was appointed an honorary assistant surgeon at Sydney. He was appointed to the senior staff in 1902 and lectured to Sydney Hospital nurses from 1900 until 1909. When Sydney Hospital became a clinical school in 1909, Maitland was the first lecturer in clinical surgery. He was a councillor of the local branch of the British Medical Association from 1904 until 1916 and president for two years after that. Maitland also served as consultant surgeon at the Crown Street Women's Hospital, South Sydney Women's Hospital and The Coast Hospital. During World War I, Maitland was a surgeon and temporary lieutenant-colonel in the Australian Army Medical Corps at the 4th Australian General Hospital, Randwick. In 1914 the Maitlands moved to a home and consulting rooms at 147 Macquarie Street, Sydney that is now a wing of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians headquarters. Two years later he became a director of Sydney Hospital and served on the house committee. Sportsman Maitland played Rugby Union for Newtown and during the 1890s was a regular boxer in Sydney. He was Honorary Surgeon at Rushcutters Bay Stadium from 1908. He played cricket, swam and shot as well as being a noted angler, winning competitions in fly-casting and big-game fishing. Maitland was a skilful and expert angler who sailed from Sydney, Port Hacking and Port Stephens from 1906 to land tuna, kingfish and salmon. He is regarded as the father of game fishing in Australia.Australian Fishing Museum. Retrieved 25 November 2018. Death Maitland died in his medical rooms of coronary artery disease. An impromptu mourning procession occurred when doctors, medical students and nurses from Sydney Hospital, and Sydney citizens walked from his home and congregated at Queen Victoria's statue near St James' Church. Survived by his wife, who later married Sir Frederick Edward French, and two sons, a third son had predeceased him, Maitland was buried in Waverley cemetery.

From 1925 to 1933, it was a regional subdivision of the Nazi Party. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was established at a party conference on 22 May 1926 to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. The Gau had its origin in 1925 in Gau Rheinpfalz (English:Rhenish Palatinate), comprising the parts of Bavaria left of the river Rhine, the Palatinate (German:Pfalz). The territory of Oldenburg Birkenfeld was also annexed to the Gau in 1934. With the return of the Saar Basin to Germany on 1 March 1935, the two regions were merged and formed the new Gau Pfalz-Saar. This Gau was renamed Gau Saarpfalz (English:Saar-Palatinate) on 13 January 1936. After the outbreak of the Second World War and the defeat of France in 1940, the French d√©partement of Moselle, renamed \\"CdZ-Gebiet Lothringen\\", was added to the Gau on 30 November 1940.Jacques Lorraine (Edmond Huntzbuchler): Les Allemands en France. Origines, Bretagne, Zone interdite Est, Bourgogne, Alsace et Lorraine, editions du D√©sert, Alger-Oran, 1945, p. 121-124. On 7 December 1940, it was again renamed, now Gau Westmark. Gauleiter B√ºrckel hoped that Westmark would be extended as far as Germany's future western border, especially keeping in mind the ore region of Briey-Longwy in the d√©partement of Meurthe-et-Moselle. B√ºrckel further laid claims to parts of Alsace and even Baden. The Gau, however, remained as it was until the defeat of Germany in 1945. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War. Local Gauleiters were in charge of propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onwards, the Volkssturm and the defence of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter was held by Fritz Wambsgan√ü from February 1925 to 13 March 1926 and Josef B√ºrckel from 13 March 1926 until his death on 28 September 1944, when Willi St√∂hr took over and served for the duration of the existence of the Gau.

He survived the ordeal and was carved out of the stomach by his peers when they, not knowing he was inside, caught and began skinning the whale because of the hot weather which would have rotted the whale meat. It was said that he was in the whale for 36 hours and it was also said that his skin had been bleached by the gastric juices, and that he was blind the rest of his life.

The French scientist De Parville published a report of the alleged incident in the Paris Journal des D√©bats in 1914. Investigations More recently, the facts were carefully investigated by historian Edward Davis, who pointed out many inconsistencies. The ship in the story is The Star of the East; a British ship by the same name existed and sailed during the time in which the incident allegedly occurred and could have been near the Falklands at the right time, but the real Star of the East was not a whaling vessel and its crew list did not include a James Bartley.Edward Davis, A Whale of a Tale: Fundamentalist Fish Stories. Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith 43 (1991): 224-37 Moreover, Mrs. John Killam, the wife of the Captain, wrote a letter stating that \\"there is not one word of truth in the whale story. I was with my husband all the years he was in the Star of the East. There was never a man lost overboard while my husband was in her. The sailor has told a great sea yarn.\\" Davis suggested that the story may have been inspired by the \\"Gorleston whale\\", a 30-foot rorqual killed near Great Yarmouth shortly before in June 1891 that generated a lot of publicity.[Robert B. Durham, \\"Modern Folklore\\"] While the veracity of the story is in question, it is physically possible for a sperm whale to swallow a human whole, as they have been known to swallow giant squid whole. However, such a person would drown or suffocate in the whale's stomach. Cultural references George Orwell refers to this incident (twice) in his 1939 novel Coming Up for Air (though not in his 1940 essay \\"Inside the Whale\\"). Julian Barnes references the event in his novel A History of the World in 10¬Ω Chapters, as did Arthur C. Clarke's novel Childhood's End and J. M.

It forms part of the Black Country Urban Forest.  Location  The park is located to the south of Great Bridge, with main entrances at Sheepwash Lane and John's Lane, close to Dudley Port. It is bounded to the south-west by the West Coast Main Line, and on other sides by housing estates. The site was originally used for waste disposal, landfill and as a brickworks and was redeveloped in the 1980s. It extends to about 37 hectares.  Features  The Oldbury Arm of the River Tame flows through the park from south to north, close to its western edge. It is flanked by a length of the River Tame Way. It feeds a number of lakes of varying sizes, which help relieve flooding along the river. These and the surrounding wetland, grassland and woods provide an important urban habitat. Some of the original brickworks buildings are still discernible around the lakes, which have islands to act as wildlife havens. Large numbers of wild flowers, small mammals and amphibians are to be found, along with varied insect life. The council claims that 164 bird species have been recorded on the site since 1985.Enjoy the Black Country Urban Forest, National Urban Forestry Unit There is also fishing.

Product technologies  Organizations practicing advanced manufacturing make products characterized as: * Products with high levels of design * Technologically complex * Innovative * Reliable, affordable, and available * Newer, better, more exciting * Products that solve a variety of problems * Flexibility  Process technologies  The manufacturing process technologies described in definitions of advanced manufacturing include: * Computer technologies (e.g., CAD, CAE, CAM) (Paul Fowler, NACFAM; UK Manufacturing Advisory Service Southeast; C.B. Adams, St. Louis, OECD) * High-Performance Computing (HPC) for modeling, simulation, and analysis (Council on Competitiveness) * Rapid prototyping (additive manufacturing) * High Precision technologies (Paul Fowler, NACFAM) * Information technologies (Paul Fowler, NACFAM) * Advanced robotics and other intelligent production systems (US Department of Labor, ETA; C.B.

For example, one organization defines \\"advanced manufacturing as the insertion of new technology, improved processes, and management methods to improve the manufacturing of products.\\" (National Defense University, 2002, as reported in PCAST) Another organization lists advanced manufacturing as \\"encompassing lean production techniques, enhanced supply chain integration, and technology assimilation.\\" In fact, the Wikipedia definition of \\"advanced manufacturing\\" is \\"advanced planning and scheduling\\" described as \\"a manufacturing management process by which raw materials and production capacity are optimally allocated to meet demand.\\" Overall, the following business or management methodologies were listed as being a part of advanced manufacturing: * Quality controls (US Department of Labor) * Lean production technologies * Supply chain integration * Advanced Planning and Scheduling (Wikipedia, online, accessed June 2010) Other definitions There are also definitions of \\"advanced manufacturing\\" that are used by one or a few sources. =Traditional vs. advanced manufacturers= Traditional manufacturing is defined as the act of converting raw materials into finished products by using manual or mechanized transformational techniques. The purpose of such activities is to add value to achieve targeted objectives, which do not preclude society's overall interests. In one report, the distinction between traditional sectors of manufacturing (listed as auto, steel) and others (listed as aerospace, medical device, pharmaceutical) is the basis for a definition of advanced manufacturing, with the characteristics of the two differing in terms of volume and scale economies, labor and skill content, and the depth and diversity of the network surrounding the industry (New England Council and Deloitte, as referenced in PCAST document). =Successful manufacturers= Other sources define advanced manufacturers as those that \\"succeed\\" in today's competitive environment. One source states that: \\"What differentiates certain companies is a unique ability to create a competitive advantage in this environment. These manufacturers think and do faster and, by definition, these advantages make them advanced.\\" (Industrial College of the Armed Forces) The White House survey lists some experts as defining advanced manufacturing \\"solely by advances that led to decreased cost or increased productivity.\\" (PCAST) =Research and development= One organization listed \\"aggressive research and development\\" as being part of the definition of advanced manufacturing. (Purdue University) Although research and development were not explicitly included in most definitions, the innovative technologies listed by many are most likely the result of extensive research and development. Development of a sound product, which satisfies given criteria with least pain, is a common challenge, most unusually, haunting the manufacturer. The domain of competition is quite large because manufacturers compete at inter-manufacturing and intra-firm levels, producing near net products. The customer desires a component which promises functions most reliably, while addressing socio-techno-environmental attributes. Dynamic Finally, several sources pointed out that any definition of advanced manufacturing will need to change with the changing times, and that the definition will vary for different companies and different industries. The White House survey states: \\"Most discussants agree that an appropriate advanced manufacturing definition should be dynamic in nature and be treated as more of a benchmark. That is, there is a constant iteration of improving manufacturing frontiers...Therefore, what is classified as \\"frontier\\" is constantly changing, and, likewise, advanced manufacturing is constantly changing.\\" (PCAST) Another source stated that: \\"Advanced manufacturing is like a chameleon. It changes in response to the needs of whichever company has incorporated it into its manufacturing process.\\" (St. Louis, C.B. Adams). An expert is quoted as saying: \\"Advanced manufacturing, by its very nature, defies definition, because it is going to be different for the chemical industry than it is for the metal fabrication industry and any other industry.\\" (Tom White, as quoted by C.B. Adams). Conclusion The term \\"advanced manufacturing\\" encompasses many of the developments in the manufacturing field during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, including high tech products and processes and Clean, green, and flexible manufacturing, among others. No one definition captures everything said about advanced manufacturing, although the majority of definitions found on the web include the use of innovative technology to improve products and/or processes, and may also include the use of new business/management methodologies. Accordingly, the definition that probably comes closest to being comprehensive is that given by Paul Fowler of the National Council for Advanced Manufacturing (NACFAM), celebrating its 20th anniversary this year: \\"The Advanced Manufacturing entity makes extensive use of computer, high precision, and information technologies integrated with a high-performance workforce in a production system capable of furnishing a heterogeneous mix of products in small or large volumes with both the efficiency of mass production and the flexibility of custom manufacturing in order to respond quickly to customer demands.\\" (Quoted in PCAST). \\"In foreseeable future categorical developments facilitated with integration with computers will ... be largely impacted by the state of raw material and energy availability.

The province is the second-highest level of government, after the national government. The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces. In provincial politics there are three functions: the King's Commissioner, the States Provincial, and the States Deputed. Together they share legislative power. The King's Commissioner chairs both the States Provincial and the States Deputed. The States Deputed and the King's Commissioner exercise the executive power of the provincial government. The relationship between the States Deputed and the States Provincial is officially dualistic, that is they have separated responsibilities. King's Commissioner The King's Commissioner (Commissaris van de Koning) chairs both the States Deputed and the States Provincial. He or she is a member of the States Deputed and often has his own portfolios, often including safety and public order. He also has a representative role, as the head of the provincial government. He is appointed by the national government for a renewable six- year term. When a vacancy occurs the States Provincial express their preferences to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. All Commissioners are members of a national political party, but they are expected to exercise their office in a nonpartisan fashion. States Provincial The States Provincial (Provinciale Staten, PS) is the elected assembly of the provinces. Its main role is laying down the guidelines for the policy of the States Deputed and exercising control over its execution by the States Deputed. The States Provincial are elected every four years by the general population. All major political parties contest in the election and most of them are represented in each States Provincial. All citizens in a province have the right to vote and almost all citizens can be elected, ministers and state secretaries in the national government are barred from standing in elections as well as King's Commissioners and civil servants employed by the province. The number of members of the States Provincial depends on the number of inhabitants. After the elections, the parties in the states elected the States Deputed. Moreover, the States Provincial also elect the Senate of the national parliament on the first day of a new term. The States Provincial is supported by its own civil service headed by the Statengriffier. Members of the Provincial States are not paid as full-time politicians, instead, most of them have day jobs. Like most legislatures, the members of Provincial States work in both political groups and policy area related committees. The King's Commissioner chairs the meetings of the States Provincial. Provincial Executive The Provincial Executive (Gedeputeerde Staten, GS) are executive councilors of the province. Together with the King's Commissioner, they form the College van Commissaris van de Koningin en Gedeputeerde Staten, which is the executive council of the province. Members of the Provincial Executive are elected by the States Provincial. The members of the Provincial Executive all have their own competence on which they prepare, coordinate, and plan policy and legislation for the State Provincial and execute legislation. The Provincial Executive has the duty to inform the States Provincial on all aspects of their policy. The Provincial Executive functions a collegial body and most decisions are taken by consensus. Provincial competencies Dutch provinces do not have many competencies. As the level of government between national government and the municipal government, it is responsible for those affairs for which the national government is too large and the municipalities too small. In most competencies the provinces have an executive function, executing policy that is made at the national level. The provincial competencies often shared with the national and municipal government include: *Land management, specifically regional zoning laws; *transport, regional infrastructure and regional public transport; *economy and agriculture; *environment and conservation; *recreation, welfare and culture; *control over water boards and the finances of municipalities. Finances The provinces get most of their finances from the national government. Partially through the provincial fund in which the national government puts part of its tax income. This money is divided evenly over the provinces, which can spend it as they see fit. Moreover, provinces receive earmarked budgets from the national government, with which the province can take care of specific competencies such as regional public transport. Moreover, provinces can levy their own taxes. The most well known is the opcent, a small increase in the tax on cars which the provinces use for infrastructural investments. Provinces also receive administrative payments from citizens who need particular services such as environmental permits. Some provinces receive money from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds of the European Union. Finally some provinces have their own savings, from which they receive interest. Civil Service All twelve provinces have their own civil service. Combined they have some 14.000 employees (2003). The head of the provincial civil service is the province-secretary.

Taking influence from Robert Johnson, John Lee Hooker, Pussy Galore, MC5, Skip James, Bad Brains and The Gun Club, ILCK approached the punk blues genre with reverence and originality, lending credibility to a genre that had sometimes been previously employed as a musically ironic post-punk and garage rock aesthetic. They did not take influence from blues-rock, preferring the older Delta blues and Chicago blues styles. Chet Weise‚Äîa university professor of political economics and a blues connoisseur‚Äîhas stated, \\"Punk and blues are both honest reactions to life. It's blues, it's our blues. It's just a bit turned up and a bit faster.\\" Post-breakup After The Immortal Lee County Killers' 2007 breakup, Weise went on to front a new punk blues band, Silver Lion's 20/20. John Wesley Myers also started a new band, Black Diamond Heavies, he also recently recorded a solo album, Solitary Pleasure, released on April 12, 2011.

The cars were manufactured by the Italian company Breda (now Hitachi Rail Italy) at its Pistoia plant between 1988 and 1997 and are used on the Metro's B and D Lines. Details The fleet of 104 vehicles was supplied in two orders: The first vehicles (fleet numbers 501‚Äì530) were built between 1988 and 1993 and are propelled by a Chopper traction control system manufactured by Westinghouse. The remaining vehicles (fleet numbers 531‚Äì604), were built between 1995 and 1997 and include AC inverter traction control and intercar safety barriers. The acceleration for this last group of cars is almost identical to that of the now-retired 1000 series cars found on the Washington Metro because they both utilize the same General Electric AC traction motors. These cars share a design very similar to the Budd Universal Transit Vehicle, which was built between 1982 and 1986 for the Baltimore Metro Subway and the Miami Metrorail. The Budd UTV was originally intended to be used as the vehicles for the Red Line, but as Budd/TransitAmerica stopped railcar manufacturing in 1987, Breda (following its success with the 2000, 3000 and 4000 series cars for the Washington Metro) was contracted to build an as-similar-as-possible variant. As such, the A650 shares the UTV's bodyshell, layout and general appearance. Costing $1.5 million each, the trains usually run in four to six car consists, and feature automatic train control, air conditioning, emergency intercoms, wheelchair spaces and emergency braking. The fleet is maintained in a yard south of Union Station on Santa Fe Drive near 4th Street on the west bank of the Los Angeles River in Downtown Los Angeles.  Replacement  The A650 series will be fully replaced in 2024. LACMTA has signed a contract with CRRC to acquire new heavy rail vehicles, dubbed the HR4000 series.  In popular culture  Because Los Angeles is the home of many television and production agencies, A650 subway cars are featured in countless commercials, TV shows and movies. The Breda A650 was depicted as being burned in the tunnel between MacArthur Park and Metro Center in the 1997 film Volcano, when a lava flow through the tunnel causes all passengers and conductor to pass out on board. The A650 was featured in Speed when the emergency brake feature stops and the train derails. It is also featured in SWAT and it is seen taking a nosedive plummet from a mountain as the cataclysmic events of December 21, 2012, unfold in 2012.

Note how the segments widely separated in the primary structure have come in contact in the three- dimensional tertiary structure forming part of the same epitope A conformational epitope is a sequence of sub-units (usually amino acids) composing an antigen that come in direct contact with a receptor of the immune system. An antigen is any substance that the immune system can recognize as foreign. Antigens are usually proteins that are too large to bind as a whole to any receptor so only specific segments, that form the antigen, bind with a specific receptor. Such segments are called epitopes. Likewise, it is only paratope of the receptor that comes in contact with the epitope. Proteins are composed of repeating nitrogen-containing subunits called amino acids that in nature do not exist as straight chains called primary structure, but as folded whorls with complex loops. The latter is known as the tertiary structure of a protein. So, whenever a receptor interacts with an undigested antigen, the surface amino acids that come in contact may not be continuous with each other if the protein is unwound. Such discontinuous amino acids that come together in three-dimensional conformation and interact with the receptor's paratope are called conformational epitopes. In contrast, if the antigen is digested, small segments called peptides are formed, which bind with major histocompatibility complex molecules, and then later with T cell receptors through amino acids that are continuous in a line. These are known as linear epitopes.

Number 8 wire is a -diameter gauge of wire on the British Standard Wire Gauge that has entered into the cultural lexicon of New Zealand. Use for farm fencing Early farm fences in New Zealand were generally used to protect crops, gardens, and orchards from farm animals rather than to contain the stock. Fencing methods used were post-and-rail fences, ditch-and- bank fences, stone walls, and hedges, but all proved too expensive to install and maintain to fence entire properties and tended to be unreliable. To prevent stock straying, boundary keepers were employed to patrol boundaries. In the 1850s, heavy annealed iron wire became available for fences but this wire was very thick and only came in short lengths, was hard to work and to keep taut, and expensive to use. In England, in 1855, Henry Bessemer patented the Bessemer process that led to the mass production of low-cost high-quality steel leading to the large scale production of affordable lighter gauge steel wire. The introduction of the new steel fencing wire of various gauges in the 1860s allowed the rapid construction of low-cost fencing and was quickly adopted for use on New Zealand sheep farms. Galvanised number 8 steel wire soon became the preferred standard. These new lightweight steel wire fences were not suitable for cattle as cattle would lean over or on the fences and damage or push the fences over. When barbed wire became available in 1879, it was used as the top wire and perhaps a lower additional wire in conjunction with No. 8 wire on fences on dairy and cattle farms to prevent these animals from damaging the fences. This further extended the use of number 8 wire. From the early 1960s, lower cost and lighter weight but more difficult to work high-tensile 12¬Ω gauge 2.5 mm steel wire has largely replaced number 8 wire for New Zealand fencing. Since 1976, when New Zealand adopted the metric system, number 8 wire is officially referred to as 4.0 mm gauge wire, although the older term \\"Number 8 wire\\" continues to be commonly used. Number 8 wire in language and culture As a consequence of the ubiquitous use of number 8 wire in New Zealand, remote farms often had rolls of number 8 wire on hand, and the wire would often be used inventively and practically to solve mechanical or structural problems other than fencing.. Accordingly, the term \\"number 8 wire\\" came to represent the ingenuity and resourcefulness of New Zealanders, and the phrase \\"a number 8 wire mentality\\" evolved to denote an ability to create or repair machinery using whatever scrap materials are available on hand. New Zealand hardware and DIY store franchise Mitre 10 have adopted \\"Number 8\\" as their in house brand for generic hardware supplies and tools. The Waikato Museum runs an art award named after the wire.

It was published on August 1, 1992 by Baen. It was the winner of the Compton Crook Award. Plot Fire in the Mist is the story of Faia Rissedote, who as the story begins is a shepherd from a small village. Faia returns from tending her sheep to find everyone in her village dead from the plague. In her anguish, she loses control of her magic and destroys the entire village. This act is felt even in the far away town of Ariss, where staff of the university that exists there to train mages travel to the village to see what happened. They find Faia and bring her back to their university. Faia does not fit in there, as she is a much stronger mage but has little control; the other mage students either don't believe in her power or dislike her for being from a humble background. She does meet and sleep with a young mage, which is expressly forbidden as sex is supposed to be harmful to magical talent. A series of murders occur; primarily targeting young mages with potential. The women at the university believe it to be the work of the men, as the murders resemble a much earlier legend which implicated the men. Faia's body is taken over by the spirit of the murderer, who it turns out was actually a woman (and is the same person from the legend) and proceeds to start killing the mages of the university. Faia defeats the murderer by surprising her with the fact that she (the murderer, in Faia's body) is pregnant, and regains her body. She escapes the university, the staff of which still bear a grudge against her, in spite of explanations, and begins to travel.

He is the manager of Avellino. Career =Playing= A midfielder, Braglia started his professional career with Serie C team Montevarchi, then making his debut in the Serie A in 1976 with Fiorentina. He then spent six seasons with Catanzaro, five of them being in the Italian top flight. He then retired in 1987 after spells with Serie B teams Triestina and Catania. =Coaching= In 1989 Braglia accepted his first managerial job, at the helm of amateur Tuscan team Bibbienese. He then coached a number of Tuscan teams in the lower ranks of Italian football with some success, including a Serie C2 title with Montevarchi in 1995. In 1999, he accepted his first coaching job outside of Tuscany, becoming head coach of Foggia in the Serie C2, obtaining a fourth place in the final table. He then returned to Tuscany, again to Montevarchi, before to join Chieti, which he led for two seasons in the Serie C1 league. In 2003‚Äì04 he returned to Catanzaro, this time as a head coach, and led the giallorossi to win the Serie C1 title and establish them back in Serie B after over a decade in the lower tiers. He was however sacked during the club's following Serie B campaign due to poor results. He then returned in Tuscany, joining Sangiovannese, a team he already twice in the Serie D during his early coaching years, and achieving an impressive third place in their Serie C1 campaign. In 2006, he accepted an offer from Pisa, with the aim to lead the nerazzurri back to Serie B; a third place in the regular season, followed by a successful campaign in the promotion playoffs, assured Pisa and Braglia a place in the second-highest Italian league for the next season. However, after discussions with the club management, Braglia opted to leave Pisa and accept an offer from Lucchese, another Tuscan Serie C1 team with aims of promotions. However, despite this, Lucchese ended only in eighth place and failed to qualify to the promotion playoffs. In June 2008 Braglia was unveiled as head coach of Serie B team Frosinone, replacing Alberto Cavasin. In June 2009 Piero Braglia went to Taranto, but was removed weeks later due to poor results. On June 2010 he was announced as new head coach of Juve Stabia, which he led to a surprise promotion to Serie B via the playoffs. He was then confirmed as Juve Stabia boss for the 2011‚Äì12 second division campaign, where he guided his small club to an impressive first season half and a good ninth place by the end of the season. Another safe season followed, with Juve Stabia keeping its Serie B status for one more year. These fortunes did not repeat in the 2013‚Äì14 season, as Juve Stabia immediately appeared unable to escape relegation and Braglia was fired in November 2013 to be replaced with Fulvio Pea; after Pea's failure to improve results, Braglia was however called back at Juve Stabia, but could not do anything to avoid Lega Pro relegation to his club. In July 2014, Braglia agreed a comeback at the helm of Pisa, seven years after he guided them to what was the last Serie B promotion to date for the Nerazzurri of Tuscany. On 12 October 2015 he became the head coach of Lecce. He led the club to the third place and thus entered the play-off round, where Lecce lost in the semifinal. On 15 June 2016 he was appointed new manager of Alessandria. He was exonerated on 15 April 2017, three days before the end, due to the sudden collapse of results that led to overtaking the Cremonese at the top of Group A Lega Pro, after a long domination of the piedmont team. On 27 September 2017 he was hired as the head coach of Cosenza in the Serie C. With the calabrian club, on 16 June 2018, he won the final of the Serie C playoffs against Robur Siena, with a score of 3-1 at the Stadio Adriatico in Pescara. Thus, Cosenza returns to Serie B after 15 years. On his first season in charge at the club in Serie B, he comfortably succeeded in keeping Cosenza into the safer spots of the league table, ending in tenth place, just four points shy of a promotion playoff spot. However, the 2019‚Äì20 Serie B campaign did not prove to be as successful, and Braglia was sacked on 10 February 2020 following a 0‚Äì1 home loss to Benevento which left Cosenza in deep relegation zone (18th place).

Brunelle continued with RCA until 1975, and then continued to record on the Bonanza label.Paul Brunelle in The Canadian Encyclopedia Career Born in 1923, Brunelle was one of the child singers in his hometown of Granby early in 1930. Employed at the Miner Rubber, he bought his first guitar on credit for $6.50. During the war, he won twice, in 1943 and 1944, the amateur competition by Living Room Furniture, organized by AM radio CKAC. The first 78 rpm was launched in 1944, marketed by RCA Victor, attempting with this artist to compete with Private Lebrun. \\"Women, You're Pretty\\" appeared in September, then \\"My Child, I Forgive You\\" in October of that year. This last piece is an adaptation to French of the traditional song \\"When It's Springtime in the Rockies\\". The success of Brunelle was immediate. He also broadcast a program on CKAC in 1945, and apparently sold 200,000 copies of \\"Cruel Destiny.\\" This was followed by inter alia, \\"On This White Rock\\", in December 1946, \\"In a Night of Stars\\" in August 1947, then in 1948, \\"The Song of the Vagabond\\" (in April) and \\"In the Distance There in my Prairie\\" (July). From 1949 to 1951, Brunelle went on tour throughout Quebec with Antoine Grimaldi. His wife, Suzanne Brunelle, accompanied the troupe, which also offered dance numbers and comedy. The troupe visited possibly the provinces of Ontario and the Maritimes. From 1955 to 1957, he would daily moderate on radio CKVL, Montreal, the show \\"Paul Brunelle and his Troubadours.\\" He is best known in the US for his 1955 novelty yodeling hit, \\"The Cowboy of the Mountains.\\" In the years 1960, a contract with RCA Victor and London allowed the singer to launch in 33 rpm format several compilations of his previous hits. Paul Brunelle is considered, along with Marcel Martel and Willie Lamothe, as one of three major Quebec country artists. Brunelle is regarded as one who has laid the foundation of Belle Province country music before Wille Lamothe popularized it with a wider audience in the decades that followed, including the medium of television and its popular show, \\"The Willie Ranch.\\" Paul Brunelle continued his career until early 1980, when a cancer of the throat forced an end to his career as a musician. In the last years of his life, he would appear on stage only on rare special occasions, most recently in 1992. He died in 1994 in his hometown, Granby. In 2005 the label, Experience, issued a compilation compact disc of sixteen remastered hits originally recorded between 1945 and 1957. Billboard additionally lists four 2007 US CD album releases from Brunelle on the DDM and Select labels, Billboard Artist Discography, Paul Brunelle and an additional three songs appearing on three different Quebec Country compilations featuring various artists of the genre.

In 1527 Cuthbert Cunninghame is said to have lived at both Jocksthorn and The Place, \\"assuming that Jocksthorn is indeed Kilmaurs Castle and that the now ruined late-16th or early-17th range at The Place was itself preceded by an earlier building. After the building of the later Place, the castle must have quickly fallen into disuse and decay.\\" The map by Timothy Pont from circa 1600 shows a typical tower castle within an enclosure with a second area of enclosed woodland running up beside the Carmell Water. A mill is indicated and the dwelling of 'Karmel-Wood' is marked, a farm of that name surviving today (2015). The site is named 'Kilmaers' and lies to the south of the church. Only one tower is indicated in the area and Jocksthorn is not shown. Kilmaurs Castle is the only site in the area shown to have a second wooded enclosure.Cuninghamia / ex schedis Timotheo Pont ; Ioannis Blaeu excudebat. Cunningham. In 1612 John Monipennie stated that Kilmaurs Castle was the residence of the Earls of Glencairn, indicating that Kilmaurs Place had not yet been constructed at least not in the form of a suitable residence.

Adamson relates in 1875 that the ancient castle was in the vicinity of Jock's or Jack's Thorn farm, now 'Jocksthorn' and several old people from Kilmaurs in 1875 remembered playing amongst the ruined remnants of masonry which occupied the site of this old castle of the Cunninghames.Adamson, Page 168. A typical Scottish Tower Castle at Smailholm. Adamson also talks of the typical woodland policies of such a dwelling still existing in the 1870s with venerable old trees, what sounds like roundels of trees, avenues that may have defined lanes or rides, etc. All of these are not normally associated with farms and he appears to clinch the argument of the castles site by describing the \\"..sward covered circular mound\\" or motte at the 'traditional' site. In 1884-6 the Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland records that \\"... a neighbouring farm, Jock's Thorn, contains vestiges of the original or more ancient residence of the Glencairn family, to whom Kilmaurs gave the title of Baron both while they were Earls of Glencairn and for 53 years earlier.\\"Gazetteers of Scotland, 1803-1901 > 1884-1885 - Ordnance gazetteer of Scotland > Volume 4 The RCAHMS records cartographic evidence of a castellated building at this site,RCAHMS Canmore Site probably a typical Scottish tower castle. The lack of stone on the site and the clear written records of ruins at this precise location indicate a high degree of 'robbing' for use in building projects such as Jocksthorn Farm, The Place and other sites.

It publishes images of what it believes to be poor graphic design and art, \\"strange\\" buildings, bizarre gardens and churches and ill-conceived advertising. Andrew McDonald, an employee of Curtin University and a part-time comedian, began the blog on 29 September 2007 with a post on the Peninsula Tavern in suburban Maylands. The building was judged to be Worst-worthy due to its bland render, poor-taste interior and palm trees. The media soon showed interest in the blog. McDonald was interviewed by 720 ABC Perth Drive broadcaster Russell Woolf on 5 October 2007, and the blog experienced a jump in viewers when it was featured in The Sunday Times' STM on 28 October 2007. McDonald has also been interviewed by The Australian newspaper, national ABC youth radio network Triple J and ABC Radio Perth Mornings broadcaster Geoff Hutchison. On 5 December 2007 McDonald claimed the blog \\"won its first public art scalp\\" when the Lord Mayor of Perth, Lisa Scaffidi, announced a 7.5 tonne limestone sculpture would be removed from outside the Perth railway station. The West Australian quoted Scaffidi as being \\"embarrassed\\" about the artwork (commonly known as the Youth of Perth sculpture) when she saw it on The Worst of Perth. In the previous month the blog, in a post titled \\"The First Level of Hell\\", had described the sculpture as a \\"monstrosity\\" that had \\"been plopped next to Perth‚Äôs main railway station for 20 years\\". The sculpture was removed on 19 March to Gomboc Gallery in Perth's Swan Valley. In its Vanished Worst section the blog notes the subsequent destruction or closing of things it has focused on: these include a Chinese restaurant in Rivervale, the Norwood Hotel in Mount Lawley, suburban residential housing, a bingo centre, a lingerie factory and a dumping ground for wrecked cars. The most-visited blog entries have been about The West Australian newspaper and Fairfax Media's WAtoday site. Former West editor Paul Murray is a frequent target of the blog; in February McDonald wrote \\"the actual motivator for starting this blog was to have a forum where I could label Paul Murray as the worst journo in Australia\\". Howard Sattler on the WA Today site is also a frequent target. The most-visited thread on the site was an entry targeting prominent Perth lawyer and socialite Patti Chong. Chong personally responded to a criticism of her on the site, leading to a stream of correspondence that spilled over onto Chong's own blog on WAtoday. In August 2009 Chong resigned from her column on WAToday, blaming the relentless criticism and satire from internet bloggers. The architecture of Uniting Church buildings has often appeared, as have poor examples of signwriting. The most commonly used tags on the blog are advertising, architecture and graphic design. By the end of June 2008 there were more than 500 posts on The Worst of Perth and 17,400 comments. McDonald claims the blog received between 1000 and 3000 page views per day. In January 2008 the State Library of Western Australia sought McDonald's permission to archive the blog.

Cyanation to form sp3 nitriles  Typically, alkyl nitriles are formed via SN1 or SN2-type cyanation with alkyl electrophiles. Illustrative is the synthesis of benzyl cyanide by the reaction of benzyl chloride and sodium cyanide. In some cases cuprous cyanide is used instead of sodium cyanide. Cyanation of ketones or aldehydes yields the corresponding cyanohydrins, which can be done directly with the cyanide ion (the cyanohydrin reaction) or by using bisulfate, followed by displacement of sulfite: Cyanation of aldehyde with bisulfate A related reaction is hydrocyanation, which installs the elements of H-CN.

Generally, KCN or its less toxic surrogate Zn(CN)2 are used as nucleophilic cyanide sources. To further diminish toxicity concerns, potassium ferricyanide has also been used as a cyanide source. Catalytic cycles are believed to proceed through a standard Pd (0/II) pathway with reductive elimination forging the key C-C bond. Deactivation of Pd(II) with excess cyanide is a common problem. Palladium catalysis conditions for aryl iodides, bromides, and even chlorides have been developed: 330x330px Nickel-catalyzed cyanations avoid the use of precious metals, and can take advantage of benzyl cyanide or acetonitrile as a cyanide source, via reductive C-C bond cleavage: 330x330px Sandmeyer cyanation is a means of converting aniline derivatives to benzonitriles.

It is situated in Noakhali District in Bangladesh. Once it was called Char Osmani, Baluar Char, Golden Island A cluster of islands (mainly, Ballar Char, Kamlar Char, Char Osman and Char Muri) emerged in the early 1950s as an alluvium in the shallow estuary of the Bay of Bengal on the south of Noakhali. These new sandbanks first drew the notice of a group of fishermen, who named it Baular Char (literally, the alluvium of sand) later transformed into Ballar Char. Occupying an area of , the island is situated between 21 0 1 / to 22 0 6 /North latitude and 90 0 3 / to 91 0 4 / East longitude Migratory Birds in Nijhum Dwip: During winter, thousands of migratory birds flock in to island. The fishermen use the airy and sunny land as an ideal place for drying their catches from the sea. Sometimes many of them also construct straw huts on the island as seasonal residences. In 1974 the Forest Department took an afforestation program for a duration of twenty years in the north side of the island. Covering an area of nine thousand acres, it has now developed into a deep forest with a variety of plant species. Among the trees Keora is much seen. Besides this Gewa, Kankra, Bain, Babul, Karamja, Pashur and many other species are seen. On 8 April 2001 the government declared the of forest of Jahajmara range including of forest land on Nijhum Dwip as a National Park for the protection and development of the biodiversity of the forest. But in practice, there a very lazy appearance of that declaration. It was named 'Nijhum Dwip' by former Minister Amirul Islam Kalam in 1975 observing its isolation and mild nature. Population leftThe population in Nijhum Dwip in 2016 was 25,000+. Their main occupations are cultivation, fishing and livestock farming. The island produces vegetables. But the island suffers from natural calamities, and life is hard and risky. Current status Nijhum Dwip presently has six big bazaars that mainly consist of grocery shops, small restaurants and drug stores. These bazaars are the only places in the islands to have electricity from generators. More than eight (8) thousand inhabitants found their permanent settlement in the island and their occupations are mainly cultivation and fishing. There are some NGO's and other organisations like Proshika, Human Development Centre and JAICA who are involved with their development projects on this island.  Accommodation  While in Nijhum Dwip one can stay at any of several hotels. Some of them have electricity supplied by generators. Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation also has a hotel there which is the earliest of all. Flora and fauna Buffalo Herd at Nijhum DwipThe forest department of the government of Bangladesh created mangrove forests in Nijhum Dwip and the main attraction in these forests is the herd of about 5000 cheetal or spotted deer. The most common type of planted tree species in the island is Keora, also known as Kerfa, which has fast growing roots holding the sandy land. The plant also supplies pillars for houses, materials for making boats and agricultural implements, and fuel for domestic use. In 2001, the government of Bangladesh declared the forest area as Nijhum Dwip National Park in the year 2001. Now this island has been declared as the unique eco- touristic spot for its ideal natural setup with the rich bio-diversification factors and the perennial mangrove forest with wild animals like spotted deer, wild boar and rhesus macaque and for the ideal habitat for fish resources. Since south coast is open to the mouth of a great span of Bay of Bengal, whales were sometimes seen though very rare nowadays.left References External links * has map showing Nizum Dwip * Nijhum Dwip Category:Islands of Bangladesh Category:Tourist attractions in Bangladesh ","title":"Nijhum Dwip"},{"id":"18159780","text":"Montgomery is an underground station on the Brussels Metro, the first station on the eastern branch of line 1 (formerly line 1B), in Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium.

He entered the majors in 1978 with the Red Sox, playing for them in parts of two seasons before joining the San Francisco Giants (1980‚Äì1981) and Chicago Cubs (1982). Primarily a starter, Ripley notched one career save, coming on July 7, 1979. Ripley pitched the last 3 innings of a Red Sox 10-8 victory over the Mariners. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/SEA/SEA197907070.shtml His most productive season came with the 1980 Giants, when he had a 9‚Äì10 mark with a 3.54 earned run average in a pitching rotation that included Vida Blue (14‚Äì10), Ed Whitson (11‚Äì13) and Bob Knepper (9‚Äì16). In a five-season career, Ripley posted a 23‚Äì27 record with a 4.50 ERA in 101 pitching appearances, including 67 starts, four complete games, one save, 229 strikeouts and 148 walks in 463‚Öî innings of work. Additionally, Ripley went 72‚Äì41 with a 3.28 ERA in 169 minor league games from 1973 to 1980, striking out 619 while walking 337 in 942 innings. Career highlight Ripley's best season came in 1977 with the Red Sox' Triple A affiliate Pawtucket, when he won 15 games and posted a 1.40 ERA, including eight consecutive wins and the highest winning percentage (.789), setting team single season records which stand today.MiLB.com ‚Äì Pawtucket Red Sox : All- Time Records The Buffalo Heads Remembered as a colorful player, Ripley formed part of an informal group of counterculture Red Sox players known as The Buffalo Heads who clashed with team management.

He built the first tandem rotor helicopter in 1927 - a flying scale model and full size helicopter was built in 1933. Biography Nicolas Florine was born to Anatole Victorovich Florin (1856-1936) and Aimee Lioubov (1862-1935) and had a sister Olga (30 oktober 1893 -) and a brother Victor Anatolyevich Florin (7 December 1899 - 1960). He spent his childhood and youth in St. Petersburg, to which his parents had moved in the early 20th century. There, he studied mathematics at the university. He completed his military service in 1914. After the advent of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Florine took refuge in Germany before returning to the Soviet Union. His family background (of minor Russian nobility) and his status as an engineer trained under the Tsar put him under threat from the communists, from which he fled by raft across the Gulf of Finland to a refugee camp in Helsinki before settling in Belgium in 1920, the only country (of the 26 to which he applied) to accept his asylum application.Les h√©licos de Nicolas Florine partie 1 (The helicopters of Nicolas Florine Part 1) - personal blog, 19 April 2008 Nicolas Florine worked at l'Administration de l'a√©ronautique, based in the buildings of the Hotel des Monnaies in Saint-Gilles (Brussels). In 1926 he was responsible for initiating the Centre d'a√©rodynamisme located in Rhode-Saint- Gen√®se, on the outskirts of Brussels, whose first director was Professor √âmile Allard. He was involved in the creation of Belgium's first wind tunnel, together with the initiators, Alfred Renard and Emile Allard. From wind tunnel installations there the Stampe SV.4, by Jean Stampe, a school and acrobatics aircraft used in Belgium, France and many other countries, was begun, as well as the prototype Alfred Renard R.35 tri-motor pressurized airliner.Andr√© Hauet, Les avions Renard, Bruxelles : √âditions A.E.L.R., 1984, 2nd Ed 1999, Today, the center has been renamed as the 'von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics'. The studies Florine performed here in 1926 led to patents related to helicopter control and in particular how to counteract the torque resulting from using two rotors. The results of the studies were published in the article El√©ments du calcul de stabilit√© d'un h√©licopt√®re. Herein, the principle was described of a helicopter with two rotors. These rotors turned in the same direction, in contrast to the current tandem helicopters. In order to counteract the torque, the rotors were angled inwards at 7 to 10¬∞ from the vertical. This publication formed the basis of all his designs that would follow. In 1927 Nicolas Florine received financial support from the Belgian airline SNETA and the Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique for the development of a helicopter. This resulted in three prototypes. The helicopters The first was built in 1927 and made its first flight in 1929. Nicolas Florine built a helicopter with two rotors in tandem, turning in the same direction. To balance the reaction torques, he used his principle of inclining the axes of rotation of the rotors with respect to each other. After the implementation of scale models, one of which weighed 36 kg and left the ground several times, he built a first device (the \\"Type I\\") able to carry a pilot, propelled by a Hispano-Suiza water-cooled engine of 180 CV. In 1930 it was partially destroyed during a static trial following a failure in its mechanical transmission. The pioneer gave the following description:Jean Boulet, Histoire de l'h√©licopt√®re : racont√©e par ses pionniers, 1907-1956, Paris : France-Empire, 1982 In 1931 a second, lighter, design was built, and baptized \\"Type II\\". This was largely built at Soci√©te Anonyme Avions et Moteurs Renard. It was equipped with an air-cooled 240-hp Renard engine with a vertical axis. Like its predecessor, the Type II was equipped with two tandem rotors (one at the front and one at the rear) rotating in the same direction. In order to balance the reaction torques, the axes of rotation of the rotors were inclined about 7¬∞ on either side of the longitudinal axis of the fuselage, laterally (one to the left and the other to the right). Its chassis, made of welded steel tubes, gave it a total working weight of 950 kg, i.e. 60% of the weight of the Type I wooden fuselage. The aircraft was equipped with magnesium alloy 'elephant legs' as landing gear. This model made many test flights, and eventually set an unofficial record flight duration of 9 minutes and 58 seconds. The flights began on April 12, 1933, and on October 25 of the same year, near the beech forest of Soignes, the aircraft piloted by Mr. Robert Collin, engineer at the Belgian Aeronautics Technical Service, officially beat the record for time in the air of 9 min 58 s. A few months later, in 1934, when tested in Haren the team tried to beat the record of altitude of 18 meters realized in Rome by the machine designed by Ascanio. During the attempt, there was a malfunction of one of the clutches of the transmission, which unbalanced the device which turned and crashed. Robert Collin, very well protected, got away without a scratch. The Florine II made more than thirty test flights between April 1933 and May 1934. A third model was then built, this time with a twin-engine configuration. The fuselage was lighter while the two Salmson 60 hp engines were placed at the front on either side of the fuselage. The blades of the rotors were folded when stationary. The first flight was made by Collin on 15 September 1936 and tests were carried out until the autumn of 1937. However, the results were disappointing, especially in comparison with the prototype Florine II. In 1937, further development stopped. This helicopter was destroyed during World War II. Later years The onset of World War II, with the cost of national rearmament, deprived Florine of a budget.Alphonse Dumoulin, La Belgique √† l'avant-garde de la giraviation, Ed. FNAR et AELB, Bruxelles 1991 Robert Collin went to the Belgian Congo in 1938 to work in civil engineering until his retirement in 1967. Florine worked on a quadrirotor project until 1949 and remained attached to the Service technique de l'a√©ronautique (STA√©) until his retirement In 1956. He died in Brussels in 1972, aged 81 years. Nicolas Florine is also known to have devised a system of three lenses coupled to three filters allowing the superposition of colored images. This principle was developed in the 1930s for the projection of films in relief. An area in the Air and Space section of the Royal Museum of the Army and Military History in Brussels is reserved for Florine; it presents documents (photos, plans, drawings, etc.) as well as a complete wind-tunnel model (scale 1/5) of the Florine IV project, his quadrirotor.

As of December 2014, 75% of California was under Extreme (Red) or Exceptional (Maroon) Drought. The California drought continued after 2014. Climate change and the effects of global warming with regard to the climate in California primarily revolve around issues such as drought and the subsequent risk of wildfire and related occurrences. A 2011 study projected that the frequency and magnitude of both maximum and minimum temperatures would increase significantly as a result of global warming. The same study further projected that the frequency and magnitude of both maximum and minimum temperatures would likely increase as a result of global warming. Paleoclimatological evidence Paleoclimatological studies indicate that the last 150 years of California's history have been unusually wet compared to the previous 2000 years. Tree stumps found at the bottom of lakes and rivers in California indicate that many water features dried up during historical dry periods, allowing trees to grow there while the water was absent. These dry periods were associated with warm periods in Earth's history. During the Medieval Warm Period, there were at least two century-long megadroughts with only 60-70% of modern precipitation levels. Paleoclimatologists believe that higher temperatures due to global warming may cause California to enter another dry period, with significantly lower precipitation and snowpack levels than observed over the last 150 years. Extreme weather impacts A 2011 study projected that the frequency and magnitude of both maximum and minimum temperatures would increase significantly as a result of global warming. = Wildfires = Governor Gavin Newsom talks about climate change and wildfires at the North Complex Fire in 2020. In 2017, a study projected that the single largest threat to Los Angeles County hospitals related to climate change is the direct impact of the expected increase in wildfires. In Los Angeles County, 34% of hospitals are located within one mile of fire hazard severity zones. Additionally, one of these hospitals was also deemed in danger of coastal flooding due to the effects of climate change as concluded by the study. This latter issue was also included and focused on, as the study likewise concluded that this would become a greater hazard as sea level rise due to increase annual temperatures. As a consequence of further global warming, it is projected that there will be an increase in risk due to climate-driven wildfires in the coming decades. Because of warming, frequent droughts, and the legacy of past land management and expansion of residential areas, both people and the ecology are more vulnerable to wildfires. Wildfire activity is closely tied to temperature and drought over time. Globally, the length of the fire season increased by nearly 19% from 1979 to 2013, with significantly longer seasons in the western states. Since 1985, more than 50% of the wildfire area burned in the western United States can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. In addition, due to human fire suppression methods, there is a build of fuels in some ecosystems, making them more vulnerable to wildfires. There is greater risk of fires occurring in denser, dryer forests, where historically these fires have occurred in low-density areas. Lastly, with increases in human population, communities have expanded into areas that are at higher risk to wildfire threat, making these same populations more vulnerable to structural damage and death due to wildfires. Since 1990, the average annual number of homes lost to wildfires has increased by 300%. Almost 900,000 of western US residences were in high risk wildfire areas as of 2017 with nearly 35% of wildfires in California starting within this high risk areas. In 2019, after \\"red flag\\" warning about the possibility of wildfires was declared in some areas of California, the electricity company \\"Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;)\\" begun to shut down power, for preventing inflammation of trees that touch the electricity lines. Millions can be impacted. The climatic conditions that cause this warning became more frequent because of climate change. If the temperatures keep rising, such power outages could become common. = Drought = According to the NOAA Drought Task Force report of 2014, the drought is not part of a long-term change in precipitation and was a symptom of the natural variability, although the record-high temperature that accompanied the recent drought may have been amplified due to human-induced global warming. This was confirmed by a 2015 scientific study which estimated that global warming \\"accounted for 8‚Äì27% of the observed drought anomaly in 2012‚Äì2014... Although natural variability dominates, anthropogenic warming has substantially increased the overall likelihood of extreme California droughts.\\" In February 2014, the Californian drought effects caused the California Department of Water Resources to develop plans for a temporary reduction of water allocations to farmland by up to 50% at the time. During that period California's 38 million residents experienced 13 consecutive months of drought. This is particularly an issue for the state's 44.7 billion dollar agricultural industry, which produces nearly half of all American-grown fruits, nuts, and vegetables. According to NASA, tests published in January 2014 have shown that the twelve months prior to January 2014 were the driest on record, since record-keeping began in 1885. Lack of water due to low snowpack prompted Californian governor Jerry Brown to order a series of stringent mandatory water restrictions on April 1, 2015. 578x578px = Forest management = Drought-surviving sugar pines around Lake Tahoe have found among 129 million trees in California killed between 2012 and 2016 by drought and bark beetles. Thousands of seedlings descended from these trees are being planted south-facing slopes on the lake basin's north side with the hope that they carry genes that make them more resilient to drought, waning snowpack and other effects of global warming in the forests of Sierra Nevada.  Sea Level rise  Population density and low elevation coastal zones in Western United States Population density and low elevation coastal zones in San Francisco Bay (2010) A 2017 study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research projected that a sea level rise of between 1 and 2 m will swallow between one-third and two-thirds of Southern California beaches.  Health impacts  Expected increases in extreme weather could lead to increased risk of illnesses and death. = Heat waves = From May to September 1999 ‚Äì 2003, a study was conducted in nine Californian counties that found that for every 10 ¬∞F (5.6 ¬∞C) increase in temperature, there is a 2.6 percent increase in cardiovascular deaths.Basu, R., and B. D. Ostro. 2008. ‚ÄúA Multicounty Analysis Identifying the Populations Vulnerable to Mortality Associated with High Ambient Temperature in California.‚Äù Am J Epidemiol 168(6): 632‚Äì37  2006 heat wave  A study of the 2006 Californian heat wave showed an increase of 16,166 emergency room visits, and 1,182 hospitalizations. There was also a dramatic increase in heat related illnesses; a six-fold increase in heat-related emergency room visits, and 10-fold increase in hospitalizations.Knowlton, K., M. Rotkin-Ellman, G. King, H. G. Margolis, D. Smith, G. Solomon, R. Trent, and P. English. 2009. \\"The 2006 California Heat Wave: Impacts on Hospitalizations and Emergency Department Visits\\". Environ Health Perspect 117(1): 61‚Äì67 A study of seven counties impacted by the 2006 heat wave found a 9 percent increase in daily mortality per 10 degrees Fahrenheit change in apparent temperature for all counties combined. This estimate is 3 times greater than the effect estimated for the rest of the warm season. The estimates indicate that actual mortality during the 2006 heat wave was two or three times greater than the initial coroner estimate of 147 deaths. = Air pollution = Research suggests that the majority of air pollution related health effects are caused by ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM). Many other pollutants that are associated with climate change, such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide, also have health consequences.Public health- related impacts of climate change in California. California Energy Commission Five of the ten most ozone-polluted metropolitan areas in the United States (Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Visalia, Fresno, and Sacramento) are in California.ALA (American Lung Association). 2008. State of the Air: 2008. American Lung Association: New York. Californians suffer from a variety of health consequences due to air pollution ‚Äì including 18,000 premature deaths attributed to various causes such as respiratory diseases as well as a number of other illnesses. Climate change may lead to exacerbated air pollution problems. Higher temperatures catalyze chemical interactions between nitrogen oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight that lead to increases in ambient ozone concentrations in urban areas. A study found that for each 1 degree Celsius (1 ¬∞C) rise in temperature in the United States, there are an estimated 20‚Äì30 excess cancer cases, as well as approximately 1000 (CI: 350‚Äì1800) excess air-pollution-associated deaths. About 40 percent of the additional deaths may be due to ozone and the rest to particulate matter annually. Three hundred of these annual deaths are thought to occur in California.  Economic impacts  = Gross domestic product = The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that under a business-as-usual scenario, between the years 2025 and 2100, the cost of providing water to the western states in the United States will increase from $200 billion to $950 billion per year, an estimated 0.93‚Äì1 percent of the United States' gross domestic product (GDP). Four climate change impacts‚Äîhurricane damage, energy costs, real estate losses, and water costs‚Äîalone are projected to cost 1.8 percent of the GDP of the United States, or, just under $1.9 trillion in 2008 U.S. dollars by the year 2100. = Job opportunities = A study conducted in 2009 showed that increases in frequency and intensity of extreme weather due to climate change will lead to a decreased productivity of agriculture, revenue losses, and the potential for lay offs. Changing weather and precipitation patterns could require expensive adaptation measures, such as relocating crop cultivation, changing the composition or type of crops, and increasing inputs such as pesticides to adapt to changes in ecological composition, that lead to economic degradation and job loss. Climate change has adverse effects on agricultural productivity in California that cause laborers to be increasingly affected by job loss. For example, the two highest-value agricultural products in California's $30 billion agriculture sector are dairy products (milk and cream, valued at $3.8 billion annually) and grapes ($3.2 billion annually).California agriculture statistical review. Sacramento, California. California Agriculture Statistics Service It is also expected to adversely affect the ripening of wine grapes, substantially reducing their market value.  Legislation  California has taken a number of legislative steps and extensive measures and initiatives targeted at the broader issue of climate effects seeking to prevent and minimize the risks of possible effects of climate change by a wide variety of incentives, measures and comprehensive plans for clean cars, renewable energy, and pollution controls on industry with overall high environmental standards. California is internationally known for its leading role in the realm of ecoconscious legislature not just on a national level but also globally.

History Western, established originally in the West End of Glasgow, played hockey in that district for 70 years, during which time they never succeeded in finding a permanent ground which they could call their home. Nevertheless, they maintained their position as a prominent club in the West of Scotland and were highly regarded throughout Scotland. From the earliest times they have provided many Scottish internationalists. After the second World War the club continued to prosper, fielding four teams regularly every weekend. But it was in 1968 that the major change occurred when the club became a fully integrated part of Milngavie and Bearsden Sports Club. This was a step of great significance, providing financial stability to the Sports Club and a permanent home for Western. With the requirement that top class hockey be played on artificial surfaces the first privately owned artificial hockey pitch was laid at Auchenhowie in 1994 providing unrivalled facilities to Western players and contributing significantly to the improvement of playing standards throughout the club. Over the past twenty years or so, Western has promoted a deliberate youth policy to interest local boys and girls in the game of hockey. Coaching has been provided on a regular basis with games and mini tournaments for the various age ranges from 8 year-olds to 17 year-olds.

He was the father of Pol Clovis Bo√´l. Career Bo√´l was the son of farmers (Salasse farm), growing up with four brothers and a sister. Bo√´l studied at the industrial school of Houdeng-Aimeries and in 1851, at the age of 14, started working at the Etablissements Ernest Boucqu√©au. He became foreman of the factory and in 1865 he became plant manager. Ernest Boucqu√©au, at the edge of bankruptcy and faced with the refusal of his family to help him, asked Bo√´l and his accountant to assist him in saving the company. They helped gather the necessary funds to finish the work he had started on the railroad tunnel between Enghien and Geraardsbergen of the railroad of Braine-le-Comte to Ghent. On 16 July 1880 Ernest Boucqu√©au died without leaving an heir and he bequeathed his fortune and his companies to Gustave Bo√´l and his accountant. When the accountant died, Bo√´l became the sole heir of the entire fortune and the factories. As of 1881, he modernized his companies and created an industrial group by taking participations in other companies, such as the steel factories Fabrique de Fer de Charleroi (Fafer) in Charleroi and in Braine-le-Comte, coal mines and glass industry les Glaces de Moustier-sur-Sambre which would become Glaverbel. On 1 September 1888, Gustave Bo√´l was one of the first in Belgium who established a participation in the profits for the employees of his factory. In 1912, the Etablissements Ernest Boucqu√©au would become the Usines Gustave Bo√´l. Political career Gustave Bo√´l also inherited the liberal political and philosophical ideas of Boucqu√©au. As a progressive liberal, he embarked on a political career. On 11 October 1880, Bo√´l became a member of the communal council of La Louvi√®re, and on 14 November of the same year he became alderman. On 4 May 1881, Bo√´l became burgomaster of La Louvi√®re. During his mandate, he supported many local initiatives and provided financial support for the construction of the hospital of La Louvi√®re. In 1883, he resigned as burgomaster and became senator from 12 April 1883 until 8 July 1884. Asked by his liberal political friends, he again became senator on 14 June 1892 and from that moment onwards, Bo√´l would stay senator for the Liberal Party until his death in 1912.

He was elected laureate by the Marseille Academy in 1983, and Guy Levis Mano laureate in 1984.  Biography  Dominique Sorrente was born in Nevers (Ni√®vre) in 1953. He spent his childhood in various cities and regions of France: Marseille, the Morvan‚Äôs forests and the Vend√©e, on the Atlantic coast. After receiving a Jesuit education, he moved in 1970 to Aix-en-Provence where he began to write poetry. When he was 17 years old, he met the poet, Christian Guez-Ricord (1948-1988) who was to have a lasting influence on his work. In 1975, in Paris, he founded the journal Avalanche which he edited for four years with the novelist, Michel Orcel. After studying Political Sciences and European Studies in Paris, then in Bruges (Belgium), he returned to Marseille where he became a teacher. His first book, Citadelles et Mers (1978) was published by Mediterranean and International Review Sud. He later became a member of the committee of Sud until its demise in 1997. In 1982, Jean-Fran√ßois Manier an editor at Cheyne editions accepted Sorrente's manuscript La Lampe allum√©e sur Patmos. Dominique Sorrente was elected laureate by the Marseille Academy in 1983, and Guy Levis Mano laureate in 1984; he subsequently received several literary Prizes: Luc B√©rimont, Antonin Artaud and Louis Guillaume as well as two grants from the Centre national du livre (French Ministry of Culture). Later on, he became a member of different boards such as the Jean Malrieu Prize. Recently (June 2008) he received the Sainte-Victoire Prize in Aix-en-Provence. Dominique Sorrente has published some twenty books and anthologies, including a bilingual poetry collection, A Crayon for the Rainbow (Publibook, 2003). A new book was published in March 2007, called Mandala des jours (Publibook). Dominique Sorrente‚Äôs writing has also been published in several journals, both in France and abroad. Poems have been translated into English, but also in German, Romanian, Italian and Chinese. Besides his work as a poet, Dominique Sorrente gives regular readings, lectures and seminars in France and internationally (Prague, Venice, Marrakech, Naples‚Ä¶). He participates regularly in literary events in France, such as the Printemps des Po√®tes. In 2007, he was invited to the first ‚ÄúPrimavera dei poeti‚Äù in Turin (Italy). In 1999, a retrospective exhibition Voix, po√®me, encre & compagnie dedicated to Dominique Sorrente and other collaborating artists (painters, musicians, sculptors, poets) was organized in Aix-en-Provence by the Saint-John Perse Foundation created in honour of the Nobel Prize winner. In 1999 Sorrente set up a new meeting-place for poetry in a small sea harbour called the Vallon des Auffes, Marseille, called The Scriptorium. This movement is based on \\"intuitive poetry\\" and the desire to stimulate creative links among artists. With the rhythm of semaphore (a time for appearing / a time for vanishing‚Ä¶), it seeks to promote all the resources of poetry in the heart of the city, through conferences, lectures and original experiences called: ‚Äúintervals‚Äù, ‚Äúpoetic caravans‚Äù, ‚Äúliterary meals‚Äù, ‚Äútranscontinental events‚Äù‚Ä¶ An international seminar was held in May 2002 with writers coming from all around the world. For the Unesco International Poetry Day, the Scriptorium organized in 2008 the first edition of La Transcontinentale gathering poets of different continents. Dominique Sorrente has also held a position as Professor in Culture and Humanities at the Euromed School of Management and in different Graduate Schools in France. He bases his educational research on his central concern for creative management and poetry. He has taught European studies, Ethical Issues and Cultural Management. In 2006, Dominique Sorrente was selected for an international Residence in Lavigny Castle (Switzerland) by the Ledig-Rowohlt Foundation. In 2007, he was selected by L&Arc; (%culturel Migros) for the international artists‚Äô residence in the site of the abbey of Romainm√¥tier (Switzerland) where he returned in May 2008. The first prototype of a new concept of poetical DVD, called Pictodramathis (Entracte 1: Lettre √† une habitante en chemin ‚Äì ‚ÄúA missive to a pioneer denizen‚Äù) was developed by Sorrente with the photograph and painter, Daniel Vincentscreened at the Salon du Livre in Paris (March 2007).

He was the bishop of Anadyr and Chukotka from August 2000 to June 2008. Now he is the formal leader of the extremely small non-canonical religious group \\"Holy Governing Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church\\". Diomid is known for his views condemning ecumenism, taxpayer ID, cell phones, new passports, vaccination and globalisation. He believes that the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church have \\"departed from the purity of the Orthodoxal dogma\\" in its support of the Russian government and of democracy, as well as its ecumenism with other confessions. Biography Sergey Dziuban graduated from the Kharkov Radio- Electronics Institute in 1983 and worked as an engineer in the Kharkov Construction-Technological Bureau. In 1987, he was tonsured a monk (as Diomid) at the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius north of Moscow by Archimandrite Alexis (Kutepov) (now Metropolitan of Tula and Efremov). Diomid completed study at the Moscow Theological Seminary in 1989 and began studies at the Moscow Teological Academy that same year, completing study there in 1993. He was ordained a hieromonk by Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow on 1 September 1991. In 1993, he became a hegumen, and from 1992‚Äì2000 he was priest at the Church of Assumption of the Mother of God in the Kamchatka Eparchy. In June 2001 he was named archimandrite, and two months later was consecrated bishop of Anadyr.See his biography on the website of the Moscow Patriarchate: http://patriarchia.ru/db/text/31662.html Due to his insubordination and alleged heretical views, he was provisionally suspended from his episcopate on June 28, 2008 by the Bishops Council of the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patriarchate for \\"supporting the violation of canonical norms and introducing temptation into the life of the Church\\".–ñ–£–†–ù–ê–õ ‚Ññ 56 –∑–∞—Å–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –°–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –°–∏–Ω–æ–¥–∞ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π –¶–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ –æ—Ç 28 –∏—é–Ω—è 2008 –≥–æ–¥–∞ The official web site of the MP.

He said that he was not establishing a new church of his own and that he remained in the ROC however without obedience to its \\"heretic prelates\\".

There was a ferry across the River Thames at Bablock Hythe from the 13th century. The hand- propelled cable ferry was said to be the first along the Thames and was still in use for cars and other road vehicles up until 1959. Heritage The Ferryman Inn The earliest reference to a ferry is in 1279 and later ferries continued to provide a crossing service until the mid-20th century. The ferry was a wide-beamed ferry punt with a rope or chain in the river, which presented something of a hazard to navigation.Fred. S. Thacker: The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs (1920, republished 1968 by David & Charles). There was also an ancient inn, The Chequers, described by William Senior in his Royal River in the 1880s. This was rebuilt in the early 1990s and renamed The Ferry Inn and later The Ferryman.Christopher Winn: I Never Knew That about the River Thames (London: Ebury Press, 2010), p. 39.

This is the power station there McAlpine's Fusiliers is an Irish ballad set to a traditional air, popularised in the early 1960s by Dominic Behan. The song relates to the migration of Irish labourers from Ireland to Britain during the 20th century. The ballad's title refers to the eponymous construction company of Sir Robert McAlpine, a major employer of Irish workmen at the time. John Laing and Wimpey (also referred to in the opening monologue; an integral part of the ballad although not included in some cover versions of the song) were other major construction companies employing Irish 'navvies' (a British term referring to building labourers and originally coined for the labourers who built the British canals or 'navigations'). The colloquial and local terms in the song's monologue and lyrics include references to a 'spike' (a hostel or 'reception centre' sometimes used by Irish navvies who could not find or afford lodgings) and to 'shuttering' (a rapidly constructed wooden casing made to hold concrete while it sets). Holyhead, also referred to in the monologue, is a port on Anglesey (Ynys M√¥n) in Wales where the main ferry service across the Irish Sea from D√∫n Laoghaire used to dock. Cricklewood is a district of North West London which had a relatively large Irish population. The Isle of Grain is an area in Kent where the River Medway joins the Thames Estuary east of London which was a large construction site for several years while a large power station was built there. The song offers a satirical view of the life and work of the Irish labourers of the times and as such proved popular. Some sources suggest that the words of the song were derived from an earlier poem or poems by Irish labourer Martin Henry, with the song's arrangement attributed to Dominic Behan. Along with a number of other songs, Behan provided the song to The Dubliners for use in a new set-structure. In its original form, the song was performed in two parts, a spoken monologue (originally spoken by Ronnie Drew of the Dubliners self-accompanied by his flamenco guitar) followed by the sung verses supported by the full band. The song has also been recorded by Paddy Reilly, The Clancy Brothers and others.

Dmitry Girs was born in Taganrog, where his father was chief of quarantine. Girs‚Äôs ancestors were of Swedish origin. His most notable relative was his cousin Nikolai Karlovich Girs, foreign minister in 1882-1894. In 1843, his family moved to Saint Petersburg, where he studied in a military school, graduated from the engineer college, and then served as a field engineer. In 1868 he had to leave the city as punishment for his speech at the funeral ceremony of Dmitri Pisarev. Girs‚Äôs first writings were published in 1862 in The Russian Messenger under the pen-name Konstantinov. In 1868 he published the beginning of his novel Staraia i novaia Rossia (The Old and New Russia) in Otechestvennye zapiski (Homeland Notes). Although the novel aroused great expectations, it was never finished. Other works by Girs are Na krayu propasti (On the edge of the abyss) in Delo (The deed), 1870; Kaliforniiskiy rudnik (The California mine) in Otechestvennye zapiski, 1872; Dnevnik notarialnogo pistsa (The diary of a notary scribe), Ibid., 1883; Avdotya- dvumuzhnitsa (Avdotya the bigamist) in Russkaya mysl' (Russian Thought), 1884. In 1876 Girs worked in Serbia as a military reporter for Sankt-Peterburgskiye Vedomosti (The St. Petersburg Gazette) and in 1877 for Severnyi vestnik (The Northern Bulletin). In 1878-1880 Girs published his own newspaper, called Russkaya pravda (Russian Truth), in which he wrote feuilletons under the pen- name Dobro-Glagol. The paper was respected but never enjoyed great success; it incurred administrative penalties and was suspended from publishing many times. Girs‚Äôs works Zapiski voiennogo (Notes of a military man) and Kaliforniiskiy rudnik were published in a single volume (St. Petersburg, 1872).

The Chinar Division's headquarters are located in the Murree Hills Cantonment. The brigades of 12th Division are deployed all across Azad Jammu Kashmir and the Line of Control. With 6 Infantry Brigades, 1 Divisional Artillery brigade and a number of supporting units of Air Defence, Supply and Remount Veterinary Corps under its command, 12th Infantry division is the largest division of Pakistan Army.  History  The division was formed in 1948, from troops allocated to Pakistan from the old British Indian Army. It was the first division sized formation to be created by the Pakistan Army (the three prior ones, 7th (Golden Arrow), 8th and 10th infantry divisions predated Pakistan).  1948 Kashmir War  The division went into combat against the Indian army in Kashmir. A notable action was the recapturing of Skardu from the Indian forces, accomplished with help from tribesmen from the tribal areas.  1965 Indo-Pakistani War  In between the wars the division was active on the ceasefire line, where fighting broke out on several occasions. In 1965 the division undertook Operation Grand Slam, whereby under the command of 7th Infantry Division, it attacked and captured Chamb, and then moved on and captured territory beyond the river Tawi, ending up in a position 6 km ahead of Jammu. Although its performance was greatly lauded at the time, its commander Maj-Gen Akhtar Hussain Malik was privately criticised by General Ayub Khan, for abandoning several posts in Kashmir which were then taken by the Indian forces, and for losing the strategically vital Hajir Pir Pass (this would not be retaken until after the ceasefire).  1971 Bangladeshi War  Six years later, the division went into action again, this time in Poonch-Ranjouri sector. Despite being outnumbered by Indian forces, the formation managed to advance nearly 50 km, all the way to Ranjouri. Unfortunately dogged Indian resistance meant that it was unable to capture Poonch itself. During the war, it was commanded by Maj-Gen Mohammad Akbar Khan.  Recent history  Since 1971, the formation had been deployed on the Line of Control, dividing the Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, where sporadic fights break out with Indian forces, and occasionally full-fledged actions develop. In 1991, the division defeated an Indian incursion into the Neelum Valley.  List of GOCs (Commanders)  * Lieutenant-General (Lt. Gen.) Attiqur Rahman * Lt. Gen.

Many garments today are produced through outsourcing in other countries. A way to do this efficiently and effectively is through Tech Packs. Tech Packs contain 9 pages of information that help the manufacturer communicate with the designer. Here is the order of the pages: *A summary page with a drawn example of the garment (usually using Adobe Illustrator) *Construction details (in-depth details of different pieces to the garment) *Dimensions (in-depth measurements of garment) *Order of Operation (order of construction) *Component (list of different pieces/trims involved) *Cost Section (cost and quantity of materials) *Label Section (illustration and description of tags/labels on garment) *Shipping (manner in which product is packaged and shipped) *History (any changes prior to finishing) =Designing Software= In recent times, many organizations have started offering customization software including apparel design software, t-shirt customization tool, suit designing software and much more. These software ease the work of fashion designers and apparel manufacturers. iDesigniBuy, Customink, Fluid and Productimize are some of the leading fashion designing software providers. Databases The fashion industry has been using databases to aggregate and organize information specific to the industry. Below are some examples of such databases. 1\\\\. Mix-and-Match databases The mix-and-match database is a database that is being used in Hong Kong. Traditionally, fashion companies depend on sales associates to complementary clothing recommendations for customers. The mix-and-match database essentially does the same thing, but in a different way. In order to use this database all clothes in the store have to be tagged with a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag.. In addition, each fitting room has to be equipped with a computer monitor. When a customer brings a clothing item with a RFID tag into the fitting room, the computer monitor will identify the garment, and display photographs of complementary items using the database.1> 2\\\\. Fashion Library databases An example of a useful database that is the National Fashion Institute of Fashion Technology's Virtual Fashion Library (VFL) in India. This database is specifically organized to meet the needs of India's fashion designers. The VFL's most useful tool is its Fashion Image Inventory. The inventory includes three image banks: the Indian fashion museum, the virtual swatch library, and archives of fashion shows. The Indian fashion museum contains pictures and videos of Indian costumes and dress throughout various historical periods. The virtual swatch library includes a collection of fabrics from all over India which helps designers select fabrics and patterns made in India. The archives fashion show contains videos of India's top fashion runway shows.2 References *Course listing by Australian Institute of Fashion Design *Wong, W.K., et al. ‚ÄúA fashion mix-and- match expert system for fashion retailers using fuzzy screening approach.‚Äù Science Direct. 2009:1750-1763.

It is narrated in the first person in the name of Orpheus and tells the story of Jason and the Argonauts. It is not known who the real author is. The poem is found in manuscripts either on its own or together with the Orphic Hymns and other hymns such as the Homeric Hymns and those of Proclus and Callimachus. The poem was lost, but in the fifteenth century it was found and copied in a manuscript (Codex Matritensis gr. 4562) by the Neoplatonic Greek scholar Constantine Lascaris, who considered a Pythagorean Orpheus. Another related work is the Lithica (describing the properties and symbolism of different stones). The narrative is basically similar to that in other versions of the story, such as the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius, on which it is probably based. The main differences are the emphasis on the role of Orpheus and a more mythological, less realistic technique of narration. In the Argonautica Orphica, unlike in Apollonius Rhodius, it is claimed that the Argo was the first ship ever built. References Further reading * M. L.

The fundamental concept of Wilson‚Äôs cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different ways: based on their first-hand experience or on what they have learned second-hand from others. What people learn first-hand depends on the stock of ideas they bring to the interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world. People primarily depend on others for ideas as well as for information outside the range of direct experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained second-hand. Wilson (1983) argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own lives is what others have told them. However, people do not count all hearsay as equally reliable; only those who are deemed to ‚Äúknow what they are talking about‚Äù become cognitive authorities. Wilson coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position.\\" (Rieh, 2005). Philosophical issues Wilson's dichotomy between first hand knowledge and second hand knowledge may be a trace left from empiricism. According to non-empiricist epistemologies such as hermeneutics and pragmatism even our first hand knowledge (our perception) is influenced by our culture and hence - mostly indirectly and unconsciously - by cognitive authorities: the way we learn to look at things when brought up in a culture and socialized into a subculture and a domain. The concept of cognitive authority is important because it forces us to be skeptical towards claims in the literature and elsewhere. It forces us to consider the criteria we should use when evaluating information sources. In other words: It forces us to consider epistemological issues. Different \\"movements\\", \\"paradigms\\", \\"positions\\" or \\"schools\\" in a given field tend to have different cognitive authorities. \\"Most people, even most academics, do not have the time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation\\" (Herrnstein, 1973, pp. 52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that IQ was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field (Leon Kamin) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world. The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from \\"experts\\" while on the other hand, \\"commonsensism\\" is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education in order to make the general public less vulnerable to the power of experts. Example: The cognitive authority of professional historians In about 1880, history was established as an academic discipline and as a profession based on that discipline in both Europe and the USA. The cognitive authority of history was closely related to the application of scientific methods and source criticism. A clear division was established between amateur historians and professional, scientific historians. From the dominant \\"paradigm\\" in the historical profession of that time, it was clear what to consider \\"cognitive authority\\". However, inside history, the \\"paradigm\\" shifted to \\"the present period of confusion, polarization, and uncertainty, in which the idea of historical objectivity has become more problematic than ever before\\".(Novick, 1988, p. 16-17) For some the development has turned around and amateurs have the same cognitive authority as professional historians: \\"[I]t is not the purportedly objective investigations of the historian into a real subject matter which lead to knowledge about history, but rather the knowledge at which the historian arrives is conditioned by the linguistic mode in which she/he operates. Professional historiography for White [1973] generates no more objective knowledge of the past than does speculative philosophy of history or the historical novel.\\" (Iggers, 2001, 6772) What is considered \\"cognitive authority\\" in a given field of knowledge is thus relative and depending on the \\"paradigm\\" of the information seeker. An argument about what should be regarded \\"cognitive authority\\" is in the end an epistemological argument. Implications for library and information science The concept of cognitive authority was developed in library and information science and has attracted a lot of attention in this field. Its importance for this field is related to questions such as: What criteria should be used for selecting information sources? For advising users about selecting information? For interpreting user studies and relevance judgments? All such issues involve questions of cognitive authority and epistemology. \\"Perhaps we [library and information professionals] should learn to be more critical of the very concept of authority. Authority is legitimate only within the boundaries of the community (subject or otherwise) in which it is based. Many questions pertain to areas claimed by competing disciplines, and some to areas beyond the bounds of recognized disciplinary communities. Even when we are able to locate authoritative sources with answers to questions, they tend to be less certain than they look, and greater authority is no guarantee of quality. Authority tells us only that the creators of the source have qualifications and institutional affiliations that match the expectations of a given disciplinary community, not that the source is infallible, or even that its disciplinary community is the best to pursue the information sought\\" (Pierce, 1991, p. 31).

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. Name The word Kainos comes from ancient Greek, meaning \\"new\\" or \\"fresh\\". History =1986 to 2010= Kainos's headquarters in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Kainos was founded as a joint venture between Fujitsu and The Queen's University of Belfast business incubation unit (QUBIS Ltd) on 14 April 1986, and became one of Northern Ireland's first campus companies. In January 1987, the company began trading in the QUBIS building on Malone Road, Belfast and Kainos founder, Frank Graham, was appointed managing director. In 1993, Kainos developed the Microsoft-based Meridio product, which is enterprise document and records management (EDRM) software. A spin-off company of Kainos was established in 1994 called Lagan Technologies, which grew to become a leading software supplier into local government in the UK and the US It was eventually acquired by U.S. based Kana Software in 2010. By 1997, due to the expansion of the company, Kainos relocated and opened offices in Mount Charles, Belfast, and opened its main headquarters in Upper Crescent, Belfast. Since then, Kainos moved into customer management systems (CMS) and call centre technology, and resulted in the company being restructured in January 1998 to form three business divisions ‚Äì Customer Management Systems, Custom Solutions and Products. That same year, Kainos signed a major deal with Fujitsu to develop a new document management software product, based on Kainos Knowledge, to be launched in markets around the world under Fujitsu's Teamware brand name. Historical logo used by Kainos in the mid-2000s After several years of business, in which Fujitsu was its main customer, the company sold most of its stake to ACT Venture capital in 2000. ACT Venture capital later divested its shareholding in Kainos. In 2001, the product Meridio was launched as a separate business division to develop document and records management software, which were sold to a number of system integration and software resellers. Frank Graham resigned as managing director of Kainos in 2001, to become managing director of Meridio, and was succeeded by Brendan Mooney. That same year, Kainos established a joint venture with InHouse Publications called Property News, one of the largest property portal sites in the UK and Ireland. In September 2004, Kainos entered into a partnership agreement with Mediasurface, the UK's largest content management provider. The following year, Kainos entered into another partnership agreement in 2005 with TIBCO, a provider of infrastructure software. In 2007, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kainos called SpeechStorm was established, providing automated products for call centres, including touch tone, SMS, speech and visual IVR. Meridio was sold and acquired by HP's Autonomy on 24 October 2007 to become Autonomy Records Manager, a records management product. That same year, management in Kainos bought out Fujitsu's remaining 20% shares. SpeechStorm, the speech division of Kainos, partnered with Genesys to deliver eircom with the solution to \\"streamline and optimize customer service\\", and to transform its customer contact center into a \\"Dynamic Contact Center\\" (DCC) on 24 April 2007. The company extended its Microsoft Gold Partnership on 27 February 2008, with the addition of the Microsoft competency for Custom Development Solutions. On 9 February 2009, the company was selected by six UK councils to be their IT services partner to deliver their electronic document and records management projects. Kainos launched the National Safeguarding Unit and its website for the NSPCC on 2 August 2009, which provides information and resources to help keep children safe. On 26 July 2010, Kainos won a strategic SharePoint 2010 EDRM project for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Kainos expanded its operations and opened a research office in Silicon Valley on 18 October 2010. =2011 to present= Kainos was chosen to take part in a healthcare technology research project in 2011, known as \\"VERVE\\", which aims to improve the quality of life for disadvantaged groups including older people and those with neurological disorders. The project is coordinated by Trinity College Dublin and includes partners in healthcare and academia in France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and (Germany), who together provide clinical and technical research, practical experience and knowledge in their respective areas of expertise. On 16 February 2011, Kainos launched AppCamp, an opportunity for young developers and entrepreneurs to learn how to create applications for iOS devices. Kainos became a corporate member of the ECHAlliance in 2012, an initiative based in Northern Ireland and Finland designed to support and promote healthcare and wellbeing. Kainos launched a scheme called \\"Earn as you Learn\\" on 1 May 2013, which allows students to earn a living and develop real-world expertise and experience as apprentice software engineers, while studying part-time for a degree funded by Kainos. On 28 May 2013, a new research and development centre was built next to Kainos's Gda≈Ñsk office. Kainos announced its partnership with Cloudera on 17 February 2014, which has allowed Kainos's customers and services to benefit from big data analytics in Europe. The partnership combines both Cloudera Enterprise and Cloudera's Hadoop-based data management solutions, with Kainos specialising in data integration, data quality and project delivery, to meet the needs of large organisations.

Early life Castairs Douglas was born a son of the manse in Kilbarchan in Renfrewshire, Scotland, the youngest or second-youngest of seven children. His father Rev Robert Douglas, was the parish minister, and his elder brother Robert was also closely involved in the church. His brother George also joined the church and served as Moderator of the General Assembly to the Free Church of Scotland 1894/95/Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church Douglas studied at the University of Glasgow from 1845 until 1851, gaining an MA degree, and was later awarded the LL.D. by his alma mater in recognition of his scholarly achievements. Going on to study Divinity at the University of Edinburgh, Douglas professed a keen interest in missionary work. He was ordained in February 1855 and set sail for China a month later. Mission to Amoy (Xiamen) As one of the treaty ports opened to Westerners in 1842, Xiamen (then known in the West as Amoy) was one of the few places in China where missionaries could go about their work relatively unmolested. During his tenure Douglas was responsible for increasing the single church in Xiamen to a congregation of twenty-five churches, composed mostly of Chinese members. Contemporaries of Douglas were heavily involved in producing material concerned with the local language, including Elihu Doty who wrote the Anglo- Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect and John Van Nest Talmage, author of the √ä-MnÃÇg Im √™ Jƒ´-ti√°n (Dictionary of the Amoy Speech). While stationed in Xiamen, Douglas, alongside fellow Scottish medical missionary H. L. Mackenzie, visited Formosa (modern-day Taiwan) and was influential in the decision by the English Presbyterian Mission to send missionaries to the island.A. Hamish Ion (21 September 2009). The Cross and the Rising Sun: The British Protestant Missionary Movement in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, 1865‚Äì1945. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press. p. 19. In his last significant position Douglas was elected joint Chairman of the Shanghai Missionary Conference of 1877, a gathering of 150 or so missionaries employed in the China field. Published works =Amoy‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary= During twenty-two years as a Presbyterian missionary in Xiamen Douglas amassed a wealth of information on the Southern Min language spoken in the area, eventually compiling his Chinese‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of Amoy (1873), which was the first comprehensive Southern Min‚ÄìEnglish dictionary and indeed the first dictionary of \\"living\\" Southern Min in any language; it remains an important work in the understanding of the language. The dictionary used an early version of the Peh-oe-ji romanisation to represent the sounds of Southern Min, with pronunciations from both the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou dialects of Southern Min, along with literary readings for many of the entries. Douglas felt that in regards to his work... Douglas' hope was ended by his early death, although fifty years after the initial publication of his dictionary just such an appendix was added, by the Reverend Thomas Barclay, a missionary stationed in Tainan, Qing-era Taiwan who had himself much benefited from the volume. Death and memorial Douglas died of cholera on 26 July 1877 at the age of 46 in his adopted home of Xiamen and was buried on Gulangyu. He is memorialised in a stained-glass window in St. Bryce Kirk, Kirkcaldy which was dedicated by his brother Robert Douglas, an elder of the kirk. Family Douglas's nephew (son of his brother Robert) was the eminent hygienist Prof Carstairs Cumming Douglas, named in his memory.

Attending university has a major impact on their future careers. The equivalent term in Japan is r≈çnin.  Social context  Gaining entrance to the extremely competitive and prestigious SKY universities in Seoul requires that some students become jaesusaeng after an initial less-than-stellar performance on the national exam. Korea is \\"prepossessed by social status and reputation,\\" and a SKY education is the main way to gain social status. Generally, the public education system is not enough to prepare students for the exam, so most students attend after school lessons at various hagwon (cram schools). The fierce competition for enrollment at prestigious universities is called \\"entrance exam war\\" (). Effects The stress from constant study and limited social life as a student have contributed to an increase in suicide in South Korea; for children aged 10 to 19 years old, suicide is the second most common cause of death in the country. Related term When a student fails to earn an adequate score over 3 or more years, he may be derisively referred to as a jangsusaeng () a play on words from the expression \\"Please live a long life\\" said to elders (Ïû•Ïàò ÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî). However, since 2010, the word \\"N susaeng\\" () is in common use. Although the definition of the word and the use of it is identical to the formerly used vocabulary, the Chinese character jang (Èï∑, meaning \\"long\\") is replaced with the Latin letter 'N', which stands for the undefined number of time the student is taking the test.

However, attempts to extend the Belgo franchise organically beyond London in the late 1990s were not successful: the franchise in Jersey lasted barely 12 months before closing in 2000. The Belgo flotation was used as a vehicle to acquire a number of celebrated chic London restaurants, such as The Ivy, The Caprice, Daphne's The Collection and J. Sheekey, creating the 'Signature Restaurants' division, and a business with a market capital that peaked at more than ¬£90,000,000.

It is composed of original and archive footage of Ellison and talking head segments from colleagues and fans including Robin Williams, Peter David, and Neil Gaiman. History In 1981, then-24-year-old producer Erik Nelson began shooting footage of Ellison while the author was at work on his typewriter. The footage was meant for a PBS segment set to air in March of that year. Ellison allowed Nelson to repeatedly film and interview him over subsequent years, stating that he thought Nelson to be \\"a fan working on a student project\\", and has stated that he never suspected that the film would amount to a serious production on such a professional level. The result of those sessions, and subsequent sessions spanning decades from the original, have been culled and edited, with additions from contemporaries of Ellison into what has become a documentary following a rough arc of Ellison's life and activities. Dreams with Sharp Teeth received its first public screening Thursday, April 19, 2007, at the Writers Guild Theatre in Los Angeles.Loftus, David (May 6, 2007). \\"Dreams with Sharp Teeth\\". DocumentaryFilms.net Retrieved September 24, 2018. Ellison's last public appearance in his hometown was in September 2007 for the Midwestern debut of the documentary at Cleveland Public Library. The film's screenings were met with critical acclaim by contemporaries of Ellison and Nelson, and the production company is currently searching for distribution to bring it to a larger audience. The DVD version was released on May 26, 2009. Additional materials on the DVD include a short feature on the film's debut screening, a conversation over pizza between Ellison and Gaiman, and readings of extracts from a number of short stories.

Nomino√´ was appropriating border territory and opposing Charles' attempt to impose Frankish authority. Nomino√´ defeated Charles, initiating a period of Breton expansion and consolidation of power. Background Following the death of Louis the Pious, Nomino√´ initially supported Charles the Bald in the dispute between him and his brothers over control of Frankish territory. However, when Count Ricuin of Nantes was killed at the Battle of Fontenoy, Charles refused to accept Lambert II as his successor, since Lambert's father, Lambert I, had fought against Charles. Charles replaced him with his supporter Renaud, Count of Herbauge. While Nomino√´ was ill, Renaud attacked Breton territory, but was killed in battle by the Bretons led by Erispoe, Nomino√´'s son, in alliance with Lambert. This allowed Lambert to occupy Nantes with the support of Nomino√´. Recovered from his illness, Nomino√´ hoped to take advantage of the disorder to expand into Frankish territory. On campaign in Aquitaine, Charles was initially unable to respond to the incursions. Learning of Charles's difficult military position in Toulouse, Nomino√´ continued his offensive, raiding Maine. In 845, Charles concluded a peace with Pepin II of Aquitaine and was reconciled with Lambert II of Nantes, freeing him to deal with the threat from Nomino√´. In November, he had intended to participate in a religious festival in Tours, but he decided to strike against Nomino√´ instead, having heard that a faction of discontented Bretons would defect to him if he hastened to their aid. The battle Charles quickly assembled an army of around 3,000 men.On Carolingian military power see \\"Un peuple de guerriers\\" in Favier, Jean, Charlemagne, Librairie Arth√®me Fayard, 1999. Nomino√´'s men were probably much fewer in number, comprising mostly a highly-mobile light cavalry. Nomino√´ lured the king into marshland at the confluence of the Oust and the Aff between Redon and Bains-sur-Oust, near Ballon Abbey - hence the name of the battle. The Bretons were then able to exploit their knowledge of this treacherous wetland territory. Details of the events of the actual battle are sketchy. Reports simply state that Charles was defeated. According to the Annals of Saint-Bertin: :\\"Charles had recklessly attacked Gallic Britain [Brittany] with limited forces, slipping up by a reversal of fortune...\\"Annales de Saint-Bertin (latin), Chr√©tien Dehaisne, √©diteur scientifique, Paris: Jules Renouard, 1871, in Gallica, biblioth√®que num√©rique on line: Biblioth√®que nationale de France According to First Annales de Fontenelle: :\\"The Franks entered Brittany and engaged in battle with the Bretons, November 22. Helped by the difficulty of the wetland location, the Bretons proved the better.\\"Les premi√®res annales de Fontenelle (Chronicon Fontanellense), dom Jean Laporte, Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de Normandie, M√©langes, 15e S√©rie, Rouen - Paris, 1951 Aftermath and significance Nominoe Triumphant: Tad ar Vro, Breton nationalist image of Nominoe as master of the territory of Brittany secured by the battle.Following his defeat, rumors circulated that Charles had been killed, forcing him to make a quick public appearance in Maine. While there, he rebuilt his army and headed back towards Brittany late in 846. There he concluded a treaty with Nomino√´, though the exact content of the agreement is unknown. Despite this a \\"cold war\\" persisted, and Breton raids continued into Frankish territory at Christmas of that year. Nevertheless, the agreement remained unbroken until 849. This relatively minor battle is often confused with the much more decisive Battle of Jengland won by Nomino√´'s son Erispoe against Charles in 851. This confusion dates to Arthur de la Borderie's 1894 History of Brittany and has been repeated many times since. However, it is to the battle of Ballon that some date the birth of a unified and independent Brittany, behind a single sovereign: Nomino√´. The expansionist policy of Nomino√´, by the conquest of the former Marches of Brittany, a Frankish buffer zone, was continued by Erispoe, who consolidated the borders of medieval Brittany. In the twentieth century the battle was given emblematic status by Breton nationalists. In 1952 the battle was commemorated by the nationalist group Koun Breizh, who funded the erection of a statue of Nomino√´ by the artist Raffig Tullou in Bains-sur-Oust, near the site of the victory.Koun Breizh: Nomino√´ Another nationalist group, Bretagne 845, founded in 1982, was named from the date of the battle. It merged with Koun Breizh in 1994.

An extinct branch called Goybet de Lutrin de Grilly was ennobled in the 18th Century and gave in 1753 a governor of the provinces of Chablais and Genevois. The coat of arms of this extinct branch was a blue field with three silver stars at the head and an upturned crescent at the point. Traversing the centre is a bar of gold. Mariano Goybet was born in Zaragoza, Spain. He was the son of Pierre Jules Goybet (1823‚Äì1912), an industrialist and Marie Bravais, niece of the physicist Auguste Bravais. One of his grandmothers was Louise de Montgolfier niece of the Montgolfier Brothers inventors of the hot air balloon.  Before the war  He studied at the college in Lyon, then at the military school √âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr and was promoted to second lieutenant in 1884. He served in the 2nd Regiment of Tirailleurs Alg√©riens, where he married Marguerite Lespieau, daughter of his commanding officer, general Theodore Lespieau. He was promoted to lieutenant in the 140th Regiment of Infantry, stationed in Grenoble, and then attended L'Ecole de Guerre (the War College), graduating with honours in 1892. He served on the staff of the 27th Infantry Division, was promoted to captain in 1893 and was appointed as orderly officer to general Z√©d√©, governor of Lyon, in 1896. He commanded a company of the 99th Regiment of Infantry then, following another staff appointment, he was made battalion chief of the 159th Regiment of Infantry. In 1907 he took command of the 30th Battalion of Chasseurs Alpins as lieutenant-colonel. He was still in command of this battalion when he was promoted to colonel. World War I (1914-1918) At the beginning of World War I he was assigned to the Vosges front with his Alpine battalion. He was placed at the head of the 152nd infantry regiment then he took command of the 81st Brigade and his troops took Steinbach in Alsace. Wounded twice at Hartmannswillerskopf. Afterwards, he joined the 98th Infantry Regiment at the Verdun front. In autumn his division was transported north to the Battle of the Somme. He commanded the 50th Brigade. In the beginning of 1917 he took command of the 25th Infantry Division and, as the enemy retreated, his division pursued them to the city of Saint Quentin. In August his men seized the woods of Avocourt after heavy fighting . In December, he was promoted to general. Red Hand Division In May 1918, General Goybet commanded the 157th Division, which had been decimated after the Chemin des Dames. It was reconstituted by putting together the 333rd Infantry Regiment (French) with the American 371st and the 372nd American Regiments. The 157th Division participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. With violent attacks, General Goybet broke the enemy front at Monthois, taking many prisoners and considerable materiel. After that he occupied the Vosges at the front of Sainte Marie les Mines. He gave his military honour to his troops Chester D. Heywood, Negro Combat Troops in the World War :The Story of the 371st Infantry, 1928.. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal awarded by General PershingMy dear General, the President delegated me to confer you the Distinguished Service Medal in the name of the United States government: As Commander of the 157th French Division of Infantry, you have been an important factor in the success of the allies by your valiant leadership and eminent tactical ability. The officers and soldiers of the 371st and 372nd American Infantry Regiments count it a great honor to have served as part of your command in the operations conducted by you in Champagne and in the Vosges.

Joseph was president of the Tioga Railroad and followed the family business of trading with China, Japan, and England. He also followed the family avocation of collecting art, especially oriental art. Joseph died in 1868 leaving the house to his second wife Anne, and following her death, to his son Robert. Robert also traveled and collected art which he displayed in the house. Less than a year before he died at age 65, Robert married his longtime housekeeper, Mary Ann Reed. She inherited a comfortable annuity and the house, with the house to be given to the City of Philadelphia after her death. She remarried three years after his death to the Reverend John G. Bawn and they continued the family avocations of traveling and art collecting.

The name top-hat originates from the shape of the filter, which is a rectangle function, when viewed in the domain in which the filter is constructed. Real space In real-space the filter performs nearest-neighbour filtering, incorporating components from neighbouring y-function values. However, despite their ease of implementation their practical use is limited as the real-space representation of a top-hat filter is the sinc function, which has the often undesirable effect of incorporating non-local frequencies. =Analogue implementations= Exact non-digital implementations are only theoretically possible. Top-hat filters can be constructed by chaining theoretical low-band and high-band filters. In practice, an approximate top-hat filter can be constructed in analogue hardware using approximate low-band and high-band filters.

As time moved on, their audience base expanded (in terms of both size and diversity) and they would increasingly favour larger arenas and stadiums. For many years, the group would choose to play North America, Continental Europe, and the United Kingdom on a three-year rotating cycle.

Between 1998 and 2002, he was NRP leader, and also held several ministerial portfolios. Biography Yitzhak Levy was born in Casablanca in Morocco in 1947, the son of Daniel-Yitzhak Levy, who later served as a member of the Knesset for the National Religious Party. The family immigrated to Israel in 1957. He studied at Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh and Yeshivat Hakotel, where he received rabbinical ordination. He served as an officer in the IDF, achieving the rank of major. He was a member of the Bnei Akiva Executive and World Secretariat, and Secretary-General of the National Religious Movement from 1986 to 1995. He was the Rabbi of the Bnei Akiva Talmudic College in Kfar Maimon, and was among the initiators of the establishment of the Jewish quarter in Jerusalem, and one of the founders of the Israeli settlement of Elon Moreh in the West Bank. Levy is married, with five children, and lives in Kfar Maimon. Political career He was elected to the Knesset in 1988 on the National Religious Party list. He was a member of the House Committee from 1988 to 1996, and the Labor and Social Welfare Committee from 1988 to 1992. He was also chairman the Ethics Committee and the children welfare lobby, as well as the Israel-Argentina Parliamentary Friendship League. Since 1988, he has been a member of the Committee on Constitution, Law, and Justice. In June 1996, he was appointed Minister of Transportation by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In February 1998, after the death of Zevulun Hammer, he became the leader of the NRP, and served as Minister of Education until July 1999. He also served as Minister of Religious Affairs, a position he held in rotation. In July 1999, he was appointed Minister of Housing and Construction. Following his appointment, he resigned from the Knesset in order to allow the next person on the NRP list, Nahum Langental, to enter the Knesset. In July 2000, following the Camp David Summit, he resigned from the government. On November 2, 2000, his 28-year-old daughter, Ayelet Hashahar Levy, was killed by a Palestinian car bomb in Jerusalem. In April 2002, during Operation Defensive Shield, he resigned as leader of the NRP to make way for Effi Eitam, and was made Minister without Portfolio. From September 2002 until February 2003, he served as Minister of Tourism. In March 2003, he was appointed Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. However, in June 2004, he and Eitam resigned in protest against the disengagement plan. He and Eitam subsequently left the NRP, and founded a new religious-Zionist party, Ahi, which joined the National Union alliance. In December 2008, Levy announced that he was retiring from politics, stating that the decision was made due to the new Jewish Home party not holding traditional primary elections, but instead relying on an internet- based vote.NRP's Yitzhak Levy retiring from politics Ynetnews, 12 March 2008 References External links * Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Ahi (political party) politicians Category:Deputy Speakers of the Knesset Category:Israeli Orthodox Jews Category:Israeli people of Moroccan-Jewish descent Category:Israeli Orthodox rabbis Category:Jewish Israeli politicians Category:Members of the 12th Knesset (1988‚Äì1992) Category:Members of the 13th Knesset (1992‚Äì1996) Category:Members of the 14th Knesset (1996‚Äì1999) Category:Members of the 15th Knesset (1999‚Äì2003) Category:Members of the 16th Knesset (2003‚Äì2006) Category:Members of the 17th Knesset (2006‚Äì2009) Category:Ministers of Education of Israel Category:Ministers of Tourism of Israel Category:Moroccan emigrants to Israel Category:Moroccan Jews Category:National Religious Party leaders Category:People from Casablanca ","title":"Yitzhak Levy"},{"id":"18160937","text":"MAX IV aerial photo MAX IV in Lund nearing completion.MAX IV is a next- generation synchrotron radiation facility in Lund, Sweden. Its design and planning has been carried out within the Swedish national laboratory, MAX-lab, which up until 2015 operated three accelerators for synchrotron radiation research: MAX I (550 MeV, opened 1986), MAX II (1,5 GeV, opened 1997) and MAX III (700 MeV, opened 2008). MAX-lab supported about 1000 users from over 30 countries annually. The facility operated 14 beamlines with a total of 19 independent experimental stations, supporting a wide range of experimental techniques such as macromolecular crystallography, electron spectroscopy, nanolithography and production of tagged photons for photo-nuclear experiments. The facility closed on 13 December (St Lucia dagen) 2015 in preparation for MAX IV. On 27 April 2009 the Swedish Ministry of Education and Research, Swedish Research Council, Lund University, Region Sk√•ne and Vinnova, a Swedish government funding agency, decided to fund the research center. The new laboratories, including two storage rings and a full-energy linac is situated in Brunnsh√∂g in Lund North East. The inauguration of MAX IV took place 21 June 2016, on the day of summer solstice. The larger of the two storage rings has a circumference of 528 meters, operates at 3 GeV energy, and has been optimized for high-brightness x-rays. The smaller storage ring (circumference 96 meters) is operated at 1.5 GeV energy and has been optimized for UV. There are also plans for a future expansion of the facility that would add a free-electron laser (FEL) to the facility, but is yet to be funded. At this point the 3 GeV ring along with the first few beam-lines has been opened for users to start their experiments. The smaller storage ring will not be opened for users until 2018.

(IMM). She was a sister ship to and a near sister ship to and of the same company. Although her name was Dutch, it was changed during World War I to the less German-sounding SS Northland. She served for a time as a British troop ship under the name HMT Northland. Reverting to Zeeland after the war, the ship was renamed SS Minnesota late in her career. Zeeland sailed primarily for IMM's Red Star Line for most of her early career, but also sailed under charter for the White Star Line (later White Star-Dominion), the International Navigation Company, the American Line, and the Atlantic Transport Line, all IMM subsidiary lines.  Early career  In July 1899, the Red Star Line announced plans for the construction of four large steamers. Two ships, and Zeeland at John Brown & Company of Clydebank in Scotland, and two others, and , were to be built at William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia.Bonsor, p. 840. After being launched on 24 November 1900, Zeeland made her maiden voyage from Antwerp to New York on 13 April 1901, sailing under the British flag.Bonsor, p. 855. Zeeland began regular service on the Antwerp‚ÄìNew York route sailing opposite of Vaderland, and when they were completed in 1902, Kroonland and Finland. In April 1910, Zeeland was chartered to the White Star Line for service between Liverpool and Boston, where she remained until September 1911. The following month, Zeeland was returned to the Antwerp‚ÄìNew York service for Red Star. In July 1912 the liner was reflagged as a Belgian ship; she remained on the same route, and continued sailing for the Red Star Line.  World War I  After the August 1914 outbreak of World War I, Zeeland was reflagged as a British ship, and sailed from Liverpool to New York in September. Shifting to the White Star-Dominion Line, Zeeland first sailed from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal in November, and from Liverpool to Halifax and Portland in December and January 1915. In early 1915, Zeeland, though her name was Dutch, was renamed to the less German-sounding SS Northland. Sailing for the International Navigation Company, the liner continued on the Liverpool‚ÄìHalifax‚ÄìPortland service through June before returning to the Liverpool‚ÄìQuebec‚ÄìMontreal route. After a period when she was taken up as a British troop ship, under the name HMT Northland, the liner returned for service under the White Star-Dominion Line in August 1916. In April 1917, Northland began Liverpool‚ÄìHalifax service, eventually making seven roundtrips on that route.  Late career  In February 1919, SS Northland began sailing from Liverpool to Philadelphia for the American Line through June 1919. After a refurbishment, the liner was returned to her former name, Zeeland; to the Red Star Line; and to Antwerp‚ÄìNew York service (with intermediate stops in Southampton) in August 1920. In April 1923, Zeeland was converted to cabin- and third-class passenger service only. Zeeland began her last Red Star voyage on 8 October 1926. Transferred to the Atlantic Transport Line in 1927, the liner was renamed SS Minnesota and began tourist service between London and New York in April. After making her last voyage in September 1929, Minnesota was sold and scrapped at Thos W Ward Inverkeithing in 1930.

The principles are based on the work of Disney animators from the 1930s onwards, in their quest to produce more realistic animations. The main purpose of these principles was to produce an illusion that cartoon characters adhered to the basic laws of physics, but they also dealt with more abstract issues, such as emotional timing and character appeal. The book has been referred to by some as the \\"Bible of animation\\", and some of its principles have been adopted by traditional studios. In 1999, The Illusion of Life was voted the number one \\"best animation book[...] of all time\\" in an online poll done by Animation World Network. While originally intended to apply to traditional, hand-drawn animation, the principles still have great relevance for today's more prevalent computer animation. The 12 principles of animation =Squash and stretch= The squash and stretch principle: rigid, non-dynamic movement of a ball is compared to a \\"squash\\" at impact and a \\"stretch\\" during the fall and after the bounce. Also, the ball moves less in the beginning and end (the \\"slow in and slow out\\" principle).The purpose of squash and stretchJohnston & Thomas (1981), p. 47. is to give a sense of weight and flexibility to drawn objects. It can be applied to simple objects, like a bouncing ball, or more complex constructions, like the musculature of a human face.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 47‚Äì51. Taken to an extreme, a figure stretched or squashed to an exaggerated degree can have a comical effect. In realistic animation, however, the most important aspect of this principle is that an object's volume does not change when squashed or stretched. If the length of a ball is stretched vertically, its width (in three dimensions, also its depth) needs to contract correspondingly horizontally.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 49. =Anticipation= pitch prepares for the action by winding his arm back. Anticipation is used to prepare the audience for an action, and to make the action appear more realistic. A dancer jumping off the floor has to bend the knees first; a golfer making a swing has to swing the club back first. The technique can also be used for less physical actions, such as a character looking off-screen to anticipate someone's arrival, or attention focusing on an object that a character is about to pick up.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 51‚Äì2. =Staging= This principle is akin to staging, as it is known in theatre and film.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 53. Its purpose is to direct the audience's attention, and make it clear what is of greatest importance in a scene; Johnston and Thomas defined it as \\"the presentation of any idea so that it is completely and unmistakably clear\\", whether that idea is an action, a personality, an expression, or a mood. This can be done by various means, such as the placement of a character in the frame, the use of light and shadow, or the angle and position of the camera.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 53, 56. The essence of this principle is keeping focus on what is relevant, and avoiding unnecessary detail.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 56. =Straight ahead action and pose to pose= These are two different approaches to the drawing process. Straight ahead action scenes are animated frame by frame from beginning to end, while \\"pose to pose\\" involves starting with drawing a few key frames, and then filling in the intervals later. \\"Straight ahead action\\" creates a more fluid, dynamic illusion of movement, and is better for producing realistic action sequences. On the other hand, it is hard to maintain proportions and to create exact, convincing poses along the way. \\"Pose to pose\\" works better for dramatic or emotional scenes, where composition and relation to the surroundings are of greater importance.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 56‚Äì8. A combination of the two techniques is often used.  In computer animation  Computer animation removes the problems of proportion related to \\"straight ahead action\\" drawing; however, \\"pose to pose\\" is still used for computer animation, because of the advantages it brings in composition. The use of computers facilitates this method and can fill in the missing sequences in between poses automatically. It is still important to oversee this process and apply the other principles. =Follow through and overlapping action= Follow through and overlapping action: the galloping race horse's mane and tail follow the body. Sequence of photos taken by Eadweard Muybridge. Follow through and overlapping action is a general heading for two closely related techniques which help to render movement more realistically, and help to give the impression that characters follow the laws of physics, including the principle of inertia. \\"Follow through\\" means that loosely tied parts of a body should continue moving after the character has stopped and the parts should keep moving beyond the point where the character stopped only to be subsequently \\"pulled back\\" towards the center of mass or exhibiting various degrees of oscillation damping. \\"Overlapping action\\" is the tendency for parts of the body to move at different rates (an arm will move on different timing of the head and so on). A third, related technique is \\"drag\\", where a character starts to move and parts of them take a few frames to catch up. These parts can be inanimate objects like clothing or the antenna on a car, or parts of the body, such as arms or hair. On the human body, the torso is the core, with arms, legs, head and hair appendices that normally follow the torso's movement. Body parts with much tissue, such as large stomachs and breasts, or the loose skin on a dog, are more prone to independent movement than bonier body parts.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 59‚Äì62. Again, exaggerated use of the technique can produce a comical effect, while more realistic animation must time the actions exactly, to produce a convincing result.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 60. The \\"moving hold\\" animates between two very similar positions; even characters sitting still, or hardly moving, can display some sort of movement, such as breathing, or very slightly changing position. This prevents the drawing from becoming \\"dead\\". Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 61‚Äì2. =Slow in and slow out= The movement of objects in the real world, such as the human body, animals, vehicles, etc. needs time to accelerate and slow down. For this reason, more pictures are drawn near the beginning and end of an action, creating a slow in and slow out effect in order to achieve more realistic movements. This concept emphasizes the object's extreme poses. Inversely, fewer pictures are drawn within the middle of the animation to emphasize faster action. This principle applies to characters moving between two extreme poses, such as sitting down and standing up, but also for inanimate, moving objects, like the bouncing ball in the above illustration. =Arc= Most natural action tends to follow an arched trajectory, and animation should adhere to this principle by following implied \\"arcs\\" for greater realism. This technique can be applied to a moving limb by rotating a joint, or a thrown object moving along a parabolic trajectory. The exception is mechanical movement, which typically moves in straight lines.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 62‚Äì3. As an object's speed or momentum increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. In baseball, a fastball would tend to move in a straighter line than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed would be unable to turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn. An object in motion that moves out of its natural arc for no apparent reason will appear erratic rather than fluid. For example, when animating a pointing finger, the animator should be certain that in all drawings in between the two extreme poses, the fingertip follows a logical arc from one extreme to the next. Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in lightly on the paper for reference, to be erased later. =Secondary action= Adding secondary actions to the main action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can simultaneously swing their arms or keep them in their pockets, speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 63‚Äì4. The important thing about secondary actions is that they emphasize, rather than take attention away from the main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out. For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases, it is better to include them at the beginning and the end of the movement, rather than during.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 64. =Timing= Timing refers to the number of drawings or frames for a given action, which translates to the speed of the action on film. On a purely physical level, correct timing makes objects appear to obey the laws of physics. For instance, an object's weight determines how it reacts to an impetus, like a push; as a lightweight object will react faster than a heavily weighted one. Timing is critical for establishing a character's mood, emotion, and reaction. It can also be a device to communicate aspects of a character's personality.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 64‚Äì5. =Exaggeration= Exaggeration is an effect especially useful for animation, as animated motions that strive for a perfect imitation of reality can look static and dull. The level of exaggeration depends on whether one seeks realism or a particular style, like a caricature or the style of a specific artist. The classical definition of exaggeration, employed by Disney, was to remain true to reality, just presenting it in a wilder, more extreme form.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 65-6. Other forms of exaggeration can involve the supernatural or surreal, alterations in the physical features of a character; or elements in the storyline itself. It is important to employ a certain level of restraint when using exaggeration. If a scene contains several elements, there should be a balance in how those elements are exaggerated in relation to each other, to avoid confusing or overawing the viewer. =Solid drawing= The principle of solid drawing means taking into account forms in three-dimensional space, or giving them volume and weight. The animator needs to be a skilled artist and has to understand the basics of three-dimensional shapes, anatomy, weight, balance, light and shadow, etc.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 66‚Äì7. For the classical animator, this involved taking art classes and doing sketches from life. One thing in particular that Johnston and Thomas warned against was creating \\"twins\\": characters whose left and right sides mirrored each other, and looked lifeless.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 67.  In computer animation  Modern-day computer animators draw less because of the facilities computers give them, yet their work benefits greatly from a basic understanding of animation principles, and their additions to basic computer animation. =Appeal= Appeal in a cartoon character corresponds to what would be called charisma in an actor.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 68. A character who is appealing is not necessarily sympathetic; villains or monsters can also be appealing, the important thing is that the viewer feels the character is real and interesting. There are several tricks for making a character connect better with the audience; for likable characters, a symmetrical or particularly baby-like face tends to be effective. A complicated or hard to read face will lack appeal or 'captivation' in the composition of the pose or character design. Notes a. The twelve principles have been paraphrased and shortened by Nataha Lightfoot for Animation Toolworks. Johnston and Thomas themselves found this version good enough to put it up on their own website.

Unlike ice pellets, which are hard, and freezing rain, which is fluid until striking an object, this precipitation is soft and translucent, but it contains some traces of ice crystals, from partially fused snowflakes. In any one location, it usually occurs briefly as a transition phase from rain to snow or vice versa. Its METAR code is RASN.  Terminology  This precipitation type is commonly known as sleet in most Commonwealth countries. However, the United States National Weather Service uses the term sleet to refer to ice pellets.  Formation  This precipitation occurs when the temperature in the lowest part of the atmosphere is slightly above the freezing point of water The depth of low-level warm air (below the freezing level) needed to melt snow falling from above to rain varies from about and depends on the mass of the flakes and the lapse rate of the melting layer. Rain and snow typically mix when the melting layer depth falls between these values.Crh.noaa.gov Rain snow mix soundings - Left diagram shows typical skew-T appearance, while right diagram shows variations which result in mixtures of rain and snow  \\"Wintry showers\\" or \\"wintry mixes\\"  Wintry showers is a somewhat informal meteorological term, used primarily in the United Kingdom, to refer to various mixtures of rain, graupel and snow. Though no \\"official\\" criteria exist for the term, in the United Kingdom the term is not used when any significant accumulation of snow on the ground takes place. It is often used when the temperature of the ground surface is above , preventing accumulation from occurring even if the air temperature is marginally below ; but even then, the falling precipitation must generally be something other than exclusively snow. In the United States, wintry mix generally refers to a mixture of freezing rain, ice pellets, and snow. In contrast to the usage in the United Kingdom, in the United States it is usually used when air and ground temperatures are below . Additionally, it is generally used when some accumulation of ice and snow is expected to occur. During winter, a wide area can be affected by the multiple precipitation types typical of a wintry mix during a single winter storm, as counter-clockwise winds around a storm system bring warm air northwards ahead of the system, and then bring cold air back southwards behind it. Most often, it is the region ahead of the approaching storm system which sees the wintry mix, as warm air moves northward and above retreating cold air, causing snow to change to ice pellets, freezing rain and finally rain. The reverse transition can occur behind the departing low pressure system, though it is more common for precipitation to change directly from rain to snow, or for it to stop before a transition back.

According to an IDF investigation, a-Shawamreh and his partners made a hole in the fence before passing. After passing through the fence the soldiers called them to stop. When they tried to escape, the soldiers shot towards a-Shawamreh's leg but mistakenly hit his waist, causing his death. Therefore, the soldiers were not prosecuted.

He then studied at Limerick Institute of Technology with rugby union player Jerry Flannery. After graduating in 2002 with a degree in Marketing Management, McGarry worked for just over a year in advertising sales for a Galway Independent in Galway City.  Impact Media  In 2003 in joined forces with Tom Lynskey and founded Impact Media. The company grew and represented clients including Supermacs, Eircom and Radisson Hotels. Having grown the company to a 20-strong workforce, McGarry and Lynskey sold the business to Cork company H+A Marketing+PR in 2011.  JOE.IE  McGarry originally created JOE.ie in 2010, providing an online outlet for Irish males with an interest in areas like sport, tech, entertainment, motors and fashion. McGarry created Her.ie, a site that caters for Irish women in July 2012 and has achieved almost instant success, already attracting an audience of over 2.2 million unique visitors each month. In November 2019 McGarry announced that he was going to step away from executive involvement in the Irish business and he will focus instead on its business in the UK, where he launched with its Joe digital platform in 2015. He said he will work in conjunction with the existing management team in the UK. In May 2020 the joe.ie parent company went into examinership. In July 2020 it was bought out of administration by investment fund Greencastle Capital.

Morlock, C. Oellig (2009), CAMAG Bibliography Service 103, 5 High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) is an enhanced form of thin-layer chromatography (TLC). A number of enhancements can be made to the basic method of thin-layer chromatography to automate the different steps, to increase the resolution achieved, and to allow more accurate quantitative measurements. Automation is useful to overcome the uncertainty in droplet size and position when the sample is applied to the TLC plate by hand. One approach to automation has been the use of piezoelectric devices and inkjet printers for applying the sample. The spot capacity (analogous to peak capacity in HPLC) can be increased by developing the plate with two different solvents, using two-dimensional chromatography. The procedure begins with development of sample loaded plate with first solvent. After removing it, the plate is rotated 90¬∞ and developed with a second solvent.  Instrumentation  An example of an instrument for HPTLC is from CAMAG, a Switzerland based company. It provides automated sample application (loading), plate development, detection and documentation.

Vorovoro island is inhabited by the Mali tribe, a traditional Fijian tribe which also has villages nearby on both Mali Island and Vanua Levu. Vorovoro is home to Tui Mali (the Chief of the Mali Tribe) and his family, as well as the Vorovoro Cultural Centre. Between 2006 and 2011 the island was run by Tribewanted, a self-described \\"unique community tourism project\\".Tribewanted: Tribewanted During this time, the island and the project received extensive media coverage,Tribewanted: In the media including a five-part BBC documentary called Paradise or Bust.BBC - Press Office - BBC Two Winter/Spring 2008: Programmes M-S In 2012, the Mali community began a partnership with Bridge the Gap, a non-governmental organization that assists communities with sustainable community development. Bridge the Gap partners with Vorovoro in the planning and execution of Vorovoro's community development goals and to bolster Vororovo's global outreach opportunities while maintaining the integrity of the tribe's rich cultural heritage and working to protect the local natural environment. The partnership uses a multipronged approach for reaching these development goals. This approach includes business mentorship programs, sustainable agricultural training, infrastructure support, and networking with various international organizations. However, the most unique approach may be the formation of a Fijian-run eco-tourism business; facing pressures to develop Vorovoro island into a profitable tourism enterprise owned and managed by foreign investors, Vorovoro leadership had wanted a way to retain control of their traditional community home. By opening their home to a limited number of (predominately student) visitors each year, Vorovoro has been able to take control of tourism on their land while creating a source of income for the Mali community. In collaboration with Bridge the Gap, Vorovoro has formed a partnership with the Auburn University College of Human Sciences to develop and offer a unique, accredited study abroad program focused on cultural immersion, environmental awareness, and global sustainability. During the study abroad program, students live on Vorovoro while engaging with the local culture and studying various methods of community development. In order to build on the increasing momentum that the Auburn University partnership has had on Vorovoro's development, Bridge the Gap has begun to expand with Arizona State University and other major universities. Vorovoro plans to continue to expand their tourism business to other interested universities as well as through worldschooling family programs and dive trips. After Bridge the Gap intern (Sibley Barnette) studied abroad on Vorovoro with Auburn University, she brought her father, Dave Barnette, to the island in 2018 to gain the unique experience that Vorovoro has to offer. This visit resulted in Dave writing an article for the Washington Post, \\"Too much seawater, not enough drinking water: Fiji's fight to withstand climate change.\\" The article has helped to shed light on Vorovoro and has served as a spark for future tourism development.

It is recognized as an appellation of origin related to the six crus of Cognac, but Fine Champagne is not a cru itself. Among the major cognac houses, R√©my Martin is a specialist in this type of production, while other houses such as Braastad, De Luze, Hine and Tiffon all produce and sell Fine Champagne cognacs.  Legal notice  According to the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC - National inter-professional cognac office), cognac is the result of blending mature eaux-de-vie from different crus, but this is not mandatory. If a cru is mentioned on the label, this means that 100% of the eaux-de-vie which make up that cognac come from that cru. The Appellation Cognac Fine Champagne Contr√¥l√©e (Cognac Fine Champagne registered designation of origin) is ascribed to cognac of which the eaux-de- vie are exclusive to Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne, with a minimum of 50% Grande Champagne.  Origin and history  During the 19th century, Charentais geologist Henri Coquand devoted himself to numerous studies on the nature of cognac-producing soil, and his studies resulted in the official delimitation of the different crus. The origin of Cognac Fine Champagne appear to precede Coquand‚Äôs research. The name was used by Paul-Emile R√©my Martin, the owner of the R√©my Martin cognac house, who blended the Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne crus.Dictionnaire biographique des Charentais [Charentais biographical dictionary], Editions Le Cro√Æt Vif [The Living Growth], 2005, p. 1107. Today, R√©my Martin states 1848 as the birth of their company's first Fine Champagne cognac.Fine Champagne origins A register in their archives proves this name was used from 1820, and the first legal texts protecting the places' names date back to 1824.Gilles Bernard, Cognac: A la conqu√™te du monde, Presses Universitaires de Bordeaux [Conquering the world, Bordeaux university press] 2011, p. 117, 118 In 1927, R√©my Martin created VSOP Fine Champagne and since 1948, every cognac from R√©my Martin has the Cognac Fine Champagne designation.  Production and special features  The Cognac Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e is divided into six crus corresponding to the growing areas called Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies, Fins Bois, Bons Bois and Bois Ordinaires. The crus' delimitation, according to geological and sampling criteria of the eau-de-vies, was carried out during the 19th century, registered in 1909 and integrated in the designation decree in 1938. Fine Champagne is produced from eau-de-vies from two crus (Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne) which have very chalky soil. This terroir produces very aromatic eau-de-vies, slow ripening, with a great ageing potential. Petite Champagne is known for its cognacs' potency, while Grande Champagne is known for its cognacs' finesse. The two main crus' soil, soft and chalky from the Cretaceous period, has a great capacity to retain water which ensures a regular supply to the vine. The level of organic material is significant and the top soil reflects the light encouraging the vine to thrive. The Fine Champagne cognac's plant material is mostly the Ugni Blanc vine; the cognac designation decree also includes the Folle Blanche and Colombard vines. The Ugni Blanc vine, also called Trebbanio, originates from Italy, it is known for its finesse, vivacity and acidity which is ideal for distillation. A late budding variety, the Ugni Blanc is less susceptible to late frosts. It is also found in Armagnac, the Languedoc, Corsica, Italy and Bulgaria. Out of the 75,000 hectares in the Cognac appellation area, Grande Champagne has 13,800 hectares and Petite Champagne has 16,200 hectares. During the 1960s, l'Alliance Fine Champagne (The Fine Champagne Alliance) was started by Andr√© H√©riard Dubreuil of R√©my Martin. This cooperative brings together a thousand wine growers from Petite Champagne and Grande Champagne.  The Fine Champagne Cognac Houses  Cognac houses that produce and sell Fine Champagne are: * A.

It is found at lower levels in humid forest in the Guianas, far eastern Venezuela (with Guyana), and north-eastern Brazil (north of the Amazon River and east of the lower Negro River and the Branco River). Taxonomy The French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon described the Guianan warbling antbird in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux in 1779. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Buffon did not include a scientific name with his description but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Formicarius cantatar in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The specific name is from the Latin cantator \\"a singer\\". The present genus Hypocnemis was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1847. The Imeri, Peruvian, yellow-breasted, Rondonia and Spix's warbling antbird were all formerly treated as subspecies of the Guianan warbling antbird. A study published in 2007 found that there were significant vocal differences as well a small plumage differences between the taxa and they are now all treated as separate species. As presently defined, the Guianan warbling antbird is monotypic, although the subspecies notaea sometimes has been recognized. Its conservation status has been assessed as near threatened.

Career The son of former sekiwake Oginohana Masaaki, he joined Dewanoumi stable in March 1987, where his father worked as a coach, and four years after his elder brother Oginohana Akikazu had also joined the stable. The \\"Ogi\\" character in his shikona was taken from Ogi, Saga where his father was born. Initially wrestling under his own surname of Koiwai, he switched to Oginoshu in 1989 and then Oginishiki in 1990.

Major landmarks and attractions include South Bank Parklands, the Queensland Cultural Centre (including the Queensland Museum, Queensland Art Gallery, Gallery of Modern Art, Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland), City Hall, the Story Bridge, the City Botanic Gardens and Parliament of Queensland, the Howard Smith Wharves, ANZAC Square, Fortitude Valley (including James Street and Chinatown), West End, the Teneriffe woolstores precinct, Roma Street Parkland, New Farm Park (including the Brisbane Powerhouse), St John's Cathedral, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Botanic Gardens, the D'Aguilar Range and National Park, the Brisbane River and its Riverwalk network, as well as Moreton Bay (including Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands, and coastal suburbs such as Shorncliffe, Wynnum and those on the Redcliffe Peninsula). City landmarks The Story Bridge =Story Bridge= The Story Bridge is a Brisbane icon, designed by Dr. John Bradfield, designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It spans Petrie Bight from Kangaroo Point to Fortitude Valley and totals meters in length. Tourist groups run the Story Bridge Adventure Climb as well as the Abseil Climb, which provides daylight, twilight, and night tours. Brisbane City Hall Kangaroo Point Cliffs lit at night =Brisbane City Hall= Brisbane's most famous landmark is Australia's largest and grandest city hall.

The oldest such group in the United States is The Civil War Round Table of Chicago, which was founded in 1941 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The second and perhaps third oldest are the Civil War Round Table of Milwaukee (founded in 1947) and the Civil War Round Table of Atlanta (founded in 1949). There are hundreds of such organizations throughout the U.S., with some in other countries as well. There is no national organization to coordinate and publicize the activities of the individual roundtables, although most follow a similar format of holding a monthly meeting (some include a dinner on site or at a nearby restaurant) to make announcements about local Civil War history-related events and to host a presentation by a guest speaker (usually a scholar, professor, author or artist, park ranger, battlefield preservationist, reenactor, or other expert). The meetings might also feature raffles, book signings, door prizes, auctions, fund raisers, and similar activities. Some CWRTs sponsor battlefield preservation events, battle walks, excursions, tours, and other \\"sanctioned\\" events. Many roundtables charge an annual membership fee to help defray expenses, and others cover costs by charging for individual dinner meetings or presentations. Several smaller CWRT groups do not charge any set fees, but instead \\"pass the hat.\\" Many are IRS 501(c)(3) entities and accept donations or contributions that are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Since 2004, Matthew Borowick has been writing a column in the Civil War News about round tables.

In 2010, he published The Civil War Round Table Handbook, a compilation of those columns. Mr. Borowick as well as Walter Rueckel and Mike Powell of the Brunswick CWRT, John Bamberl of the Scottsdale CWRT, and Michael Movius of the Puget Sound CWRT, have hosted conferences attended by representatives from various roundtables based throughout the U.S. and Canada to discuss methods to increase collaboration among roundtables and related groups.

AD 430) was a mid-5th century King of Powys. Cadell appears to have been driven out of his father Cadeyrn's kingdom by Irish pirates during the chaos of the Saxon insurrection in Southern Britain. He hid himself amongst the peasants of Powys and became a servant of the Irish chieftain, Benlli, hoping, one day, to find an opportunity to retrieve his inheritance. His chance arose when St. Germanus of Auxerre visited Britain, probably for the second time in AD 447, to combat Pelagian views (opposition to the new dogma of Original Sin). Travelling into the Midlands, St. Germanus heard of the pagan Irish stronghold and, with his many followers, laid siege to the Powysian capital. Cadell showed them what modest hospitality he could in his rural hovel outside the city walls. Germanus eventually had a dreadful premonition and advised Cadell to remove all his friends from within the city walls. That night, the Royal palace was struck by lightning. The resulting fire spread quickly and all within the city were burnt alive. The young Cadell was thus restored to his throne. It is unclear where the kingdom's capital was at the time; tradition suggests the Clwydian hillfort Foel Fenlli, the 'Hill of Benlli', while archaeological evidence points to Caer Guricon (Wroxeter, Shropshire). The latter was occupied well into the 6th century, and an ancient memorial stone bearing the Irish name Cunorix has been discovered here. Cadell married Gwelfyl, one of the many daughters of King Brychan Brycheiniog. They had a number of children including his heir, Cyngen Glodrydd, and Tegid, the father of Gwynllyw; and possibly Gwynfyr Frych, Ystradwel and Ddewer. Cadell apparently died quite young.

First introduced by the Exin Lines Brothers in 1968 in Barcelona, Spain, this plastic block toy was designed for the construction of castle-like-buildings. The company has most recently produced Castle lines toys for the Shrek movie franchise and others. The EXIN Castillos blocks are of a peg-and-socket design similar to Lego, though with larger pegs, and the most common size being a 1x2 design (whereas 2x4 is the most common Lego size). The blocks are usually a mottled light tan color, intended to resemble stone, although a few sets were produced using pale blue blocks instead, for a \\"fantasy\\" theme. Beyond the standard blocks, additional specialized pieces in EXIN sets include arched top pieces for windows and doors, smooth caps to create battlements, single-piece tower tops and turret roofs to attach to those, wall-mounted torches and braziers, etc. The existence of these specialized pieces made the EXIN blocks especially suitable for their particular role of building castles in the early 1970s, before Lego had anything similar. The later introduction of more specialized Lego sets in the late 1980s and onwards, which were equally well suited for such a task, yet still interoperable with generic Lego, gave increased competition to EXIN.

They were located at Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Quetta, Mhow, Poona, Meerut, Lucknow, Secunderabad and Rangoon. The whole corps was re-organized on command basis five companies of the IHC were created in 1932. No 1 Company was at Rawalpindi, No 2 Company at Lucknow, No 3 Company at Poona, No 4 Company at Quetta and No 5 Company at Rangoon. The World War II was responsible for rapid developments. The idea of having a homogeneous corps by amalgamating IMS, IMD gradually took shape and Indian Army Medical Corps (IAMC) came into being on 03 Apr 1943. The medical institutions of the IAMC were concentrated in the areas, which were to subsequently become Pakistan. The British Raj in India had left its legacies in the territory, which later became Pakistan. The bulk of the troops of the British Indian Army was recruited from the areas, which became Pakistan. The threats of the Russian empire and a fear of Afghans and Central Asians overrunning the Indian territory had made the British rulers wary of the northwestern borders across the Hindu Kush mountains. The army was deployed at large scale. Rawalpindi was the pivotal military base, from where they controlled the command, logistics and services provided to those troops. It was the Headquarters, Northern Command India. Therefore, the city had many offices and institutes located there. Armed Forces Medical Services were one of the most organized and highly developed support services in the British Indian Army. The members of the medical profession served in the IMS (Indian Medical Services), with pride and dignity. The senior jobs in civil medical services were also reserved for the medical professionals of the army. The troops of British Indian Army were deployed over an extensive area. They were exposed to the tropical climate. They were present in the heights of Chitral in the north-west to Burma in the east. The major bulk of their health related problems were of tropical infections and parasitic infestation. The medical services were committed for the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. The diagnosis of these diseases was based upon the rudimentary laboratory service. The need for pathology services was, therefore, recognized even in those days. A well organized and up to the mark pathology organization was established. That was the time when experienced pathologists, especially, those dealing with the tropical pathology, served in IMS. As we mentioned earlier, Rawalpindi was the headquarters of the northern Command of the India. Combined Military Hospital (CMH) and Military Hospital (MH) were the largest and the most well-equipped hospitals in this area at that time. Alongside these major hospitals and field medical services, a pathology laboratory, the Command Laboratory, Northern Command, was established. This was indeed the best Armed Forces laboratory, which the newly independent Pakistan inherited from the British India in 1947. After 1947 Lt Col Sarup Narayan was the first Commanding Officer of this laboratory, at the time of independence. He originally belonged to Rawalpindi area and had happily opted to stay and serve in Pakistan. However, due to obvious reasons, he felt it difficult to continue living in Pakistan and he had to migrate to India for personal reasons. He was a very brilliant, hardworking and well mannered pathologist. He ultimately rose to the rank of Lt General in the Indian Army Medical Corps and was appointed as the Director of Medical Services (Research). After independence, Pakistan Army Medical Corps (AMC) was established from the fragmented available resources (monetary as well as personnel). Two senior IMS officers, Lt Gen S.M.A. Faruki and Lt Gen Wajid Ali Khan Burki, played a key role in early formative years of AMC. Shortly afterwards the Command Lab. at Rawalpindi was raised to the status of the Central Military Pathological Laboratory (CMPL). This cumbersome name was a legacy of the mother unit of the same name at Poona (India). The CMPL had started its existence in a small premises as a Central Diagnostic and Reference Laboratory for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Apart from being a diagnostic laboratory, it was also given the task of production of some reagents and bio-products. This was the modest beginning and the services were gradually evolved into a comprehensive institute, which is now called as Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). It had very basic equipment, limited infrastructure and the tests used were conventional and very basic ones. Initially, the laboratory had a dearth of trained manpower. A limited number of medical officers serving in the Indian Army had been trained as pathologists during the Second World War. Even a fewer out of them were inherited by the Pakistan Army; none of these pathologists held postgraduate qualifications. A sound and strong pathology service was established by a very dedicated and diligent physician, Colonel (later Maj Gen) M Akram, who was appointed as Commandant of CMPL in October 1947. He possessed a membership of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (MRCPE) and also held diplomas in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (DTM&H;), and Public Health (DPH), from London. In his capacity of an eminent physician, he had a wide experience of the health problems of the region. During his difficult task of laying the foundations of sound pathology, he had to work very hard. Col Akram was well known for his virtues of simplicity, clarity of mind, purity of soul, dedication to the duty, love for Pakistan and strict observance of Islam as a code of life. He also had the responsibility of organizing and initiating training of pathologists and technicians. The spirit of dedication, simple minded sincerity to scientific pursuits, brotherly and homely atmosphere in the institution and above all the habit of hard work was created by him, in the staff. He encouraged and supported three young pathologists, to obtain their postgraduate qualifications from London. They were Major (later Maj Gen) M Iqbal Chaudri (DCP), Major (later Colonel) M Akram (DCP) and Major (later Col) SMH Bokhari (Dip Bact and DTM&H;). After a few years, Colonel Akram was due for his promotion and left CMPL to become a Brigadier and left the command of the laboratory. He later became Director of Medical Services (DMS) of Pakistan Army, in the rank of Maj Gen. Major Manzoor Ahmed Chaudhry was the senior most pathologists at that time and was posted to command the CMPL. He was a graded pathologist trained at Poona (India), during the Second World War and, had served in the Burmese theatre of war. After the independence, he had obtained DTM&H; from London. Two very brilliant pathologists, Major (now Major General Retd) MI Burney and Major (Late Colonel) SMH Bokhari made his team of experts. That was the time when the pathology services had expanded tremendously. The need to have an infrastructures and the resources; both in terms of trained personnel and gadgetry were felt. Initially, the emphasis was laid upon have a sizable group of trained pathologists. Therefore, structures training programmes, at postgraduate level, for pathologists were started, at regular basis. To cope with the technical side, an extensive programme for the training of laboratory technicians was also started, simultaneously. The induction of men with expertise led to a revolutionary improvement in the extent and quality of the diagnostic laboratory services in the Pakistan Army. A period of enthusiasm and dedication started. The CMPL, as an army unit was commanded 'by Lt Col Muhammad Said, for a short duration. He was once again replaced by then Lt Col Manzoor Ahmed Chaudhry who by then had a background of heading the unit. Once the tradition is set, a smooth functioning can be ensured by a good command and control. CMPL to AFIP-1957 It was with the advice received in the form of a letter from Major Syed Azhar Ahmad that the CMPL was designated as Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) on 20 August 1957. He was then being trained at AFIP Washington. As the CMPL was to be transformed to an institute of excellence, the infrastructure needed to be developed and the facilities enhanced. The existing working and administrative space had by then become too crowded and the quality work needed smooth mobility of the action. Therefore, more room was needed and a double-storey building was constructed which was later considered unsuitable for the work of the AFIP and was handed over to the newly created Armed Forces Medical College. It must be put on record that late Lt Gen W.A.Burki, was very keen to improve the scientific basis of AMC and was a moving force behind many projects of development. A new building was desperately needed for the institute. It needed finances, planning and supervision. It must not be forgotten at this stage that the finances were arranged by a very kind gesture of late Chaudhri Mohammad AH, then finance minister of the Federal Government. Chaudhri Mohammad Ali had to visit the AFlP quite frequently. During his visits, he too felt the need of an advanced diagnostic laboratory service and provided necessary financial support for the construction of the new building. He later became the Prime Minister of Pakistan and continued helping AFIP for long period of time. A large purpose built double-storey building was planned by Maj (later Col) SMH Bokahari, who took personal efforts in its design and construction. A new purpose-built building for AFIP was completed in 1958. Lt Col Noor Ahmed was appointed the Commanding Officer of AFIP, in September 1957. He was a very learned and experienced pathologist of that time. He had long served in the Indian Medical Department (IMD) of the Army and in the Indian Army Medical Corps. He was an excellent bench worker and a keen teacher, who himself had worked very hard and expected the same from others. He was highly disciplined, tough task master and took a keen interest in the lab work, improvement of the premises, postgraduate teaching and maintenance of a high quality work. During the tenure of Lt Col Noor Ahmed, a very well organised and systematic programme of academic activities and research was set up in this institute, on sound scientific basis. He was also responsible for raising the standards of (so far neglected) histopathology services in the Army. It was the fruit of his concerted efforts that the AFIP in Pakistan established close cordial links with AFIP Washington, D.C. and various American and British Universities. In 1959, during his Command, Armed Forces Tumour Registry was started. This was the beginning of the organised study of malignant tumours in Pakistan. The suggestion was once again made by Major (now Lt Gen Retired Syed Azhar Ahmed). When the locally available meager training resources of pathologists were exhausted, the matter of training of pathologists abroad was seriously taken, during his tenure. Consequently, Major (now Maj Gen Retd) M.I.Burney completed a one-year training course in Virology in Walter Reed Army Institute of USA. As he returned, the department of Virology was established on modern lines. The department was engaged in the study of Asian Flu effect on local population. He maintained his interest in parasitology and entomology. It was he, who discovered a new focus of Kala-Azar in Gilgit and Baltistan. A new species of sand fly flourishing in this cold climate was also discovered and named after Lt Col M.I. Burney as Phlebotomus Brunei. The newly constructed building of AFIP had to be furnished. So far, all the laboratory furniture including laboratory benches were imported from abroad. This was most probably the first time when it was manufactured locally, instead of being imported. Messrs Abdullah and Sons from Gujranwala accepted the task and they made all the furniture indigenous at a remarkably low price. Many such benched are still being used at AFIP. All the services like a high voltage electricity, water and gas were all supplied smoothly on a regular basis on these benches. The federal capital was shifted from Karachi to Rawalpindi, in 1958. The AFIP was the mainstay of the diagnostic laboratory services in that city. Therefore, the responsibilities of AFIP increased further. It was then supposed to look after the ministers and senior civil servants of the Federal Government of Pakistan ad their family members. Mr Mohammad Shoaib was then the Finance Minister. He used to attend AFIP for his regular check-up. He found the AFIP premises uncomfortable during the hot seasons. The building was closed and the newly inducted heavy gadgetry generated a lot of heat, in the close space. The working atmosphere was uncomfortable and it was a really tough task to work there. The patient reception area was extremely unpleasant. Mr Mohammad Shoaib shared the discomfort with other patients and he generously sanctioned a handsome amount for bringing changes. It was spent for the fixation of a modern central air conditioning plant for the building. It had an added advantage of the provision of a dust free environment. The constant temperature was needed for the fine functioning of many pieces of equipment and the conditions needed for the performance of sophisticated tests. During those days, the pressing demands of quality pathology service had compelled the AFIP to assume the role of a Central Reference Laboratory. It provided services for the Armed Forces, as well civil sector. The general population belonging to civil sector of this region, including many medical institutions in and around Rawalpindi benefited its expertise. This gave it new prestige and status. 1962 Colonel Noor Ahmad retired from his Army service and Lt Col Manzoor Ahmad Chaudri was called to take over the Command of this Institute, in August 1962 once again. A steady progress was maintained and some of the first generation automated laboratory equipment was introduced at that time. Major (Major General in Bangladesh Army) Mahmud ur Rahman Chaudhary worked in microbiology before he was sent to NIH, Islamabad. By then the department of virology was fully established. It was soon designated as National Centre for Viral Diseases. During this period, a proper animal house was also constructed and a Departmental of Experiment Pathology was established. It was used for animal experimentation and the production of reagents. The reagents produced there were provided to the pathology laboratories of the peripheral hospitals. It was always run without the hiring of veterinary personnel and high tech work. It was conventionally looked after by the officers of Virology department. Some sweepers were trained to feed and look after the animals. Gradually, the dependence on the use of animals had been declining, as more emphasis was laid upon the use of more sophisticated technology. 1970 In July 1970, Col (now Late Maj Gen) M.I.Burney took over as Commanding Officer of AFIP. He was known to be a dedicated bench worker, an efficient field work organizer and a diligent scientist. He had a very long association with AFIP by serving the AFIP for a quarter of a century in different positions. He had spent a lifetime in research and diagnostic facilities and with his becoming the Commandant, the tempo of scientific progress was increased. Many pieces of automated laboratory equipment were acquired and put to use for the first time during this period. He developed a dedicated team of workers and trained them in sophisticated technology. A state of art of Electron microscope was acquired for Virology department from Carl Zeiss, Obercocken, Germany. It was the first electron microscope ever installed in a diagnostic setup of Pakistan. The technology of immunoelctrophoresis, immunoprecipitaion in gel and fluorescent microscopy was introduced. In his days a well known histopathologist Dr Sughra Fatima Ahmed and a dedicated microbiologist Major (later Brig) S J Malik worked at AFIP. 1973 In August 1973 Col (now Late Maj Gen) M.I.Burney was seconded to the civil as Executive Director of the National Institute of Health, Pakistan and Lt Col (now Retd Lt Gen) Syed Azhar Ahmed was appointed as the Commandant of the Institute. His tenure was a period of continuing improvement and progress in every field. A major training programme was started and young officers were selected for higher training in Pakistan and abroad. The forum of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan was utilized for this purpose and within few years a large number of candidates qualified for FCPS in pathology. To help the pathologists who fund the FCPS difficult at that time to do were helped by M.Phil training programme, which was started in 1982 for the first time. Since-then a large number of Armed Forces pathologists as well as civilian doctors availed AFIP facilities for their research for M.Phil thesis. A large number of very brilliant young officers was also sent for training abroad especially to UK and USA. By this action, he laid the foundations of future of sound basis of Virology, Immunology, Histopathology, Microbiology, Chemical Pathology and Nuclear Medicine. Major (Now Lt Gen Karamat Ahmad Karamat, HI(M) in July 1973 as a Microbiologist with dip Bact (London) and MRC Path (London) and remained in the team of Lt Gen Syed Azhed Ahmed till May 1981. A very important decision at this time was to establish a Nuclear Medical Centre as a part of AFIP. A new building was constructed for this purpose in a record period of eight and a half months. Simultaneously the required equipment was purchased, the officers and staff were selected and trained and within a year, the centre was made functional. Further training of these officers was arranged in UK and two of item obtained their master's degree in nuclear medicine from the London University. The premises of the institute were also expanded and a special emphasis was laid upon the improvement of facilities for the visiting patients and the staff. In 1983 a completely new block was designed and constructed for patient's reception. It contained different waiting rooms for officers, other ranks, families and the civilian patients. A canteen block was completed in 1984. An entirely new block in the name of Advanced Diagnostic and Research Centre (ADRC) was also planned in 1983. It was approved in early 1984 and, in a phased programme; the whole project was completed in 1988. This provided of additional laboratory space in a modern building with adequate training and research facilities. Subsequently, the departments of Haematology as well as Chemical pathology were housed in that building. Some space was subsequently utilized there for Immunology as well as Molecular biology. 1988 In 1988, Lt Gen Syed Azhar Ahmed left AFIP to become the Executive Director of national Institute of Health. The new Commandant of AFIP was Brigadier (now Maj Gen) Manzoor Ahmad. Maj Gen Manzoor Ahmed has been a very active participant in the progress and development of AFIP for over thirty years. He had a sound background of extensive training in Histopathology from the best centre of USA. He had been previously posted to PNS Shifa, Karachi. There he was involved in teaching of the postgraduate level at newly established Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. He had been pioneer of the research in medical sciences with the collaboration of Dr Sarwar Jehan Zuberi and Prof Naeem Aon Jaaaferi. He was a dedicated professional and a great trainer and teacher. He concentrated his efforts in making best use of the available resources raising the standards of the institute to an international level. He established the full-fledged departments of virology and immunology and encouraged the expansion of the unit. During his tenure, many hardworking officers joined the unit. His team included the professional stalwarts like a great Haematologist Brig Mohammad Saleem and a renowned Microbiologist, Brig Abdul Hannan. The trained pathologists returned from abroad. They were Captain (now Major General) Farooq Ahmad Khan after obtaining PhD from London, Major (now Brigadier) Waheed Uz Zaman Tariq after obtaining his DpBact (Manchester) and MRCPath (London) in Virology and Maj (now Brigadier) Sajid Mushtaq who returned with MRCPath in Histopathology from London. His other team members consisted of Col (now Brigadier retired) Amir Hussain, Lt Col (now Major General retired) Masood Anwar, Wing Commander Iftikhar ul Hassan Abidi and Major (now Major General) Mohammad Amin Wiqar. During his days, emphasis was laid upon structured training, evening classes and seminars and conferences. The Lymphoma project which was already started, gave a new vigour and activity as the funds were diverted to hire the services of many more doctors, technical and secretarial staff. The institute was asked by other societies like Pakistan Society of gastroenterology and GI Endoscopy to organize the international conference. A faculty of overseas experts was established. Internationally renowned experts like Prof Maurice Longson (of Manchester University), Prof JE Banatavala of St Thomas‚Äô Hospital, London and Prof Morag C Timbury, Director Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, London visited and delivered the lectures in the institute. The AFIP revived its ties with the Royal College of Pathologist, London. The officers were encouraged to attained international conferences and present their papers. Much emphasis was also diverted towards paper writing and compilation of the professional books and booklets. 1992 Maj Gen Manzoor Ahmad was the first pathologist, who was appointed as the Surgeon General Pakistan Army and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, in 1992. Maj General Iftikhar Ahmad Malik was appointed the Commandant of AFIP. He had long worked as a pathologist. He had been in Saudi Arabia and then Professor of Pathology at Army Medical College Rawalpindi. He was also Chairman Pakistan Medical Research Council and actively involved in the activities of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan. He brought new dimension to Pathology training and practice. He was disciplined, to the point and expected a high standard of work and tough training. The institute was open for long hours. The research papers were written in great number and work was expanded to different fields. His tenure brought meticulousness and diligence in the unit. The major change was brought in the Virology department. The newly constructed structure of the building was fully changed and converted into a purpose built laboratory. The office space was created. The serum bank area, Viral serodiagnosis lab, Molecular Biology laboratory and laboratory sterilization areas were added. The department has a new shape. The expansion of the space led to mobility and freedom of work and increased the efficiency. The new gadgets, computers, telephonic connections and working areas were added in the department. During his tenure, the freedom of thoughts, acceptance of new ideas and an improvisation remained the priorities. The quick decision were made and the sudden expansion in the quality work was absorbed. The working of the LIMS was reviewed and innovations were introduced into it. The plan for the Forensic Lab was followed and the work started on it. After a long time the officers were encouraged to receive training from abroad and attend the conferences and make presentations. During his tenure, the earthquake struck the north of Pakistan and the Azad Kashmir. All laboratories and pathology service had disappeared there. He and his team played a vital role in the revival of the service, by offering the equipment, manpower and the resources from the institute. In a very little time, the services were running efficiently and smoothly. The names of Lt Col SMH Bokhari, Maj Gen Abdul Hannan, Maj Fatima Sughra Ahmad, Maj Gen Karamat Ahmad karamat, Brig Tariq Butt, Brig Waheed Uz Zaman Tariq, Brig Sajid Mushtaq, Brig Mohammad Ayyub, Brig Tahir Aziz Ahmad and Brig Sajjad Hussain Mirza will always be remembered in its history. They were all British trained pathologists of great international fame and have injected a new tradition of rational thinking and intellectual pursuits. <3 List of commandants *Lt Col Sarup Narayan *Col Mohammad Akram *Lt Col Mohammad Said *Lt Col Noor Ahmad *Col Manzoor Ahmad Chaudhri *Col M I Burney *Maj Gen Syed Azhar Ahmed *Lt Gen Manzoor Ahmad *Maj Gen Iftikhar Ahmad Malik (Late) *Maj Gen Mohammad Saleem *Maj Gen Muhammad Muzaffar *Lt Gen Karamat Ahmad Karamat *Brig Zahur-ur Rahman *Maj Gen Masood Anwar *Maj Gen Mohammad Amin Wiqar *Maj Gen Farooq Ahmad Khan *Maj Gen Muhammad Ayyub *Maj Gen Pervez Ahmed HI(M) *Maj Gen Muhammad Tahir Khadim (current) Category:Rawalpindi District Category:Military medical facilities in Pakistan ","title":"Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Rawalpindi"},{"id":"18161865","text":"Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) refers to hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period. The term was initially coined to refer to anatomically modern Homo sapiens from sites near Balangoda that were responsible for the island's Mesolithic 'Balangoda Culture'. The earliest evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated skeletal remains to 30,000 BP, which is also the earliest reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is the earliest record of such stone tools. Balangoda Man is estimated to have had thick skulls, prominent supraorbital ridges, depressed noses, heavy jaws, short necks and conspicuously large teeth. Metrical and morphometric features of skeletal fragments extracted from cave sites that were occupied during different periods have indicated a rare biological affinity over a time frame of roughly 16,000 years, and the likelihood of a partial biological continuum to the present-day Vedda indigenous people. Origin Rama's Bridge, pictured heading across the Palk Strait into India (top right), is a remnant of a recurring land bridge that first appeared at least 500,000 BP. Archeological data from the Late Pleistocene in South Asia is vital for our understanding of the evolution of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the continental shelf shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused the continental shelf to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100 km wide and 50 km long. From an analysis of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in the possibility that there were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and southeast of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids. From South Asia in general, there is secure evidence of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning. Sri Lankan skeletal and cultural discoveries Compared to the earlier Sri Lankan fossils, the island's fossil records from around 40,000 BP onwards are much more complete. Excavated fossils of skeletal and cultural remains from this period provide the earliest records of anatomically modern Homo sapiens in South Asia, and some of the earliest evidence for the use of a specific type of stone tool. The Fa Hien Cave in the Kalutara district in Sri Lanka, one of the largest caves on the island, has yielded some of the earliest such fossils. Radiometric dating from excavated charcoal samples indicated that the cave was occupied from 34,000 to 5,400 BP, a period that was found to be consistent with the occupational levels of some other caves on the island. Dates from cultural sequences at the cave suggested a slightly earlier settlement from 38,000 BP. The oldest skeletal remains unearthed from Fa Hien Cave were that of a child with an associated radiocarbon dating of 30,000 BP. Caves in Batadomba lena, 460 m above sea level in the foothills of Sri Pada (Adam's Peak), have also yielded several important ancient remains. The first excavation of the cave floor in the late 1930s unearthed skeletal fragments of a child and several adults. Excavations in 1981 yielded more complete human skeletons from the sixth stratum (a layer of internally consistent sedimentary soil or rock) which were radiocarbon dated from associated charcoal samples to 16,000 BP. Excavations of the seventh stratum in the following year produced further human remains along with charcoal and 17 geometric microliths, i.e. 1‚Äì4 cm long triangular, trapezoid or lunate stone tools made of flint or chert that form, among other artifacts, the end points of hunting weapons such as spears and arrows. Radiometric tests on the charcoal placed the tools to around 28,500 BP. Along with some sites in Africa that have also revealed geometric microliths from contexts earlier than 27,000 BP, those recovered from caves in Beli lena in Kitulgala and Batadomba lena, and from two coastal sites in Bundala have the earliest dates for geometric microliths in the world. The earliest date for the use of microlithic technology in India of 24,500 BP, in the Patne site in Maharashtra, only slightly postdates the first appearance in Sri Lanka. Such early evidence of microlithic industries in various sites in South Asia supports the view that at least some of these industries emerged regionally, perhaps to deal with challenging climatic, social or demographic conditions, rather than being brought in from elsewhere. In Europe, the earliest dates for microliths seem to start from around 12,000 BP, though there does appear to be a trend towards microlithic blade production from 20,000 BP. Mesolithic sites in the Sabaragamuva and Uva provinces in Sri Lanka confirmed that microlithic technology continued on the island, albeit at a lower frequency, until the onset of the historical period, traditionally the 6th century BC. Cultural sequences at rock shelters showed that microliths were gradually replaced by other types of tools including grinding stones, pestles, mortars, and pitted hammers-stones towards the late Pleistocene, specifically 13,000-14,000 BP. Other sites that have revealed ancient human skeletal fragments are the Beli lena cave and Bellanbandi Palassa in the Ratnapura district. Carbon samples corresponding to the fragments were dated to respectively 12,000 BP for the former site and 6,500 BP for the latter, suggesting that the island may have been relatively continuously occupied during this time frame. = Physical traits and cultural practices = Certain samples of Balangoda Man were estimated to be 174 cm tall for males and 166 cm tall for females, a significantly higher figure than modern day Sri Lankan populations. They also had thick skull-bones, prominent supraorbital ridges, depressed noses, heavy jaws, short necks and conspicuously large teeth. Apart from the microliths, hand-axes from Meso-Neolithic times were discovered at Bellanbandi Palassa, which were manufactured from slabs extracted from the leg bones of elephants, and also daggers or celts made from sambar antler. From the same period, this and other sites have also yielded evidence of widespread use of ochre, domesticated dogs, differentiated use of space, inferred burials, and the strong use of fire. World's End\\") in the Horton Plains National Park Other cultural discoveries of interest from the meso-neolothic period included articles of personal ornamentation and animals utilised as food, e.g. fish bones, seashell-based beads and shell pendants, shark vertebra beads, lagoon shells, molluscan remains, carbonised wild banana, breadfruit epicarps, and polished bone tools. The frequency at which the marine shells, shark teeth and shark beads occurred at the different cave sites suggested that the cave dwellers likely had direct contact with the coast around 40 km away; Beli lena also showed signs that salt had been brought back from the coast. The microlithic tradition appears to have been contemporaneous with high mobility, the use of rainforest resources and adaptation to changing climate and environment. The discovery of geometric microliths at Horton Plains, located on the southern plateau of the central highlands of Sri Lanka, suggests that the area was visited by prehistoric humans from the Mesolithic period. One possible interpretation is that in their annual cycle of foraging for food, prehistoric hunter-gatherers that lived in lowland rock-shelters periodically visited the Horton Plains for hunting‚Äîpossibly wild cattle, sambur and deer‚Äîand gathering foods such as wild cereals. While it was likely used as a temporary camp-site, Horton Plains does not appear to have been used for more permanent settlement. From the late Pleistocene and Holocene periods there is evidence for the use of several lowland rainforest plant resources including wild breadfruit and banana, and canarium nuts. The transition from hunter- foraging to food production with domesticated cereals and other plants seems to have begun in some tropical regions at the beginning of the Holocene. Until then, humans probably exploited the Horton Plains wetland, grassland and rainforest resources using slash-and-burn techniques, and facilitated the growth of rice fields. Link with indigenous people Like the prehistoric people of the island, historical sources describe the aboriginal people of Sri Lanka‚Äîthe Veddas‚Äîas hunter-gatherers, who inhabited natural caves and traded their game and honey for metal-based arrow and spear points from neighbouring village populations. These villagers were predominantly descendants of populations from the Middle East, Europe and the Indian mainland who during different periods were en route along seaways or arrived from India. Over the years, while some Veddas remained in caves, others either assimilated with the neighbouring villagers or joined military campaigns led by the Kandyan kings during the Kingdom of Kandy from the late 15th century to the early 19th. While the Vedda title has also been adopted by certain present-day farming populations in Sri Lanka, it remains unclear whether they have any roots in the Vedda populations characterised by hunting and foraging. Metrical and morphometric features of the analysable skeletal remains from the Sri Lankan caves have revealed similar anatomical attributes, signalling the likelihood of a biological continuum from the prehistoric hunter-gatherers of the island to the Veddas, and a close biological affinity over a period of roughly 16,000 years. This is not surprising given the relative geographical isolation of the island until the fifth century BC when settlers arrived from the Indian mainland. Veddas are therefore relevant to the question of the degree of relative isolation of ancient and modern Homo sapiens in Sri Lanka from populations of southern India. Veddas have relatively smaller statures, significantly more robust skulls, dental differences, including somewhat larger molar crown sizes, and greater cranial diversity than populations of southern India. While some of these features are also distinct from the Sinhalese and Tamil co-inhabitants of the island, and from Veddas with Portuguese, Dutch or British ancestry, some claim that certain other features including genetic traits do appear among present-day Sri Lankans, suggesting that their ancestry traces back to some of the earliest human settlers on the island. A recent genetic study has found indigenous Vedda people to probably be earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka.Mitochondrial DNA history of Sri Lankan ethnic people: their relations within the island and with the Indian subcontinental populations.

It is constructed of 5.5 tons of wood and is 12 metres (39 feet) high. It depicts a giant chair with a broken leg and stands across the street from the Palace of Nations, in Geneva. It symbolises opposition to land mines and cluster bombs, and acts as a reminder to politicians and others visiting Geneva.  History  Broken Chair is an original project of Paul Vermeulen, co-founder and director of Handicap International Suisse. In October 1996 he commissioned from the artist a monumental chair of over 10 meters high, with a torn-off leg, to be installed on the Place des Nations. The objective was to get the largest possible number of States to sign the Ottawa Treaty on landmines in December 1997. The sculpture was erected by Handicap International in front of the main entrance to the Palais des Nations in Geneva on the 18th of August 1997, where it was intended to remain for three months, until the signing of the Ottawa Treaty in December 1997 in Ottawa. Following ratification by 40 countries, the Treaty became effective as an instrument of international law on 1 March 1999. The failure of significant countries to sign the Treaty and the strong public support for the sculpture caused it to be left in place until 2005, when it was removed to allow extensive remodelling of the Place des Nations. After completion of the work, it was reinstalled in the same place in front of the United Nations Office at Geneva on 26 February 2007. The reinstallation of Broken Chair in February 2007 was officially dedicated by Handicap International to support the signature of an international treaty on a ban on Cluster Bombs (Convention on Cluster Munitions), which was signed in Oslo in December 2008. The work was the property of the sculptor until 2004, when he transferred ownership to Handicap International.

Evidence of SR 35's existence can be found in Hardee County, Florida along County Roads 35A & 35B in Coker, Wauchula, and Zolfo Springs. Polk County's evidence of SR 35's existence can be found with County Road 35A between Lakeland and Providence, and in Pasco County, Florida, evidence of SR 35's existence can be found with County Road 35 Alternate between Branchborough and Dade City. According to some maps, County Road 41 Alternate (Spring Valley Road) was previously known as CR 35B, and was extended to US 98-301 north of Dade City along Frazee Hill Road. SR 35 becomes CR 35 in Silver Springs, Florida. Within Belleview, the road is briefly co-signed with US 27-441 (SR 25-500) then turns right at the eastern terminus of CR 484, where it is signed independently along Southeast Hames Road, and then turns left again at Baseline Road, where it curves north as it leaves the city. While State Road 35 terminates at State Road 40 near the site of the former Wild Waters water park in Silver Springs, the road continues northward as County Road 35 north towards its terminus at State Road 326.

They are owned by Centro Biblico of NJ, Inc. and offer a Spanish-language Christian format. Until August 17, 2011, They offered an oldies music format with songs from the 1960s and 1970s along with a small number of oldies from 1955 to 1964 and a small number of hits from the 1980s. They were a full-time affiliate of Scott Shannon's True Oldies Channel from ABC Radio. The station was owned by Clear Channel Communications from 2001 until 2011. From the station's 1953 sign-on until July 1, 2008, the radio station was known as WNNJ. History The station was known as WNNJ when it signed on as a daytimer in 1953 and had a full service middle of the road music and news format. The station was owned by Simpson Wolfe, incorporated as Sussex County Broadcasters. In 1961, Wolfe got the construction permit for 103.7 FM. That Station, WNNJ-FM signed on in 1962 and broke away as WIXL in the mid-1960s. By 1971, 1360 WNNJ would evolve into an adult contemporary music format with a slight lean on Top 40 music. The station was also news intensive. WNNJ was also allowed to sign on at 6:00 a.m. even if it stayed dark after because they had a pre sunrise authorization. In the Fall of 1978, WNNJ modified their music to more of a Top 40 format adding more rock music. In 1979, Group M Communications headed by Marvin Strauzer & Mike Levine purchased WNNJ and WIXL. WNNJ stayed with top 40 until October 1981, when they evolved back into an Adult Contemporary format and in November 1981 into Adult Standards format, mixing in some Adult Contemporary hits. The amounts of adult contemporary hits varied from more than half to only a couple an hour depending upon the time of day and who was on the air. The station tried to be more consistent by the early summer playing very limited contemporary songs but by the late summer the station began to lean Adult Contemporary again. In the Fall of 1982 though the station abruptly dropped virtually the baby boomer pop and became a Big Band and Standards station only playing music from the '30s to the '50s, with a few exceptions by Sinatra-type artists. By the Spring of 1983 the station evolved back to a Middle Of The Road format blending standards and soft AC cuts. That fall, the station moved into an easy listening leaning format playing almost no big bands but only small amounts of adult contemporary cuts. The station was now leaning toward artists like Frank Sinatra, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Nancy Wilson, Johnny Mathis, among others. This format failed, and on February 8, 1984, at 1:00 p.m. WNNJ became a soft adult Contemporary station. At that point WNNJ got a post sunset authorization to stay on the air until 6 p.m. even in the months that dusk occurred before 6. That summer they modified into more of a contemporary hit radio station mixing in a few oldies. In the Winter of 1985, under new program director William Cox, and after a few false starts, WNNJ settled on an Adult Contemporary/Oldies hybrid format under the name \\"Solid Gold 1360 WNNJ\\". The format did well through the late 1980s. In 1989 WNNJ got 24-hour-a-day authorization to broadcast. WNNJ now could stay on the air during the overnight but still signed off at 10:00 p.m. By 1990, though the current product was dropped and the station had evolved into a broad based 1955-1989 oldies format still known as Solid Gold 1360 WNNJ. In January 1994, some of the full-time airstaff was laid off while other full timers and part timers were folded into 103.7 WNNJ-FM. WNNJ 1360 became a satellite oldies station playing music from 1955 to 1975. The station was still called Solid Gold 1360 WNNJ but was entirely automated. The station also began broadcasting 24 hours a day. Late in 1996, Nassau Broadcasting purchased WNNJ along with WNNJ-FM. WNNJ 1360 dropped the Satellite Oldies in favor of ABC's Stardust satellite format featuring an eclectic blend of standards, soft rock oldies, soft AC cuts, and some big bands. The station remained automated full-time, known as \\"Unforgettable 1360 WNNJ\\". During the summer of 1998 WNNJ added a live weekday morning show from 5:30 to 10 a.m. with Chris Debello. The show consisted of a few adult standard songs along with news and phone call ins by people of various types. In 2000 the satellite format was switched to Westwood One's standards format which was a blend of soft rock oldies, easy listening standards, and soft adult contemporary hits. By now the station was known as simply \\"1360 WNNJ\\". In January of 2001, this station, along with WNNJ FM, and WSUS were sold to Clear Channel Communications, along with the LMA Nassau had with WDLC and WTSX. The station stayed with this standards format for about a year and 8 months but advertising was very low. So att 3 p.m. on November 27, 2002, WNNJ switched to country as \\"Bear Country 1360\\". The station was entirely automated with in house voicetracking except for overnights when they ran \\"After Midnight\\". Ratings were still very low but the format lasted until September 2004. In September 2004 Clear Channel lost the local marketing agreement with locally owned 96.7 WTSX (known as Fox 96.7) which played '60s' and '70s' oldies. At the end of the month WTSX went their separate way. Most of the airstaff though would stay with Clear Channel. They opted to move aspects of the Oldies format over to 1360, dropping country and flipping to oldies as \\"Oldies 1360\\". In the Spring of 2005 Oldies 1360 added former WCBS- FM personality Max Kinkel to mornings. Late in October 2006, Max Kinkle suffered debilitating injuries in an automobile accident. He never returned to the station. On July 30, 2007, local voice tracking and personalities were abruptly dropped. The station continued its automated oldies format for a few more weeks. Then on August 21 at Noon, WNNJ picked up a Satellite format called \\"Timeless Classics\\", which played a mix or Soft Oldies, some Soft AC cuts, and some adult standards. Core artists included Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Neil Diamond, Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Roy Orbison, and others. On June 26, 2008, it was announced that WNNJ was dropping their call letters on July 1, 2008, and would be known as \\"WTOC\\" at that time when the WTOC call letters were relinquished by a radio station in Savannah, GA. On the evening of June 30, 2008, the Classic AC/Oldies Timeless format was dropped in favor of Scott Shannon's True Oldies Channel. WTOC shared call letters with a CBS Television Affiliate in Savannah, Georgia known as WTOC-TV, and was never affiliated with 1360 WTOC. On July 21, 2010, Clear Channel announced that they will donate the station to the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council through the MMTC-CLEAR CHANNEL Ownership Diversity Initiative. According to press releases at the time, originally, Clear Channel would continue to manage the station with an LMA and WTOC would continue to offer True Oldies Channel. At the same time it was stated that Minority Media also had the option of selling the station and they executed that option in August 2011 selling the station to Radio Christiana. The station then signed off at noon on August 17, 2011. The last song played was \\"Hello Goodbye\\" by the Beatles. The last voice heard was that of chief engineer for Clear Channel Sussex and staff announcer Tony Dee. On December 19, 2011, WTOC signed back on with a Spanish-language Christian format under ownership of Radio Vision Christiana. In September 2013, WTOC was sold by Radio Vision Christiana to Centro Biblico of NJ, Inc. for $235,000. The sale was consummated on September 23, 2013.

It is one of three mountain communities in Pickens County, and the only one dedicated to maintaining its natural amenities. There are of paved roads running through the community, but the population density is intentionally low (approximately 300 lots over ranging in size from a minimum of to a maximum of 37 acres.) The Preserve at Sharp Mountain was named the \\"Best Community for Outdoor Lovers\\" by Pinnacle Living magazine, Unlike many planned communities, the Preserve at Sharp Mountain does not have swimming pools and tennis courts with club houses or golf courses. Instead, the Preserve at Sharp Mountain offers many acres of green space, hiking and nature trails, a nature pavilion, waterfalls, a bird sanctuary, a butterfly garden and various nature parks. The community is gated to restrict use of its of privately owned roads to those living in the community. The Preserve at Sharp Mountain was developed by Four Seasons originally, which later became Naterra Land. Naterra's stated goal in all of its projects is \\"to better connect people with nature.\\" Naterra Land sold out all of its inventory in the Preserve, and control of the community is now governed by a Property Owners' Association (POA). In 2011, the Preserve Association switched from being an HOA (Home Owners' Association) to being a POA (Property Owners' Association), each being viewed differently under Georgia law. In 2008 the Preserve became a recognized member of the national Firewise communities program and is one of the 13 in Georgia. Location and environment Sharp Mountain as viewed from adjacent winery The community is in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and offers panoramic views. The city of Atlanta can be seen on the horizon from Sharp Mountain (2,333 feet (711.10 meters) MSL @ LAT 34.43898, LON -84.506873) and Tally Mountain (1,903 feet (580.03 meters) MSL @ LAT 34.453723, LON -84.492457). The climate is that of a temperate southeastern forest. Flora includes red and white oak families, tulip poplar, maple, dogwood, and at the higher elevations, sourwood trees. Wild turkeys, fox, bobcat, deer, various species of hawks and owls, golden eagles, and an occasional black bear live within the community. Proximity Residents of the Preserve are an approximately ten minutes drive away from the Jasper business district and seven minutes from the Piedmont Mountainside Hospital. North Georgia is also \\"wine country,\\" and hosts a number of large wineries, one of which, is immediately adjacent to the Preserve on the southeast corner. The Sharp Mountain Vineyards produces approximately 11 tons annually with winery capacity of 800 cases per year.

The show was discontinued in May 2007 but some episodes still aired on Wow Mali Bytes and Wow Mali Express. On February 22, 2009, Wow Mali returned to TV5. Following the network's second reformat after Holy Week, Wow Mali was set to return in April 2010, airing every Wednesday at 7:30 pm. The show was again discontinued in September 2010 and was replaced by a spin-off show, Wow Meganon which lasted until April 8, 2011. Its third incarnation aired on April 11, 2011 and ended on February 26, 2012. However the management decided to return the series this late 2013 as their 4th incarnation under a new name Wow Mali Pa Rin!. Chinese yoyo master is Talentadong Pinoy‚Äôs last grand champion retrieved August 20, 2013http://www.mb.com.ph/the-wow-in-wow-mali/ History The Philippines got its first taste of unpretentious, candidly-captured-for-TV Filipino humor on May 25, 1996 from reality-based comedy show WoW Mali, hosted by feted comedian Joey De Leon. Inspired by the America's Funniest Home Videos concept, WoW Mali features a plethora of video footage featuring practical jokes, bloopers and wacky segments, as well as solicited but equally hilarious video clips from the viewers. The actual stars of the show are men on the street - individual Filipinos, caught by the candid camera in bizarre and funny situations. =Gaining Currency= From its pilot episode, the innovative program's candid camera format increasingly gained popularity among viewers of all ages, even paving the way for countless WOW Mali clones that failed to topple the original show. Soon enough, WoW Mali became a household name, even adding a gem to colloquial lingo. \\"WOW Mali\\" or \\"NA-WOW-MALI AKO\\" is now the common expression whenever one makes a mistake or becomes the victim of a prank or a ruse. For two years, the show was directed by Edgar \\"Bobot\\" Mortiz (a former teen matinee idol and part of the famous Going Bananas gang). Mortiz gave Joey de Leon a comic puppet co-host called Dennis Wrongman (as vivified by mime actor Totong Federez), another original touch. The taping of spiels and vignettes were usually held in the studio while candid shots, gag and tease segments were conducted on the streets by a daily roving crew, with the unsuspecting public as so-called \\"victims.\\" In August 1998, Ding Bolanos took over as director and brought Joey de Leon out of the studio to the outdoors. Hence, WoW Mali became a traveling show, capturing the Filipino brand of humor in different parts of the country, amid the colors and flavors of exotic places, exciting resorts and well-traveled tourist spots. =Wow Maling Mali= After almost a decade, ABC reformatted Wow Mali and retitled it Wow Maling Mali which premiered on May 7, 2005. On July 29, 2006, Wow Maling Mali morphed into Teka Mona!, but was discontinued on April 28, 2007. =Wow Mali Bytes/Express= On May 5, 2007, Wow Mali came back with a new brand, Wow Mali Bytes. It still featured skits and spoofs and gags, but with explicit humor and with no host at all. In mid-2007, it changed its title to Wow Mali Express. =Wow Mali spin-offs= After the reformat of ABC5 to TV5, Lokomoko was created which shared the same concept as Wow Mali but focused with school gags. It was hosted by Cathy Gonzaga, and Randolf Stamatelaky. When TV5 was reformatted in April 2010, Lokomoko morphed into being a gag show similar to Bubble Gang and Tropang Trumpo. Another comedy gag show in TV5 was Ogags hosted by two Brazilian ladies Daiana Menezes and Ariana Barouk. Ogags ended with the return of Wow Mali. =2nd Revival= The show returned on February 22, 2009 on TV5 with Joey de Leon again as host. De Leon hosts the show from a studio similar to virtual reality studio. It aired on Sundays at 6:30 PM. The show became a separate show from Lokomoko, following the renaming of show to Lokomoko High. Changes have been made to the second season of the show. It became live every Sunday nights. De Leon interacted with several people in a studio with a barangay plaza as backdrop. Sexy comedian Alyssa Alano joined him as co-host and had her own segment. Other homegrown TV5 talents like the Baikingu Girls (from the Tuesday primetime show Baikingu) and the Smurfets (from the Wednesday primetime show Ogags) were also seen in the show as well. Richie d' Horsie was added to the cast as Joey's second sidekick. Mahiwagang Tunog Mahiwagang Tunog (Filipino for Mysterious Sound) was a game show incorporated in the new incarnation of Wow Mali. A video clip of someone doing a mundane task was taken, but the video itself was removed, letting the viewers hear only the sound. The host then provided a sentence with the verbs of the sentence blanked out. Through a telephone call, the home viewer attempted to guess what is that particular person doing using only the sound he heard. The winner was awarded a cash prize from an ever-growing jackpot. =Wow Meganon?!= On September 6, 2010, Wow Mali became Wow Meganon. De Leon remains as the main host, together with Jeff \\"Mr. Fu\\" Espiritu, Calamity Fun, Wanlu, Miko Petito, Maui Manalo & Jeffrey Tam as the new co-hosts of the show. It was similar to Wow Maling Mali, but it also featured new segments like street magic and a puppet show. =3rd Revival= Wow Meganon ended its run on April 8, 2011, to make way for the revival of Wow Mali. However, it ended on February 26, 2012. =4th Revival= Wow Mali Pa Rin logo from September 2013 - April 2014 The management of TV5 decides to revive the program in September 2013 and naming it as Wow Mali Pa Rin! which will replaced Talentadong Pinoy's timeslot, alongside Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, and Pinoy Explorer. The series was scheduled to be aired on September 15, 2013 at 8pm.http://philnews.ph/2013/08/28/wow-mali-pa-rin- returns-soon-to-air-on-tv5/http://celebritygossip.com.ph/post/wow-mali-pa-rin- returns-soon-to-air-on-tv5http://www.mb.com.ph/tv5-weekend-block-revamp- offers-viewers-options/http://manilastandardtoday.com/2013/09/08/tv5-launches- weekend-programs/ =5th Revival= A new title again as Wow Mali: Lakas Ng Tama was premiered on TV5 last summer of 2014 with same host funnyman Joey De Leon and various guest stars of the show.

The three main elements of contractual formation are whether there is (1) offer and acceptance (agreement) (2) consideration (3) an intention to be legally bound. One of the most famous cases on forming a contract is Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company,Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 2 QB 256 decided in nineteenth-century England. A medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, a smoke ball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, buyers would receive ¬£100. When sued, Carbolic argued the ad was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was merely an invitation to treat, and a gimmick. But the court of appeal held that it would appear to a reasonable man that Carbolic had made a serious offer. People had given good \\"consideration\\" for it by going to the \\"distinct inconvenience\\" of using a faulty product. \\"Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will,\\" said Lindley LJ, \\"here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable\\". Offer The most important feature of a contract is that one party makes an offer for a bargain that another accepts. This can be called a 'concurrence of wills' or a 'meeting of the minds' of two or more parties. There must be evidence that the parties had each from an objective perspective engaged in conduct manifesting their assent, and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement.e.g. Lord Steyn, Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men (1997) 113 LQR 433; c.f. ¬ß 133 BGB in Germany, where \\"the actual will of the contracting party, not the literal sense of words, is to be determined\\" An objective perspective means that it is only necessary that somebody gives the impression of offering or accepting contractual terms in the eyes of a reasonable person, not that they actually did want to contract.Smith v Hughes =Invitations to treat= Where a product in large quantities is advertised for in a newspaper or on a poster, it is generally regarded as an offer, however if the person who is to buy the advertised product is of importance, i.e. his personality etc., when buying e.g. land, it is merely an invitation to treat. In Carbolic Smoke Ball, the major difference was that a reward was included in the advertisement which is a general exception to the rule and is then treated as an offer. Whether something is classified as an offer or an invitation to treat depends on the type of agreement being made and the nature of the sale. In retail situations an item being present is normally considered an invitation to treat; this was established for items on display in shop windows in Fisher v Bell [1961] 1 QB 394 and for items on shelves in Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd [1953] 1 QB 401. Retail agreements can also be considered invitations to treat if there is simply not enough information in the initial statement for it to constitute an offer. In Partridge v Crittenden [1968] 1 WLR 1204 the defendant had placed an advertisement indicating that he had certain birds for sale, giving a price but no information about quantities. He was arrested under the Protection of Birds Act 1954 for 'offering such birds for sale'; it was ruled that since the advertisement did not specify the number of birds he had it could not constitute an offer; if it did he could have been legally bound to provide more birds than he possessed.Poole (2004) p.40 The same principle was applied for catalogues in Grainger v Gough [1896] AC 325, when it was ruled that posting catalogues of items for sale to people did not constitute an offer since there was insufficient detail. *Chapelton v Barry UDC *Spencer v Harding (1870) LR 5 CP 561 *Harvey v Facey [1893] AC 552 =Offers generally= *Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.

However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract (Hillas and Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd(1932) 147 LT 503). Courts may also look to external standards, which are either mentioned explicitly in the contractWhitlock v Brew (1968) 118 CLR 445 or implied by common practice in a certain field.Three Rivers Trading Co Ltd v Gwinear & District Farmers Ltd (1967) 111 Sol J 831 In addition, the court may also imply a term; if price is excluded, the court may imply a reasonable price, with the exception of land, and second-hand goods, which are unique. If there are uncertain or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, it may be possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test‚Äîwhether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. *Sale of Goods Act 1979 ss 8(2) 9 See also *English tort law *Consideration in English law *Powell v Lee (1908) 99 LT 284 Notes External links Category:English contract law ","title":"Agreement in English law"},{"id":"18162373","text":"The Hood is the main villain and adversary of International Rescue in the Thunderbirds TV series. Background The name \\"Hood\\" was derived from the term hoodlum; Gerry Anderson also observed that the character was frequently masked, and that a mask \\"could be described as a 'hood'.\\" Sylvia Anderson acknowledges that the Hood's appearances became less regular towards the end of the series (the character is absent from the six episodes of Series Two), explaining that, like Kyrano, the character \\"turned out to be less viable on the screen than on the page.\\" To strengthen the character's antagonistic appearance, the Supermarionation puppet was fitted with an oversized head and hands. In the 2004 live-action film adaptation, the Hood's actions are motivated by a personal vendetta against Jeff Tracy after he left the Hood for dead during a rescue operation. Actor Ben Kingsley, who played the re-imagined Hood, described the character as a \\"vengeful obsessive, a man who is determined to discredit the hero that did not save his life. So although he could be a hero to the rest of the world, I know the Achilles' heel and I want that obsessive quest to be fulfilled.\\" The reason for the Hood‚Äôs hatred of Jeff was changed in the remake, Thunderbirds Are Go! where he explained how he and Jeff were friends but Jeff wouldn‚Äôt allow the Hood to carry out his plans. Appearances =TV series= The Hood's precise origins are unknown. While it is known that he is the half-brother of Kyrano, the precise details of their relationship ‚Äì such as which parent they share or which of them is the elder ‚Äì remain a mystery, as does the origin of his mysterious hypnotic powers. Even his real name remains a mystery; throughout the TV series, he is only ever referred to as \\"Agent Seven-Nine\\" and \\"671\\", and each codename is used on one occasion only (\\"Agent Seven-Nine\\" when he is working for \\"General X\\", a military officer from an unspecified eastern European country, and \\"671\\" when he is working for General Bron). The name \\"The Hood\\" is only used once used in the TV episodes; at the end of the episode \\"Edge of Impact\\" the General can be heard uttering the word Hood through the speaker of the Hood's vehicle underwater (hence why it is never mentioned in Thunderbirds books or on fan websites). Instead, the name was revealed in spin-off media and tie-in promotional materials. What is known for certain about the Hood is that he possesses a significant reputation among the less ethical groups of the world, as he has been shown to be in contact with spy agencies and militaries seeking information or for a target to be eliminated, such as in the episode \\"Edge of Impact\\", in which when he is hired by a general to sabotage the Red Arrow program as it was a threat to his work. He regularly spends his time in an Aztec-themed temple in the heart of a Malaysian jungle,Gerry Anderson obituary which features a statue of Kyrano in front of which he regularly stands when communicating with his brother, as well as other high-tech equipment that he uses to monitor his enemies and prepare his plans. However, his driving goal is to discover the secrets of the Thunderbirds machines and use them for his own goals. To this end he has been known to create several disasters in an attempt to photograph their machines in action, such as sabotaging the Fireflashs maiden flight by planting a bomb, causing actors for a film to be trapped in a cave, or attempting to sneak a miniature camera in the form of a mouse into Thunderbird 2 after triggering a nuclear reactor meltdown. However, these plans invariably failed, either through direct intervention on the part of International Rescue and their agents or through his own mistakes; for example, when he sent the mouse-like camera into Thunderbird 2, its program (to photograph movement) caused it to instead photograph the screaming Lady Penelope, who had wanted to see the Tracy brothers in action and thus accompanied Virgil, rather than Thunderbird 2's controls. Although capable of coming up with sophisticated plans- many of which showed little to no regard for the innocent people, setting up several high-stakes rescue missions without any sign of concern for those who would be endangered in the process so long as he got what he wanted-, the Hood was commonly shown to have a short temper and be very poor at improvisation when his schemes didn't work out the way he had planned. On one occasion when he actually managed to obtain footage of Thunderbirds 1 and 2 in action, the subsequent pursuit after they learned someone had been filming them culminated in the Hood stealing a plane with engine trouble that he had no idea how to fly resulting in the plane crashing and the film being destroyed, reflecting his inability to consider alternative plans if his original one failed. His arrogance is also a noteworthy handicap; when attempting to escape the scene after his sabotage of the Red Arrow project was uncovered, he crashed through a roadblock assuming that it had been erected to stop him, only to realise too late that it had actually been to stop people from driving over a damaged bridge. Although he and the team never came face-to-face in the series ‚Äì save for when he hypnotised Brains and Tintin to learn the location of a lost treasure ‚Äì the Tracy brothers were nevertheless aware of his existence. Having thwarted his plan in \\"Martian Invasion\\", Virgil commented that he was convinced that \\"Studt\\" (the Hood's alias at the time) was the same person who'd been after them since they first began the rescue business, with Scott agreeing with the assessment but nevertheless confident that they would one day capture him. In the first feature film, Thunderbirds Are Go, the Hood was unmasked and exposed by Scott as he was attempting to infiltrate the new Zero-X spaceship, having unintentionally sabotaged the original one two years previously while attempting to photograph it. His helicopter was shot down by Lady Penelope during his escape and he is seemingly killed, although many fans note that the Hood had faced such seemingly certain-death situations before and always survived. In the second feature film, Thunderbird 6, there is a villain known only as \\"Black Phantom\\". There has been an ongoing debate as to whether this is actually the Hood or not. The marionette that plays \\"Black Phantom\\" is that of the Hood, but with hair. This could be the Hood in disguise and \\"Black Phantom\\" maybe another alias. His voice however is different (due to voice actor Gary Files replacing Ray Barrett). On the Thunderbird 6 DVD commentary, director David Lane jokes that \\"Black Phantom\\" is the \\"son of the Hood\\". Sylvia Anderson states that \\"Black Phantom\\" is a different character. He is killed when Thunderbirds 1 and 2 open fire and destroy the \\"Black Phantom\\" hideout, which is a disused airfield near Casablanca in Morocco. =Comics= During his appearances in the comics, the Hood's plans became even more daring, with some plots even seeing him coming into direct contact with the Tracy family. On one particularly memorable occasion he attempted to expose International Rescue's location by bombing Thunderbird 2's hangar, forcing Virgil to move the craft onto the runway where he subsequently took photographs of the vessel. During the subsequent cover-up attempt ‚Äì claiming that Tracy Island was simply a theme park based on International Rescue, Thunderbirds 1 and 2 were sent into space with Thunderbird 5 while Lady Penelope and Parker staged a rescue, the intention being for the Thunderbirds to arrive at the scene and thus confirm that they hadn't come from Tracy Island ‚Äì the Hood managed to infiltrate the island, nearly hypnotising John and Brains, but was captured and had the last week or so of his memory erased to preserve the Tracy family's secret. On another occasion he managed to capture Brains by faking his death to use his genius to launch a direct assault on Tracy Island, but Gordon was able to track and rescue Brains in time to thwart the Hood's last attack, subsequently capturing the Hood and erasing his memory again. Another occasion featured him setting up three satellites that allowed him to take control of Thunderbirds 1 and 2 via remote, but Thunderbird 1 was able to escape his control and Thunderbird 3 subsequently destroyed one of the satellites and ruined the network when he attempted to do the same to Thunderbird 2. A later plan featured him hypnotising Kyrano to ask him to come to Tracy Island, but the Tracy's security measures proved sufficient for them to realise what he was up to and halt his attempts to access the Thunderbird hangars. =2004 film= In the live-action film Thunderbirds, where he was portrayed by Ben Kingsley, the Hood's actions against International Rescue were far more direct; having tracked them to Tracy Island, he trapped Jeff Tracy and the four eldest brothers on Thunderbird 5 with a missile attack, subsequently proceeding to steal Thunderbird 2 and the Mole and use them in an attempt to rob the Bank of England. The nature of his powers also changed; while he no longer appeared to possess his hypnotic powers, he now possessed powerful telekinetic abilities, although over-use of this power weakened him. The Hood tells Brains that \\"I was born with my powers.\\" It was revealed during the film that the Hood was left for dead during one of International Rescue's first missions; the Hood accuses Jeff Tracy of leaving him to die, but Jeff later tells Alan that, at the time, he left the Hood because he could see no way to save him that wouldn't kill them both. Despite what the Hood had done to him and his family, however, when faced with the chance to let the Hood fall into the Mole's drilling mechanisms, Alan instead saved him when the Hood was weakened by over-use of his powers, subsequently allowing him to be captured. In the film he is actually called the Hood, with Parker pointing out \\"Sounds like an alias, milady.\\" and Lady Penelope saying his real name is Trangh Belagant. This is in sharp contrast with the original series where he is never named on- screen by either his alias or real name. In the film both he himself and the other characters refer to him by his alias \\"the Hood\\". =2015 series= In the CGI 2015 series, the Hood is portrayed as having been secretly after International Rescue for some time, but his existence was apparently more of a rumour and theory rather than confirmed knowledge as far as the Tracy brothers are concerned. He is confirmed to be Kayo's uncle, but only Jeff and Grandma Tracy were aware of her ties to the Hood. It is also suggested that the Hood is responsible for Jeff Tracy's disappearance and possible demise, as Jeff was apparently investigating reports of the Hood before his ship vanished, with Lady Penelope having identified seven different aliases of the Hood before Jeff vanished and the trail went cold. Unlike the original series, the Hood uses holographic projections for his disguises as opposed to conventional means such as masks. In the first-season finale, \\"Legacy\\", the Hood manages to infiltrate Tracy Island and seize control of the Thunderbirds. He also reveals to the Tracy brothers that he is Kayo's uncle and claims she is working for him to undermine their trust in her. However, Kayo tricks him into seizing nearby Mateo Island instead of Tracy Island, and Thunderbirds 1, 2, and 5 destroy his ship before he can escape. The season ends with his capture by the Global Defence Force, but the second season sees him escape from prison mid- season with the assistance of the Mechanic. After a couple of other appearances in the second half of this season, he allows himself to be rescued/captured by International Rescue to escape the Mechanic's attack, but after Brains is able to convince the Mechanic to stand down in return for the GDF attempting to remove an implant in the Mechanic's brain that forces him to obey the Hood so long as they are within a certain distance from each other, the Hood escapes while being taken back to the GDF prison. In the third season, the Hood has devised a new means of causing trouble for International Rescue in the form of 'the Chaos Crew', brother and sister Fuse and Havoc, who pilot their own advanced vehicles to create destruction and further the Hood's plans. This ultimately cultivates in finding Jeff Tracy in outer space, though Jeff saw through his disguise as Brains. It was revealed that the Hood used to be friends with Jeff, but broke off when he was restricted in his plans by him. The Hood was then recaptured and placed under permanent arrest. =NES Game= Thunderbirds was adapted for one game for the NES; in it, the Hood threatens to bombard the earth with meteors if the Tracy family doesn't give him all of the Thunderbird vehicles within 60 days. After the period is up, the family defeats him. Powers and abilities =TV series and comics= Throughout the original series, the Hood was shown to be a master of disguise, using various masks to try and discover the secrets of the Thunderbirds machines and carry out various missions. He also possessed strange hypnotic powers of unknown origin, although these abilities were apparently limited to making people carry out simple commands, such as to follow him or put them to sleep. He was also apparently unable to use these powers to acquire information; on one occasion he attempted to force Brains to tell him the location of a lost treasure by burying him up to his neck in sand and sunlight and depriving him of water rather than simply hypnotising him to learn the answer, suggesting that he cannot make people tell him information but simply make them carry out certain actions. The only exception to this ability has been when he hypnotises Kyrano, as he was able to make Kyrano tell him such information as when International Rescue would be ready to start operating or where the organisation's headquarters was located. These abilities were apparently aided by a statue of Kyrano he had in his temple, as he always stood in front of it when making contact with his brother. He was also able to implant post-hypnotic suggestions to make Kyrano carry out certain actions when the Hood was no longer in direct 'contact' with him, such as when he had Kyrano disable the automatic camera detectors prior to the rescue in \\"Martian Invasion\\" so that he could photograph the Thunderbirds without them knowing. Although these hypnotic attacks always have a significant effect on Kyrano, causing him to collapse to the ground in pain before he is finally forced to reveal the information the Hood seeks, it would appear that Kyrano is not consciously aware of these assaults, as he always passes them off as mere 'dizzy spells' in their aftermath despite his otherwise unquestionable loyalty to Jeff Tracy. In the 2015 series, the Hood has not demonstrated any of his hypnotic abilities, but retains his knack for cunning plans, and was shown to command significant resources, possessing at least three henchmen, a large flying machine, and the technical resources necessary to create and distribute a large number of earthquake-inducing machines around the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. =Film= In the film, the Hood's abilities were changed to telekinesis, allowing him to levitate himself and move objects, although his temporary control of Lady Penelope and Parker's bodies when they attempted to rescue the Tracys suggests that he retained at least some of his old hypnotic powers. However, over-use of these abilities weakened him, and‚Äîin a marked contrast to the series‚Äîhis niece Tin-Tin (Vanessa Hudgens) was also shown to possess these abilities, although she only ever used them to help her friends; she even managed to overpower her uncle in a duel, although he had been weakened by over-using his powers while fighting Alan. Reception Media historian Nicholas J. Cull compares the Hood to \\"an evil version of Yul Brynner [as the King of Siam] in The King and I\\". The authors of The Rough Guide to Cult TV view the character as an update of Masterspy from the earlier Supermarionation series Supercar. To John Peel, the Hood marks a progression from the \\"silly, stereotyped\\" villains of Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray: \\"Most of his appearances were quite serious, and he was lethally rather than comically inclined.\\" In contrast, Jon Abbott of TV Zone magazine calls the Hood a \\"rather weak villain\\" of the type that exists \\"because the show simply needs a bad guy\\" and whose goal of photographing the Thunderbird machines would be considered \\"hilarious\\" by modern audiences. Abbott also believes that the character embodies a negative ethnic stereotype, stating that the \\"use of a foreign culture to create a sinister atmosphere ... dates the show badly\\" and that while Gerry Anderson strove to avoid casting Russians as the enemy, \\"he seems to have missed the point where it comes to the Orient.\\" For Jonathan Bignell, the Hood's villainy transcends geopolitical boundaries: his Eastern appearance and exotic powers \\"associated him with James Bond villains of the period, and pervasive fears of China as a 'third force' antagonistic to the West.\\" Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the Hood in the 2004 live-action film has drawn a mixed critical response. Glenn Erickson of the review website DVD Talk writes that Kingsley plays the role with \\"complete actorly overkill\\" and likens the characterisation to that of a clich√©d \\"evil baddie\\". He argues that the script uses ethnic stereotyping in its depiction of the Hood and his relatives, the Kyrano family, noting that both the Hood and his half-niece Tin-Tin possess hypnotic powers constituting \\"inscrutable Oriental wizardry\\". Alex Hewison of The Digital Fix calls Kingsley's performance \\"flat and dull, as though the ignominy of having to wear a red kimono and ridiculous face paint was enough to send him into a semi-catatonic state of weary indifference.\\" In contrast, Dennis Prince of DVD Verdict describes Kingsley as \\"simply excellent, devouring the role of the wicked yet dryly witty criminal mastermind, providing a hiss-worthy baddie who never becomes too evil\\". Philip Tibbetts of Den of Geek suggests that while the actor \\"hams it up on occasion\\", he \\"manages to restore some menace\\" to a film that is sometimes \\"frustratingly infantile\\". Carolyn Percy of the Wales Arts Review praises the re-imagined Hood of the remake series, describing him as \\"much more consistently competent and dangerous\\" than the original. She applauds the decision to remove his hypnotic abilities and give him an English accent, stating that the original character's supernatural powers \\"weren't in keeping with the rest of the show\\" and his Eastern tones made him a \\"racial stereotype\\".

It roughly comprises the southern portions of East New York between Flatlands Avenue to the north, and Jamaica Bay and the Gateway National Recreation Area to the south, with the Brooklyn neighborhood of Canarsie to the west and the Queens neighborhood of Howard Beach to the east. It is named after Spring Creek, one of several creeks that formerly ran through the area and drained into Jamaica Bay. For most of its history, the neighborhood of Spring Creek was considered the place where \\"the city came to an end\\", consisting of undeveloped marshland used as illegal dumping grounds, and hosting several large landfills and an incinerator during the 20th century. Much of the area was designated as the Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Area in 1967. The area has since seen several major development and restoration projects, including the Starrett City apartment complex, the Gateway Center shopping complex, several affordable housing communities, and Spring Creek Park. Spring Creek had the largest net gain in population in Brooklyn between 1940 and 2010, an increase of 330%. Spring Creek is part of Brooklyn Community District 5, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11207, 11208, and 11239. Location Spring Creek comprises the southeastern section of East New York, located to the south of New Lots. It is bounded to the north by Flatlands Avenue, to the east by Fountain Avenue (at the former drainage basin of Spring Creek and Betts Creek on the Brooklyn-Queens border), and to the west by Schenck Avenue, Gateway Drive and Hendrix Creek. To the south is the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway, the Gateway National Recreation Area, and Jamaica Bay. Including Starrett City (which is physically separated by Hendrix Creek), the neighborhood extends west to Louisiana Avenue and Fresh Creek at the boundary with Canarsie. Several areas north to Linden Boulevard, between Fountain Avenue to the west and 78th Street to the east, are also considered part of Spring Creek; this area was formerly known as Plunders Neck. Linden Boulevard was previously considered the northern boundary of Spring Creek. To the south of the Belt Parkway are the Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue Landfills (PAL/FAL). The two landfills were high man-made peninsulas created from former marshland and open water. The Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill opened in 1956 while the Fountain Avenue Landfill was opened in 1961 respectively. The Fountain Avenue Landfill (also simply called the Spring Creek Landfill) served as one of five major city facilities for regular refuse during its operation, along with the Fresh Kills and Brookefield Landfills in Staten Island; a facility in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx; and another one in Edgemere, Queens. The landfills closed around 1985. The two sites have since undergone restoration and are now part of Shirley Chisholm State Park and Spring Creek Park. Most of Spring Creek and Starrett City fall under the 11239 ZIP Code, but some portions of Spring Creek north of Flatlands Avenue, as well as the Brooklyn Developmental Center, fall under the 11207, and 11208 ZIP Codes. History =Early settlement= Forbell's Landing, late 19th Century Prior to European colonization, what is now Spring Creek consisted of salt marshes and several creeks, which drained into Jamaica Bay. The namesake creek itself ran north as far as Atlantic Avenue and Eldert Lane, near Highland Park (at the north end of Brooklyn) and Forest Park, forming the border of Brooklyn and Queens. The northern shores of Jamaica Bay were inhabited by the Jameco, Canarsee, and Rockaway Native American groups (for whom the Jamaica, Canarsie, and Rockaway areas would be named). In the 1650s, Dutch colonists began settling in the eastern sections of Brooklyn, forming the towns of Flatbush and New Lots (the latter the predecessor to East New York). The area, along with the rest of Brooklyn and modern New York City, was ceded to the British Empire in 1664. The first development in the Spring Creek area took place in the 1890s, a farm built by the Cozine family, the likely namesake of Cozine Avenue. This farm included a house and stable at the modern-day intersection of Elton Street and Vandalia Avenue. Plunders Neck, then a peninsula between Betts and Spring Creeks, took its name from pirates who occupied the waters and \\"plundered.\\" In the late 19th century it hosted a small community of wooden houses housing around 50 families who fished and farmed in the area. A hotel was erected along Mill Pond, near the basin of the creeks, at what was called Forbell's Landing. Otherwise, the area remained uninhabited. =Early development= Beginning in the 1920s, the city planned to develop a large ship and rail terminal along Jamaica Bay, particularly along the Paerdegat Basin in nearby Canarsie, to relieve port operations in the greater New York Harbor. The project would have constructed new rail facilities to connect with the Long Island Rail Road, New York Connecting Railroad, and a proposed rail tunnel to Staten Island.See:  Around this time, a street grid was mapped in Spring Creek, though most of the streets had yet to be constructed. In 1930, Spring Creek Park and the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway were proposed by Robert Moses, along with several other parks and highways. Land for both projects along Jamaica Bay in the area was acquired via eminent domain in 1938, and Shore Parkway opened in 1940, with an interchange to the south end of Pennsylvania Avenue. This put an end to the proposed Jamaica Bay seaport. Later plans by Robert Moses in the 1950s called for Spring Creek Park to extend to Cross Bay Boulevard in Howard Beach, Queens and include a new beach and boat basin. The Milford Street Landfill began operations in the 1930s, occupying much of the area where the Gateway Center now sits. The Milford Street Landfill was closed in 1950. This area later became known as the Vandalia Dunes due to its sandy landscape, and became a habitat for the Henslow's sparrow and other bird species.See: * * The South Shore Incinerator at Forbell Street and Wortman Avenue was dedicated on June 30, 1954, and the Pennsylvania and Fountain Avenue Landfills were opened in 1956 and 1961 respectively, on land previously earmarked for Spring Creek Park. Ash from the incinerator was used as additional fill for the marshes. A sewage treatment plant adjacent to Hendrix Creek was also opened around this time, while refuse was used to landfill the future Spring Creek Park.See: * * In spite of the new highway, Spring Creek Basin, as the area was then called, continued to remain undeveloped while other local areas were extensively built up. This was in part due to its remoteness from the city's focal points (such as Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn), its distance away from the nearest rapid transit lines, the presence of the landfills, incinerator, and water treatment plant in the area, and noise from the nearby Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport). A 1943 city profile called the area \\"Brooklyn's least populated district\\", with many streets remaining as mapped but not constructed. Smoke and odor from the incinerator and landfills, meanwhile, were reported to extend to the Queens neighborhoods of Howard Beach and Ozone Park.See: * * The remoteness of the area led it to be used as an illegal dumping ground for waste. The territory, particularly the landfills, is also said to have been used for dumping corpses, most notably by Murder, Inc. and the Gambino crime family; human remains from modern incidents have been unearthed as recently as 2013. =Urban renewal and development= Flatlands Avenue and Schenck Avenue in 2011. The lot to the right has yet to be developed In 1967, the area south of Flatlands Avenue between Schenck and Fountain Avenues (on the peninsula between Hendrix and Spring Creeks) was designated as the Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Area (FCURA). During this time, the remaining 19th-century buildings in this vicinity were demolished. That year, a major development project was proposed, which would include a state mental health facility, several intermediate schools, a high school, a community college, a shopping center, a branch library, an expansion of Spring Creek Park, and several thousand housing units including 8,000 middle-income condominium-style units. In preparation for the development, in 1968 under the city's Program for Action, it was proposed to extend the IRT New Lots Line and the BMT Canarsie Line of the New York City Subway to the Spring Creek area; the New Lots Line would have been extended to Flatlands Avenue near Elton and Linwood Streets. These extensions were canceled in the mid-1970s, largely due to the city's fiscal crisis at the time. Under the 1967 FCURA plan, the mental health facility (called the Brooklyn Developmental Center) was opened in 1973, the rental complex (the Starrett City apartment complex) opened in 1974, and the Spring Creek branch of the Brooklyn Public Library opened in the summer of 1977. The area was officially given the name Spring Creek in 1973 by Brooklyn borough president Sebastian Leone. Following community protests, and seepage of contaminated oil into Jamaica Bay, the Pennsylvania and Fountain landfills ceased municipal waste operations in 1979 and 1985 respectively, after which they were absorbed into the Gateway National Recreation Area.See:  * * On June 25, 1996, the New York City Council amended the original Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Plan to facilitate the Gateway Estates plan, a massive mixed-use proposal to redevelop 227 acres of landfill south of Flatlands Avenue. Expanding on the 1967 plan, it proposed to construct a retail development and 2,385 units of affordable housing. Ground broke on the Gateway Center shopping mall on November 16, 2000,See:  and it opened on October 1, 2002. Restoration of the Pennsylvania and Fountain Avenue Landfills meanwhile began in March 2002.See: * * In early 2007, the second phase of the Gateway Estates project (Gateway Estates II) was proposed, which included a expansion of the Gateway Center, 2,385 additional affordable housing units, and a new public school facility.See: * * The school facility, Spring Creek Educational Campus, opened in fall 2012. Gateway Center II opened in stages beginning in late 2014. Housing =Starrett City= Starrett City; Fresh Creek Basin is in the foreground Starrett City (also known as Spring Creek Towers) is the largest subsidized rental apartment complex in the United States. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are: Flatlands Avenue to the north, Hendrix Street to the east, Jamaica Bay to the south and the Fresh Creek Basin. Opened in 1974, the Starrett City site spanned over before being subdivided in 2009 as part of a refinancing. The housing development contains 5,881 apartment units in 46 buildings. The residential site also includes eight parking garages and a community center. The area contains a shopping center as well. A number of parcels of undeveloped land totaling were separated out from the residential site as part of the refinancing. The development was designed by Herman Jessor, organized in the towers in the park layout. The buildings utilize a simple \\"foursquare\\" design.See: * * The residential portion of the property has eight \\"sections\\" each including several buildings, its own field, recreational area (jungle gym, park, handball court, basketball court) and a five-story parking garage for residents in that section. These sections are Ardsley, Bethel, Croton, Delmar, Elmira, Freeport, Geneva, and Hornell; each named after municipalities in New York State. The community had its own newspaper, known as the Spring Creek Sun. =Nehemiah Spring Creek= The colorful houses in the Nehemiah Spring Creek development Nehemiah Spring Creek, or Spring Creek Nehemiah, is one of two affordable housing developments built under the Gateway Estates plan (along with Gateway Elton). Located south of Flatlands Avenue and north of Gateway Center II between Elton and Erskine Streets, the neighborhood consists of modular prefabricated one-to-three family rowhouses assembled at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The houses were designed by Soho-based architect Alexander Gorlin. Nehemiah, operated by East Brooklyn Congregations (EBC), previously constructed other developments in the East New York and Brownsville areas in the 1980s.See: * * The land was originally assigned by the city to the Starrett Housing Corporation for development in 1989; the project was known as Spring Creek Estates. EBC began competing with Starrett for the site in 1992. The name was changed to Gateway Estates in 1994. By the project's groundbreaking in August 2006, Starrett Housing had backed out of the plan, and the name was changed to Nehemiah Spring Creek Houses at Gateway Estates. The first phase of the development was completed in 2008. Residents of the community apply for housing via a lottery; some applied during the project's planning in the 1990s. =Gateway Elton= Gateway Elton Street in December 2015 Gateway Elton Street sits at the west end of Nehemiah Spring Creek, on Elton Street between Flatlands Avenue and the Gateway Center. The three-phase affordable-housing project features six-story apartment buildings with retail space on the ground level. The buildings utilize electricity from solar panels affixed to the roofing. The first phase of the project, featuring 197 rental units, was completed in 2012. The second phase broke ground on May 2, 2013.See:  Construction on the third phase started on January 15, 2015. and a housing lottery for the project was held upon its completion in July 2016. =Spring Creek Gardens= Spring Creek Gardens is a third low-income housing complex in the northeast corner of Spring Creek near the border with Lindenwood, Queens, one block south of Linden Boulevard. Located at 902 Drew Street, it is bound by Loring Avenue to the north, Stanley Avenue and the remnants of Spring Creek to the south, Forbell Street to the west, and Emerald Street to the east. The community is gated, with the primary entrance situated at Drew Street. It was opened in 1989, developed by General Atlantic Realty Corporation, and paid for by Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the city's 421a tax-abatement certificates. It was sold to the Domain Companies and the Arker Companies in 2006. Industry and commerce Looking at the Spring Creek Depot from Flatlands Avenue Several industrial and commercial structures are located in the northeastern portion of the area east of Fountain Avenue and south of Linden Boulevard, the former Plunders Neck area. At 803 Forbell Street in this part of the neighborhood, the South Shore Incinerator, also known as the Forbell Street Incinerator, was active from 1954 to the 1980s. Other structures in this area include: * Spring Creek Auxiliary Water Pollution Control Plant (Spring Creek AWPCP), operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP). * Spring Creek Yard Waste Composting Facility, operated by the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) at the former incinerator site. The incinerator facility is now used as a garage for cleaning and derelict vehicle storage.See: * * Two other DSNY facilities are located west of Fountain Avenue, at Milford Street and at Georgia Avenue. The Georgia Avenue location is also a former incinerator plant, having operated from about 1920 through at least the mid-1930s. * Spring Creek Depot, operated by the MTA Bus Company. * United States Postal Service Brooklyn Processing and Distribution Center, also known as the Brooklyn P&DC;, the Brooklyn General Mail Facility, or simply the Postal Facility, at 1050 Forbell Street. Constructed in 1991, it occupies a large area between the bus depot and DSNY facility.See:  Other structures in the rest of Spring Creek include: * 26th Ward Water Pollution Control Plant, also operated by the NYCDEP, in Starrett City on the shore of Hendrix Creek. It was opened in the 1950s. * Flatlands Fairfield Industrial Park, north of Flatlands Avenue. Parks and recreation Moe Finklestein Athletic Complex (also known as the Thomas Jefferson High School Field), located on Flatlands Avenue between Essex Street and Erskine Street, is used by the schools of Thomas Jefferson Educational Campus and other schools in PSAL competition. The complex was created as part of the Fresh Creek Renewal Plan. Spring Creek Park is operated by both the city and the federal government. It consists of man-made parkland, marshland along the Jamaica Bay Shore, and the former Pennsylvania and Fountain Avenue Landfills. Shirley Chisholm State Park, a state park, is located atop the Pennsylvania and Fountain Avenue Landfills south of the Belt Parkway. The Pennsylvania Avenue section opened in July 2019, and the Fountain Avenue expansion is expected to open in 2021.See:  Retail There are two major shopping malls in the area: * Gateway Center, located on Erskine Street and Gateway Drive across from the Brooklyn Developmental Center. The two-part suburban-style complex was built as the retail component of Gateway Estates. The southern portion opened in 2002, and the northern (Gateway Center II) in 2014. * Spring Creek Towers Shopping Center, located in Starrett City. Schools Spring Creek Campus on Elton Street and Flatlands Avenue A branch of the New York School of Career and Applied Studies, part of Touro College, is located in Starrett City.

Combat search and rescue (CSAR) are search and rescue operations that are carried out during war that are within or near combat zones. A CSAR mission may be carried out by a task force of helicopters, ground-attack aircraft, aerial refueling tankers and an airborne command post.Combat Aircraft (European Edition) (magazine), Ian Allan Publishing, September 2003, page 28 The USAF HC-130, which was introduced in 1965, has served in the latter two roles.Combat Aircraft (European Edition) (magazine), Ian Allan Publishing, September 2003, page 29 History Richard Bell-Davies conducted the first combat S&R; mission in his aircraft during the First World War. The First World War was the background for the development of early combat search and rescue doctrine, especially in the more fluid theaters of war in the Balkans and the Middle East. In the opening fluid stages of the First World War the Royal Navy Air Service Armoured Car Section was formed with armed and armoured touring cars to find and pick up aircrew who had been forced down. When trench warfare made this impossible the cars were transferred to other theatres, most notably the Middle East. In 1915, during the First World War, Squadron Commander Richard Bell-Davies of the British Royal Naval Air Service performed the first combat search and rescue by aircraft in history. He used his single-seat aeroplane to rescue his wingman who had been shot down in Bulgaria. His Victoria Cross citation included \\"Squadron-Commander Davies descended at a safe distance from the burning machine, took up Sub-Lieutenant Smylie, in spite of the near approach of a party of the enemy, and returned to the aerodrome, a feat of airmanship that can seldom have been equalled for skill and gallantry.\\" Like the search and rescue efforts of the future, Davies' action sprang from the fervent desire to keep a compatriot from capture or death at the hands of the enemy. It was during the Mesopotamian campaign that British and other Commonwealth forces began to use similar tactics on a larger scale. Shot down aviators in hostile Bedouin territory were often located by search parties in the air and rescued. Other nations also contributed to the development of modern-day CSAR. During World War II, the Luftwaffe (Seenotdienst organization) operated armed camouflaged air-sea rescue aircraft.Feltus, Pamela. History and the Headlines. \\"Air-Sea Rescue.\\" ABC-CLIO, 2008. Retrieved: 23 April 2011. In the First Indochina War French doctor, pilot and parachutist Valerie Andre pioneered MEDEVAC tactics, a precursor to what we know as CSAR today, by flying helicopters into combat zones to retrieve (or sometimes treat) injured soldiers. In August 1943 a wing flight surgeon, Lt. Col. Don Flickinger, and two combat surgical technicians, Sgt. Richard S. Passey and Cpl. William MacKenzie, parachuted from the search planes in the Naga area of Burma to assist and care for the injured. At the same time, a ground team was sent to their location and all twenty walked to safety. Although parachute rescues were not officially authorized at the time, this is considered by PJs to be the birth of United States Air Force Pararescue. Eric Sevareid said of his rescuers: \\"Gallant is a precious word: they deserve it\\". A few short months later, Capt. Porter was killed on a rescue mission when his B-25 was shot down. A Sikorsky HH-53B refueling during the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam War the costly rescue of Bat 21 led the US military to find a new approach to high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, it should not be attempted and other options such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the US Air Force introduced the A-7 Corsair, originally a carrier-based Navy light attack aircraft, to replace the Air Force's A-1 Skyraiders, an aircraft that also was originally a carrier-based naval attack bomber. As a result of the Vietnam CSAR experience, the US military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions. During the Vietnam War, U.S. SAR forces saved 3,883 lives at the cost of 71 rescuers and 45 aircraft. Notable CSAR missions =World War One= On 21 April 1917, Captain Richard Williams of the Australian Flying Corps landed behind enemy lines to rescue a downed comrade.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, p.63 =Vietnam War= In 1972, during the Vietnam War, Lt Col Iceal Hambleton, a USAF navigator/electronic warfare officer with a background in ballistic missile technology and missile countermeasures, was the sole survivor of an EB-66 shot down during the Easter Offensive. He eluded capture by North Vietnamese forces until his rescue 11¬Ω days later. During the rescue operation, five US military aircraft supporting the CSAR effort were shot down, eleven US servicemen were killed and two men were captured. The rescue operation was the \\"largest, longest, and most complex search-and-rescue\\" operation during the entire Vietnam War. It has been the subject of two books and the largely fictionalized film Bat*21.Darrel D. Whitcomb, The Rescue of Bat 21 (Naval Institute Press, 1998) =Others= Pararescuemen return with a downed pilot from a successful rescue mission in southern Iraq (2003). The United States Air Force (USAF) 24th Special Tactics Squadron was involved in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu. Timothy Wilkinson, a Pararescueman, was awarded the Air Force Cross for his heroic actions during the battle. Air Force pararescue personnel (PJs) have been awarded one United States Air Force Medal of Honor and 12 Air Force Cross's since the Southeast Asia conflict. During the opening moments of Operation Desert Storm, an MH-53 Pave Low crew from the 20th Special Operations Squadron recovered an F-14 Tomcat pilot who was shot down over Iraq. On June 2, 1995, a USAF F-16C was shot down by a Bosnian Serb Army SA-6 surface-to-air missile near Mrkonjiƒá Grad, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The American pilot, Scott O'Grady, ejected safely and was rescued six days later. The operation became known as the Mrkonjiƒá Grad incident. In 1999, members of United States Air Force Pararescue along with Air Force Special Operations recovery aircraft successfully rescued the pilot (Vega 31) of an F-117 \\"stealth\\" attack aircraft and the pilot (Hammer 34) of an F-16 fighter aircraft both of whom were shot down over Yugoslavia while on a NATO-led mission.

It stars Irene Worth, Mercedes Ruehl, and Richard Dreyfuss. It was the first theatrical feature film to be edited on Avid Media Composer. Plot synopsis In 1942 in the Bronx, Evelyn Kurnitz has just died following a lengthy illness. Her husband, Eddie Kurnitz, needs to take a job as a traveling salesman to pay off the medical bills incurred. Eddie decides to ask his stern and forbidding mother, from whom he is slightly estranged, if his two early-teen sons, Jay and Arty (whom their Grandma calls by their full given names, Yakob and Arthur), can live with her and their Aunt Bella Kurnitz in Yonkers. His mother refuses at first but reluctantly agrees after Bella threatens to leave her if the boys aren't allowed to stay. Despite their Grandmother owning and operating a candy store, Jay and Arty don't like their new living situation. They are afraid of their cold and distant Grandmother and find it difficult to relate to their crazy Aunt Bella, whose slow mental state is manifested by perpetual excitability and a short attention span, which outwardly comes across as a childlike demeanor. Into their collective lives returns one of Eddie and Bella's other siblings, Louie Kurnitz, a henchman for gangsters. He is hiding out from Hollywood Harry, who wants what Louie stole and which he is hiding in a small black bag. Jay and Arty's mission becomes how to make money fast so they can help their father and move back in together, which may entail stealing the $15,000 their Grandma has hidden somewhere. Bella's mission is to find a way to tell the family she wants to marry Johnny, her equally slow movie theater usher boyfriend; the two could also use $5,000 of Grandma's hidden money to open their dream restaurant. Louie's objective is merely to survive the next couple of days. Cast * Richard Dreyfuss as Louie Kurnitz * Mercedes Ruehl as Bella Kurnitz * Irene Worth as Grandma Kurnitz * Mike Damus as Arty Kurnitz * Brad Stoll as Jay Kurnitz * David Strathairn as Johnny Broadway play After eleven previews, the Broadway production, directed by Gene Saks, opened on February 21, 1991, at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, where it ran for 780 performances. The original cast included Jamie Marsh, Irene Worth, Mercedes Ruehl, and Kevin Spacey. Reception The film holds a score of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 17 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"B+\\" on scale of A+ to F. Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, \\"All of the performances are good, but one of them, by Mercedes Ruehl, casts a glow over the entire film.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"A wonderful play about a classically unhappy household that has been turned into a typical, mechanical Neil Simon joke machine. Simon's stage words rarely transfer well to the more realistic arena of film, and this is no exception.

Sandbach has been a market town since the 1579 when it was granted a Royal Charter by Elizabeth I due to the petitioning of Sir John Radclyffe of Ordsall who as the largest landowner in Sandbach and the owner of the Old Hall encouraged the farmers of the area to go and hold a market in the town on Thursdays. The actual Charter is still preserved and can be found in Chester, a reproduction can be found in the Sandbach Town Council meeting offices, which are at the Literary Institution. The charter also granted the town the right to hold two annual fairs, which lasted for two days, and were held around Easter and early September. Today the Thursday market is still held outdoors on Scotch Common, and in and around the town hall. Nearby are some wetlands called Sandbach Flashes.

This was the only notable event of the Civil War to have happened in Sandbach. On 3 September 1651 Sandbach summer fair was being held and a Scottish army of around 1000 exhausted cavalry men passed through the town; this army had been under the command of David Leslie. The town was not an easy retreat route however the people of Sandbach and the Market stall holders attacked the Scottish in their tents during the night whilst they slept , killing 9 or 10 and taking around one hundred prisoner a newspaper of the time said: > The dispute was very hot for two or three houres, and there were some > townsmen hurt and two or three slaine, the Townesman slew about nine or ten > and tooke 100 prisoners.

Also in Australia and New Zealand, it is normal for a university to grant a bachelor's degree in engineering technology.  Entrance requirement  The entrance requirement is usually a high school diploma. Graduates of two-year diploma programs (In US, associate degree program graduates) in a closely related field may be admitted directly into the 3rd year of the degree program and can graduate at the end of the fourth year. Sometimes the program consists of last two years only, in which case it is mandatory to have a two-year diploma in a related field. Some colleges allow students to exit the degree program after successful completion of first two years with diploma credential as well. Graduates of this type of degree program are expected to fulfil a role that is somewhere between a technician and an engineer.  History  Canadian colleges started granting applied degrees in the mid-1990s and all major colleges offer Applied bachelor's degree programs in variety of fields ranging from accounting, human resources, marketing, international business, finance, engineering, criminology, film productions, radio broadcasting and hospitality and tourism management.  Recognition  = By professional licensing bodies = Certified General Accountants Association of Canada accepts Applied bachelor's degree as meeting exit requirements for CGA credential. Professional engineering associations usually accept membership applications from such graduates, but will sometimes assign supplemental courses before professional designation is given if all other criteria are met. = By industry = ‚ÄúSociety of Petroleum Engineers‚Äù accepts a graduate of Bachelor of Applied Petroleum Engineering Technology program as a member. = By government = Applied degrees are considered a qualified academic credential for the purpose of applying to government-run student loan programs.

It was directed by Dick Richards and starred Billy Green Bush as Frank Culpepper and Gary Grimes as Ben Mockridge. This was the first credited film for Jerry Bruckheimer, for which he received an associate producer credit. Its tagline is \\"How many men do you have to kill before you become the great American cowboy?\\" and also \\"The boy from Summer of '42 becomes a man on the cattle drive of 1866\\", which references a similar coming of age film starring Gary Grimes. The film is typical of the \\"hyper-realism\\" of many early 1970s revisionist westerns. It is particularly noted for its grainy photography and use of sepia toning in some scenes. Synopsis Ben Mockridge (Gary Grimes) is a young man proud of his $4 handgun and enamored of \\"cowboyin. He asks Frank Culpepper (Billy Green Bush) if he can join his cattle drive to Fort Lewis, Colorado. Culpepper (a reformed gunslinger) reluctantly agrees and sends Ben to the cook (Raymond Guth) to be his \\"little Mary\\". Ben quickly discovers that the adults have little interest in young'ns, and no interest in \\"showing him the ropes\\". Culpepper nevertheless assigns Ben tasks the greenhorn handles poorly‚Äîor simply fails at‚Äîrepeatedly causing serious trouble. After rustlers stampede the herd, Culpepper tracks them to a box canyon. When the rustlers' leader (Royal Dano) demands 50 cents a head for having rounded up and taken care of the cattle, Culpepper will have none of it. He and his hands kill the rustlers, not hesitating to gun down disarmed men, or repeatedly shoot anyone still moving. They lose four of their own in the fight. Culpepper directs Ben to a cantina a day's ride off, to find Russ Caldwell. Before he can reach the cantina, Ben is accosted by trappers who take his horse and gun. Once Ben finds Caldwell (Geoffrey Lewis), he and three of his buddies agree to join the drive. When they cross the trappers' path, there is no parlaying‚Äîthey immediately kill the trappers and take their possessions. When Ben stands night watch, he's unprepared for a one-eyed man (Gregory Sierra) trying to steal the horses. Instead of immediately shooting him, Ben lets the man distract him with his talk, and is overcome by another thief. Culpepper is outraged at Ben's stupidity. The horse theft \\"tears it\\", and Culpepper decides to toss Ben on a stage coach, regardless of where it's headed. When Culpepper & Co. enter a town where they hope to buy horses and send off the greenhorn, they stop at a saloon, where Ben recognizes one of the patrons as the one-eyed horse thief. Another shootout ensues, with Ben \\"redeeming\\" himself by killing the bartender as the latter reaches for his shotgun. As before, Culpepper's adversaries wind up dead, an unlikely survivor directing Culpepper to the horses. When Ben handles Caldwell's gun without his permission, the touchy Caldwell goes into a snit, and knocks Ben to the ground. When one of the hands calls Caldwell an SOB for striking Ben, Caldwell demands a gun fight to reclaim his \\"honor\\". The hand decides it is not worth the trouble and leaves the drive. \\"You cost me a good man, boy,\\" fumes Culpepper, warning him to \\"make himself small\\" for the remainder of the drive. When they reach an area with grass and water, Culpepper leaves the cattle to graze, taking Caldwell and his men into town to look for the landowner to pay him. Ben follows them, initially to buy food for the cook, but joins them in a bar for a drink, where they prod him into a session with a backroom prostitute. The owner of the land, Thornton Pierce (John McLiam), tells Culpepper he should have asked first before letting the cattle graze, and demands $200 as down-payment simply for having trespassed. This time, Culpepper & Co. are outgunned, and forced to surrender their sidearms, which they view as a symbolic castration. Moving out the cattle, Culpepper & Co. encounter a group of religious \\"pilgrims\\", led by Nathaniel Green (Anthony James), who invites them to stay and water their cattle. He says God has led his party here, and they intend to settle. Not surprisingly, Pierce and his thugs show up, claiming \\"this land is mine\\", and gives everyone‚ÄîGreen and his people included‚Äîan hour to get off. Green is convinced Culpepper was sent by God to help. Culpepper responds that Green need only leave to be safe, which is what he intends to do, as it is less than two weeks to Fort Lewis, and selling his cattle is all he cares about. Ben decides to stay, feeling he can help in some unspecified manner. He reveals that he safely hid his gun and belt from Pierce's men earlier during the barroom ambush. As Culpepper & Co. ride off, Caldwell and his three friends, their consciences (and lust for revenge) getting the better of them, return to defend Green & party from Pierce, to Culpepper's exasperation. Nonetheless, Culpepper leaves them behind to drive his cattle. In the ensuing shootout, everyone in the Caldwell and Pierce parties‚Äîexcept Ben‚Äîis killed. Revealing his hypocrisy and ingratitude, Green tells Ben that they are not going to stay after all, as the ground has been stained with blood. \\"God never intended us to stay‚Äîhe was only testing us.\\" An angry Ben forces them to bury the four bodies of his friends, then discards his gun and rides off to parts unknown. Cast * Gary Grimes as Ben Mockridge * Billy \\"Green\\" Bush as Frank Culpepper * Luke Askew as Luke * Bo Hopkins as Dixie Brick * Geoffrey Lewis as Russ * Raymond Guth as Cook * Wayne Sutherlin as Missoula * Matt Clark as Pete * Anthony James as Nathaniel * Charles Martin Smith as Tim Slater * Gregory Sierra Rustler Historical accuracy The Culpepper Cattle Co. has been praised for its attention to detail and period atmosphere. A subtle example is seen when Frank Culpepper leans against a water barrel and his arm above the wrist is exposed‚Äîit is white, untanned. People rarely took off any clothing in public (there is a comic moment when the cook is embarrassed to be seen with his shirt off), and the idea of an \\"all-over\\" tan would have been absurd, if not incomprehensible. (Only working folk had a tan.) Cowboys were \\"fish-belly white\\" over most of their bodies. The opening title sequence mixes genuine period photographs with sepia-tinted posed images of the cast members. The story is almost violent, but this has to be seen in the context of the offenses against Frank Culpepper and his party. These included horse and cattle theft, which were usually punishable by hanging. As there was no practical way to haul the thieves into court, Culpepper was justified in dispensing immediate \\"justice\\", however brutal. Culpepper's final act of justice is to wipe out the evil agro- capitalist (the villain in scores of Westerns) and his horde. By contemporary standards, the grass-fed cattle are rather scrawny, as fattening them up on corn had not become general practice. Even if it had, there would have been little point in adding weight to animals who would only \\"walk it off\\" on a long drive. The 1866 date of the story is plausible. This was the same year Goodnight and Loving made their first long cattle drive. The film's principal anachronism is showing most of the cowhands with beards. Contemporary photos indicate that, while cowboys often had mustaches (sometimes quite fancy), beards were not common‚Äîone out of twenty cowboys, perhaps. This was unusual in an era (extending to the end of the 19th century) where a high percentage of men took pride in having full beards. The film incorrectly mixes in scenes of topography and vegetation found only in the climatic zone of southwestern Arizona. The location of the cattle drive is between \\"Texas\\" and Fort Lewis, Colorado (located in southwest Colorado near Durango). There are scenes of cattle being driven by Saguaro cactus which only occur in the Sonoran Desert of southwest Arizona. This Arizona scenery is 350 miles off-course of a probable route that would run between west Texas and southwest Colorado. The scenery surrounding the Eaves Movie Ranch (outside Santa Fe, NM) is typical of the landscape and vegetation that would have been common along the fictional route. The firearms used are almost all anachronisms in an 1866 setting. With the exception of Ben Mockridge's 1850s-era percussion-cap pistol, the other pistols and rifles date from the early 1870s to the mid-1890s. Another anachronism is a pressure lantern (invented in the late 1890s) visible in one bar scene. Awards Gregory Prentiss and Eric Bercovici were nominated for best original screenplay by the Writers Guild of America. Trivia The cowboys' departure scene bringing the herd is a clear tribute to Howard Hawks' Red River.

Constructed in 1866 by the Freemasons as the Grand Lodge of Maryland Masonic Temple, the building was the headquarters for the Maryland Freemasons for over 130 years. Edmund G. Lind was commissioned to design a new Masonic Temple. The French and Italian Renaissance-inspired property is a 7-story, 90,000 square foot building in downtown Baltimore. Among its ten main meeting rooms are Edinburgh Hall, modeled after the Tudor-style Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, and another which resembles an Egyptian temple. The building features ornate plaster moldings, a marble staircase, stained glass windows and Rococo chandeliers. History In 1822, the Masons dedicated their first Grand Lodge of Maryland on St. Paul Street and Lexington Avenue. During the Civil War years, the Grand Lodge served as a federal court house for U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. After the war ended, Baltimore's economy returned to its economic focus and continued to expand. Later, the City of Baltimore acquired the Grand Lodge for a permanent extension of the Court House, and the Masons began construction on their second Grand Lodge. On November 20, 1866, the cornerstone was laid for the new Grand Lodge on Charles Street. A fire destroyed the interior in 1890, and a second fire again gutted the building in 1900, also destroying the upper stories. Repairs were completed in 1909, according to designs by Joseph Evans Sperry. It was Sperry who added the Beaux Arts sixth story and attic, as well as the elaborate ornamentation around the entryway. Its first floor was partially used for retail and its headquarters was there until 1994, when the Lodge moved to the suburbs. After the 1987 bicentennial Celebration of the founding of the Maryland Freemasons, the Masons decided to make use of a large parcel of land they owned north of the city for a new Grand Lodge. In 1993, construction of a new complex in Cockeysville, Maryland began, and the new Grand Lodge of Maryland was dedicated there in 1996. Attracted by its beauty and recognizing the possibilities for other uses, the owners of the neighboring Tremont Suites Hotel purchased the Lodge from the Masons in 1998. The firm began planning a renovation of the structure which would honor its grace and historical significance while using it for meeting space and social functions. City of Baltimore officials were unaware of plans for restoration, and condemned the building in order to erect a much needed parking structure on the land. Working with the city, the hotel's owners crafted an agreement which would save the building and add a parking structure directly behind it. Thanks to that agreement, restoration of the magnificent structure began. A team of architects, designers, restoration specialists and world class craftsmen was assembled to restore the original interiors and replicate what they could. After years of work, the doors of the lodge, newly named Tremont Grand, were opened in September 2005. The project‚Äôs scope of work involved restoration and cleaning of exterior and all interior finishes, a new addition providing elevator and lobby access for floors 2 through 5, and a connector to The Tremont Plaza Hotel. Nearly 140 years after its original cornerstone was laid as the Grand Lodge of Maryland, the Tremont Grand was returned to a graceful and elegant state, remaining a piece of Baltimore's history. When the hotel was renamed Embassy Suites Baltimore Inner Harbor, the building was renamed Grand Historic Venue. In 2015, the building was renamed The Grand.

History The impetus for the conversations emerged largely out of the friendship between the high-church Anglican, Charles Lindley Wood, the Second Viscount of Halifax, and the French Roman Catholic priest, Fernand Portal. Although the ultramontanist attitudes of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Great Britain made direct talks between British Anglicans and British Roman Catholics infeasible, the Lambeth Appeal of 1920 opened doors to Roman Catholics on the continent. D√©sir√© Joseph Cardinal Mercier, Archbishop of Malines, agreed to host the private ecumenical discussions desired by Lord Halifax and Abb√© Portal. The conversations were held in the Belgian primatial see of Malines (now normally referred to as Mechelen) from 1921 to 1927 with tacit support from the Vatican and the Archbishops of Canterbury and York Randall Davidson and Cosmo Gordon Lang. The number of participants varied but included on the Anglican side Lord Halifax, Bishops Frere and Gore and Armitage Robinson (Dean of Wells). The Catholic participants included Mercier himself, Batiffol, Hemmer, Portal and Mercier's successor van Roey, who wound up the conversations in 1927. A consensus emerged during the five conversations, of which only the first four proved substantial, that the Anglican Church should be ‚Äúreunited‚Äù with‚Äînot simply ‚Äúsubsumed‚Äù by‚Äîthe Roman Church. Dom Lambert Beauduin's 1925 paper L'√©glise anglicane unie, mais non absorb√©e was particularly remarked. Van Roey was personally less favourable to the idea of unity than his predecessor, and Cardinal Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster, successfully urged the Vatican to withdraw its encouragement, in line with Leo XIII's bull Apostolicae curae (1896), which had denied validity to Anglican orders. Although the conversations provoked controversy in both churches and failed to produce concrete results, they did pave the way toward future ecumenical discussions between Roman Catholics and Anglicans.

He most recently served as manager of F.C. S√ºdtirol in the Italian Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Career =Playing= A centre back, D'Angelo started his career playing for amateur team Trissino in 1986; he then joined Marzotto Valdagno, another amateur team, one year later, and finally signed for Chievo in 1988. During his first season with the gialloblu, D'Angelo made 17 appearances in the Serie C2 league. He then spent a couple of seasons on loan to Serie C2 teams Marzotto Valdagno and Derthona respectively. He returned to Chievo in 1991, finding his team in Serie C1 and quickly establishing himself as a mainstay for the Ceo, captaining his side to two promotions, and also in their subsequent Serie A campaigns. He made his Serie A debut, together with several of his fellow Chievo players, on August 26, 2001, in a surprise away victory against Fiorentina. In 2002, he became a back-up player, and consequently chose to leave the captaincy to Lorenzo D'Anna, another long-time Chievo player. On January 2003 he decided to leave Chievo, after twelve consecutive seasons with them, in order to join his hometown club Napoli, who were playing Serie B at the time. He returned to Chievo later on in the summer, mainly helping Luigi Delneri to his coaching duties. He made his lone and final appearance with Chievo on May 16, 2004, in a Serie A home league match against Bologna. =Coaching= Following his retirement in 2004, D'Angelo stayed at Chievo, joining the non-playing staff as assistant to new head coach Mario Beretta. However, despite a good start, Chievo found themselves to be in serious danger of relegation in the final Serie A weeks, and the club management decided to sack Beretta and appoint D'Angelo as caretaker for the three remaining matches. Under D'Angelo, Chievo ultimately managed to recover from their poor results, and escaped relegation in the end. For the following season, D'Angelo returned to serve as Chievo's assistant coach, this time working alongside Giuseppe Pillon. He then served as team scout from October 2006 to June 2008, leaving then Chievo in order to become head coach of Serie C2 team F.C. S√ºdtirol. He was however sacked only a few months later, on November 12, 2008, due to poor results.

Presumably it is identical with \\"Staodorf\\" (MHG 'on the bank') and can be deducted from \\"Stadelaren\\" which was already mentioned in the chronicles of Ebersberg Abbey.Siegfried Rehm: Die Stockdorfer, ihre H√§user und die Suche nach Stadelaren. Quellenforschungen 11.-19. Jahrhundert. Stockdorf: Verlag Siegfried Rehm. Between 1715 and 1745 the Bavarian prince-elector Max Emanuel enclosed a large piece of land in the south west of Munich as a park for coursing deer. .Projekt Hirschjagdpark  Galerie Royal In November 1734 the prince-elector and later emperor Carl Albrecht fell into the W√ºrm River while pursuing a boar. Having thus lost his horse he was forced to walk despite the frigid temperature to Grubm√ºhl. The scene of the prince changing clothes amongst his court is shown on one of the paintings by Horemans at Amalienburg.Norbert Hierl-Deronco: Es ist eine Lust zu bauen: von Bauherren, Bauleuten und vom Bauen im Barock in Kurbayern - Franken - Rheinland. Krailling: Verlag Hierl-Deronco, 2001. The reform of the Bavarian administration under Montgelas lead to the annexation of Stockdorf by Gauting between 1808 and 1818. When the new rail road from Munich to Starnberg (later extended to Garmisch) opened in 1854 Stockdorf got a train station which is still a regular stop to commuting trains. As the W√ºrm Valley became the typical suburban resort for wealthy citizens from the nearby Bavarian capital, the population of Stockdorf grew from 75 in 1866 to more than 1,500 in 1960. The village was especially popular for artists and many painters, illustrators and musicians settled there.

After Stockdorf became an independent Catholic parish in 1949 a new church was built by Hans Heps and consecrated to St. Vitus in 1953. Notable is the deep longing gable roof and the turret which give pleasant proportions to the stately structure. The eastern facade, above the main entrance of this westward oriented church, shows the fresco of St. Veit (Vitus) by Erich Schickling. The interior was modified after the Second Vatican Council.

The Lutheran church, a plain cubical building of fairfaced concrete, neighboured by an L-shaped vicarage was erected in 1959 by J. Semler and J. Haider. On the outside is a concrete relief, 'St. Peter on the water' by K. H. Hoffmann. In the interior is a baptistic window by Rupprecht Geiger (glued glass, 1960). Since the opening of the Railroad there is the 'gate house' at the former level crossing, a two-story brick building with overlapping gabled roof (ca. 1853/54). Stockdorf has a number of mansions and houses under preservation order dating before World War I which give the village its typical sight. This suburban architecture of high standards can still be found, for example at S√ºdstr. 15 (2005 by Felix Bemb√© and Sebastian Dellinger)Bayerische Architektenkammer (Hrsg.): Architektouren.

Economy  1929 the cosmetic manufacturer Franz Xaver Maier purchased a large neo-baroque facility at Zumpestr. Maier is known as one of the inventors of the permanent wave. Since 1908 the Webasto AG, one of the world's biggest automonitve suppliers is located in Stockdorf. From the former E√ülinger Draht- und Eisenwarenfabrik it was named after its founder Wilhelm Baier and the village WBS and later WeBaSto. At Wanneystr. 10 the electronic intelligence department of Bundesnachrichtendienst, the German federal intelligence is located, camouflaged as Bundesstelle f√ºr Fernmeldestatistik.

It was written and directed by Philip Kaufman in a cin√©ma v√©rit√© style and starred Cliff Robertson as Cole Younger, Robert Duvall as Jesse James, Luke Askew as Jim Younger, R. G. Armstrong as Clell Miller, John Pearce as Frank James, and Matt Clark as Bob Younger. The film purports to recreate the James- Younger Gang's most infamous escapade, the September 7, 1876, robbery of \\"the biggest bank west of the Mississippi\\" in Northfield, Minnesota. Plot In the mid-1870s, outlaws Jesse James, Cole Younger and their brothers are granted amnesty by the Missouri legislature, sympathetic to the troubles created for all citizens by the American Civil War. The bankers victimized by the James and Younger gangs are vehemently opposed to this action and hire a Pinkerton agent to follow the outlaws' every move. Younger has put aside plans to rob a bank in Northfield, Minnesota, said to be the largest west of the Mississippi River. The job appeals, however, to Jesse and Frank James, who have no intention of changing the way they make a living. Cole is ambushed by the Pinkerton's agent men, who use a prostitute as bait. And when the bankers succeed in overturning the amnesty by bribing the politicians, Cole travels by train to Minnesota to check out the bank. Once there, Cole discovers that townspeople are unwilling to risk placing their money in the bank due to concerns over its safety from thieves. Jesse, Frank, and their men arrive on horseback and, together with Cole, persuade the locals that a gold shipment is on its way, being delivered to the bank because it is supposed to be the safest possible place for it. Once the citizens begin banking their money, the robbery commences. Many things go wrong though, including one outlaw being locked inside a vault. Younger and his men flee to a nearby farm, but a posse tracks and apprehends them. The James brothers get away. But, when Jesse mentions to Frank his intention to permit Bob Ford to join the gang back in Missouri, his fate is sealed. Cast Production The film was shot in Jacksonville, Oregon. When discussing an offer for a role he was obliged to decline, Henry Winkler apparently refers to this film. http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/henry-winkler See also * List of American films of 1972 References External links  * Category:1972 films Category:1970s Western (genre) films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:English-language films Category:Biographical films about Jesse James Category:Films scored by Dave Grusin Category:Films about bank robbery Category:Films directed by Philip Kaufman Category:Films set in 1876 Category:Films set in Minnesota Category:Films shot in Oregon Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Revisionist Western ","title":"The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"},{"id":"18162840","text":"CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) is a nuclear and particle physics detector located in the experimental Hall B at Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, Virginia, United States. It is used to study the properties of the nuclear matter by the collaboration of over 200 physicists (CLAS Collaboration) from many countries all around the world. The 0.5 to 12.0 GeV electron beam from the accelerator of Jefferson Laboratory is brought into \\"Hall B\\", the experimental hall that houses the CLAS system. Electrons or photons in the incoming beam collide with the nuclei of atoms in the physics \\"target\\" located at the center of CLAS. These collisions generally produce new particles, often after the target nucleons (protons and neutrons) are briefly excited to heavier-mass versions of the familiar protons and neutrons. A whole variety of intermediate-mass short-lived particles called \\"mesons\\" can be created. Scattered electron as well as the longer-lived produced particles travel through the CLAS detector, where they are measured. Particle physicists use these measurements to deduce the underlying structure of protons and neutrons and to better understand the interactions that create these new particles. The CLAS detector system was operational from 1998 until May 2012. From that time onward, analysis of archived data continued for some years, as can be traced in the publications. Since 2012, a similar but new system called CLAS12 was constructed, which began operations with particle beams in 2017.  Overview of Detector Function  The CLAS detector was notable among devices in the area of hadronic particle physics in that it had a very large acceptance; in other words, it measured the momentum and angles of almost all of the particles produced in the electron-proton collisions. Roughly spherical, the detector measured 30 feet across. It surrounded the physics target, which was typically a small cylinder of liquid hydrogen (hydrogen's nucleus is composed of a single proton) or deuterium (with a nucleus consisting of a neutron and a proton). Each particle-target collision is called an \\"event\\". An elaborate data acquisition system records each event measured by the particle detectors, up to several thousand events per second on average. This data is then transferred to a \\"farm\\" of computing processors. Teams of physicists analyze the events, looking for new kinds of particles or information related to the underlying structure of the proton.  Detector Description  A diagram of the CLAS detector is shown in the Figure, as well as a photograph of the detector when it was partially pulled open for maintenance. The physics target is at the center. Charged particles are detected in almost all directions, excluding the very forward (beam) and backward (beam) directions, and also excluding azimuthal directions occupied by six toroidal magnetic field coils. The detector was designed in a nested form, with successive layers of particle detectors to either track particle paths or record particle flight-times. The toroidal magnet field causes charged particle from the target to bend in arcs either toward or away from the beam line. Particles leaving the target first pass through a timing counter to register the beginning of their trajectories. The particles then traverse three packages of drift chambers which are used to track their paths though the magnetic field, and thereby allow determination of their momentum. Outside the magnetic field, a layer of timing detectors measure the time of passage of the particles at a distance of about four meters from the target. Dividing the path length of a particle track by the time of travel gives the speed. Knowing the momentum and speed of a particle leads to its identification via its mass. The CLAS detector also contains additional detectors in the forward direction (Cherenkov counters and Electromagnetic Calorimeters) whose purpose is to distinguish electrons from other types of particles such as pions.  Physics Program  Two categories of experiments were carried out with CLAS: using electrons in the beam and using so-called real photons created using the electron beam. Experiments using electron scattering primarily probe the structure of protons and their excitations at various sub-nuclear \\"length scales\\". Experiments using real photon beams primarily probe the production and decay of mesons and excited baryons. A list of the scientific and technical papers resulting from the CLAS program is linked at the bottom of this article. The range of questions addressed is broad, as seen in the following list of topics given in no particular order: * Inelastic electron scattering on the nucleon to study the creation and decay of nucleon excited states * Hyperon photo- and electro-production, exploring the spectrum of ground state and excited strange baryons * Meson photoproduction off the nucleon, searching for mesonic states not accounted for in the quark model * Electro-disintegration of nuclear targets to study the correlations among nucleons within the nucleus * Deep-inelastic electron scattering with meson production using polarized beam and/or target to study the full 3D distribution of quarks inside the nucleon  Collaborating Institutions (Cumulative since 1989) * Arizona State University - Tempe, AZ * California State University - Dominguez Hills, CA * Carnegie Mellon University - Pittsburgh, PA * Catholic University of America - Washington, DC * CEA-Saclay - Gif-sur-Yvette, France * Christopher Newport University, Newport News, VA * Florida International University - Miami, FL * Florida State University - Tallahassee, FL * George Washington University - Washington, DC * Idaho State University - Pocatello, ID * INFN, Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati - Frascati, Italy * INFN, Sezione di Genova - Genova, Italy * Institut de Physique Nucl√©aire - Orsay, France * ITEP - Moscow, Russia * James Madison University - Harrisonburg, VA * Kyungpook University - Daegu, South Korea * Moscow State University - Moscow, Russia * Norfolk State University - Norfolk, VA * North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University - Greensboro, NC * Ohio University - Athens, OH * Old Dominion University - Norfolk, VA * Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - Troy, NY * Rice University - Houston, TX * The College of William and Mary - Williamsburg, VA * Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility - Newport News, VA * Union College - Schenectady, NY * Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a - Valpara√≠so, Chile * University of California Los Angeles - Los Angeles, CA * University of Connecticut - Storrs, CT *University of Edinburgh - Edinburgh, Scotland * University of Glasgow - Glasgow, Scotland * University of Massachusetts - Amherst, MA * University of New Hampshire - Durham, NH * Universit√© Paris-Sud 11 - Orsay, France * University of Richmond - Richmond, VA * University of South Carolina - Columbia, SC * University of Virginia - Charlottesville, VA * Virginia Polytechnic Institute - Blacksburg, VA * Yerevan Physics Institute - Yerevan, Armenia  Similar Facilities World Wide  *Mainz Microtron *LEPS *HERA *HERMES External links * Official Hall-B web page at Jefferson Lab  List of Publications  * The CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS) technical description * A list of CLAS publications from INSPIRE-HEP Category:Spectrometers Category:Particle experiments ","title":"CLAS detector"},{"id":"18162844","text":"Guinea-Bissau‚ÄìRussia relations is the bilateral foreign relations between the two countries, Guinea-Bissau and Russia. Soviet-era relations Relations between the Soviet Union and the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), led by Am√≠lcar Cabral, began in the 50th anniversary year of the establishment of the USSR, and intensified in 1961, when training and arming of the party began. In 1965, the first group of 75 PAIGC leaders began training at a Soviet military school in Perevalne, where they were taught skills in the manufacture and use of explosives and guerrilla tactics. The Soviet Union and Guinea-Bissau established diplomatic relations on 6 October 1973. In 1973, the Soviets began to supply the PAIGC with Strela 2 ground-to-air missiles for use in its war with the Portuguese. On 21 February 1975, a number of agreements were signed by the two states, covering economic, technical, cultural and scientific co-operation, a trade agreement and an air services agreement. From 1974 to 1983, Soviet Union was the sole supplier of arms to Guinea-Bissau. After a visit by Am√≠lcar Cabral to Moscow in 1961, the Soviets formally established ties with the armed revolutionary group African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The Soviets gave weaponry to PAIGC guerrillas, including bazookas, rocket-propelled grenades, AK-47 rifles, and eventually (shortly after the assassination of Am√≠lcar Cabral) Strela-2 missiles.Peter Karibe Mendy & Richard A. Lobban Jr., \\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)/Russia, Relations With\\" in Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau (4th ed.: Scarecrow Press, 2013), pp. 407-10. The Soviets also provided guerrilla-warfare training for PAIGC fighters at Perevalne, Ukraine, as well as training for nurses. On February 21, 1975, the Soviets and Bussau-Guineans signed a bilateral accord providing for close ties; as part of the agreement, Aeroflot flew Bissau-Guinean students to the Soviet Union for training and education. Between 1973 and 1992, about 3,000 young Bissau-Guineans studied on scholarships in the Soviet Union; an additional 3,000 scholarships came from Cuba, and 61 from East Germany. Many other such cultural, economic, and technical treaties were signed between the two nations.A Calendar of Soviet Treaties: 1974-1980 (ed. George Ginsburgs: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987), p. 450. Soviet-Guinea- Bissau ties weakened after the USSR began to collapse in 1991.

Russian Federation relations =Diplomatic ties= On 31 December 1991, Guinea Bissau recognised the Russian Federation as the successor state of the Soviet Union, after the latter's dissolution. Guinea- Bissau has an embassy in Moscow, and Russia has an embassy in Bissau. Russian citizens and embassy staff were evacuated from Guinea-Bissau in 1998 due to fighting between government and rebel forces. The current Ambassador of Russia to Guinea-Bissau is Mikhail Valinsky, who was appointed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 1 December 2008. The current Ambassador of Guinea-Bissau to Russia is Rog√©rio Ara√∫jo Adolfo Herbert, who presented his Letter of Credence to then-President of Russia Boris Yeltsin on 14 August 1997. =Political ties= In August 2001, Russia forgave eighty percent of Guinea-Bissau's debt, which was reported to be valued at US$178 million. On 1 March 2009, Jo√£o Bernardo Vieira, the President of Guinea-Bissau was assassinated by a group of Guinea-Bissauan soldiers. Russia condemned the assassination, and in noting its solidarity with the views of the African Union, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated it is \\"against the forceful change of power\\". =Cultural ties= Mr Helbert was held hostage in the embassy in Moscow in January 2005 by students from Guinea-Bissau who were protesting at their stipends not being paid.

It operates the Boeing E-4 aircraft conducting airborne command and control missions. The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to 25 September 1917, when it was organized at Fort Omaha, Nebraska. It served overseas in France as part of the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. The squadron saw combat during World War II, and became part of the Strategic Air Command during the Cold War. History =World War and Balloon School= The first predecessor of the squadron was organized at Fort Omaha Nebraska in September 1917 as Company A, 2d Balloon Squadron. Two months later it departed for overseas service on the Western Front (World War I), arriving in France in January 1918. It entered combat as an observation unit with the French Eighth Army on 19 April 1918, operating observation balloons over the front lines. Once forces of the American Expeditionary Forces, had built up, it continued to operate as the 1st Balloon Company with the American I Corps until 17 October 1918. Following the end of the war, it served with III Corps as part of the occupation forces until April 1919. =Interwar years= In the spring of 1919, the squadron returned to the United States and was stationed at Ross Field, California as part of the Air Service Balloon School. In June 1922, the Balloon School moved to Scott Field, Illinois and Ross Field was closed as a military installation. The squadron was inactivated with the closure of Ross. The second predecessor of the squadron, also designated the 1st Balloon Company, was activated at Scott in May 1929. After a brief period of training with the 21st Airship Group at Scott, it moved to Post Field, located on Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where it was assigned to the Field Artillery School. It trained and conducted exercises with the school. At the beginning of World War II, it operated barrage balloons, but that mission was assigned to the coast artillery and the squadron was disbanded two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. =World War II= The third predecessor of the squadron was activated in April 1942 at Long Beach Army Air Base as the 1st Air Corps Ferrying Squadron, the location of a Douglas Aircraft Company manufacturing plant. It ferried aircraft from the Douglas factory and other factories in the Western Procurement District to overseas departure points. However, the Army Air Forces was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were not well adapted to the training and logistics support mission. Accordingly it adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 In March 1944, Air Transport Command units assigned to the 6th Ferrying Group were combined into the 556th AAF Base Unit. =Airborne command and control= On 1 June 1962, Headquarters Command organized the 1000th Airborne Command Control Squadron at Andrews Air Force Base to operate the National Emergency Airborne Command Post and assigned it to the 1001st Air Base Wing.Mueller, p. 12 By 1965, the squadron was operating Boeing EC-135 aircraft to support this mission. On 1 July 1969, the 1st Airborne Command Control Squadron was activated and assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 1000th Squadron.Although the 1st Squadron was a new organization, it was also entitled to retain the honors (but not the history or lineage) of the 1000th. This includes an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award earned for the period 1 January 1967 ‚Äì 31 December 1968. AF Pamphlet 900-2, p. 484 In 1974, the squadron began to replace its EC-135s with more capable Boeing E-4s, completing the upgrade the following year. In November 1975, the squadron was reassigned from Andrews' 1st Composite Wing to the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. On 1 July 1977, it moved to joined the 55th Wing at OffuttOffutt Air Force Base occupies much of the same ground as Fort Omaha did in 1917, when the 2d Balloon Squadron was organized there.

She appeared in over 20 films between 1941 and 1947.  Early years  Slater's father was Edward Slater, who was described in a 1942 newspaper article as a \\"celebrated painter\\", and her mother was an actress. Slater's education came in Switzerland.  Career  Slater initially had a contract with Paramount, but she received her release after a year and began working for other studios. Modern viewers will recognize Slater for her roles in two Three Stooges films from the 1940s. She was the rumba dancing partner of Curly Howard in Three Smart Saps. Standing nearly six feet tall, Slater towers over the short Stooge, and then manages to tear off his trousers, thanks to the pants being loosely basted. Slater also appeared as Lulu Quackenbush in Half- Wits Holiday, with Curly eating her lipstick, thinking it is edible. Thanks to the popularity of the Stooges, Slater is seen almost daily worldwide due to the films' constant television broadcasts. Slater also appears in Charlie Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux, as the florist who eavesdrops on Monsieur Verdoux's telephone seduction of his next intended victim. In addition to her film work, Slater was a model at the John Robert Powers Agency in the early 1940s.  Personal life  Slater left Hollywood in 1947, and married character actor Robert Foulk on July 3 of that year. They were married until his death in 1989. Slater was later married to Charles Sims until her death on October 14, 1997.Capello, Bill.

The screenplay, written by Ephron and her sister, Delia Ephron, is based on the book, This Is Your Life, by Meg Wolitzer.  Synopsis  The film tells the story of Dottie Ingels (Julie Kavner), who works at a cosmetics counter but aspires to be a stand-up comedian. Ingels' Aunt Harriet dies and leaves the family her home in Queens which Ingels then sells to move to an apartment in Manhattan. Ingels' comedy career starts to take off with the help of her agent, Arnold Moss (Dan Aykroyd) and Moss's assistant, Claudia Curtis (Carrie Fisher). Ingels' children, Erica (Samantha Mathis) and Opal (Gaby Hoffmann) get angry at Dottie because they hardly ever see her. Erica and Opal then run away to find their father in upstate Albany, whom Opal doesn't even remember, only being 1 or 2 years old when he left them. The character portrayed by Aykroyd, Arnold Moss, is based on the famous New York talent agent Sam Cohn, and has some of the eccentricities for which Cohn was known, such as a habit of eating paper. Cast Production The film was at Columbia Pictures but was put into turnaround in 1990. Ephron allegedly asked Jon Peters if he had read the script who answered that \\"I've made over 60 movies. I don't have to read a script to know whether it works or not.\\"  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack was performed by Carly Simon and released on Qwest Records. Although the album failed to chart, the single \\"Love of My Life\\" reached #16 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.  Release  = Reception = This Is My Life was met with lukewarm critical responses.

It is for ages 11-16\\\\. It has about 1,750 pupils, making it the largest school in Sheffield. History Ecclesfield School opened as \\"Ecclesfield Grammar School\\" in 1931. Its foundation was largely due to the efforts of Lady Mabel Smith, a Labour councillor on the West Riding County Council, and daughter of Earl Fitzwilliam. Lady Mabel was Chairman of the School Governors from 1931 to her death in 1951. In 1931 Ecclesfield Grammar School provided for three streams of 30 pupils, increased to five in 1952 with an annual intake of 150 and a total number on roll of 800; by this time 2,500 pupils had been admitted. Following integration with Hunshelf pupil intake increased further. Total pupil numbers during the 36 years the school operated as a grammar school was approximately 4,450, and approximately 10,000 since it became a comprehensive. Major extensions to the school were made in 1952-53, including Lady Mabel Hall, kitchens and classrooms, and separate science and craft blocks. Further building undertaken during the 1960s included a sports hall with changing rooms and a multi-story classroom block, with the gymnasium from the previous building converted into a library. Concurrently, a separate Hunshelf School was built on part of the playing fields. During the 1950s new entrants were allocated to forms according to surname alphabetical order, and were allotted to a \\"house\\", Strafford, Bront√´, Fairfax or Priestley, for weekly assembly and competitive sports. In 1967 the School became Ecclesfield Comprehensive School after amalgamating with Hunshelf Secondary Modern School, and served the areas of Ecclesfield, Chapeltown, Hoyland, Elsecar, High Green, Bradfield, Stannington, Grenoside, Oughtibridge and Wharncliffe Side, on the southern boundary of the West Riding of Yorkshire between Sheffield and Barnsley. Initially, it remained separate from Hunshelf School, but the two schools later amalgamated to form an enlarged Ecclesfield Comprehensive, run by Sheffield City Council. Again, major building work took place in the school in the early 21st century, as the Priory, Wharncliffe and Cowley blocks were built (often shortened to just P, W, and C) as well as the new canteen and car park. It was here where the school gained its 'Specialist in visual and performing arts' status. On 1 April 2014, the school converted to academy status. Drama The school has drama and music studios, and a theatre with tiered seating and lighting system. Productions include musicals and serious dramas. Ecclesfield School teachers Paul O'Farrell and Ben Smithard wrote and directed the play Exit Stage Left which was performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in July & August 2012, and was well-reviewed in the local Sheffield Star. The play won the Yorkshire music and drama award. They have also directed musicals and plays which take place in the school's Lady Mabel Hall annually. Academic performance At GCSE, the school performs below average for Sheffield LEA. In a report from 2017 the school achieved \\"Inadequate\\" in its Ofsted Report.

It is noticeably smaller than mainstream and travel magazines, measuring 4.75 in. x 8.5 in. only. Sidetrip is distributed at the Department of Tourism Information Center (T.M. Kalaw, Manila), Victory Liner terminals (for deluxe passengers), travel agencies, and select cafes and restaurants in Metro Manila. It is published by Pico Integrated Marketing Agency.  History  Sidetrip began as the onboard magazine of Victory Liner, one of the oldest and biggest bus transit companies operating in North Luzon. Its maiden issue came out in December 2007 and was presented as the bimonthly (once every two months) alternative travel guide to northern Philippines. However, it was only after three issues before the magazine was formally presented to the press during its official launch party held on April 24, 2008 at Eastwood City, Libis, Quezon City. The first issue featured tourist attractions of Baguio, the country's summer capital and trade capital of Cordillera Administrative Region. Also included were tourism activities such as ukay-ukay (sidewalk vendors selling second-hand clothes, bags, and other items), along with short but informative features and directory listing of Baguio's hotels, resorts and art-inspired restaurants. The second issue, the Pampanga issue was released in February 2008 and focused on Pampanga's cuisine, deemed to be the best in the Philippines. Notable features were the exotic fare such as camaru and halo-halo, one of Filipino's favorite summer treat and dessert which literally translates to \\"mixed-mixed\\" and is made with sweetened fruits, yam, leche flan, milk and shaved ice. More importantly, it gave a rundown of Pampanga's best restaurants. Sidetrip also further delved into history and culture, with articles on Pampanga's prehispanic or pre- Spanish) history. In its third issue, Sidetrip introduced several changes in its look and content. From a bimonthly magazine, Sidetrip changed its frequency to quarterly (April to June). It also noticeably improved its content by including brief and informative travel stories and a fashion section. The hotel and directory listing too was given a face lift, with its new reader-friendly reviews and layout. But the best improvement would be its map, a detailed adventure map to Zambales, complete with hotel and attraction listings, restaurants, bus stations and gasoline stations.

It stars Jeff Bridges, Ellen Barkin, John Hurt and Diane Lane. The film was distributed by United Artists. It was written and directed by Walter Hill, with writing credits also going to Pete Dexter, author of the book Deadwood, and Thomas Babe, author of the play Fathers and Sons. The film has been described as a \\"psychedelic Western\\". Plot At Wild Bill Hickok's (Jeff Bridges) funeral, his friend Charley Prince (John Hurt) explains his final days in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. Calamity Jane (Ellen Barkin) mourns him especially. In a flashback, Bill and his friend California Joe come upon an Indian burial structure with a lone warrior. Joe, who speaks the language, says that the warrior wishes to kill Bill for killing his father and wife. Despite Joe's warning that killing Indians is bad luck, Bill kills the warrior. The ensuing scenes show Bill killing five men in a saloon after one knocks off his hat; as Marshal he then kills several soldiers after one crushes his hat at the bar. Ultimately he's seen breaking up a riot by killing its leader and inadvertently shooting his own deputy. He then retires from the law and works as an actor in a Wild West show. Years later he sees a doctor who diagnoses him with glaucoma. Eventually winding up in Cheyenne, an old rival, Will Plummer (Bruce Dern) whom Bill crippled calls him out. To \\"even the odds,\\" Bill has some men tie him to a chair and carry him into the street. After an exchange, he kills Plummer. Bill and Charley travel to Deadwood, where he is greeted with fanfare. He reunites with Calamity Jane and they go into a saloon. There, a young drifter named Jack McCall (David Arquette) claims he intends to kill Bill. Bill's entourage berate him and throw him into the street. Joe then begins telling an exaggerated tale of how Bill killed several men; Bill grows upset, leaves the saloon and goes to a Chinese opium den. After smoking, Bill has a dream about a time he and Joe were threatened by Indians for killing Buffalo, which disturbs him. A woman who works at the den tells a whore that knows Jack, Luline (Christina Applegate), that Bill was there, and she tells Jack. Meanwhile, Bill and Jane share a bath, and argue because Bill will not explain his distant and unusual behavior. The next day a mob brings Jack to Bill; Jack tells Bill that he aims to kill him because Bill mistreated his mother, Suzanne. Despite Charley trying to apologize for Bill and the mob harassing him, Jack does not relent. That night, some men approach Jack and offer to help him kill Bill. He agrees to employ them but admits he has no plan yet. Bill goes back to the den and reminisces about the night he met Suzanne. It is revealed that he left town for 6 months and she married another man, who took his pocket watch. The man draws on Bill and Bill kills him; Suzanne is distraught and a young Jack witnesses the killing. While incapacitated by the opium, Jack sneaks up on Bill to shoot him, but the den owner attacks Jack and takes him away. Jack and his posse agree on a new plan as Bill recuperates in the opium den, bemoaning his bad luck. That night, he returns to the saloon, which is empty because a gold vein was discovered nearby and everyone left. He and Jane reminisce on their affair and begin having sex. Jack and his posse enter the saloon and apprehend Jane, Bill, Joe and Charley. Jack delays killing Bill because he isn't sure how he wants to do it. Bill has one final remembrance of visiting Suzanne in a mental hospital who, despite his apologies, refuses his help. Jack offers to let Bill kill himself and hands him a loaded gun; he tricks Bill and hands him an empty gun knowing that Bill will try to kill him. Regardless, Jack claims he has already killed Bill \\"in his heart,\\" and the posse leave. Jane goes upstairs to retrieve Bill's guns; Bill catches the posse in a barn readying their horses and kills everyone but Jack. He tells Jack he is sparing him out of respect for his mother. Jack asks if he can have one last drink before leaving town, and they return to the saloon. In the bar, Joe resumes telling stories of Bill's antics. Jack pulls a hidden gun from his sleeve, gathers his nerve and shoots Bill in the back of the head. Back at his funeral, Charley says the whole town attended the funeral, and he was honored to be Bill's friend.

One of them was the play Fathers and Sons which had been on Broadway in 1978, directed by Joseph Papp. It was written by Thomas Babe, and focused on Hickok's last days in Deadwood, placing the action in the saloon where he was killed. Babe says he entirely made up the nature of Jack McCall, whom he turned into Hickok's illegitimate son. Babe's play was seen in Los Angeles in 1980 by Walter Hill, who had been considering a film on Hickok. Hill optioned the play along with a screenplay about Hickok by Ned Wynn. Meanwhile, the team of Richard and Lili Zanuck had optioned a 1986 novel about Hickok called Deadwood. They had hired the author to write the script for the movie Rush. The Zanucks said they were interested in the project because it explored the nature of celebrity in a Western context. \\"Figures like Wild Bill were like rock stars,\\" said Lili Zanuck. \\"They had sex appeal.\\" Dexter wrote a script based on his novel which was sent to Barry Levinson and Sydney Pollack before going to Hill. \\"He's a gutsy director,\\" Zanuck said about Hill. \\"He's kind of a male-oriented director, and he has great knowledge of the West and all of the folklore and all of the heroes.\\" Hill wrote a script based on the play, the novel, and Ned Wynn's screenplay. Hill says he took details of the town from the novel but the relationship between McCall and Hickok was mostly from the play. Hill took material from Dexter's novel for the atmosphere of the town and relied on Babe's play heavily for the third act, the last hours of Hickok. Hill said the script was based on \\"character rather than incident. Because I think it's not so much the fights, it's his personality, his sense of humor about himself. He seemed to understand his own legend. He both fueled it and was a prisoner of it, that it was his raison d'etre, and at the same time he felt himself very constrained by it.\\" The Zanucks and Walter Hill took the script to John Calley, president of United Artists, and the film was green-lighted at the end of January 1995. Jeff Bridges and Ellen Barkin signed to star. Westerns revived in popularity in the early 90s with Dances with Wolves and Unforgiven. However, some other Westerns had been box office disappointments including Wyatt Earp and Hill's own Geronimo. Producer Richard Zanuck said, \\"If you make a good picture and have a compelling story to tell, it's going to work. I don't believe that any genre dies. It just has to be fed with good product.\\" =Shooting= Hill said that Jeff Bridges was \\"an actor I greatly love... a very nice man, decent, hard working, got along well, no problems\\" but that there \\"was always a kind of tension between Jeff and myself\\" because \\"Jeff does a lot of takes, I don't. My focus is very intense, but when it gets to be you just doing it again and again I lose it and I find an awful lot of performers go stale. He would always have an idea he thought he could make something better.\\"\\"Interview with Walter Hill Chapter 4\\" Directors Guild of America accessed 12 July 2014 Reception =Critical= The film received a 44% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 25 reviews; the average rating is 5.24/10. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, criticizing its pacing and plot. He recognized the film's ambition, aiming for \\"elegy\\" and \\"poetry\\" in its final act, but ultimately described it as flawed, writing, \\"We can see where it's headed, although it doesn't get there.\\"Ebert, Roger (1995-12-01). \\"Wild Bill.\\" Film review.

Synopsis Humanity has colonized the solar system and moved outward to begin exploring the far reaches of the galaxy. An interplanetary audience follows real-life stories of triumph and tragedy presented to them by Duncan Chalk, a media mogul with apparently limitless resources. Chalk, unknown to all around him, is a kind of psychic vampire who draws sustenance from the emotions of others, particularly those of pain and trauma. Though he enjoys playing his inner circle of assistants against each other as a sort of daily snack, Chalk's true nourishment comes from the dramas he orchestrates for his audience. Chalk's latest drama involves the pairing of Minner Burris, a space explorer who was captured and surgically altered by aliens on the planet Manipool, and Lona Kelvin, a 17-year-old girl who donated eggs for a fertility experiment that produced a hundred babies. Burris, whose freakish appearance draws attention whenever he ventures out in public, has withdrawn into seclusion and bitterness. Kelvin, whose brief fame as the virgin mother of an army of children has begun to fade, has twice attempted suicide because she has not been allowed to adopt or even see any of her offspring. Chalk promises Burris a full round of surgery and treatment to restore his human appearance, and offers Kelvin a chance to adopt one of her babies, if the two agree to come together for an all-expenses paid tour of the solar system. At first the two wounded subjects enjoy each other's company and even become lovers. Kelvin's empathy and compassion are stirred by Burris's plight, and Burris enjoys playing masculine protector and guide to the naive teenager. The affection soon curdles into irritation, hostility and even hatred‚Äîall of which provide a psychic feast for Chalk. The two finally break off after a particularly vicious fight, which Chalk uses as a pretext to void the agreement. He does, however, try to keep them on the hook by dangling new offers: for example, he asks Kelvin to befriend David Melangio, a childlike man whose feats of memory and calculation are his only means of meeting a world that has already subjected him to overwhelming traumas. Kelvin erupts in rage and is carried off by Chalk's assistants. Burris, meanwhile, has a sexual fling with Elise, the widow of an astronaut who accompanied Burris on the Manipool landing, and who died from the surgical alterations performed by the aliens. Elise is both aroused and repulsed by Burris' body, and the sadomasochistic nature of her attraction eventually alienates Burris. His withdrawal causes her to commit suicide in a particularly grisly fashion. Burris, deeply shaken, returns to Earth. He has realized that Chalk's promise was empty, and that such help may no longer even be possible‚Äîthe changes wrought by the Manipool aliens appear irreversible. What's more, the surgery that turned him into a monster has also \\"improved\\" his body in unexpected ways that Burris has come to appreciate. With the inadvertent help of Melangio, who during a typically bland chat lets slip some information that gives them clues into Chalk's true nature, Kelvin and Burris confront the media baron in his office. They expose the full, unfiltered core of their mutual pain to Chalk, who is overwhelmed and finally killed by the intensity of the emotional flood. As the novel ends, Burris has convinced Kelvin to join him in a trip back to Manipool, where they will confront the aliens and, presumably, undergo alterations that take them beyond humanity. Themes The line \\"Pain is instructive\\" opens and closes the story. It is first delivered by Chalk, and provides ominous foreshadowing; it is later uttered by Burris, who has accepted his condition and come to see the pain it causes as a means toward growth. This theme is illustrated throughout the story in various ways. David Melangio, whose inner defenses have completely isolated him from memories of his terribly unhappy childhood, cannot face his pain and therefore will never become a fully realized adult. Burris appreciates cacti and thorny succulents, and when Kelvin complains about thorns on a cactus, Burris praises the thorn as an elegant evolutionary adaptation to a hostile environment. The science behind Lona's fertility experiment was quite novel for the late 60s, but has since become commonplace, and is one of the few dated elements in the novel. By contrast, the idea of mass media serving as theater, and being used as a tool to manipulate and exploit vulnerable people, has only become more timely with the rise of reality shows and the like on television. \\"The title describes the book: prickly, rough in texture, a sharp book,\\" Silverberg writes in his memoir Other Spaces, Other Times. \\"I worked quickly, often managing twenty pages or more, yet making no concessions to conventions of standard science fiction.\\" (p 116) His ambitions for the book were vindicated when Thorns was published in August 1967: \\"All of Ballantine's science fiction titles were then automatically being distributed free to members of the two- year-old Science Fiction Writers of America, and so all my colleagues had copies in hand at the time of that year's sf convention. Many of them had read it, and -- as I hoped -- it shook their image of my work. At least a dozen of my friends told me, with the frankness of true friendship, that the book had amazed them: not that they thought me incapable of writing it, but rather that I would be willing to take the trouble. It seemed such a radical break from my formularized science fiction of the 1950s that they thought of it as the work of some entirely new Robert Silverberg.\\" (p 117) Algis Budrys wrote of his surprise that \\"Silverberg is now writing deeply detailed, highly educated, beautifully figured books like Thorns\\" despite still producing 10,000 words a day. Brian Stableford, writing in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 1107. called Thorns \\"a stylized novel of alienation and psychic vampirism,\\"Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 1106. saying that together with Hawksbill Station it marked \\"a new phase of RS' career, in which he brought the full range of his artistic abilities to bear on writing sf.\\" After an initial burst of competent but callow science fiction work, and a brief layover in which he researched and wrote demanding nonfiction books, Silverberg returned to the genre with a remarkable series of novels written to higher standards of characterization, themes and literary quality. Thorns has several thematic parallels with Silverberg's contemporaneous novel The Man in the Maze. In both novels, the hero has been unwillingly altered by aliens (physically in Thorns, psychically in The Man in the Maze) and become an embittered outcast; the protagonists expose the full core of their inner torment in order to achieve victory over a seemingly invincible opponent; both stories conclude with the protagonists choosing to embrace an untenable, even inhuman way of life. Allusions While working on Thorns, Silverberg came across an Italian science fiction magazine that criticized one of his early novels as badly done and wordy -- malcondotto e prolisse in the original Italian. Silverberg promptly named Minner Burris' fellow astronauts Malcondotto and Prolisse. (Other Spaces, Other Times, p 116) Oliver Sacks name-checks Thorns in \\"The Twins\\", an essay included in his 1985 collection The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. The twins of the title are a pair of autistic savants who enjoyed brief fame on television for performing feats of memory and calculation, though they themselves were incapable of living without close institutional care. Sacks compares their speech and behavior with that of David Melangio and speculates that Silverberg was familiar with them when he wrote Thorns. Silverberg makes no mention of them in his memoir. Thorns has some interesting thematic parallels with The Man in the Maze, published two years later. Both novels center on an embittered man altered by contact with an alien race, and who is coaxed out of hiding by a morally ambiguous character with a hidden agenda. The threat in each novel is nullified when the protagonist exposes the unfiltered core of his being to a telepathic receptor. Many of Silverberg's best-known stories explore the darker aspects of telepathy and psychic powers. In Thorns, Duncan Chalk's telepathic abilities have turned him into an emotional vampire leeching off the pain of others. In the novels Dying Inside and The Second Trip, telepathy blights lives and turns characters into self-hating voyeurs. Silverberg's celebrated short story \\"Flies\\" centers on a spacefarer who commits terrible acts against former loved ones so that their anguish may be studied by distant aliens. In another famous story, \\"Passengers,\\" disembodied aliens enter the minds of unwilling human hosts and distort their behavior, bringing civilization to the brink of collapse.

This process eliminates the steps required for die-cutting and compression molding, as it manufactures the foam and the product simultaneously. The base resin used in a complex formula, is an ethylene based polyolefin elastomer (like polyethylene and EVA). Foam manufactured with these resins has many physical benefits. Unlike a sponge, foams from this process are closed-cell, meaning it's waterproof and resists mold, mildew and bacteria from entering the material. It is also cross-linked, which means that the cells are connected in a way that makes the foam strong and durable with high tear and tensile strength. All polyolefin elastomers are also resistant to most chemicals, which allow the products to not only be used in a chemical environment, but also very cleanable with most household cleaners. The process itself is known to be very interesting, because the injected compound is not foam, until an endothermic reaction in a hot mold activates the blowing agents, resulting in an expanded foam part. This requires the mold cavity size to be smaller than the final part. The actual known expansion is created within the formula, so that when the part \\"self- ejects\\" from the mold at the end of the cycle, it grows to the required part size. The cavity for a tire is considerably smaller than the final tire size. This process is valuable for any foam product that needs to have lots of detail. It needs to be very durable.

The CAMEO system integrates a chemical database and a method to manage the data, an air dispersion model, and a mapping capability. All modules work interactively to share and display critical information. The CAMEO system is available in Macintosh and Windows formats.  Origin  CAMEO initially was developed because NOAA recognized the need to assist first responders with easily accessible and accurate response information.

Ondrusch was an active artist in Silesian towns and villages at the time when they belonged to the German Empire and later when they were part of Weimar Republic and the Third Reich since 1919 and 1933 respectively. After the Second World War he moved to Germany when his hometown was included in the territory of post-war communist- ruled Poland in 1945. Biography =Early years= Ondrusch's wooden carving of the crucified Christ, parish church in G≈Çubczyce, formerly his home town of Leobsch√ºtzOndrusch was born to Paul Ondrusch and Anna Granel as their third child.Genealogy.net: Lokal Heritage Book Leobsch√ºtz/ Paul Alois Anton Ondrusch His father was an artist who specialized in carpentry and wished his son would go into the same profession, preparing him for it in his own workshop. Paul's talent was soon discovered when he started to carve wooden sculptures. After finishing primary school education, he was sent to a school in W√ºrbenthal in which he was taught xylography. A year later, he was able to leave that school because of his extraordinary abilities. In 1890 he made a wooden sculpture of the Christ for the Catholic Church in Leobsch√ºtz (now G≈Çubczyce in Poland). Apart from that sculpture, he also contributed to numerous projects as well as the creation of other works including a pulpit in the Trinity Church (nowadays the closed Church of St. Anne) and Saint Florian's altar in Leobsch√ºtz.Schmidt, J. =Academic studies= Having finished W√ºrbenthal school, in November 1894 Ondrusch started his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich where he was recognized and awarded for his life-size statue of the biblical figure, Judas Iscariot,Oberschlesien im Bild, pg. 6 during the fourth year of his study. His teacher was Syrius Eberle. At the age of twenty-two, he was welcomed with open arms anywhere he went. Despite his early age, he was many a time offered the position of professor. However, he did not accept the offers. He decided to devote his artistic work to religious art.Maler, K. 1996 That choice was inspired by Ondrusch's deep Catholic beliefs which had been instilled in him by his devout family. Most of his works were crosses, altars, pulpits and figures of the saints with a particular emphasis on the figures of The Virgin Mary.Schmidt, J. =Further work= As an Academy graduate, he returned to his place of birth, Leobsch√ºtz, where he again started to work in Paul Ondrusch senior's workshop where he painted and carved in wood and stone. It was then that many of his works came into existence. These included sculptures for local schools (e.g., a monument for the deceased students and teachers; and an altar in the chapel of a local gymnasium) as well as for churches located in the nearest area, but also in Neisse; K√∂nigsh√ºtte; Langenbielau; and Anklam. He carved among other things, a figure of Saint Mary (sandstone, St. Anne Church); figure of Saint John (oakwood); and figures of Saint Francis, Saint Anthony and Saint Michael defeating the devil. Other works included organ balustrades, confessionals and Stations of the Cross. Grateful for the support from Hans Georg von Oppersdorff (born 1866), who financed Ondrusch's studies, Ondrusch became the creator of several notable works, including a lifesize statue of Jesus for the Oppersdorffs family tombstone; busts of the members of that family; and a statue of Saint Dorothea which was subsequently cast in bronze. All of the mentioned works have been reported missing after the war. Nevertheless, Ondrusch's artistry can be evaluated and described on the basis of the two works of art which have remained in Oberglogau, north of his family town, Leobsch√ºtz. One of them is a sandstone sculpture of Christ carrying the cross (1903, with a meaningful gesture of a raised hand). This work can be found on a defensive wall between a monastery and the building of a former city guard in Oberglogau (now G≈Çog√≥wek in Poland). The other work is a wooden figure of Saint Mary with the Infant Jesus which can be currently seen in the Regional Museum in G≈Çog√≥wek, but it used to be placed in a local castle's chapel.Szyndzielorz, A. Paul Ondrusch was also the creator of other sculpted tombstones and busts that decorated buildings' fronts. These first ones included the figure of Saint John the Baptist placed in the old cemetery in Leobsch√ºtz in 1924.Schmidt, J. Ondrusch's wooden sculpture of Remus von Woyrsch, a German Field Marshal General, decorated the main hall in the town hall of Leobsch√ºtz. General von Woyrsch was portrayed as a knight wearing a coat and a chain mail, with his hands placed on a handle of a large sword resting against the ground. That work has not withstood the destruction of the building, bombed in March 1945 and pulled down during the following years.Maler, K. 2008 The mentioned busts decorating buildings' fronts were similar to cartouches placed above main buildings' doors. Those bas-reliefs, created by Ondrusch, decorated buildings constructed in the years 1922-1923 in Leobsch√ºtz and they portrayed Saint Hedwig with a church in the background; Saint Joseph with Jesus; Saint Martin with a coat with which he covers the needy; Saint Anne with Jesus; Saint Elizabeth with the roses; the Holy Family escaping from Egypt; the Franciscan saints; Saint George who kills a dragon; and the Madonna, this single sculpture being exceptionally done in limewood. The material used for these carvings was taken from earthworks carried out during the construction of a sports field. The newly done carvings were then transported to the master potter's workshop where they were fired in a kiln. Afterwards, the sculptures were coloured and then placed above the doors of the building. Some of these cartouches measured in length and in height, whereas others were round. Ondrusch was commissioned by the municipal authorities of Gleiwitz to do a sculpture of crucified Christ and mourning witnesses, which was erected at the Lime trees Cemetery in Petersdorf (now Szobiszowice; a district of Gleiwitz). He was also asked to sculpt a monument dedicated to seventy-six children who were killed in a theatre in 1919. The latter work is one that is characterized as modest in its message. It portrays the children embraced by Jesus and is situated in front of a flat stone. Originally, it also included an inscription in German which could be translated as follows: \\"Come to me children,\\" and \\"In memory of 76 children of Gleiwitz who died a violent death on March 24, 1919.\\"Pokorska, E. Apart from these works, Ondrusch also created several other works for the All Saints' Church in Gleiwitz (now Polish Gliwice).Schmidt, J. Ondrusch presented his works at annual exhibitions in Gleiwitz; Hindenburg; and Oppeln. One trace leads to Ostwestfalen. In 1927, Paul Ondrusch met his future son-in-law, Anton Spilker (fianc√© of his daughter Elsa), who came from his father's cabinetmaker's workshop in Steinheim, Westphalia, and profiled himself as a furniture designer. It came to a cooperation when the workshop of Anton Spilker senior in Steinheim was commissioned to make an oak plaque for the classmates fallen in the World War by the association of former high school students. Paul Ondrusch created in his unique style the middle cross-shaped sculpture with the risen Christ as Lord of life and death. After the shipment of the core piece from Leobsch√ºtz to Steinheim, the panel was produced in its entirety in the Steinheimer carpentry, and Anton Spilker junior cut in the inscriptions and names of the fallen. It was then solemnly unveiled on October 23, 1928 and found its place in the music hall of the high school. Today, the Furniture Museum Steinheim is the repository. Nowadays, the artist Ondrusch and the works of art preserved in Silesia are being honored again in Poland. In the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany there are hardly any works in the generally accessible, religious or public space. So he is largely forgotten as an artist and person in Germany today. As an exception, there are the institutions of the refugees and displaced from the Eastern territories. It is reported that works of Paul Ondrusch can be found in Oldenburg, Eschershausen (Leobsch√ºtzer Heimatstube) and Wiesbaden as well as in private collections. =Family life= Ondrusch had eleven siblings. He married Martha Olbrich in 1902 and they had four daughters (Lucia born in 1902, Elsa - 1903, Margarethe - 1908 and Charlotte - 1912) and two sons (Paul born 1916 and Heinz - 1920). He was recruited during the World War I (1914‚Äì1918). His oldest daughter died in 1916 and his wife in 1922. Three years after her death, he remarried and started a second family with Emma Werdecker with whom he had a daughter Ingeborg (1928) and a son, Gerhard (1932).Schmidt, J. Paul Ondrusch moved to Germany in 1945 and there he continued his work. He died at the age of seventy-seven.

She was the founder of many institutions namely: Kashi Ashram, Kashi Church Foundation, The River School, The River Fund, Kashi School of Yoga, the Village of Kashi, and by the River afforable housing for seniors.https://www.strunkfuneralhome.com/obituary/5899972 Ma Jaya devoted most of her life to teaching at Kashi Ashram. Ma Jaya's role in the Kashi Ashram organisation has led her to be identified as a \\"charismatic leader\\" of a potentially \\"destructive cult\\" by Rick Ross; with the Kashi Ashram described by psychologist with American Family Foundation, Paul Martin, as having \\"all the markings of a cult\\" after his interviews with 35 ex-members.  Early Life and Childhood  Ma Jaya was born on May 26, 1940, into an impoverished Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in a cellar apartment in New York.http://blog.kashiashram.org/ma-jaya/ Her birth name was Joyce Green, and she later married Sal DiFiore, becoming Joyce Green DiFiore. The couple had three children, but had a difficult marriage, with Joyce later leaving her husband and her two eldest children Jimmy and Denise behind to start her organisation, taking her youngest daughter with her in 1975. According to her obituary, Ma Jaya is out-lived by her brother, Melvin Green, her daughters, Denise Grogan, Desiree Gaskew, and Kwang Mae Cho, her sons, Soo Se Cho and Wang Chun and her grandchildren, Tony Cho, Christina Amundson, Anthony Randon, and Alexa DiFiore, and her great-grandson Jimmy DiFiore. Spiritual Enlightenment In 1972, Ma Jaya enrolled in a Jack LaLanne weight loss class in Brooklyn, New York and encountered her self-proclaimed first simple yogic breath and initiation. She said that she had a spiritual awakening in which she encountered Jesus Christ. According to ex-husband DiFiore, one night he heard a loud crash - finding that Joyce was wandering the house whsipering about experiencing Christ, with red blotches of what appeared to be blood on her pajamas. Ma Jaya claimed that she had experienced stigmata, and she shortly began delivering sermons in Brooklyn Basements to increasingly devoted followers. Teachings Founded in Hindu philosophy and integrated with many other faiths, Ma Jaya's teachings focused on the ideas of attaining spiritual fulfillment through \\"selfless service\\" to humanity.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/internationally-known- spiritual-leader-ma-jaya-dies-at-71-at-kashi-ashram-148945305.html The Kashi organisation states that \\"Kashi's values exemplify the ideal that all paths followed with a sincere heart lead to one's own God within, with the philosophy exemplifying values of \\"kindness and service,\\" envisioning a world where all are treated with kindness, dignity and respect, and people of all backgrounds are welcomed. According to the Kashi organisation, Ma Jaya stated that her teachings were \\"not a religion\\" but rather beliefs that could be used by students within their own faiths or traditions, with only kindness as a central practise. Ma Jaya was a supporter of the LGBT community, encouraging believers to serve those living with HIV/AIDS in the 1990s. Kashi Ashram In 1976, Ma Jaya moved to Indian River County, Florida to start Kashi Ashram as a non-profit, tax-exempt 510(c)3 charitable organization. Located on 7 miles along the St. Sebastian River and just west of the city of Sebastian, Kashi Ashram attracted a diverse group of students. Ma Jaya taught for 35 years at Kashi Ashram, drawing from her many publications and teaching her students. Later on, Kashi Ashram affiliates were set up in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Colorado, and Santa Fe. The retreat was visited by notable people including Julia Roberts and Arlo Guthrie, with Roberts discovering Jaya's teachings when researching for the 2010 movie Eat, Pray, Love. The Kashi Ashram community is still active today, and describes itself as an \\"interfaith spiritual community founded by Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati with temples, shrines, retreat center, yoga school and sustainable farm.\\" The Kashi organisation states that \\"the teachings of Kashi are rooted in the lineage of Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati and her guru, Neem Karoli Baba.\\" The Kashi Church Foundation still operates \\"The River Fund,\\" established in 1990 to \\"coordinate and fund humanitarian activities for the hungry and homeless in Florida, Uganda and India. The Kashi foundation's \\"Feed Everyone\\" initiative serves the needy in Gifford and supplies food to local elementary schools for a \\"backpack buddies\\" scheme. The Kashi school of Yoga still operates in the Kashi Ashram headquarters in Sebastian and offers daily yoga, breathing, qi gong and meditation classes.  Controversies  In 1993, after a fire destroyed the Branch Davidian. People Magazine included Kashi Ashram under the title, \\"It's not just Waco--Cults rule by paranoia flourish under America\\".https://wwrn.org/articles/13457/ As well as a Florida Today investigation revealing Kashi Ashram's role in \\"bitterly dividing families.\\". Many former employees and executives of Kashi Ashram have come forward such as the former treasurer to describe brainwashing, intimidation through violence, illegal drug use and more to be realities at Ma Jaya's sites. Furthermore, one of Ma Jaya's earliest students and well known author, Richard Alpert (a.k.a Ram Dass) published \\"Egg on My Beard\\" in a 1976 Yoga Mysticism journal in which he slams Ma Jaya's teachings and claims that Ma Jaya's energies came from energizing pills as opposed to spirituality. Physician, Harry Brodie, accuses Ma Jaya of drug use, beginning in 1981 he claims Ma Jaya would use cocaine nightly causing panics and energetic swings. In a 1997 autobiography entitled, It's Here Now (Are You?), Bhagavan Das recalls that while he was trying to leave Kashi Ashram, after a spiritual trip, he was violently encountered by Ma Jaya's followers; \\"I was beaten until I was bruised and bleeding. Fortunately, they didn't break any bones. I . . . thought, 'We have given [Ma Jaya] the power of God. It's time to leave.'\\". Ex-adherents claim abuses ranging from violent beatings to paedophilia. In 2013, Ma Jaya's youngest daughter with Sal DiFiore sued the Kashi Church Foundation in a Miami court, claiming that in 1981, aged 14, she was raped by a church member at her mother's orders. Her daughter, whose name was changed to Molly to disguise her identity, claimed on 10 December 1981 that she was \\"squeezed into a white wedding dress\\" and married to a 25-year-old church member Kevin Brannon so that Molly could be impregnated to supposedly provide more church members for Ma Jaya. The Kashi Ashram and Brannon deny the molestation ever happened. Ma Jaya is said to have ordered marriages between devotees who \\"barely knew each other,\\" although most seemed to consent - according to follower Lyn Deadmore writing in her journal in 1981. A spokesperson for Kashi Ashram denies these arranged marriages occurred. Other accusations include parents who claimed, in 1989 and 2001 court filings, that Ma had manipulated them into giving her custody of their children. Publications Ma Jaya is an author to many publications, namely: Deep and Simple Wisdom: Spiritual Teachings of Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati, The 11 Karmic Spaces: Choosing Freedom from the Patterns That Bind You and The River; as well as numerous podcasts: \\"Ma's River Poem\\", \\"Healing Mantra Practice\\", and \\"Shakti and the Ego,\\" in which she speaks about her ideas and reads original poems.http://kashipodcast.libsyn.com/https://www.kashi.org/ Ma Jaya also painted paintings depicting gods and goddesses involved in Hindu and Vedic traditions and Kali Natha Yoga; she oftentimes brought these pieces into her teaching. Death and Memorial Ma Jaya died on April 13, 2012 at her home in Kashi Ashram due to pancreatic cancer. She was surrounded by her family and several of her students who came to see her shortly before she passed away. A memorial service was held in her honor on Kashi Ashram's birthday in 2012 on May 26. Earlier on in her career, when Ma Jaya was asked what she wanted to be remembered by, she replied, \\"non-judgemental\\".  Honours and Affiliations  According to the Kashi foundation, Ma Jaya was widely recognized for her work and was a recipient of many awards and honors, including: # Recipient, Interfaith Visionary Award, 2010 from the Temple of Understanding. # Recipient of Humanitarian Service Award 2007 from the Gandhi Foundation. # Recipient of title Mata Maha Mandaleshwar from the Ma Yoga Shakti Mission # Recipient of the Interparliamentary Paradigm of Peace Award. # Recipient of the United Foundation for AIDS Award. # Recipient of the Universal Way Award. # Inducted into the Martin Luther King Jr. Board of Preachers, Morehouse College.

While there, Brownrigg carried out experiments that earned him the Copley Medal in 1766 for his work on carbonic acid gas. He was the first person to recognise platinum as a new element. He was created a Fellow of the Royal Society. Early life and education He was born at High Close Hall, the son of local gentry, George Brownrigg. William's mother, Mary Brownrigg, was from Ireland. William was educated in Latin and Greek by a local clergyman from the age of 13 and by the age of 15 was an apprentice to an apothecary in Carlisle. Then followed two years studying under a surgeon in London before going to Leiden where he studied under Boerhaave, 's Gravesande, van Royen and Albinus. He graduated in 1737 with his thesis \\"De Praxi Medica Ineunda\\" ‚Äì about the environment where the clinician practises medicine. He gained the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD). Medical career Brownrigg returned to Britain and took up medicine with an established doctor called Richard Senhouse in Whitehaven. Senhouse died soon after, making Brownrigg the principal doctor in the area for many years to come. His casebook for 1737-1742 survives and was recently transcribed. It contains descriptions of his patients and remedies and some of the earliest English references to puerperal fever.Irvine Loudon, The Tragedy of Childbed Fever (Oxford University Press 2000: ), p17 In 1741, Brownrigg married Mary Spedding. Mary's father and uncle ran the collieries for James Lowther, whose family had developed Whitehaven into a major seaport. This increased William's local influence and also promoted his interest in the health and welfare of the miners. Later in 1771, with the threat of an epidemic from Europe, Brownrigg who had studied the subject from outbreaks of typhus at Whitehaven, published a paper \\"Considerations on the means of pestilential contagion, and of Eradicating it in Infected Places.\\" Scientist His medical interest led him to investigate the gases the miners breathed ‚Äì fire damp (methane) and choke damp (oxygen depleted air). Carlisle Spedding helped to build a laboratory for Brownrigg and fed it with gases from a nearby coal mine through lead pipes. Brownrigg developed methods of collecting and transferring the gases and supplied James Lowther with gas filled bladders to show to The Royal Society which then elected Brownrigg as a Fellow. His experiments on gases continued and after visiting a spa resort in Germany he became interested in gases to be found in mineral waters. A paper he published entitled \\"Experimental inquiry concerning the nature of the mineral elastic spirit or air contained in the Pouhon water, and other acidulae\\" earned him the prestigious Copley Medal in 1766. =Discovery of platinum= In 1741, Brownrigg's relative, Charles Wood, a British metallurgist, found various samples of Colombian platinum in Jamaica, which he sent to Brownrigg for further investigation. In 1750, after studying the platinum sent to him by Wood, Brownrigg presented a detailed account of the metal to the Royal Society, stating that he had seen no mention of it in any previous accounts of known minerals. Brownrigg wrote up Wood's experiments and did some of his own. He was the first to recognise it as a new element and by bringing the new metal to the attention of The Royal Society encouraged other scientists to start investigating it.An Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology By Ian McNeil Pub. 1990 Taylor & Francis: =Salt manufacture= Brownrigg also produced a major treatise on salt manufacture. He hoped that improved domestic production could make Britain self-sufficient in this valuable resource thereby improving the fishing industry and economy both in Britain and America.The Art of Making Common Salt... by William Brownrigg Published 1748 C. Davis Much of the best quality salt was 'bay salt' produced in France and Spain; the two European powers with whom Britain was most likely to be at war with in the eighteenth century. When a paper based upon his book was read at the Royal Society in June 1748 (whilst the negotiations which were to lead to the peace treaty ending the War of the Austrian Succession were still under way), it was considered the most important paper read there in the last fifty years. =Franklin= In 1771 Benjamin Franklin was on a tour of Britain with Sir John Pringle who advised him to visit William Brownrigg. Franklin stayed at Brownrigg's home of Ormathwaite in the Lake District and was presented with a signed copy of his book on salt.Edwin Wolf, The Library of Benjamin Franklin (Kevin J. Hayes 2006: ), p. 47. Franklin demonstrated his experiment of adding oil to the water surface of Derwent Water to calm the waves. He later corresponded with Brownrigg on the subject leading to another paper for The Royal Society's transactions. Other interests Brownrigg was a businessman as well as a doctor and scientist. He went into partnership with Anthony Bacon from Whitehaven in 1765 to develop the iron industry in Wales which led to the expansion of Merthyr Tydfil, particularly the Cyfarthfa Ironworks.Welsh Biography Online He also inherited a share of John Speddings ropery and invested in the Keswick Turnpike Trust. With his retirement to Ormathwaite, he became interested in improving the local agriculture, made a study of minerals, and encouraged Thomas West to write A Guide to the Lakes, the first guide book to the Lake District. He had several society positions including magistrate, Patent searcher at Port Carlisle and Receiver General of Government Taxes for Cumberland and Westmorland. Brownrigg died in 1800 and was buried at Crosthwaite church where his coffin was carried by three baronets and other local gentry. His friend and biographer Joshua Dixon felt that his importance and abilities had been overlooked due to his modesty and reluctance to leave his home county of Cumberland in later life.

Early life Soon after his arrival in France, his uncle, Cardinal Mazarin, decided to use him as a tool to avert future warfare in the kingdom. Upon the death of King Louis XIII in 1643, the older of his two sons succeeded to the throne of France as King Louis XIV. In order to discourage the type of tempestuous relationship that had developed between Louis XIII and his younger brother Philippe, duc d'Orl√©ans, the young king's mother, Anne of Austria, and chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, decided to protect the future king by making sure that his younger brother, the duc d'Anjou, had no part in any political or military office. During his youth, Anjou's behavior was closely watched by dowager queen and her advisor, who made sure that the young duke had no meaningful financial freedom from the Crown. His income was to be derived solely from his appanage. The queen and Mazarin discouraged the duc d'Anjou from traditional manly pursuits such as arms and politics, and encouraged him to wear dresses, makeup, and to enjoy feminine behaviour. His inclination toward homosexuality was not discouraged, with the hope of reducing any threat he may have posed to his older brother. Reportedly, Cardinal Mazarin even commanded his nephew, Philippe, to de-flower the king's younger brother.Erlanger, Philippe, Louis XIV, translated from the French by Stephen Cox, Praeger Publishers, New York, 1970, p. 75 (footnote).Dufresne, Claude, Les Orl√©ans, CRITERION, Paris, 1991, p. 33 (French). In 1657, Cardinal Mazarin re-established the Mousquetaires du Roi, a military unit later immortalized by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re in his story of The Three Musketeers. Philippe was awarded the position of leader of the corps as a captain-lieutenant. In 1661, after the Cardinal's death, jurisdiction over the musketeers passed to Louis XIV. He replaced Philippe in 1667 with Charles de Batz-Castelmore, comte d'Artagnan. The comte had been in actual control of the unit since joining in 1658, as Philippe was not interested in war and rarely accompanied the musketeers in battle. As a young man, Philippe frequented the salon of Paul Scarron. Scarron's young wife, the future Madame de Maintenon, became friends with Philippe's sister Marie Mancini. In 1660, Philippe was nominated to be duc de Nevers and Donzy by his uncle, Cardinal Mazarin, with the prerogative to strike coins. The Parlement de Paris, however, refused to register this new creation. Another creation in 1676 was no more successful. In 1661, Philippe inherited part of his uncle's colossal wealth, the majority of which went to his younger sister, Hortense, who was their uncle's favourite. In 1668, Philippe helped Hortense escape her abusive husband by procuring horses and an escort to help her travel to Rome, where she took refuge with their sister, Marie, now the Princess Colonna. He was a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit. Marriage and children In 1670 he married Diane-Gabrielle de Damas de Thianges, daughter of Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart and niece of Louis XIV's mistress, Madame de Montespan. They had six children, including: *Diane Gabrielle Victoire Mancini (1672‚Äì1716), who married Charles Louis Antoine de H√©nin-Li√©nard, prince de Chimay *Philippe Jules Fran√ßois Mancini (1676‚Äì1769), prince de Vergagne et du Saint Empire, then duke of Nevers *Diane Ad√©la√Øde Philippe Mancini (1687‚Äì1747), who married Louis-Armand, duc d'Estr√©es *Jacques Hippolyte Mancini (1690‚Äì1759), who in 1719 married Anne-Louise de Noailles (daughter of Anne Jules de Noailles), with their only child being Marie Diane Z√©phirine (1726‚Äì1755), who married Louis-H√©racle de Polignac.

Hastings returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy The seat had become vacant following the resignation of the sitting Unionist MP, Harvey Du Cros, on grounds of ill health. He had been the MP for the seat of Hastings since the 1906 general election. Electoral history The seat had been Conservative since they gained it in 1906 against the national swing, having surprisingly lost it to the Liberals in 1900. Candidates Arthur Du Cros in 1913 The Conservatives quickly adopted 37-year-old Arthur Du Cros, son of the former MP, as their new candidate. He had been born and raised in Dublin before entering the family rubber tyre manufacturing business in the Birmingham area. In 1906 Du Cros unsuccessfully contested the London seat of Bow & Bromley as a Conservative candidate. The Liberals had no local candidate because their previous candidate Freeman Freeman-Thomas had since been elected at a by-election. There was a delay in selecting 30-year-old Robert Vernon Harcourt, the son of Sir William Harcourt as their man.Ian Ivatt, The 1908 Hastings By-Election in Journal of Liberal History, Issue 59 ‚Äì Summer 2008 Harcourt was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge where he took honours in the History Tripos.Who was Who, OUP 2007 At Cambridge, he was a committee member of Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1899 to 1900.http://keynessociety.wordpress.com/about-the-keynes-society/ Harcourt went into the Foreign Service, serving as a Clerk on the diplomatic establishment of the Foreign Office from 1900 to 1906.The Times House of Commons 1910; Politico‚Äôs Publishing, 2004 p97 He was then briefly engaged in journalism, being parliamentary correspondent of the magazine Tribune. He stood unsuccessfully for the London County Council seat of Mile End in 1907, as a Progressive. He was standing for parliament for the first time. Campaign Polling Day was fixed for the 3 March 1908. The themes raised in the by-election ranged over many issues of the day and the clash between what was seen as the local man (Du Cros) versus the government incomer (Harcourt), even though they were both outsiders to the area. Harcourt promoted his candidacy as that of a strong supporter of Free Trade. Members of the militant Women's Social and Political Union were in Hastings campaigning for the Conservative candidate, even though he was an opponent of women's suffrage, while the Liberal candidate was a supporter.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/mar/28/parliamentary- franchise-women-bill Result The Conservatives held the seat and managed an increased majority; Both the Sussex Express and The Times newspapers were agreed that the Unionist victory was ‚Äòfirst and foremost [due] to Tariff Reform and particularly to the colonial preference side of the question‚Äô. Aftermath Harcourt had to wait only a few more weeks to get into Parliament. He was adopted as Liberal candidate at a by-election at Montrose Burghs following the elevation to the peerage of the sitting member there, the veteran Liberal John Morley, was elected on 12 May 1908, and served as Member for Montrose until 1918. Du Cros held Hastings at the subsequent General Election. Du Cros held the seat until 1918 when he transferred to stand as a Coalition Conservative in Clapham, a seat he held until 1922.

Brogyntyn Hall was the home of the Ormsby-Gore family from 1815, and had previously been the estate of their ancestors the Maurices and Owens since the sixteenth century. It was abandoned and uninhabited from around 1985.  History  It was a residence of members of the princely dynasty of the Welsh kingdom of Powys and one of the ta√Æ'r uchelwyr (houses of the gentry) in late medieval Wales. It subsequently came into the possession of the Ormsby-Gore family (Lord Harlech). Its English correspondent is sometimes given as Porkington. A manuscript known to have been in the possession of Brogyntyn in 1574 was a copy of the Hanes Gruf(f)udd ab Cynan. The house itself is of brick dating from circa 1730 refaced and much added to between 1813‚Äì20 by the architect Benjamin Gummow.Colvin H., A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840, Yale University Press, 3rd edition London, 1995, p 436, It is noted for a portico of four giant unfluted Ionic columns with scrolls and pediment. Outside can be seen an arch with 2 pairs of unfluted Ionic columns. In the entrance hall survives an elaborately carved fireplace dated 1617. Brogyntyn Hall and its 1,445-acre estate, was sold by the 6th Baron Harlech in 2001 for less than ¬£5m to a local developer, who divided up the estate, and investigated the potential for a retirement community development in and around the Hall.The Daily Telegraph, \\"Fall of the house of Harlech\\" by Angela Pertusini and Hugh Davies, 22 Jun 2000Gaunt Francis Architects proposals However, the Hall and 234 acres went up for sale for ¬£5m in December 2013.Knight Frank reference CHO090108 = Brogyntyn Library = It is known that Sir Robert Owen of Brogyntyn (d. 1698) was a bibliophile who continued the family's traditional patronage of poets and a collection of printed English literature was developed by his grandfather Lewis Anwyl of Park. Nevertheless, the early history of the library at Brogyntyn is obscure. Some of the family had collected early printed books during the nineteenth century but this does not account for the fine collection of manuscripts that the library held. There is some evidence contained within the manuscripts which suggests that the collection was formed circa 1700 from other manuscripts collections in the surrounding area. The thirty Welsh language manuscripts that the third Lord Harlech deposited in the National Library of Wales in 1934 was, at the time, the largest collection of manuscripts in Welsh that was still privately owned. The fourth Lord Harlech deposited a further fifty-nine manuscripts in the National Library in 1938 and subsequently donated most of the deposits in 1945. The remaining items were purchased from the sixth Lord Harlech, the incumbent in 1993. The manuscripts from the Brogyntyn Library include a medieval psalter and a version of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanni√¶, both from the thirteenth century, a fifteenth century miscellany in Middle English, a volume of the Welsh laws of Hywel Dda, and pedigrees, genealogy and heraldry of families in Wales.

In her book American Classic Pedigrees (1914‚Äì2002), author Avalyn Hunter wrote that Bally Ache was \\"a crowd favorite\\" who \\"won hearts by his sheer determination.\\" Background Bally Ache was a bay horse bred by brothers Alan and Marvin Gaines at their Twin Oak Farm in Walton, Kentucky. He was sired the Irish import Ballydam out of Celestial Blue. The colt was sold as a yearling as part of a $5,000 two-horse deal. His purchasers were Leonard D. Fruchtman and Morris Fruchtman, steel company executives from Toledo, Ohio, who had a small string of horses racing under his Edgehill Farm colors. The colt was trained by Homer \\"Jimmy\\" Pitt. Racing career As a two-year-old, Bally Ache made sixteen starts. He won five stakes races, set a new track record at Jamaica Race Course for five furlongs, and finished out of the money just once. He ended the year ranked second in earnings to Bellehurst Stables' 1959 Champion Two-Year-Old, Warfare. At age three, Bally Ache won the Flamingo Stakes and Florida Derby on the way to the Triple Crown. In the Kentucky Derby, C. V. Whitney's colt Tompion, ridden by Bill Shoemaker, was coming off wins in the Santa Anita Derby and the Blue Grass Stakes and was sent off as the betting favorite. Bally Ache, under jockey Bobby Ussery, was the second choice. However, jockey Bill Hartack aboard 6:1 outsider Venetian Way, whom Bally Ache had already beaten four times, won. Despite Bally Ache's second- place finish, it did not deter the Turfland racing syndicate led by Joseph L. Arnold, who bought the colt for what Sports Illustrated magazine described as the \\"staggering price of $1,250,000\\". Bally Ache then won by four lengths in the 84th running of the Preakness Stakes. Entered in the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown, Bally Ache came up lame the day before the race and was withdrawn. After returning to racing, in his fourth outing he suffered a career-ending ankle injury. He was scheduled to stand at stud for his owners but developed an intestinal ailment that led to his death on October 28, 1960. He was buried at Bosque Bonita Farm in Versailles, Kentucky.

Ataga Khan was the husband of Jiji Anga, one of Akbar's wet nurses. Background Shamsuddin was the son of Mir Yar Muhammad of Ghazni, a simple farmer, and started life as a soldier in Kamran Mirza‚Äôs army. He saved Humayun from drowning in the Ganges. As reward, Humayun took him into his personal service and his wife became one of Akbar's foster-mothers. She was called foster-mother (Anagah) and her husband Shamsuddin was designated foster-father (Atgah).

This magnificent temple dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi stands distinctly on the outskirts of the city. Amidst value the varied Islamic architectural monuments in the area, this temple has a different style -- a touch of south Indian architecture. Among the Hindu pantheon, the Goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, finds a special place in the hearts of the people for she brings prosperity and happiness as well as salvation. But very few temple have Goddess Lakshmi in her eight splendorous forms. History Built under the auspices of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, the temple was consecrated in April 1996. It is one of its kind in the state of Telangana. This temple is located between Dilsukh Nagar and LB Nagar, in Vasavi Colony near Kothapet (NH 9). its very famous Design The design and architecture of the Ashtalakshmi temple was borrowed from the one at Chennai. However, several modifications were made while the construction was initiated. The Ashtalakshmi temple is a fine example of a collective endeavor. People from many quarters came forward to donate liberally. It took five years of non-stop work and a total expenditure of Rs 10 million for the magnificent Ashtalakshmi temple to take its present form. The well-known architect, Padmashri S.M. Ganapati Sthapathi, and M. Mathiyalagan Sthapathi conceived the structure and design. About 134 vigrahams (idols) of lesser-known gods adorn the mahagopuram. Although built of sand and cement, the Ashtalakshmi temple reveals the remarkable dexterity of the artists. Installed inside are idols of Adilakshmi, Aishwaryalakshmi, Santanalakshmi, Dhanalakshmi, Dhanyalakshmi, Gajalakshmi, Vijayalakshmi and Varalakshmi. Depicting these eight postures, the idols are adorned with gold and kasula Peru necklace and other necklaces. If one is all praise for the richly ornamented idols inside the temple, one is equally agog to see the intricately carved designs on the temple gopuram. Proposals are in the offing to construct a two-storeyed Kalyana Mandapam at a cost of Rs 15 million and an Archaka nilayam residential quarters for the priests. The nightly illumination of this enchanting temple is spectacular. Viewed from a distance, it looks like it's made from marble. And on approaching the temple entrance, one is captivated by the tranquility of the surroundings and the all-pervading sweet fragrance of the incense.

At PWG Mystery Vortex V, Ricochet lost the PWG World Championship back to Taylor in a Guerrilla Warfare match. =Dragon Gate (2010‚Äì2015, 2017)= Through his work in Dragon Gate USA, Ricochet got to make his first tour of Japan with its parent promotion Dragon Gate, making his debut on December 10, 2010, in Toyama, where he teamed with his Warriors stable mate Cima and Masaaki Mochizuki in a six tag team match, where they defeated Gamma, Kzy and Naruki Doi. Ricochet's first tour of Japan ended on December 26, when he, Cima and Dragon Kid defeated Naoki Tanisaki, Takuya Sugawara and Yasushi Kanda in Fukuoka at Final Gate 2010 to win the Dragon Gate Open the Triangle Gate Championship. Ricochet turned heel on January 14, 2011, along with the rest of Warriors, attacking Masato Yoshino and World‚Äì1, and joining forces with Naruki Doi's group. On January 18 the new group was named Blood Warriors. On February 10 Cima, Naruki Doi and Gamma defeated World‚Äì1 representatives Masato Yoshino, BxB Hulk and Susumu Yokosuka in a six-man tag team match and as a result, Pac was forced to leave World‚Äì1 and join Blood Warriors. However, Ricochet blocked the move as he felt that he, not Pac, was the top high flyer in the world and instead challenged him to a match for his Open the Brave Gate Championship. The title match between Pac and Ricochet took place on March 1 and ended with Pac retaining his title. On May 15, the rest of Blood Warriors turned on Dragon Kid and kicked him out of the group, despite the fact that he still held the Open the Triangle Gate Championship with Ricochet and Cima. As a result, the title was declared vacant. On July 17, Ricochet and Cima defeated Dragon Kid and Pac of rival group Junction Three to win the Open the Twin Gate Championship. On November 19, Ricochet defeated Pac for the Open the Brave Gate Championship. After their third successful defense of the Open the Twin Gate Championship on November 30, Ricochet and Cima vacated the title in order for Ricochet to concentrate on defending the Open the Brave Gate Championship and Cima to concentrate on chasing the Open the Dream Gate Championship. On January 19, 2012, Akira Tozawa took over the leadership of Blood Warrios, kicking Cima out of the group. After Ricochet continued to team with CIMA in Dragon Gate USA, it was announced on February 9, that he was also kicked out of Blood Warriors. On March 4, Ricochet and Cima decided to mutually split up, with Ricochet joining Masato Yoshino's and Naruki Doi's new World-1 International stable and Cima reviving the Veteran-gun. On May 6, Ricochet lost the Open the Brave Gate Championship to Dragon Kid in his fourth defense. On May 25, 2013, Ricochet defeated Shingo Takagi in the finals to win the 2013 King of Gate tournament. As a result, Ricochet earned a shot at the Open the Dream Gate Championship, but was defeated in the title match on June 16 by Cima. On July 21, Ricochet and Naruki Doi defeated Akira Tozawa and BxB Hulk for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. They lost the title to Dragon Kid and K-Ness on August 30. On September 12, Doi turned on Masato Yoshino, signaling the end of World-1 International. Ricochet quickly found a new alliance, forming Monster Express with Yoshino, Akira Tozawa, Shachihoko Boy, Shingo Takagi and Uhaa Nation. On March 2, 2014, Ricochet defeated Monster Express stablemate Masato Yoshino for the Open the Dream Gate Championship, becoming the first gaijin to hold the title. Ricochet made his first successful title defense just four days later against another stablemate, Uhaa Nation. After a two-month reign, Ricochet lost the Open the Dream Gate Championship to Yamato in his second defense on May 5. Ricochet returned to Dragon Gate during the summer of 2015. On July 20, he and Matt Sydal unsuccessfully challenged Naruki Doi and Yamato for the Open the Twin Gate Championship. Ricochet returned to Dragon Gate two years later on November 3, 2017, defeating Eita. He wrestled his Dragon Gate farewell match five days later. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2013‚Äì2017)= On May 3, 2013, New Japan Pro-Wrestling announced Ricochet as a participant in the 2013 Best of the Super Juniors tournament.

Later in the month, Ricochet entered the 2016 Best of the Super Juniors tournament. On May 27, Ricochet faced Will Ospreay in the tournament in a match, which received widespread attention in the professional wrestling world. While some like William Regal praised the two, others criticized the match with the most notable criticism coming from Vader, who compared the match to a \\"gymnastics routine\\". Ricochet finished the tournament with a record of four wins and three losses, failing to advance to the finals due to losing to Chase Owens in his final round-robin match. On June 19 at Dominion 6.19 in Osaka-jo Hall, Ricochet and Sydal lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to The Young Bucks in a four-way elimination match, also involving reDRagon and Roppongi Vice. Ricochet (right), David Finlay (left) and Satoshi Kojima (center) as the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions On July 3, Ricochet and Sydal teamed up with Satoshi Kojima to defeat The Elite (Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks) for the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. They were stripped of the title on September 25 due to Sydal failing to make a scheduled title defense at Destruction in Kobe because of travel issues. That same day, Ricochet and Kojima, now teaming with David Finlay, defeated Adam Cole and The Young Bucks to regain the vacant title. This led to a match on October 10 at King of Pro-Wrestling, where Ricochet and Finlay unsuccessfully challenged The Young Bucks for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. Ricochet, Finlay and Kojima lost the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Los Ingobernables de Japon (Bushi, Evil and Sanada) in a four-team gauntlet match at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome on January 4, 2017.

On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2017, Ricochet, Tanahashi and Taguchi lost the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship back to L.I.J. Ricochet then entered the 2017 Best of the Super Juniors tournament, where, despite a win over reigning IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Hiromu Takahashi, he failed to advance to the finals with a record of four wins and three losses. Ricochet then formed a new tag team named \\"Funky Future\\" with Ryusuke Taguchi under the banner of Taguchi Japan. On August 13, the two defeated The Young Bucks to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Roppongi 3K (Sho and Yoh) on October 9 at King of Pro-Wrestling. Following the match, Ricochet took responsibility for the loss and thanked both NJPW and Taguchi Japan. His mannerisms were interpreted as meaning he had wrestled his final NJPW match. On November 8, Ricochet confirmed he had wrestled his final match in Japan. =Lucha Underground (2014‚Äì2017)= In September 2014, it was reported that Mann had signed with the El Rey network's new television series, Lucha Underground. He assumed a masked character by the ring name of Prince Puma. He was given a fictional Latino background and managed by Konnan, with him doing most of the talking on his behalf. Puma wrestled in the main event of the debut episode of Lucha Underground on October 29, losing to Johnny Mundo. On the January 7, 2015, episode (taped October 5, 2014), Puma defeated 19 other wrestlers to win the Aztec Warfare battle royal and become the inaugural Lucha Underground Champion. Puma made his first televised defense of the Lucha Underground Championship on the January 14, 2015, episode of Lucha Underground against F√©nix. Puma then entered a rivalry with Cage, which led to a title match between the two on the March 25 episode, where Puma retained his title. On April 19 at Ultima Lucha, Lucha Underground's season one finale, Puma lost the Lucha Underground Championship to Mil Muertes. After failing to regain the title, he formed a team with El Dragon Azteca Jr. and Rey Mysterio Jr. and entered a tournament for the Trios championship. After defeating the team which consisted of Taya and two of Puma's old adversaries Cage, and Johnny Mundo, in a qualifying match, they captured the titles last eliminating Fenix, PJ Black, and Jack Evans in the finals. Mann had originally signed a contract with Lucha Underground, which gave him an out following the conclusion of the program's third season. With WWE reportedly looking to sign him, Lucha Underground offered Mann a new contract, which would have allowed him to continue working NJPW and the indies and would have made him \\"one of the highest paid non-WWE talents in the business\\". Mann, however, decided to opt out of his contract. On June 26, 2016, at the third season concluding Ultima Lucha Tres, Prince Puma challenged Johnny Mundo for the Lucha Underground Championship in a match, where he put his Lucha Underground career on the line. Though Puma won the match and the title, he was immediately afterwards challenged by Gift of the Gods Champion Pentag√≥n Dark, with Dario Cueto stating that the loser of the match would be forced to retire. Pentag√≥n won the match and the Lucha Underground Championship with help from Vampiro, ending Prince Puma's Lucha Underground career. Though Mann's Lucha Underground contract had expired, he could not appear on television for another promotion until season three had been aired in its entirety. Mann later commented on his status, stating that an \\"underground fighting company holding [him] back\\" was the reason he had not yet been signed by a \\"major promotion\\". The final episode of the third season aired on October 18, 2017, sixteen months after being taped. =WWE= Championship reigns (2018‚Äì2019) Ricochet made his WWE debut in April 2018 at NXT TakeOver: New Orleans On January 16, 2018, WWE announced on their website that Ricochet had signed a contract with the company and would be wrestling in WWE's developmental territory NXT.

If the law deems a mistake to be sufficiently grave, then a contract entered into on the grounds of the mistake may be void. A mistake is an incorrect understanding by one or more parties to a contract. There are essentially three types of mistakes in contract, *unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non- mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried to take advantage of the mistake.Smith v Hughes [1871] It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in Lewis v AverayLewis v Averay [1971] 3 All ER 907 where Lord Denning MR held that the contract can only be avoided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient. *mutual mistake is when both parties of a contract are mistaken as to the terms. Each believes they are contracting to something different. The court usually tries to uphold such a mistake if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgement does not cause the contract to be voidable by the party that is adversely affected. See Raffles v Wichelhaus.Raffles v Wichelhaus (1864) 2 Hurl. & C. 906. *common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts. This is demonstrated in the case of Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd,Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd [1931] All ER 1, [1932] AC 161 which established that common mistake can only void a contract if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible. This is similar to frustration, except that the event precedes, rather than follows the time of agreement. Common mistake *. *Bell v Lever Bros [1932] AC 161 *Grist v Bailey [1967] Ch 532 *Nicholson & Venn v Smith-Marriot (1947) 177 L.T. 189 *Associated Japanese Bank (International) Ltd v Credit du Nord [1989] 1 WLR 255 *Brennan v Bolt Burdon [2004] 3 WLR 1321 *Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd [2003] QB 679 *Galloway v Galloway *Scott v Coulson Res Sua, there is a mistake as to the title/name of an involved party (where the subject matter already belongs to oneself for example) *Cooper v Phibbs Res Extincta, where subject matter does not exist *Courturier v Hastie *Sale of Goods Act 1979 s 6 Mutual mistake *Raffles v Wichelhaus (1864) 2 H & C906; 159 ER 375 Unilateral mistake to identity Mistake as to identity occurs when one party ‚Äì usually deceived by a \\"rogue\\" ‚Äì believes themselves to be bargaining with another, uninvolved, third party.https://ipsaloquitur.com/contract-law/mistake/ In a typical situation of this kind, the contract will either be void for mistake, or voidable for fraud. Such a distinction depends on the manner in which the contract was made. There are two types: (1) Contract made inter absentes, when the parties do not meet face-to-face, e.g. through correspondence; and (2) Contract made inter praesentes -- when the parties meet face-to- facehttps://ipsaloquitur.com/contract-law/mistake/ One commentator states \\"'[t]here are few more vexed areas of contract law' than mistake of identity.\\" with reference: \\"MacMillan [2005] CLJ 711.

The contract was held to be void for mistake because Lindsay & Co had intended to contract with Blenkiron & Co, not the rogue. Lindsay & Co were able to recover the handkerchiefs from a third party who had purchased them from the rogue (as the rogue did not have good title to pass on to them). * King's Norton Metal Co v Edridge Merrett & Co [1897] 14 TLR 98http://swarb.co.uk/kings-norton-metal-co- ltd-v-edridge-merrett-and-co-ltd-ca-1879/http://e-lawresources.co.uk/Kings- Norton-v-Edridge.php In similar situation similar to the preceding case, except that rogue used the name of a non-existent company. The seller could not claim they had intended to contract with the non-existent company, so the contract was merely voidable for fraud, and the third party obtained good title to the goods. * Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson [2004] 1 AC 919 Although Cundy v Lindsay and Phillips v Brooks have had a difficult co-existence which has led to confusion (e.g. Ingram v Little,[1961] 1 QB 31) the principle was upheld by a 3:2 majority in the House of Lords decision of Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson.[2004] 1 AC 919 The minority of Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett argued strongly for the abandonment of Cundy v Lindsay and in favour of the principle that all mistakes for identity merely render a contract voidable; for instance, Lord Nicholls argued that the loss should be borne by the seller, \\"who takes the risks inherent in parting with his goods without receiving payment\\", rather than by the innocent third party. =Inter praesentes= A contract made inter praesentes occurs when the parties meet face-to- face.http://e-lawresources.co.uk/Mistake.phphttps://ipsaloquitur.com/contract- law/mistake/ Cases: * Phillips v Brooks [1919] 2 KB 243 In a contract was made face to face, the court presumed that the seller intended to contract with the person in front of them, so the contract was not void for mistake to identity. * Ingram v Little [1961] 1 QB 31http://e-lawresources.co.uk/Ingram-v- Little.php * Lewis v Averay [1971] 3 WLR 603PP. 560-1 of A rogue impersonating one Richard Greene, a popular actor, told the plaintiff who had advertised to the sale of his car and offered to buy it for the advertised price, 450 pounds.

Vorhoelzer belonged to the classical modernist school of architecture that is otherwise rather underrepresented in Bavaria. Most of his works were built when Vorhoelzer was Oberbaurat of the Bavarian postal administration. Together with Robert Poeverlein he founded the \\"Bayerische Postbauschule\\". In the early stages of his work, such as at the post office Penzberg or the post office on Ismaninger Stra√üe in Munich, the influence of the \\"Heimatstil\\" was dominant. But later Vorhoelzer built many modern and functional buildings (post offices, depots, apartment buildings for postal staff etc.) in the style of Neue Sachlichkeit. These include, for example, the post office on Tegernseer Landstra√üe (\\"Tela-Post\\") in Munich-Obergiesing, the post office building at Goethe Platz or the post office at Harras place in Munich-Sendling (1931‚Äì32), a white office building with a rotunda and high rise apartment blocks in the background. The harmonious integration of his buildings in the surrounding urban landscape proves Vorhoelzer's ability as a city planner. In particular, the appearance of the Arnulfstra√üe in Munich owns much to the numerous Vorhoelzer buildings. In 1930, Robert Vorhoelzer has been appointed professor at the Technical University of Munich. With the beginning of the Third Reich he lost his chair accused of being an \\"architectural bolshevist\\", although he resumed working as an architect and, for example, built the church \\"Mary Queen of Peace\\" in Obergiesing (1936‚Äì37). On the eve of World War II, Vorhoelzer emigrated to Turkey, from where he has been expelled in 1941 due to an allegation of espionage for Germany. After the war, he retrieved his chair, but in 1947 he has been suspended again for six months after Nazi allegations concerning the date of the Turkish exile. In the post- war debate on the reconstruction of Munich, Vorhoelzer pointed out that parts of the city had been in need of rehabilitation even before the war. He called for a radical new development plan, in which Flachbauten low-rise and high- rise buildings played an important part. He also had been ahead of his times in his request to discuss the reconstruction in public. In 1952, Vorhoelzer retired and two years later, he died at the age of 70 years after an operation. His last major work was the monumental parish church of St. Joseph in Dingolfing, which had only been completed 1954 to 1956 after his death. For this hall-type church, he applied motives that were already present in the church Giesinger \\"Mary Queen of Peace\\".

It was removed as part of a channel-widening project in 1968. History This light was constructed in 1872 to mark a bend in the shipping channel southwest of Sabin Point. The Second Empire style house was constructed according to a plan by Albert R. Dow, the winning design in a contest sponsored by the Lighthouse Service. Nearly identical lights were constructed at Colchester Reef, Pomham Rocks, Esopus Meadows Light and Rose Island. Initially the keeper also had responsibility for the beacon which was replaced in 1876 by the Bullock's Point Light. The light weathered the hurricane of 1938 fairly well, albeit with serious flood damage to the first floor. The keeper's wife, Annie Whitford, was washed away three times, but managed not only to survive but to keep the light going through the storm. On a less perilous note, two of her daughters were married at the light, the second to the son of the keeper of the Warwick Light. In 1956 the light was converted to electricity and automated. In 1968 widening of the shipping channel led the harbor authority to order the removal of the light, and it was burned down and the foundation razed. An automated beacon was placed on a dolphin nearby; the light was discontinued in 1989 and replaced with a day beacon.

The church houses a relic of the Holy Blood allegedly collected by Joseph of Arimathea and brought from the Holy Land by Thierry of Alsace, Count of Flanders. Built between 1134 and 1157 as the chapel of the Count of Flanders, it was promoted to a minor basilica in 1923. The basilica in Burg square consists of a lower and upper chapel. The lower chapel, dedicated to St. Basil the Great, is a dark Romanesque structure that remains virtually unchanged. The venerated Passion relic is in the upper chapel, which was rebuilt in the Gothic style in the 16th century and renovated in the 19th century in Gothic Revival style.  History  In 1134, Thierry of Alsace decided to build a private double chapel next to the ', the first residence of the Counts of Flanders, transformed today into the town hall of Bruges. Thierry went on crusade a second time in 1147 during the Second Crusade. According to the tradition, Thierry of Alsace returned to his capital Bruges on April 7, 1150, with the relic of the Precious Blood. During the first half of the 13th century, the name of the upper chapel was changed to the Chapel of the Holy Blood.  St Basil chapel  Romanesque St Basil chapel The chapel of Saint Basil is one of the best preserved churches in Romanesque style of West- Flanders. Built from 1134 to 1149, the chapel is dedicated to St. Basil the Great of whom a relic was brought back by Count Robert II from Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia, Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). The chapel consists of two side naves and a central nave continued by the choir, which in turn is ended by a semi-circular apse. In the tympanum above the entrance linking the chapel and the annex is a 12th-century representation of the baptism of Saint Basil. In the right nave, the seated Madonna and Child (Sedes Sapientiae) is a wooden polychrome sculpture of the early 14th century. Carried each year during the procession, two venerated wooden statues, made around 1900 and representing Jesus on the Cold Stone and the Pieta are displayed. At the left of the choir, the chapel of Saint Yves was added in 1504 and houses the relics of Saint Basil and of Blessed Charles the Good, Count of Flanders. The black marble retable is allegedly executed from designs by Lancelot Blondeel.  Chapel of the Holy Blood  Originally built in Romanesque style like the St Basil chapel, the upper chapel was transformed in Gothic Style at the end of the 15th century and again in 1823. Only the curved arches giving access to the side chapel of the Holy Cross remain from the original Romanesque chapel. Main altar of the Basilica of the Holy Blood. The monumental staircase, commonly named ', which leads to the upper chapel, was built in from 1529 to 1533 in late Gothic and Renaissance style according to the drawings of Flemish painter and architect William Aerts, ornamented on the outside with sculpted statues. The aftermath of the French Revolution left the staircase badly damaged and it was decided in 1832 to move it backwards and to rebuild it after removing the remaining ruins of the Oud Steen.It is considered to be the first artistic renovation carried out by the recently created Belgian State. The gilded bronze statues represent Archduchess Isabelle of Burgundy, Mary of Burgundy, Thierry of Alsace and Philip of Alsace and, in the medallions, the Archdukes of Austria Albert VII and Maximilian III, Margaret of York and Sibylla of Anjou, wife of Thierry and daughter of King Fulk of Jerusalem. During the 19th century, successive renovation campaigns gave to the chapel its final Gothic Revival aspect, with its characteristic mural decorations. The stained-glass windows in the choir date from 1845The original stained-glass windows were removed after the French Revolution. Some of the original ones ended up in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. and represent the sovereigns who reigned over the County of Flanders from Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, till Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, Holy Roman empress. The following architects and artists took part in these neo-Gothic renovations of the Chapel of the Holy Blood: * Jean-Baptiste Bethune * Louis Delacenserie * Thomas Harper King * William Curtis Brangwyn, father of Frank Brangwyn * Charles De Wulf, architect of the city of Bruges and winner of the Prix de Rome in 1887 The pulpit in the form of a globe was made in 1728 by Henry Pulinckx, inspired by its evangelical purpose : \\"Go into all the world and preach the gospel\\" . The large wall-painting behind the high altar was realized in 1905. In the upper part, the Mystery of the Cross depicts Christ shedding his blood, with, in the background, the towns of Bethlehem, where Christ was born, and Jerusalem where he died. The lower part depicts the transport of the relic from Jerusalem to Bruges: on the left, Thierry of Alsace receives the relic from Baldwin III of Jerusalem, King of Jerusalem ; on the right, kneeling besides Countess Sibylla of Anjou, he hands over the relic to the chaplain. The high altar used today for the Eucharist is decorated with a relief in alabaster from the beginning of the 17th century depicting the Last Supper. Typical attributes of a basilica, the tintinnabulum, the small processional bell, and the Umbraculum, the sunscreen in the form of a parasol in yellow and red silk, are displayed next to the high altar. Laurent Delvaux completed in 1751 the white marble altar in Baroque style for the relic side chapel. The two adoring angels were made by Peter Pepers. The relic is kept in a magnificent silver tabernacle made by local silversmith Fran√ßois Ryelandt (1709‚Äì1774), representing the \\"Lamb of Christ\\". To the right of the altar, the painting of Jacob van Oost depicts the descent from the Cross. The relic is shown to the public every Friday and every day two weeks before Ascension Day.  Relic of the Precious Blood  Relic of the Holy Blood, Bruges. The basilica is best known as the repository of a venerated phial said to contain a cloth with blood of Jesus Christ, brought to the city by Thierry of Alsace after the 12th century Second Crusade. Although the Bible never mentions Christ's blood being preserved, Acts of Pilate - one of the apocryphal gospels - relates that Joseph of Arimathea preserved the Precious Blood after he had washed the dead body of Christ; legends of Joseph were popular in the early thirteenth century, connected also with the emerging mythology of the Holy Grail. Popular legend claims that the phial was taken to Bruges during the Second Crusade of CE 1147‚Äì1149, by Thierry of Alsace, who returned from Jerusalem with the relic of the Holy Blood presented to him by his brother-in- law Baldwin III of Jerusalem, as the reward of his great services. Recent research found no evidence of the presence of the relic in Bruges before the 1250s. In all likelihood, the relic originated from the 1204 sack of Constantinople by the army of the Count of Flanders, Baldwin IX during the Fourth Crusade. Ever since, the phial has played no small part in the religious life of the city. Pope Clement V issued a papal bull in 1310 granting indulgences to pilgrims who visited the chapel to view the relic; the blood was supposed to liquefy weekly at noon on Fridays; the miracle apparently ceased the same year, though a recurrence was alleged in 1388. The is no definitive evidence for or against the authenticity of the relic. Modern examination has shown that the phial, made of rock crystal and dating back to the 11th or 12th century, was a Byzantine perfume bottle made in the area of Constantinople. Its neck is wound with gold thread and its stopper is sealed with red wax. The phial is encased in a glass-fronted gold cylinder closed at each end by coronets decorated with angels. The date \\"MCCCLXXXVIII die III maii\\" (May 3, 1388) is engraved on the frame.  Procession of the Holy Blood  The reliquary used during the procession is displayed in the Basilica Museum. The shrine was made in 1617 in Bruges by goldsmith Jan Crabbe from some of gold and silver and more than 100 precious stones. It consists of a gem-encrusted hexagonal case topped by golden statues representing Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, St. Donatian and St. Basil the Great.

Born in Vienna, St√∂hr studied composition with Robert Fuchs at the Vienna Conservatory. After working there as a repetiteur and choral instructor from 1900, he taught music (theory of harmony, counterpoint, form) from 1903 to 1938, being professor from 1915. Among his students were Herbert von Karajan, Rudolf Serkin, Erich Leinsdorf, Samuel Barber, Erich Zeisl, Louis Horst, Marlene Dietrich, Alois H√°ba and Hellmut Federhofer. Fired from the Vienna Academy due to his Jewish heritage in 1938, he emigrated to the US in 1939 and taught at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. His students there included Leonard Bernstein and Eugene Bossart. From 1941 to 1950 he taught at St. Michael's College in Vermont, where he maintained emeritus status until 1960. He died in Montpelier, Vermont in the United States. Biography =Early life= Richard St√∂hr was born in Vienna, in the same year as Arnold Schoenberg. His Jewish parents had come from Hungary. His father, Samuel Stern, was a professor of medicine at the University of Vienna. His mother, Mathilde, was a member of the Porges family (her brother was Heinrich Porges, a close associate of Richard Wagner). St√∂hr had one sibling, a sister named Hedwig (birth date unknown) who would later perish in Modliborzyce in the custody of the Nazis on January 2, 1942. =Study in Vienna= He began composing at the age of six and kept a daily diary from the age of 15. St√∂hr first obtained an M.D. degree (1898) but immediately entered the Vienna Academy of Music as a composition student of Robert Fuchs. At this time he also changed his name from Stern to St√∂hr and converted to Christianity. In the annual summary of his diary from 1898 he wrote: > This was the year the big change occurred. Herewith I have sealed the fate > of my future life. Now I am a musician and I carry this responsibility > seriously, consciously and without regret. At the same time came the actual > change of my name to \\"St√∂hr\\", on which I had decided already in the summer. > It was just the right time for this and I am glad I didn't miss it. I am > certain that in the future advantages will come from this for me.Hans > Sittner (1965), Richard St√∂hr. Mensch/Musiker/Lehrer. Vienna* Doblinger, p. > 12. He was also encouraged in his musical activities by Heinrich Porges, who helped him get around in Viennese musical circles, and who introduced him to Gustav Mahler, among others.[https://www.eclassical.com/shop/17115/art40/4877940-d624f5-5060113442109.pdf Stefan Koch, \\"Richard St√∂hr (2014). Viennese Composer in American Exile\\". Booklet for Richard St√∂hr, Chamber Music Volume One. Toccata Classics 0210, pp. 2-7. =Career in Austria= After completing his studies with Fuchs and earning a PhD in Music (1903) he first worked at the Academy as a rehearsal pianist and choir director. Soon he was teaching courses in theory, composition and the history of music, and coaching chamber music. When Fuchs retired in 1911, St√∂hr took over his most advanced courses and he became a professor of music theory at the Academy in 1915. That same year he was called up to serve as a doctor by the Austrian army. He served in a hospital in the suburbs of Vienna and was able to live at home and continue teaching at the Academy. The length of his service is unknown. The extent of his success as an author and composer is summed up the diary summary of 1909: \\"Of even greater importance for me was the success of my \\"Harmonielehre\\", of which the first edition was already sold out in June and has therefore already appeared in the second edition. The critiques of this work were extremely positive from all sides. The performances of my compositions reached such frequency this season that some newspapers even commented that this was inappropriate.\\"Koch, \\"Richard St√∂hr\\", p. 3. St√∂hr was married to his first wife in 1904, a marriage which lasted only three years. In 1909 he met his second wife Marie (Mitzi). As he was unable to obtain a divorce from his first wife, Richard and Marie lived together from 1909 until 1923, when they were finally able to marry. Their children Richard and Hedwig (Hedi) were born in the 1920s. In this decade he solidified his status as a leading musical theorist and also published treatises and textbooks on counterpoint and musical form. He also performed frequently as a pianist and he was able to have virtually all of his compositions published. Before his exile there were hundreds of performances of his works annually in Europe. Around 1930, Austria's dismal economy and growing antisemitism prompted St√∂hr to begin learning English. It is unknown exactly why, though it may have been part of a plan to emigrate, or simply as preparation in case he had to emigrate. A candid picture of St√∂hr's life in the 1920s comes from the following reminiscence by a former student, Hedy Kempny, written in 1954 on the occasion of St√∂hr's 80th birthday: > During the 1920s I was a student of Dr. Richard St√∂hr at the Academy of > Music in Vienna. He was my teacher of History of Music and Harmony. All of > us women students were very fond of him. Not only was he a very handsome > man, but we also found his teaching fascinating. Soon we followed him > wherever he went; to concerts or when he was invited into private homes, > where musicians dared to make us acquainted with a new kind of music by > composers such as Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg, Alban > Berg, Eric Korngold and many others. St√∂hr was still Conservative, but open > minded about the new era, which soon hypnotized us. We followed with > enthusiasm. At the end of World War One many Viennese young people, > including myself, were stricken with tuberculosis. This was no wonder after > the starvation and hardship during the war and inflation. But St√∂hr had > plans for helping us. He had connections through former students in > Switzerland and Norway. He wrote personal letters to each of them begging > them to invite us to their countries in order to help us recuperate and to > feed us so we would lose the \\"string bean\\" look. He suggested in his letters > that we would bring along the renowned Viennese charm, the love of music and > an optimistic outlook in spite of all the misery we had experienced. The > effort was a tremendous success, and I believe that our benefactors were not > disappointed to have invited us. St√∂hr lived in a typical \\"old Vienna\\" home > with two pianos in the huge music room. On the walls, there were photos of > composers and famous people he knew in various countries, as well as > snapshots of students and friends. Every two weeks he had an \\"open house\\" to > which anyone who wanted to come was invited. We would gather at about seven > o'clock and bring along friends who wanted to meet Dr. St√∂hr. It was quite > informal, and sometimes he came later and found the apartment crowded by > thirty or more people. Many of us brought food such as cheese, sausages, > salads, fruit or cakes. We deposited these in the kitchen and after a short > time, we gathered in the living room, where all the goodies were displayed > on the table and we helped ourselves. But soon St√∂hr got up and went to the > music room and sat at the piano. He called out \\"Purfferl\\", his pet name for > his wife Mitzi, and she came quickly and stood behind him and massaged his > head while he played. Indeed this was strange, but we knew of this eccentric > behavior of his and nobody minded. He had other strange habits. For > instance, when he was invited to someone's house he brought out of a pocket > a folding coathanger for his coat. Many times all kinds of famous people > attended these gatherings without fanfare. For instance Bruno Walter, Felix > Weingartner, Korngold and other musicians. Sometimes St√∂hr's beautiful > Lieder were interpreted by opera singers. Later in the evening, there were > discussions, not only about music, but also about what was new and exciting > in Vienna. We discussed the music of Gustav Mahler. We younger ones loved it > from the beginning. There was never a concert of Mahler's music, often > conducted by Bruno Walter, without a fight between us and the older > generation. After a Mahler symphony, when we admirers stood up, applauded > and shouted with excitement, the opponents were chased out by us and finally > after many calls, Bruno Walter would come out once more. We stood close to > the ramp, stretching our hands out to him - the greatest interpreter and > friend of Gustav Mahler. St√∂hr talked and listened and argued. He was versed > in every field and subject. The discussions were most interesting and > stimulating. St√∂hr's heart and mind stayed young and flexible. He gave help > and advice to us younger ones who asked for it. What a wise man he > was![http://www.richardstoehr.com/biography/ Daniel Stohr (2019). > \\"Biography, Richard St√∂hr (Stoehr): 1874-1967\\". > www.richardstoehr.com/biography. Accessed 28 December 2019. =National socialist takeover and dismissal= After German troops marched into Austria as part of the Anschluss on 13 March [1938], an SS intelligence unit was housed in the state Academy. Over the next few days, the interim director suspended eleven teachers who, under the Nuremberg Race Laws, did not have the \\"right\\" to swear allegiance to Hitler due to their Jewish extraction. A list of cuts dated May 1938 contains the names of 23 teachers who were no longer to be employed on the grounds of their race. St√∂hr was among them. Several of the teachers were allowed to emigrate. The fate of several other teachers is unknown. =Emigration to the USA= In February 1939 Richard St√∂hr emigrated to the United States. From this time until the end of his life he used the alternate spelling of his name: Stoehr. He was hired by the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, initially as music librarian and subsequently to teach courses in theory and composition. Leonard Bernstein was among his students at Curtis. Stoehr was also hired to translate part of the Burrell Collection of the Letters of Richard Wagner. Curtis downsized their faculty in 1941 due to the war and Stoehr was let go from his position there. He quickly found another position at Saint Michael's College, then in Winooski Park, now in Colchester, Vermont. There he taught German language as well as music courses. The College was not able to pay a full-time salary, so Stoehr was assisted by at least one refugee aid organization. Stoehr continued to compose prolifically during his years in the US in all major classical genres except opera. None of the numerous compositions from his US years were ever published. Richard Stoehr died in December, 1967 in Montpelier, Vermont and is buried in Merrill Cemetery in Colchester. Legacy Richard Stoehr's diary spanning more than six decades is stored in the Austrian National Library along with his published compositions. Copies of most of his published compositions as well as the manuscripts of his compositions from the post- emigration years are available at the Saint Michael's College Archive. His work encompasses choral music, chamber music, seven symphonies,At least one, his opus 18 in A minor, was published in 1911 by Feuchtinger of Stuttgart, according to Hofmeisters Monatsberichte. symphonic poems, two operas, an oratorio and two cantatas. While Schoenberg and others of the Second Viennese School were creating a new 20th Century style of composition, Stoehr seemed hardly influenced by them. Contemporary critics respected his music which maintained the tonal tradition of the 19th Century. In 2003 the City of Vienna dedicated a plaque at the site of his former residence at Karolinengasse 14. In 2010 ORF (Austrian National Radio) released a Richard St√∂hr compact disc recording (CD 3093) of his String Quartet in D minor, Opus 22 from 1903 amongst other pieces. His flute sonata is available on an David Shostac CD entitled Masterpieces Remembered. St√∂hr's cello works are available on a CD released by Toccata Classics. In February of 2010 his String Quartet was performed in Vancouver, Canada by the Vancouver Chamber Players for Rediscovered Treasures on the Out For Lunch concert series.

Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze.\\" Peter Travis of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that \\"a luminous cast reveals long-buried feelings. Meryl Streep finds the expansive soul behind prim schoolteacher Kate. And she is matched by Kathy Burke's bawdy Maggie, Brid Brennan's secretive Agnes, Sophie Thompson's slow-witted Rose and Catherine McCormack's bold Christina, who never married the father of her son.\\" Darrell Johnston, the youngest of the cast was also nominated for a best young actor in a supporting role.

In 1875, he became habilitated for surgery, and from 1879 was chief physician and an associate professor at Berlin's Augusta Hospital. In 1890 he was appointed professor of surgery at the University of Marburg, later returning as a surgeon to Berlin (1907). In 1872 K√ºster was a founding member of the German Society of Surgery, being chosen as its chairman in 1903. He is credited for developing the foundation of modern radical mastoidectomy for treatment of chronic ear disease.

According to the earliest Indian Buddhist sutras, Pindola Bharadvaja was one of four Arhats asked by the Buddha to remain in the world (Chinese: ‰Ωè‰∏ñ) to propagate Buddhist law (Dharma). Each of the four was associated with one of the four compass directions. Pindola is said to have excelled in the mastery of occult and psychic powers. He was once remonstrated by the Buddha for misusing his powers to impress simple, ignorant people. Along with Ananda, Pindola preached to the women of Udena's palace at Kosambi on two occasions.Vin.ii.290f; SNA.ii.514; J.iv.375 In later centuries, the number of Arhats increases from four to Sixteen Arhats, then later on to 18. In Tibetan Thangka paintings depicting the 18 Arhats, Pindola Bharadvaja is usually depicted holding a book and begging bowl. Regional Influence =Japan= Statue attributed to 1299 AD of Binzuru at Banna-ji Temple, Japan Wooden Binzuru (healer) sculpture at Todai-ji temple in Nara, Japan In Japan, Pindola is called , a short form of , and is arguably the most popular of all the Arhats. The monastery refectory near T≈çdai-ji Temple at Nara has a large wooden statue of Binzuru, depicting him seated in the lotus position. Statues of him are usually well worn, since the faithful follow the custom of rubbing a part of the effigy corresponding to the sick parts of their bodies, as he is reputed to have the gift of healing. Nagano, whose Zenkoji temple also hosts a well-worn Binzuru statue, stages a yearly Binzuru festival. He is also very frequently offered red and white bibs and children's caps to watch over the health of babies, so that his statue is often decked in rags. He is represented in painting as an old man seated on a rock, holding in his hand a sort of sceptre (a Japanese shaku), or a sutra box and a feather fan. All the other Arahants are usually worshipped in Japan in his person. =Chinese Buddhism= In Chinese community, Pindola is usually called Bƒ´nt√≥ul√∫(), who is regarded as the \\"Blessing the First\\"(Á¶èÁî∞Á¨¨‰∏Ä) disciple of Sakyamuni Buddha. =Tibetan Buddhism= Pindola Bharadvaja (Skt.

Born into a family of royal chaplains, he found no meaning in this life. Seeing the gifts and favours that were bestowed on the Buddha's disciples he had decided to become a monk. At first he was very greedy, and went about with a large alms bowl, however, following the Buddha's personal advice he conquered his greed and lived strictly on whatever he received and soon became an arhat. He constantly showed his gratitude to the Buddha by obeying his words and working only for the benefit of others. Pindola Bharadvaja lives in a mountain cave on the eastern continent (Purvavideha) with 1,000 arhats.

The company manufactures copies of folding bicycle designs, including those originally created by Brompton Bicycle and Dahon. Neobike's operation in copied products later became Grace Gallant (), sold under the Flamingo () brandname. History Neobike International was originally created in 1992 as a joint-venture company formed between Euro-Tai SA of Taiwan and Brompton Bicycle Ltd of the United Kingdom. The remit was to produce officially licensed copies of the Brompton folding bicycle for sale into Asian and Japanese markets, where Brompton were not able to keep up with demand. For this, Brompton loaned Neobike design plans and specialist tooling, in exchange for a per-unit royalty agreement. Later during 1992 the Neobike company hired a number of ex-Dahon employees from Dahon's research and development department and started to produce unlicensed Dahon copies, in addition to its officially sanctioned Brompton model. Original Brompton folding bicycles manufactured by Brompton Bicycle Ltd in England were made of steel, but the frame material for the Taiwan copies was changed from steel to aluminium. On 31 December 2002 the ten-year franchise agreement between Brompton and Euro- Tai for Neobike to produce officially licensed Brompton models expired, at which point Euro-Tai and Neobike failed to return loaned tools to Brompton Bicycle Ltd. During the ten-year period the royalties paid had amounted to under ¬£10,000. One week later, on 7 January 2003, Euro-Tai sold its majority stake in Neobike to YTS Manufacturing, an aluminium extrusion company who had already been producing frames for Neobike. During 2003, Neobike exhibited a‚Äînow unlicensed‚Äîcopy of the Brompton bicycle design at the European Eurobike show. Unlicensed copies of the Brompton product were then imported into The Netherlands (under the name \\"Scoop One\\" and \\"Astra Flex V3\\"), into the United Kingdom (under the name \\"Merc\\") and into Spain (as the Nishiki \\"Oxford Bicycle\\"). In 2004, Grace Gallant Enterprises was created, and Neobike's interests in the unlicensed copy designs were transferred to Grace Gallant, to be sold under the \\"Flamingo\\" brandname. =Court cases= On 2 April 2002 in Dahon vs. Hsiao, et al, five senior Neobike employees were convicted and given jail sentences for a variety of business-related offences, including patent fraud. Three employees who had previously worked in Dahon's research and development department from the late 1980s, up until the formation of Neobike International in 1992 were convicted on their violation of signed non-compete contracts. On 26 February 2004 a consignment of 250+ \\"Scoop\\" branded bicycles were impounded at the decision of the court in Groningen, in The Netherlands. The judgement against Vincent van Ellen and Neobike Europe on copyright grounds was released later in September 2004. On 24 May 2006 in Brompton Bicycle Limited v Rijwielbedrijf Vincent Van Ellen BV, Neobike's Dutch importer was convicted of copyright infringement of the Brompton design under Article 19 of the Dutch Copyright law. The entire import of Neobike Brompton- copies were seized and destroyed along with an injunction to prevent further imports. In June 2010, Brompton Bicycle Limited obtained an injunction at the Commercial Court No. 5 in Madrid, Spain, following a ruling that copies of the Brompton being sold under the name \\"Nishiki Oxford\\" infringed Brompton's copyright.

From his great stature he was known among the Highlanders as \\"Coinneach Mor\\" (Great Kenneth). Origins and education Mackenzie was the eldest son of George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth (died 1651) and Barbara, daughter of Arthur, Lord Forbes. The Mackenzies were a clan from Ross-shire that had risen to prominence in the 15th century during the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles. He was born at Brahan Castle in 1635, and when he was five or six years old his father placed him under the care of the Rev. Farquhar Macrae, minister of Kintail, and constable of Eilean Donan, who had a seminary in his house which was attended by the sons of the neighbouring gentry. From there, he went to public school and was sent in 1651 to King's College, Aberdeen, under the discipline of Mr Patrick Sandylands. Attempt to raise the clan However, he had not been there long when the King arrived in Stirling and began to recruit an army for his proposed invasion of England. Kenneth‚Äôs father remained in Holland, so he went home himself to raise his men for the King‚Äôs service. He went straight to Kintail with leading members of his clan (his uncles, the Lairds of Pluscarden and Lochslinn; young Tarbat, Rory of Davochmaluag, Kenneth of Coul, Hector of Fairburn, and several others), but the Kintail men declined to rise with him, because he was but a child, asserting that they would not move without his father, their master, since the King, if he had use for him and for his followers, might easily bring him home. Adherent to Charles II Immediately after the Battle of Worcester, at which Charles was defeated by Cromwell in 1651 - where we find among those present Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscarden as one of the Colonels of foot for Inverness and Ross, and Alexander Cam Mackenzie, fourth son of Alexander, fifth of Gairloch - Charles fled to the Continent, and, after many severe hardships and narrow escapes, he found refuge in Flanders, where he continued to reside, often in great want and distress, until the Restoration in May, 1660. The Earl of Cromartie says that subsequent to the treaty agreed upon between Middleton and Leslie at Strathbogie, \\"Seaforth joined the King at Stirling. After the fatal battle of Worcester he continued a close prisoner until the Restoration of Charles.\\" He was excepted from Oliver Cromwell's Ordnance of Pardon and Grace to Scotland in 1654, and his estates were forfeited, without any provision being allowed out of it for his wife and family. He supported the King's cause as long as there was an opportunity of fighting for it in the field, and when forced to submit to the opposing forces of Cromwell and the Commonwealth he was committed to prison, where, with \\"much firmness of mind and nobility of soul,\\" he endured a tedious captivity for many years. Referring to the position of affairs at this period, the Laird of Applecross said that the \\"rebels, possessing the authority, oppressed all the loyal subjects, and him with the first; his estate was over-burthened to its destruction, but nothing could deter him so as to bring him to forsake his King or his duty\\". When Charles II was recalled in 1660, he ordered his old and faithful friend Seaforth to be released, after which he became a great favourite at the licentious and profligate Court. On 23 April 1662 he received a Commission of the Sheriffship of Ross-shire, which was afterwards renewed to him and to his eldest son, jointly, on 31 July 1675; and when he had set his affairs in order at Brahan, he re-visited Paris, leaving his wife in charge of his interests in the North. Family and posterity Kenneth married in about 1660 Isobel, daughter of Sir John Mackenzie of Tarbat, father of George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie.The Complete Peerage, volume XI, London 1949 They had four sons and four daughters, including his heir, Kenneth Mackenzie, 4th Earl of Seaforth, who succeeded him on his death in December 1678.

It was directed by David Butler to a script by William M. Conselman, Owen Davis, and Jack Moffitt. It was produced by Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century Fox), who had earlier produced the 1921 silent adaptation of the novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.

Lacy, The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 152 (New York: Garland, 1991); . As in The Wizard of Oz, many of the actors in the film play more than one role, a character in the real world and one in the dream world. The film stars Will Rogers as Hank Martin, an American accidental time traveler who finds himself in Camelot back in the days of King Arthur (William Farnum, a Fox star for many years). Myrna Loy and Brandon Hurst play the evil Morgan le Fay and Merlin, who must be overcome by Hank's modern technical knowledge, while Maureen O'Sullivan plays Alisande. Fox was likely inspired to produce A Connecticut Yankee based on the success of the 1921 silent film. The 1931 version was likewise successful, and was re-released in 1936. It is unrelated to the 1927 musical also titled A Connecticut Yankee. The hero's name was changed from Hank Morgan to Hank Martin, possibly because the original name sounded too similar to that of actor Frank Morgan.

This is a national Site of Special Scientific Interest in the United Kingdom, due to its biodiversity and undisturbed character. Pollen analysis has revealed the first peat deposits of the northwest's mosslands to be from around 8,000 years BC making Red Moss an impressive 10,000 years old. Red Moss covers an area of 47.2 hectares. A severed female head was discovered in Red Moss in the 19th century dating from the Bronze Age or early Iron Age. Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council owns most of the moss, but parts of the site are also owned by British Rail and United Utilities. History In 1999, the Wildlife Trust for Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside was asked to manage the area of land owned by Bolton Council with the aim of restoring suitable water levels and conditions for the growth of mossland species. Since 1999, the Trust has been undertaking large-scale capital works to block drainage ditches and raise water levels within the mossland to a level suitable for the growth of mossland species. Baulkways, strips of higher land, have been created to isolate the mossland so that the site is now fed purely from rainfall and helps protect the site from pollution. Water levels have risen considerably and mossland vegetation is now beginning to flourish over a wider area of the site. It is also hoped that in the future many of the species that have been lost can be re-established. In May 2010, the area was badly damaged by a fire. Fauna and flora =Fauna= Snipe and teal breed on the open mossland and the locally scarce black darter is present. =Flora= The site is notable for its diversity of sphagnum moss species, with nine species identified as present on the site. Other plants present include common cottongrass and hare's tail cottongrass and purple moor grass, which dominates most of the site.

It housed the seat of the local government from 1801 to 1821. It is one of the oldest remaining public buildings in the city. It was built as a courthouse in 1801 and was expanded later when it served as a private residence. With . History =19th Century= The Old Government House was built in 1801 and housed the seat of the local government. In 1821, the government sold the building to former Mayor Samuel Hale. He converted the Old Government House into an elegant residence. Many other prominent families lived in the building including those of Colonel Paul Fitzsimmons, a Charleston ship magnate, Colonel James Gardner, and James Gregg, son of the founder of Graniteville Mills. In 1877, Dr. Eugene Murphey purchased the property. His family lived in the building for 75 years. =20th Century= Dr. Murphey sold the estate to the Augusta Junior League in 1952. The organization used it as a reception facility until the 1970s, when they gave it to Historic Augusta. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The City of Augusta purchased the property in 1987. City officials hired VGR Architect, to revitalize the Old Government House into a reception hall to retain its historic significance. Architecture The architecture of the Old Government House has a historic impact on Augusta. It was built in a Federal style brick with parapet end chimneys. When the building became a residence, the owner stuccoed the walls adding the elaborate recessed wings, iron portico, balcony, and trimmed windows. These changes were made in 1821 and 1839. Today Today, the Old Government House is a historic reception hall that accommodates various parties and receptions. It can also be seen on the city seal and flag.

The locomotive works of Maffei in Munich based its design on principles developed in-house by Hammel and Leppla, which had already proved themselves well on the Bavarian S 3/6. In fact there is a clear line of development for Maffei locomotives from the twin-cylinder Bavarian G 4/5 N through the C 4/5s built for the Swiss Gotthard railway and the Baden VIII e delivered to the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways to the G 4/5 H. The locomotives had a superheated, four-cylinder, compound engine and a bar frame, like most other Bavarian four-cylinder compounds, which simplified access to the inside driving gear. All four cylinders drove the second coupled axle. The leading axle was of the Adams type. Between 1915 and 1919 195 engines were built by Maffei and Krauss for the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Another 10 locomotives were ordered by the Imperial Railway Office (Reichseisenbahnamt) for MGD Brussels and 25 by the Head of Military Railways for war service and which were taken over by Bavaria after the First World War. 48 engines were transferred to France in 1919, as part of the ceasefire agreement, and 13 went to Belgium. The remaining 169 engines left in Germany were renumbered by the Deutsche Reichsbahn to 56 801‚Äì809, 56 901‚Äì1035 und 56 1101‚Äì1125. Due to falling demand for transportation during the worldwide economic crisis, the electrification of lines in south Bavaria and the restationing of simpler, Prussian goods locomotives to Bavaria in great numbers the G 4/5 H was retired very quickly. This began as early as 1933 and was carried through so rapidly that by the beginning of the Second World War there were only 5 examples left. Two engines survived the war, but were retired and scrapped in 1947. The actual reasons for the premature retirement of this class can only be speculated upon today, but it may at least in part have been due to the opposition of the influential head of the construction department, Richard Paul Wagner, to \\"south German\\" four-cylinder, compound locomotives. The G 4/5 Hs were coupled with tenders of Class bay 3 T 20.2 which, after the G 4/5 H's early retirement, were often attached to Prussian G 10 locomotives stationed in Bavaria because they were still relatively new and had a large capacity.

Its boundaries are imprecise but the area roughly flanks Rockland Avenue. The neighbourhood was founded as, and remains, one of the tonier neighbourhoods in the city, and contains a notable concentration of opulent houses and heritage architecture and lush gardenscapes. The two largest, and most famous, of Rockland's residences are Craigdarroch Castle, built by the Dunsmuir fortune, and Government House.  History  The area known today as Rockland was originally divided between the land grants taken up by James Douglas, second governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island and Joseph Despard Pemberton. As early as 1860 Cary Castle was built on a high point in Rockland with extensive views south to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Cary Castle was used as residence by Arthur Kennedy, governor of Vancouver Island and served as the vice-regal residence for the Lieutenant- Governors of British Columbia when the Province entered Confederation in 1871.Martin Segger and Douglas Franklin, Victoria: A Primer for Regional History in Architecture, Victoria: Heritage Architectural Guides, p. 277 The original Cary Castle was destroyed by fire in 1903, but was replaced by another grand mansion designed by architects Samuel Maclure, designer of many of Victoria's grandest homes, and Francis Rattenbury, architect of the British Columbia Parliament Buildings. This building was in turn destroyed by fire in 1957, and was replaced by the present building that serves as Government House. Cary Castle, British Columbia's first Government House In the late Victorian period additional grand homes were constructed along Belcher Avenue, as Rockland Avenue was then known, including Duvals, constructed in 1862 and occupied by Joseph Needham, Chief Justice at the time of the Colony of Vancouver Island, and later of Trinidad, before being sold to Francis Jones Barnard who operated a freighting company and stage coach line to the Cariboo and was later a member of the House of Commons of Canada (his son Francis Stillman Barnard was later Lieutenant-Governor).Segger and Franklin, p. 283 Gonzales, the home of Joseph Pemberton, was built in 1885 near the corner of Rockland and St. Charles Street.Terry Reksten, More English than the English, Victoria: Orca Book Publishers, 1986, p. 87 Fairholme, the home of John Chapman Davie and his wife Sara Holmes Todd, was built in 1886 on Rockland Hill.Green, Valerie. \\"If These Walls Could Talk: Victoria's Houses from the Past\\". TouchWood Editions, 2001, p. 29 Gyppeswyk, built in 1889 for the Greens who, like many of Rockland's early residents, relocated from the once fashionable James Bay neighbourhood to take up residence in Rockland, served briefly as the residence of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia after a fire destroyed Cary Castle. Located on Moss Street, Gyppeswyk forms today the nucleus of the Greater Victoria Art Gallery. Another home built in 1889 was The Laurels, which was later used as a boys' school, the gymnasium of which continues in use as the Langham Court Theatre.Segger and Franklin, p. 269 Further along Rockland Avenue stands the Rattenbury-designed residence built in 1900 for Lyman Duff, who became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and his wife Elizabeth. The most costly residence built in Rockland during the Victorian era was Craigdarroch Castle. Craigdarroch Castle was constructed in the 1890s as a family residence for the wealthy coal baron Robert Dunsmuir and his wife Joan. Robert died in April 1889, more than a year before construction on the castle was completed, and was set on of grounds with an entrance on Fort Street. His sons Alexander and James took over the role of finishing the castle after his death. The initial architect of the castle, Warren Williams, also died before completion of the castle. His work was taken over by his associate, Arthur L. Smith, in 1890. After the death of Joan Dunsmuir the castle was raffled off, served as a convalescent home for soldiers during the First World War, then as Victoria College, the forerunner to the University of Victoria from 1920 to 1946.Segger and Franklin, p. 287 Apart from Government House itself, there are relatively few public buildings of any type in Rockland. At the beginning of Rockland Avenue on the edge of Downtown Victoria stands Christ Church Cathedral, begun in the 1890s with construction extending to 1990. Built in a Gothic style reminiscent of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and Durham Cathedral, Christ Church is the cathedral church of the diocese of British Columbia.Segger and Franklin, p. 217 The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria on Moss Street is the only other significant public institution in the area.

It was preceded by a number of foreshocks, the largest being a 5.7 shock on the previous day. The earthquake was felt strongly throughout central Malawi, and also felt in parts of Mozambique (Niassa and Tete Provinces) and Zambia (Eastern Province). Nine people were killed, with many others injured or left homeless. Damage and casualties Nine people are known to have been killed as a result of the earthquake ‚Äì six in Dedza, two in Salima, and one in Chitala. At least two of the deaths (one in Dedza and one in Chitala) were caused by roof collapses, in both cases occurring in houses with roofs built from blocks of baked clay (a non-standard method of construction). The total number of injuries from the earthquake has been estimated at 100, and the total number of people left homeless at about 50,000. Urban areas were worst affected by the quake, as houses were more likely to be built of brick and thus more susceptible to cracking. The major building with the most visible damage was the Nanjoka Railway Station complex, which developed severe cracks in its walls and was subsequently abandoned. The Chitala Farm Institute, an agricultural school, was also heavily damaged. In rural areas, most dwellings were simple huts, built by pasting mud or clay onto timber frames. These were left mostly undamaged. Geology The 1989 Malawi earthquake was the result of a dip-slip fault in the Malawi rift system, part of the larger East African Rift. It is believed to have occurred at a depth of about , with the lack of surface faulting being attributed to its occurrence at a relatively deep level. The International Seismological Centre (ISC) placed the epicentre of the 1989 Malawi earthquake at , although the accuracy of their determination was affected by the lack of seismic stations in the area ‚Äì the closest was away, and there were only two within . It has been suggested that the margin of error for the epicentre is consequently around . The earthquake triggered landslides in the Manyani Hills, around east northeast of Kasungu. Slumping of in length and in width was observed, and attributed to heavy rainfall earlier in the year combined with deforestation-related soil exposure. There was also a large rock fall in the Chongomi Mountains of Dedza District, which resulted in hillside scarring. However, both of those areas were sparsely populated, and there were no reported casualties. Aftermath In the same month as the earthquake, Malawi was hit by a cyclone and suffered severe flooding. The combination of natural disasters left over 200,000 people homeless and led to the government appealing for international assistance. A field study conducted in October 1989 concluded that the March 1989 earthquake \\"should be treated as an eye opener, drawing attention to the potential of medium-size earthquakes hitting major cities in Malawi\\".

It is the fifth-largest lake located entirely in New Hampshire. The lake is approximately long (north-south) and from wide (east-west), covering ,New Hampshire GRANIT database with a maximum depth of . It contains eleven islands (Loon Island, Elizabeth Island, Twin Islands, Great Island, Minute Island, Little Island, Star Island, Emerald Island, Isle of Pines and Penny Island) and is indented by several peninsulas and lake fingers, a combination which yields a total shoreline of some . There are seven sandy beach areas including Mount Sunapee State Park beach; some with restricted town access. There are six boat ramps to access the lake at Sunapee Harbor, Georges Mills, Newbury, Mount Sunapee State Park, Burkehaven Marina, and a private marina. The lake contains three lighthouses on the National Register of Historic Places. The driving distance around the lake is with many miles of lake water view. The lake is above sea level. The lake's outlet is in Sunapee Harbor, the headway for the Sugar River, which flows west through Newport and Claremont to the Connecticut River and then to the Atlantic Ocean. The lake discharges about 250 cubic feet per second (on average), and the Sugar River drops approximately on its journey to the Connecticut River.  History  Lake Sunapee is a glacial lake. The glaciers deposited large rocks scattered everywhere in the woods when the ice melted about 11,000 years ago. These rocks are called glacial erratics. An example of a large glacial erratic can be found sitting on Minute Island in front of the John Hay Wildlife Refuge accessible along the wildlife shoreline trail. The Native Americans, probably Algonquins, called the lake Soo-Nipi or \\"Wild Goose Waters\\" for the many geese that passed over the lake during migration. Lake Sunapee also resembles a bird (goose) in flight, with the bird's head as the harbor area, from an aerial view, and at times from Mount Sunapee. Some local people can trace their ancestry back to the Penacooks who hunted geese in the autumn and fished for speckled trout using nets, weirs and spears. = The steamboat era = Following the extension of the B&M; Railroad into Newbury, Lake Sunapee became a popular vacation area long before the introduction of the automobile. The main rail station was at Newbury Harbor, the southernmost point of the lake. Today, the village contains a colorful antique caboose commemorating the railroad line that passed by, bringing vacationers from other parts of the country. Steamboat service developed on the lake to accommodate the new populace. Steamships ferried passengers from the south end of the lake to cottages and large resort hotels around the lake. Bay Point, Blodgett Landing, and Indian Cave, later known as Lake Avenue, were the most populated piers. One of the first commercial boats was actually propelled by horses in 1854. The MV Kearsarge on Lake Sunapee with Herrick Cove Lighthouse at a distance N.S. Gardner purchased Little Island for $1.00 and put a bowling alley on it. He then launched the Penacook (later renamed Mountain Maid) steamer to carry passengers to Little Island, and so the steamboat era began. The Woodsum brothers launched the Lady Woodsum in 1876. It was long and could carry 75 passengers. The Edmund Burke was launched in 1885, carrying 600 passengers. In 1887, the Amenia White was launched; it was long and carried 650. It was the flagship of the Woodsum fleet and the biggest steamer ever to sail Lake Sunapee. In 1897 the steamship Kearsarge was launched carrying 250 passengers and continues to steam daily in the summer months. In 1902 the Weetamoo was launched and was later scuttled near Newbury. The ship is still intact and is visited frequently by local SCUBA clubs. The pilothouse of the Kearsarge was salvaged from the lake in the 1960s and is on display at the Sunapee Historical Center. The MV Mount Sunapee II was launched in 1965 and takes passengers on lake cruises in summer months. The original Mount Sunapee was named Susie Q and had been a rum runner in Damariscotta, Maine. There were major steamer landings at Sunapee Harbor, Georges Mills, Lakeside Landing, Hastings Landing, Auburn Landing, Blodgett Landing, Brightwood, Pine Cliff, Lake Station, Soo-Nipi, Burkehaven, and Granliden to serve the grand hotels. The automobile led to the demise of the steamer era.  Cities and towns  Loon Lighthouse; one of three lighthouses on Lake Sunapee The lake is surrounded by three towns: Sunapee lies to the west, incorporating the villages of Sunapee Harbor and Georges Mills; Newbury lies to its southeast and southwest; and New London is to its east.  Facts about Lake Sunapee  ; Depth: At its deepest, Lake Sunapee is about deep at a point called Hedgehog. Historical maps indicate a depth of , but no recent soundings have exceeded . There is a scuba school in Newbury on the lake. ; Water quality: The water is exceptionally pure. The water is captured frequently by the LSPA (Lake Sunapee Protective Association) and analyzed at the Colby-Sawyer College aquatic laboratory. The source of much of the water comes from cold underground springs rising from a bedrock aquifer. On a sunny day, objects can be seen to a depth of . The lake has a generally rocky base (glacial erratics) and is currently milfoil-free, except for a quarantined area. ; Rainfall: One inch of rainfall on the lake produces of water. One inch in the watershed potentially produces nearly of water in Lake Sunapee. ; Ice Out: Records have been kept since 1869. The official \\"Ice Out\\" report was given by Artie Osborne until his death in 2010; now his son Richard Osborne carries that duty. Ice Out usually occurs in April each year. Occasionally Ice Out occurs in March or May, including: Taken at Sunapee Town Office September 20, 2011 :*May 10, 1869 :*May 10, 1870 :*May 3, 1872 :*May 6, 1873 :*May 9, 1972 :*May 12, 1975 :*May 11, 1876 :*May 12, 1879 :*May 6, 1881 :*May 7, 1883 :*May 7, 1887 :*May 14, 1888 (latest ice-out date) :*May 13, 1893 :*May 3, 1899 :*March 22, 2012 (previous earliest record) :*March 18, 2016 (record for earliest ice-out, first time to ever occur prior to the vernal equinox) Looking westward at Gardiner Bay, with entrance to Sunapee Harbor, upper left, and Burkehaven Hill; shows about 5% of Lake Sunapee water surface ; Golden trout and Sunapee trout: Salvelinus aureolus oquassa (Bean 1887). Common names: blueback trout, Sunapee trout. Other names: blueback char, golden trout, white trout. :The Sunapee Historical Society published a report in 1968 about Sunapee's golden trout which had a dull silver color like the females most of the year. The golden trout were really white trout, but in the fall, their nuptial season, the males turned a flaming color, attracting the name aureolus (golden halo). The golden trout had a forked tale rather than the square tail of the brook trout. :On January 15, 1921, the Lake Sunapee Fish and Game Club was founded. Rearing tanks were built at Georges Mills in 1922, and 50,000 land-locked salmon, 12,000 chinook salmon, 10,000 silver trout, and 2,000 brook trout, all fingerlings, were reared and planted. By 1940, when the fishery was closed, it had planted 347,403 landlocked and chinook salmon, 196,040 trout, 345,000 mixed trout and salmon, and more than 70 million smelt eggs. :With the introduction of lake trout into Sunapee, which was believed to be an error, the golden trout were bred out of existence. ; Fish of Lake Sunapee: Lake trout (which bred out the golden trout); landlocked salmon (Atlantic salmon) requiring deep, pure cold water; smallmouth bass; chain pickerel; yellow perch; brown bullhead catfish (commonly called \\"hornpout\\"); rock bass (red-eye bass)‚Äîpredatory, introduced accidentally into the lake, population controlled with children's fishing contests; rainbow smelt; burbot (ling cod). ; Animals of the watershed: It is not uncommon to spot a moose swimming across the lake in the morning; black bear; red foxes; whitetail deer; porcupines; woodchucks; eastern cottontail rabbits; eastern chipmunks; gray squirrels, red squirrels; northern flying squirrels; raccoons; beavers; muskrats; mink; river otters; long-tailed weasels; American martens; fishers. ; Loons: Nearly every year loon watchers are treated to the awesome sight of loons arriving on Lake Sunapee and fishing en masse. Recorded photos show as many as 40 loons arriving at the same time. The wild calls and yodeling of the loons can be heard morning and night around the lake. LSPA Loon Committee reported in 2011 that the lake can support as many as 40 loons, but at this time with pressure on habitats, only two pairs of loons nest on the lake. Also called the great northern diver in Eurasia, they dive for fish at depths of up to and fly in excess of an hour. The loon population has been on the upswing, particularly with the use of artificial nesting islands. In 2015, two loon chicks were hatched. It was the first time in 40 years that baby loons were hatched on Lake Sunapee. They were named \\"Soo\\" and \\"Nipi\\". ; Notable residents, past and present :*Peter A.

The Lake Sunapee watershed is part of the Connecticut River Basin. The watershed is surrounded by high hills and of town lands including parts of Sunapee, Newbury, Sutton, New London, Springfield and Goshen. There are 35 streams or tributaries that empty into Sunapee. The land/water ratio is 7:1. A watershed is an ecosystem of animals, plants, micro-organisms and people who all affect the physical and chemical environment. ; Lakes in the Sunapee watershed region: A large number of lakes lie in the watershed that contributes to Lake Sunapee. Directly upstream from Georges Mills at the north end of the lake is Otter Pond ( elevation), which in turn is fed by Little Sunapee Lake. Otter Pond is about higher than Lake Sunapee, and Little Sunapee () is about higher. Other lakes in the watershed include Baptist Pond, Star Lake, Morgan Pond, Dutchman Pond, Goose Hole, Mountainview Lake (), and Chalk Pond, as well as numerous small, unnamed water bodies. (Ledge Pond (elevation 1309 ft)See map prepared for Lake Sunapee Protection Association by June Fichter, 2007 previously listed as being a lake in the Lake Sunapee watershed, actually flows directly to Sugar River and on to the Connecticut.) ; Mountains in the Sunapee watershed region: To the north - Leavitt Hill, Hoyt Hill, Sanborn Hill, Morgan Hill; to the south - Mount Sunapee, South Peak, Bly Hill; to the east - Kings Hill, Burpee Hill; to the west - Prospect Hill, Trow Hill, Brown Hill, Burkehaven Hill, Blaisdell Hill. GLEON - Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network 250px The LSPA (Lake Sunapee Protective Association) has deployed the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) System in an area of the lake just east of Loon Island Lighthouse. LSPA has been collecting ecology data for more than 100 years.  Beaches on Lake Sunapee  Mount Sunapee State Park beach Lake Sunapee has seven white sandy beach areas: Sunapee Harbor; Dewey Beach, Georges Mills, Newbury Harbor, Soo-Nipi, Granliden, and the Mount Sunapee State Park beach. Mount Sunapee State Park offers activities for all seasons. Probably best known for its skiing and snowboarding, the park also offers opportunities for front-country camping, hiking, and swimming on the beach on Lake Sunapee. The entrance to Mount Sunapee State Park Beach is on the traffic circle opposite the entrance to the Mount Sunapee ski area in Newbury off Route 103B. There is ample parking. The sandy shore slopes gradually to crystal-clear deeper waters allowing bathers an opportunity to wade waist high for some distance from the shore line. The beach is the starting point for an occasional Iron Man Triathlon one-half mile swim sprint off the beach, followed by a bike race around the lake, followed by a marathon run around Lake Sunapee. Depending on weather, the park is open from 9:30 am ‚Äì 7:30 pm. Entrance fees apply for lake access during the summer months. Mount Sunapee abuts Lake Sunapee at the mid-southern end of the lake in Newbury.  Lighthouses  There are five lighthouses in New Hampshire; two on the Atlantic shore and three on Lake Sunapee. The Lake Sunapee lighthouses are Loon Island Lighthouse, Burkehaven Lighthouse and Lakeside Lighthouse.  Sunapee Dam  Lake Sunapee was the source of water power for the mills that were built on the banks of the Sugar River as it meandered through Newport and Claremont. Benjamin Giles built the first gristmill in 1768. Later in 1813, James Wolcott built a textile mill in Newport. The flow of water out of Lake Sunapee, however, was not regular; there would be either too much flooding or too much drought. Mills had to shut down in periods of low water. In 1820, some proprietors formed a group that led to the formation of the Sunapee Dam Corporation which, through an act of the New Hampshire legislature, obtained sole control of the lake's water level. The Dam Corporation lowered the dam threshold to below the low water mark with flood gates to control the level of the lake. Operation of the dam was uneventful from 1820 to 1858. By 1858 tourism became an important industry as more people were attracted to the beauty of Lake Sunapee. As the lake was lowered to power mills, the steamboats had difficulty maneuvering the waters, and farmers had to extend fences out into the water to contain livestock. Docks had to be extended. The controversy over the management of the water level became more contentious and continued to the turn of the 20th century. The New Hampshire legislature began to shift policy and concluded that (i) Lake Sunapee was mismanaged, and (ii) that all the lakes in New Hampshire should be managed for the benefit and access of the public. In 1905, legal actions ensued until finally all the parties to the suit, including the Lake Sunapee Protective Association, founded in that same year, agreed that the lake level must be maintained within the range of 1,108.5' and 1,111.5' elevation.White, Jane (Summer 2006), \\"The Whole Dam Story\\", Soo Nipi Magazine, XXIII (2): 17-21. www.soonipi.com; accessed June 28, 2006  Sailing  The Lake Sunapee Yacht Club is host to 23 Starboats, one of the largest inland fleets of the Olympic-class vessel.

It operated in Hopedale, Massachusetts for more than 130 years. Beginnings In the early 19th century, Ira Draper was a prosperous farmer from Weston, Massachusetts, with an ability for tinkering and improving machinery, such as a threshing machine that was a great improvement on any previous one made at the time. His great-great grandfather, James Draper had landed in Boston from England in 1650, and was \\"one of the first men in the American colonies to engage in the business of weaving and selling cloth\\".Draper Corporation History, 1946 In 1816, shortly after the first successful power loom in the United States was developed up by Paul Moody at Waltham, Massachusetts, Ira was granted a patent on an improved flyshuttle hand loom and the first self-acting temple.Archive.org The improvement allowed a weaver to run two power looms instead of one. Its labor- saving feature appealed to Ira, and he decided to push its sale to weavers in the area. In 1829 he took out a patent for an improvement on his original invention. In 1830 he sold his patents and the business to his eldest son, James of Wayland, Massachusetts. Ebenezer, a younger brother, bought the business in 1837, and later moved it from Wayland to Uxbridge, Massachusetts, the center of the growing textile mill area of the Blackstone Valley. In 1841, Ebenezer moved the company to nearby Hopedale, Massachusetts, where a new Christian settlement had been formed by Adin Ballou in 1841. Known as ‚ÄúFraternal Community No. 1‚Äù it was a communal association determined to create an ideal society. Hopedale was one of the most successful communal experiments of the era, but failed after fifteen years. Another brother George came to Hopedale in 1853 to join his brother in the firm of E.D. & George Draper. A year later he bought an interest in the new Dutcher temple, then made in North Bennington, Vermont. A temple is part of a loom used to improve the edges of the fabric; the Dutcher temple was an improvement on previous models. Two years later, the two companies would combine forces at Hopedale and become known as W. W. Dutcher & Company. This would be the first of several industries to be located in Hopedale within the next dozen years, for all of which E.D. & George Draper became managers and agents. Among the others were the Hopedale Machine Company and Hopedale Furnace Company. Ebenezer D. Draper retired in 1868. Over the 42 years that he was with the company, he patented many inventions that had improved the art of textile weaving. Between 1868 and 1887 George Draper became the leader and driving force behind the company started by his father years before. After Ebenezer's retirement in 1868, the company ventured into and made improvements the developing sector of ring spinning. By 1887, George Draper owned the patent rights or controlled the sale of 12 named varieties of ring spindles. Draper also made improvements to warpers and spoolers in this period. The Northrop loom In 1886, the three Draper Brothers of the third generation, still doing business at George Draper & Son were ready to increase their part in the loom field. They decided to undertake the design and manufacture of an automatic loom. There had been many patents of automatic devices but not one of them had ever proved practical: nor was any of them in successful operation anywhere. The company developed two shuttle-changing looms, the Rhoades in 1888 and the Northrop in 1889. The prototypes were given field tests at the Seaconnett Mills in Fall River, Massachusetts with encouraging results. The Northrop was named after its inventor, James H. Northrop who had emigrated from Keighley, Yorkshire, England in 1881. Northrop conceived the idea of forcing the spent bobbin through and out of the shuttle and replacing it with fresh bobbin. Further developments were made, and in 1894, eight years after beginning their venture, the Draper brothers were ready to begin production of the Northrop loom for the trade. In August 1894, the first Northrop Looms to be sold to a mill were shipped from Hopedale to Queen City Cotton Mills at Burlington, Vermont. There were 729 looms in the order. The Northrop Loom relieved the weaver of much of the drudgery of her work and enabled her to run sixteen looms at once. It is a very loud device however, and the noise of hundreds operating at once in the same room must have been overwhelming. The power looms also created a lot of vibrations, which forced them to be located on the lower level of the mills, or eventually in separate weave sheds, apart from the main mill buildings. In 1895, the Northrop Automatic Loom was patented in England, Belgium, Germany, Russia, Austria, and Spain. By 1900, Draper had sold over 60,000 Northrop Looms.Draper Northrop Loom Later years In 1917, the company became known as Draper Corporation. Focusing on looms for the cotton textile industry, Draper became part of the \\"Big Three\\" textile machinery makers in the Blackstone Valley, along with Crompton & Knowles of Worcester, Massachusetts, which focused on looms for wool, and the mighty Whitin Machine Works in nearby Whitinsville, Massachusetts which largely made spinning frames and cotton preparation machinery. The Draper automatic looms were a significant factor in the movement of the cotton textile industry to the South during this time. Draper even financed the construction of some of new Southern mills, to be filled with their superior product. Many Northern mill owners were reluctant, or were so heavily invested in older, outdated equipment that they could not afford to make the switch. At one time, more than 3,000 people were employed there. Long after most of the New England mills had closed, Draper continued to improve their products and sell them to the Southern textile companies, and others around the world. In 1967, control of the Draper Corporation was passed to Rockwell International. Eventually, competition from the highly technical, increasingly computerized Japanese machinery makers led to a demise in the textile machinery industry in the Blackstone Valley. Production ceased in the mid-1970s. A descendant of the family, Kristin Draper, is currently running Draper Knitting, a knitting mill and garment contractor.http://www.wickedlocal.com/article/20121121/News/311219867 See also *Bancroft Memorial Library *Hopedale, Massachusetts *Saco-Lowell Shops *Whitin Machine Works =Draper family= *William Franklin Draper (1842 ‚Äì 1910) *George A.

Perkins joined KU in June 2003, taking over for Al Bohl. Perkins previously held similar positions with the University of Connecticut, University of Maryland, College Park, Wichita State University and University of South Carolina Aiken where he gained a reputation for successfully cleaning up schools suffering under NCAA violations. Under Perkins direction, the athletics program at KU had several successful seasons, including winning the 2008 Orange Bowl in football and the 2008 Men's Basketball Championship. His tenure, though, ultimately ended in scandal and early retirement in 2010. Biography =Early life= Perkins is a native of Chelsea, Massachusetts, where he was inducted into the High School Athletics Hall of Fame. Following high school, Perkins played basketball at the University of Iowa from 1965 to 1967, where he was coached by former KU great Ralph Miller, a member of the Naismith Hall of Fame. He also received an undergraduate degree in education from the institution. At Iowa, Perkins pledged and activated the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. Administrative and coaching career =South Carolina Aiken= Perkins served as athletics director at the University of South Carolina Aiken from 1969 to 1980, overseeing the athletics department during the university's transition from a junior college to four-year institution. He also served as the head basketball coach from 1969 to 1979. In 1975 he received a master's degree in education from the University of South Carolina. In 2005, Perkins was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Education by the University of South Carolina Aiken. =Penn= From 1980 to 1983, Perkins served as associate athletic director at the University of Pennsylvania, managing the university's 28 varsity sports. =Wichita State= Perkins served as athletic director at Wichita State University from 1983 to 1987. Perkins took over a program that was on NCAA probation. Two years later, the NCAA cited WSU as having an \\"exemplary program.\\" During his tenure as AD, the WSU football program was ended, due to mounting budget issues. During his tenure, Perkins hired Eddie Fogler to replace Gene Smithson as head basketball coach and Ron Chismar to replace Willie Jeffries as head football coach. =Maryland= Perkins served as athletic director at the University of Maryland, College Park from 1987 to 1990. Perkins was brought in by Maryland to clean up the program after the investigation into the death of basketball player Len Bias revealed foul play within the organization. Perkins left the university following another NCAA investigation that took place after then basketball coach Bob Wade revealed to him that he and his staff had been violating several NCAA rules. Before leaving he hired Gary Williams to be the new head coach. Williams was previously the coach of Ohio State. =Connecticut= From 1990 to 2003, Perkins served as athletic director for the University of Connecticut, earning nationwide recognition for his efforts. Under Perkins' watch, the program won six NCAA national championships, including four in women's basketball, one in men's basketball, and one in men's soccer. Perkins was instrumental in bringing Division I-A football to the university. The football team joined Division I-A in 2000, and the Big East in 2004, after Perkins' departure. Perkins also brought drastic change to the athletics facilities. During Perkin's tenure, a $4 million hockey arena, $14 million student recreation center, a $2.5 million addition of seating to Harry A. Gampel Pavilion, a $3.5 million track and intramural facility, and the $90 million Rentschler Field football complex were all constructed. In 2000, he became the inaugural winner of the National Athletic Director of the Year Award. During his tenure, Perkins hired Skip Holtz as head football coach and Randy Edsall after Holtz resigned to join his father at South Carolina. =Kansas= Perkins served as athletic director of the University of Kansas from June 2003 to September 2010. While Perkins was AD, the football program won the 2008 Orange Bowl, and Kansas basketball brought home the 2008 Men's Basketball Championship. Upon arrival at KU, Perkins became aware of potential NCAA rules violations at KU and he initiated an internal investigation. After KU self-reported violations, the NCAA ruled in 2006 that KU demonstrated a \\"lack of institutional control\\" under its prior Athletic Director. As a result, Perkins added at least two new full-time compliance officers to the department. Perkins brought many facilities upgrades to the campus, and raised KU's athletics budget from $27 million to over $55 million. $10 million worth of renovations to Allen Fieldhouse were completed in 2005‚Äì06, including a new videoboard. Another $15 million was approved for further upgrades to the facility. The Booth Family Hall of Athletics was added to the eastern side of the fieldhouse, at a cost of $5 million. The Anderson Family Football complex officially opened on July 30, 2008 adjacent to the football field at Memorial Stadium, at a cost of $31 million. In 2009, $42 million in improvements for a new basketball practice and training facility, locker rooms, donor atrium, new concourses and other upgrades to Allen Fieldhouse were completed. Additionally $8 million were spent for improvement of student athlete housing. Other facilities upgrades during Perkin's tenure included new baseball and softball facilities, and a boathouse for the rowing team. Several major deals were negotiated during Perkins tenure, including a $26.67 million deal with adidas, a $40 million deal with ESPN, and an $86 million deal with IMG. In 2008, TIME magazine named Perkins one of the top-35 sports executives in the world, the only collegiate executive to make the list. However, Perkins' time at KU concluded with scandal. In March 2010, KU announced that it was conducting an internal investigation into the Athletics Department ticket office. A separate investigation by the FBI and IRS ultimately resulted in federal charges against five employees of the Athletics Department and one consultant, alleging that they had stolen more than $2 million of KU tickets to be illegally resold during Perkins' tenure. Perkins was not implicated in the scheme, but many of the five employees charged with crimes were hired or promoted to their positions by Perkins. By February 2011, all five employees pleaded guilty to the charges. Separately, in May 2010, Perkins was accused by a former Athletic Department employee of personally accepting exercise equipment in exchange for giving premium basketball tickets. As a result, Perkins was eventually fined by the State of Kansas Ethics Commission for violating rules against accepting gifts. On June 10, 2010, Perkins announced that he would retire after the 2010‚Äì11 school year, effective September 4, 2011. However, Perkins soon accelerated this schedule, and one year early, on September 7, 2010, he announced his retirement would be effective immediately. KU Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little named Associate Athletics Director Sean Lester as interim director for Kansas athletics. Despite the early retirement, KU agreed to pay Perkins the full $2 million salary he would have earned if he had stayed through September 2011, including a $600,000 retention bonus that he would have earned for working at KU through June 2011.

The Pays de ('land of') Retz is a historical subregion of France that currently forms part of the Loire-Atlantique department, but which previously formed part of the Duchy of Brittany. The area lies between the southern shore of the Loire estuary and the Marais breton (Breton marshlands), bordered to the west by the Baie de Bourgneuf (Bourgneuf Bay) and on the east by the Lac de Grand- Lieu (Grand-Lieu Lake) and a network of small rivers. Its main towns are Rez√© (which was its capital and the see of a Catholic Diocese of Rez√© from 510 to 851), Pornic, Paimb≈ìuf and Machecoul (another historical capital city).  History  Flag of Pays de RetzIn the early 9th century the area formed part of Frankish territory, but was coveted by the Breton ruler Nominoe. Nominoe and his son Erispoe won a series of victories over the Franks between 843 and 851, resulting in the Treaty of Angers (851) between Charles the Bald and Erispoe, which gave \\"Ratense\\" or Pays de Retz to Brittany.Ren√© Cintre, Les Marches de Bretagne au Moyen √Çge, √©ditions Jean Marie Pierre 1992 In subsequent centuries there was conflict between Brittany and Anjou over the area.

It was developed by Edward Grabowski Communications Ltd and published by MicroProse, and it is licensed by FIA to have real statistics for the 1996 Formula One season. A sequel, Grand Prix World, was released in 2000.  Gameplay The management menu The game is composed of long and short term \\"contracts\\", long term games being made up of 10 seasons of F1 (in game from 1996‚Äì2005) whilst short term challenges dictated a specific outcome to be met over 1, 2 or 3 seasons, failure of these resulting in being fired and losing the game. In long term challenges, the only way to lose the game is that the player's team goes bankrupt. The game can be played on the same computer with one to four players in a hotseat mode, assigning turns for the players to make their decisions. Before the start of a long term scenario, the player(s) may freely edit the teams and personnel to their liking by using a simple in-game editor. Short term scenarios cannot be modified. During the game the player(s) must hire and dismiss personnel, negotiate with sponsors to secure the team's finances, control the research of new parts to stay competitive, negotiate contracts with engine, fuel, and spare parts suppliers, control testing and set up the car according to hints given by the drivers. The race screenBefore a race weekend the player(s) can choose whether he/she wants to see the different sessions or just skip them, thus allowing the game to simulate the results. The car setup can also be altered during these sessions. Before the race the fuel and tyre strategy of both cars has to be set, the game giving a suggestion to the player(s) which can be freely modified. Stirling Moss provides commentary during the race. After the race certain news stories based on the race's results and current game events are displayed. Jacques Villeneuve (a new driver for the real 1996 season) is not named or photographed in the original version of the game. He is instead replaced by 'John Newhouse', an English translation of the Canadian's name, having the correct statistics but a different picture. This was due to Villeneuve owning the copyright to his name and likeness at the time, unlike other drivers who were copyrighted with FOA. This occurred under various guises in all of the Formula One games released from 1996 until 1999, when the issue was finally settled. (However, it is partially possible to work around this, as the game allows driver names to be changed before the start of a game). Taki Inoue, a driver scheduled to drive for Minardi in actual 1996 season but replaced by Giancarlo Fisichella at the last minute due to sponsorship reasons, makes an appearance as an driver the player can hire; all other drivers the player can hire are original characters.  Network play  Network play was also introduced in this version of the game, via Serial Connection, Modem, or TCP/IP, expanding the playability of the game. It is still possible to play the game on-line via a software such as Hamachi. Originally it could not support any mods, but recent discoveries have allowed the use of modifications in network games as well.  Game community  This game still has an active community built around it, providing updates of seasons past and present using both the internal and 3rd party editing tools. It has released quite a few mods, which are listed below. =Season updates= The first full modification for the game was released in 2004 and based on the same year's Formula One season. Ever since then a modification has been released each year for the contemporary season. There are also many historical mods, based on seasons before and after the game's original season (1996).  Reception  The game received quite mixed reviews at the time of its release, others praising the relatively low learning curve and simplicity, while major criticism was aimed at the game for its relatively poor interface, high difficulty, poor driver simulation, poor financial simulation and lack of overall improvements over the original Grand Prix Manager. Despite this, the game remains very popular among F1 management game fans.

Slalom skateboarding is a form of downhill skateboard racing that first appeared in the 1960s and 1970s and has made a resurgence in popularity in the 2000s. Slalom racers skate down a course usually marked by plastic cones. The racer tries to get through the course with the fastest time, while knocking down the fewest cones. Each cone typically carries a penalty of a fraction of a second (most often 0.1 seconds) which is added to the skater's time. Disciplines Races can be done in dual format where the racing is a head-to-head match, or in a single lane format where the racer is only racing against the clock. There are five types of Slalom race formats: Super Giant Slalom, Giant Slalom, Hybrid Slalom (a.k.a. Special Slalom), Tight Slalom, and Banked Slalom. The Super Giant Slalom, or SuperG, is characterized by fast speeds of 30-40 mph, very long distances between cones (up to 40‚Äì50 feet) and run times of around 1 minute. Giant Slalom is similar to SuperG but typically has shorted cone distances, more cones, and is often run in a single lane format. Hybrid or Special slalom is a combination of Giant Slalom cone spacings of 10-15' and tight cones spacings of 5-7' and is most often run head-to-head. Tight Slalom is characterized by very short cone distances of 5'-7' and has the highest frequency of turns. Tight slalom skaters will pass through 3-4 cones per second. Banked slalom involves skating through a course on banked walls, such as in a skatepark or in a drainage ditch. Banked slalom is similar to other forms of slalom except that it is almost never head-to- head and the course weaves through a non-level obstacle course, as opposed to a regular street where other forms of slalom are held. Rules The most unusual thing about slalom skateboard rules is that skaters are penalized a certain amount of time for each cone that they hit during a race. This penalty time is added to the racers' run time. If too many cones are hit during the run, the racer receives a Disqualification. A DQ is often penalized in head- to-head racing with a severe time penalty that is rarely made up in the second heat of a head-to-head race. Another group of rules known as \\"Grass Roots\\" rules may be used to simplify the racing environment. In grass roots rules, racers are allowed to hit a certain maximum number of cones. Below the maximum (often 5 cones) there is no penalty, and above the maximum is a DQ. In all types of head-to-head racing, race order is determined by a qualifying time which determines the brackets for head-to-head match-ups. Equipment Slalom skateboards are optimized to increase speed, turning, and traction. Slalom skateboard wheels are generally softer (durometers between 76A and 90A) and larger than a typical skateboard wheel (diameter 66 - 75 mm). This increases the wheels' roll speed and grip. Skateboard trucks for slalom racing are often hand-machined precision products that include high rebound bushings, spherical bearings, and precision ground 8mm axles. Slalom trucks are different from most regular skateboard trucks, having different geometry for the front vs the rear truck. The front truck provides increased steering capability whereas the rear truck provides a more stable trajectory. Wedged (or angled) rubber pads (initially known as Rad Pads) mounted under the trucks, shifting the angle of the king pin, can be used to achieve similar performance with standard skateboard trucks. Skateboard decks (or boards) for slalom racing are generally slightly longer than typical skateboards, while still shorter than longboards. They are also more narrow suitable for truck widths of 100 to 120 mm. Materials may include carbon fiber and foam cores, to increase board responsiveness and strength. In the 1970s and 80's they initially had significant flex which provided a smooth ride, but as competitions got more intense racers favored decks completely without flex such as solid wood, rigid maple ply or carbon fiber. Racers Some of the early stars of Slalom racing were Henry Hester, Bobby Piercy and John Hutson. These skaters won many of the races of the 1970s. Immediately following the rebirth of the sport in the 2000s, with the organization of the 2001 World Championships of Slalom, put on by Jack Smith in Morro Bay, CA, racers such as Gary Cross, Paul Dunn, and Charlie Ransom dominated. In the following years some of the most successful racers were Kenny Mollica and Jason Mitchell in the US, Luca Giammarco (ITA) Maurus Strobel (SUI) and Dominik Kowalski (GER) in Europe for the men's division. In the women's division Lynn Kramer (USA), multiple World Champion, really stands out, winning more than 10 overall titles. Other top level racing women of this period include the 2003 World Champion, 1970's legend Judi Oyama (USA) and the Europeans Kathrin Sehl (GER) and Lienite Skaraine (LAT). In recent years Joe McLaren (USA) has won more men's World Championship titles than any other previous racer, although he is regularly facing tough competition from Europeans such as Janis Kuzmins (LAT), Christopher and Michel Dupont (FRA) and the brothers Viking and Viktor Hadestrand (SWE). In North America the top contenders are currently Louis Ricard (CAN), Jonathan Harms (USA) and Joseph Kyle Smith (USA). Richy Carrasco (USA) a 1970s professional freestyle skateboarder and World Record holder of 360 spinning has also stayed a top contender and maintained a position in the top 10 Pro World Ranking for more than 11 years in a row between 2008 and 2019. Paul Price (of UK, now USA) has been a frequent traveler across Europe, North America and Australia and holds the record for the most races run. Among the women Lynn Kramer still holds strong, but in 2018 Mare Erika Belta (LAT) won both the World Championship title in tight slalom as well as the World Champions Super Final tight slalom title, both times racing Lynn Kramer in the finals. The other women placing in the top three, in either of the three slalom disciplines, at the ISSA World Championships in Policka, Czech Republic, 2018 were Karolina Vojtova (CZE), Endija Ruja (LAT) and Alina Krasavina (RUS). As if 2018 was only a temporary exception, in 2019 Lynn top once again became the World Champion in all three main slalom disciplines: tight, hybrid and giant slalom.

While indigenous artists embrace contemporary Western art media, their arts also include pre-Columbian art forms. Indian art of aboriginal origin includes ceramics, baskets, weaving and threading, feather art and leather work. Indian art of a hybrid nature includes the embroideries, lace, woodcarving and different metal products. Paraguay is particularly known for its indigenous featherwork and basket weaving.\\"Indigenous art.\\" Paraguay.com (retrieved 13 July 2011) Handmade products The handmade products of Paraguay are of a great variety and comprise ceramic articles, as well as embroideries and sewn articles, as well as wood, baskets, leather work and silver work. Pre-Columbian ceramics made in the Paraguayan territory were rustic and made from terracotta clay. They were painted in red, and occasionally in black and white. The clay used to be worked by hand. Some tribes incised their pottery with decorations before firing. The Spanish, especially the Jesuits, influenced the technical level of production and the finishing of the native ceramics. These had been characterized by extreme simplicity and production of functional goods. The Jesuits taught the Indian population in the missions. Ceramic products produced today by some Indian groups include jars, flower vases, and some without specific shapes, as well as water vases. Among those, the pottery most widely sold today due to its beauty and quality comes from Tobaty and Ita. By media =Baskets weaving= Baskets are woven from the fibers of canes. Paraguayan Indians weave open baskets, baskets with handles, hand fans, shades, place mats, and especially piri, the typical Paraguayan hat of the country men. Leather products, such as bags, hats, sacks, etc. have their main centers in Limpio and Luque, where also centers for production of beautiful baskets. Materials for wickerwork include indigenous bromeliads including tacuaremb√≥ and caraguat√°, as well as pindo palm leaves. The rich Indian basket production of Paraguay is dividing by plantations. For example, in some communities where the main crop is cassava, baskets are solid with great storage capacity. The ajaka mbya basket is an average of 35 centimeters diameter with rigid supports that can to hold the heavy weight of the cassavas. The ajak is a basket made by weaving tacuarembo and dark guembepi, making braided figures as well as geometric ones, in accordance with the Guaran√≠ concept of beauty. The baskets associated with the production of corn are smaller and lighter and are constructed from pindo palm tree leaves. =Ceramics= Ceramics are an ancient art form in Paraguay, and ancient ceramics have been preserved through the centuries. Ceramics range from the utilitarian‚Äîcooking vessels, water jugs‚Äîto the sacred, such as funerary urns. =Featherwork= A precolumbian art form, featherwork provides distinctive personal adornment. Brilliantly colored feathers are fashioned into anklets, bracelets, collars, headdresses, and even entire cloaks. Guaran√≠ medicine men used to wear full feather cloaks. The Guaran√≠ create feather headdresses called jeguaka worn during ceremonial occasions. =Textile arts= √ëandut√≠ lace from Asunci√≥n, Paraguay Indian embroidery, weaving, and other textile art are an important source of income for the domestic economy. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Indians used a horizontal piece of material to make hammocks with cotton threads, as well as the baskets and bags to transport food and nets for fishing and hunting. Later on they also knitted ponchos and other clothing items. As with ceramics, the Jesuits also introduced new techniques in this area, using the vertical frame to make the threads. Tribal artisans began producing sheets, towels, blankets, table clothes and other articles, as well as the special hammocks, which were knitted and still are with cotton threads and ornaments on the sides. New technical resources brought by the Spanish inspired the typical cotton dresses, the ones called ao poi, made with a fine thread, and the povyi, a little wider thread weaving, as well as linen, and the beautiful √±anduti, which means \\"spider web\\" in Guaran√≠ language and consists of fine embroidery, with which table clothes, curtains, blouses and more are made. The most coveted textiles are the √ëandut√≠ embroideries made in the cities of Guarambar√© and Itaugu√°. Woven ponchos, known for their beauty and quality, are made by the ethnic groups Lengua, Maskoy, Nivacl√©, and Wich√≠ from the Gran Chaco. They use sheep wool tinted in red and the ones called of 60 lists, made in Piray√∫ and Yataity, in the Guair√° Department. =Rock art= Ancient indigenous peoples of Paraguay carved petroglyphs into stone, particularly in the hills of Amambay Department.\\"The Theme.\\" Solar Map Project.\\" Retrieved 6 Jan 2013. =Woodcarving= Wood is carved into ceremonial masks, smoking pipes, chairs known as apyk√°, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies. Gourds are also carves with images. By tribe =Chamacoco= The Chamacoco ethnic group, from the Alto Paraguay Department, used dresses during their annual ritual called Debylyby. These are knitted of special fibers. Associated masks are carved from the karaguata tree and adorned with feathers from Chaco birds. The Chamacocos used a pupo, a protective vest made of karaguata. The pupo is knitted when the fibers are wet; these become rigid when dry and can serve as armor. They protected the wearer from the arrows of the enemies. =Karaguata= The weaving of Karaguata is an important element of the Indian art. It is an expression of the Indian people of the Gran Chaco. The bags of Karaguata are some of the most common applications of fiber twining. Collector's bags are mainly used by women, who carry them on their backs and have a form of a large half moon. Hunting bags are smaller, rectangular, carried by men on their shoulders. =Pa√Ø-Tavytera= The Pai Tavytera from Eastern Paraguay and Brazil are known for their necklaces made from carved wood and colorful seeds of different fruits.Flowers, Nancy M.

These bags are made with karaguata fibers and exemplify rustic Indian beauty in its conception. The adherence to traditional aesthetics makes them extremely attractive. The Ayoreo also make dishes and spoons of Palo Santo wood and feather art. =Maka= The members of the Maka tribe are excellent weavers. Their traditional blankets, belts, and other elements are knitted with colorful threads. =Ava Guaran√≠= Ava Guaran√≠ are highly skilled at making baskets and hammocks. They use karaguata fibers, as well as guembepi for baskets that represent a novelty in the Indian work of the country. Social context The art produced by these two ways of living, nomadic and sedentary, reflect the difference of each one. The communities based in the recollection system are nomads. Therefore, their lifestyle allows for a more flexible and open culture, with many adaptations. In the other extreme, the Guaran√≠ agricultural society is very attached to the land and its natural cycles, and naturally presents a conservative tendency, which can be closed to innovations. They distinguish their own from the other's property and have ongoing issues about the need to absorb or reject the foreign influences.Guaran√≠ Culture. 2008 (retrieved 29 March 2009) Despite the differences in these societies and the special characteristics of each one, scholars say that it is possible to establish some shared elements in all Indian communities who live or have lived in Paraguay. Indian art ‚Äì through its symbols and the free exercise of tribal languages ‚Äì is one of the most important manifestations of indigenous culture in Paraguay. Ceremonies and rituals Guaran√≠ spiritual leader with ceremonial gourd rattle and cross, 2006 Both the collectors and the agricultural societies have as a social nucleus, a mythical body-ritual, from where they can articulate and develop political power, in the judicial order, free time, beauty, and religion. The mythical axis mundi-ritual, in essence the Indian cosmology, is composed of communal ceremonies. These are the moments when the community, through songs, dances and rites, show their identity. Indian art finds its first fundamental origins in those ceremonies and in the human body‚Äìits principal support. Feathers use in ornamentation, tattoos, and body paintings in the case of the Chaco Indians and the feather art among the Guaran√≠ constitute basic elements of the Indian art in Paraguay. Museums A number of museums are dedicated to showcased indigenous Paraguayan art.

The group is assigned to the United States Air Force Sixteenth Air Force, stationed at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. The mission of the wing is content-dominant multi-intelligence analysis and targeting for five distinct mission sets: Air Defenses, Counter-Space, Counter-ISR, Theater Ballistic Missile/Cruise Missile Threat, and Air Threat In a ceremony on 11 July 2011, the group was inactivated and replaced by the AFCENT Air Warfare Center. On 13 February 2015, the 363 FTG was redesignated as the 363d Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing. The wing activated on 17 February 2015.  Mission  The 363d Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Wing is based at Joint Base Langley- Eustis, Virginia. It is subordinate to the Sixteenth Air Force (Air Forces Cyber). The wing conducts operations in four core missions areas: analysis for air, space, and cyber operations; full-spectrum targeting; special operations ISR; and ISR testing, tactics development, and advanced training. The wing comprises three groups and two detachments with a footprint spanning fifteen states, the United Kingdom and Japan. The 363d ISRW produces tailored geospatial and comprehensive threat analysis products to Air Force units employing air power. The wing's mission is to deliver integrated content- dominant analytical expertise, precision targeting, production, and special operations ISR support to the operational and tactical warfighter enabling combat power in air, space, and cyberspace.  Component units  Unless otherwise indicated, units are based at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, and subordinate units are located at the same location as their commanding group. 361st Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group (Hurlburt Field, Florida) * 25th Intelligence Squadron (Hurlburt Field, Florida) * 43rd Intelligence Squadron (Cannon AFB, New Mexico) * 306th Intelligence Squadron (Will Rogers ANGB, Oklahoma) * Operating Location A * Operating Location B (Fort Bragg, North Carolina) * Operating Location D (Will Rogers ANGB, Oklahoma) * Operating Location E (Greenville, Texas) * Operating Location F (Denver, Colorado) 363rd Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group * 17th Intelligence Squadron * 20th Intelligence Squadron (Offutt AFB, Nebraska) * 36th Intelligence Squadron * 363rd Intelligence Support Squadron 365th Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group (Nellis AFB, Nevada) * 15th Intelligence Squadron (Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia) * 51st Intelligence Squadron (Shaw AFB, South Carolina) * 57th Intelligence Squadron (Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas) * 526th Intelligence Squadron * 547th Intelligence Squadron History : For lineage and history of the 363d Operations Group, see 363d Air Expeditionary Operations Group =363d Reconnaissance Wing= The 363d Reconnaissance Wing was activated on 15 August 1947 when the Army Air Forces introduced the experimental wing base organization which established a single wing on each base. It was stationed at Langley Field, Virginia in December 1947 by the newly established USAF. It was redesignated the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing on 27 August 1948. President Truman's reduced 1949 defense budget required reductions in the number of groups in the Air Force to 48 and the unit was inactivated on 26 April 1949.Knaack, p. 25 Once North Korea invaded South Korea, this constraint was removed and the group was again activated on 1 September 1950 at Langley. Due to the pressing needs of Far East Air Forces in Japan the 162nd TRS, flying RB-26s, and the photo-processing 363rd Reconnaissance Technical Squadron (RTS) were reassigned from Langley to Itazuke Air Base Japan for Korean War service and began operations in August 1950 as part of the 543d Tactical Support Group. President Kennedy presents AFOUA to the 363 TRW in 1962 in recognition of the unit's actions associated with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Douglas RB-66B 53-475 of the 39th Tactical Electronics Warfare Training SquadronThis plane is now at the National Museum of the United States Air Force McDonnell RF-101C-65-MC Voodoo Serial No. 56-0068 of the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. This aircraft is currently on static display at the Keesler AFB, Mississippi Air Park. McDonnell RF-4C-34-MC Phantom II Serial No. 67-0436 of the 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in October 1986. Note the NATO European camouflage scheme, \\"SW\\" tail code and low visibility USAF markings. This was one of the last RF-4Cs flown by the 363d TFW before their retirement in 1989. On 1 April 1951, the 363d TRW was transferred to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. The 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing would remain at Shaw, under various designations, for the next 43 years. The wing's mission was to fly photographic, electronic and electronic intelligence missions to support air and ground operations by American or Allied ground forces through its operational component, the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Group. In addition, the 363d provided combat crew training for reconnaissance aircrews. In July 1954, the wing began to receive Martin RB-57A Canberra aircraft and achieved initial operational capability before the month was over. These were the first operational RB-57As in the Air Force, although the 345th Bombardment Wing had received a handful earlier to conduct transition training for its crews.Knaack, p. 313 In January 1956, the wing's 9th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was the first in the Air Force to receive jet powered Douglas RB-66B Destroyers. The RB-66B was the first operational model of the B-66. Although initially, the RB-66B had a limited all weather capability, its arrival permitted the retirement of the obsolescent RB-26s and the early retirement of the problem-ridden RB-57As. Deliveries of the RB-66Bs permitted the activation of two additional squadrons in the wing's 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Group, the 41st and 43d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons.Knaack, p. 419 In 1958, the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Group was inactivated, and its components were assigned directly to the Wing. In September 1957, the RF-101C began deliveries to Shaw. The C model combined the strengthened structure of the F-101C with the camera installation of the RF-101A. In addition, the RF-101C differed from the RF-101A in being able to accommodate a centerline nuclear weapon, so that it could carry out a secondary nuclear strike mission if ever called upon to do so. The RF-101Cs served for a brief time alongside the RF-101A, but quickly replaced them by May 1958. In the autumn of 1962, the pilots of the 363d played a major part in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Utilizing their RF-101s for low-altitude photo-reconnaissance missions, they helped identify and track activities at Cuban missile sites, airfields, and port facilities. In awarding the wing the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its achievements, President John F. Kennedy said, \\"You gentlemen have contributed as much to the security of the United States as any group of men in our history.\\" The last USAF RF-101C was phased out of the 31st TRTS, a replacement training unit at Shaw AFB, on 16 February 1971 and turned over to the Air National Guard. In 1956, the RB-66 Destroyer was assigned to the 363d TRW. They replaced the obsolescent RB-26 Invader. The USAF RB-66 force in the continental United States was concentrated at Shaw, with the first RB-66C arriving on 1 February 1956, and the aircraft would continue to operate from Shaw until its retirement in 1974. Twelve RB-66Cs initially flew with the 9th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (TRS), and then later with various training squadrons including the 4417th Combat Crew Training Squadron (CCTS), 4411th CCTS, and 39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Training Squadron (TEWTS), as well as the 4416th Test Squadron (TS). In addition to their training function, Shaw personnel participated in all major exercises and tested and evaluated the RB/EB-B66 and equipment. The wing was also to augment, within 72 hours, either of the overseas tactical air forces (PACAF and USAFE) in case of crisis or war. Most early flying of the RB-66C was devoted to getting the aircraft and crew ready for deployment and operations. It took longer than expected to have the electronic gear on the RB-66C operational, as the equipment was continually being modified. Readiness rates for the RB-66C in the late fifties and early sixties were below average, especially when compared to other new aircraft, such as the RF-101, introduced into the wing at Shaw during that same time. The RB-66 eventually became the primary night photographic reconnaissance weapon system of the Tactical Air Command. 363d TRW RB-66Cs carried out missions over Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. They were first deployed for combat operations in Southeast Asia during April 1965 and shortly thereafter all were transferred to duty in Southeast Asia, where they carried most of the early electronic warfare operations during the early years of the US involvement in the war. Many B-66s were deployed on 90-day rotations to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base and Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base during the Vietnam War. In Southeast Asia, these aircraft retained the Shaw tail code \\"JN\\". During the period 1 April 1969 through 1 January 1973 there was a 39th TEWS flying EB-66's at Spangdahlem Air Base West Germany which was a separate unit unrelated to the 39th TEWTS. The McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II (Model 98DF) was the unarmed photographic reconnaissance version of the USAF's F-4C. The first production RF-4Cs went in September 1964 to the 363d TRW's 33rd Tactical Reconnaissance Training Squadron. The first operational unit to receive the RF-4C was the 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the 363rd TRW, achieving initial combat-readiness in August 1965. The RF-4C became the main USAF tactical reconnaissance aircraft for the next 25 years, before being phased out of active service in the early 1990s at the end of the Cold War. On 15 July 1971, two EB-57Es were transferred along with the RF-4Cs of the 22d TRS from Bergstrom AFB, Texas, then transferred to the 16th TRS when the 22d TRS was inactivated. These aircraft were highly adapted to carry electronic countermeasures and were frequently deployed to Europe to support USAFE fighter activities. The 363d operated these aircraft until September 1974 then transferring them to the Air National Guard. They were the last B-57s operated by the active-duty USAF. =363d Tactical Fighter Wing= 17th Tactical Fighter Squadron General Dynamics F-16A Block 10D Fighting Falcon Serial No 80-0537. This aircraft was previously a static display at Lockheed-Martin Fort Worth, TX. On 19 March 2004 it was noted to be in use as a ground instructional airframe at NAS Fort Worth JRB, Texas. Fairchild Republic A-10A Thunderbolt II AF Serial No. 79-0206 of the 21st Fighter Squadron, 29 September 1993. The aging and phaseout of the RF-4C aircraft fleet and the utility of the Lockheed TR-1 in Europe for tactical reconnaissance led to the decision by the USAF to realign the mission of the 363d TRW. The reconnaissance training mission of the wing was terminated in 1981 and beginning in 1982, the wing would become 363d Tactical Fighter Wing (363d TFW), being equipped with General Dynamics F-16 aircraft. On 1 October 1981, the 363d TRW was re-designated . The 363d TFW received its first F-16 on 26 March 1982. The 363d TFW flew F-16A/B Block 10 aircraft until 1984 then converted to Block 15s; F-16C/D Block 25s in autumn 1985 and Block 42s in late 1991. All aircraft carried the \\"SW\\" Tail Code. On 9 August 1990, the 17th and 33d TFS of 363d TFW became the first F-16 squadrons to deploy to the United Arab Emirates in Operation Desert Shield. Operating from Al Dhafra Air Base as the 363d Tactical Fighter Wing, Provisional (along with the 10th TFS from the 50th TFW, Hahn Air Base, Germany), the wing flew combat missions to Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm between 17 January and 28 February 1991. Following Desert Storm, the 19th and 33d Tactical Fighter Squadrons deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, a coalition effort to enforce the Iraqi \\"No Fly Zone\\" south of the 32nd parallel north. The 33rd TFS made history when one of its pilots downed an Iraqi aircraft with an AIM-120 missile. The incident marked the first time an AIM-120 missile was fired in combat and was the first U.S. F-16 air-to-air kill. With the closure of Myrtle Beach Air Force Base South Carolina and the inactivation of the 354th Fighter Wing, the 21st Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated at Shaw and received 30 Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt IIs from the inactivating 355th Fighter Squadron on 1 April 1992. All A-10 aircraft with the 21st TFS were designated as OA-10A. As a result of the August 1992 destruction of Homestead AFB Florida by Hurricane Andrew in September 1992, the 31st Fighter Wing's 309th Fighter Squadron was initially evacuated to Shaw AFB prior to the hurricane making landfall. With Homstead unusable for an extended period after the hurricane, on 1 October 1992 the squadron was permanently assigned to the 363rd Fighter Wing. As a result of the end of the Cold War, the Air Force made several dramatic changes with the inactivation and re-designation of wings and their units. The 363d FW and all of its squadrons were inactivated on 31 December 1993, being replaced at Shaw by the 20th Fighter Wing, being reassigned to Shaw from RAF Upper Heyford, England. = 363d Air Expeditionary Wing = A 363d Air Expeditionary Wing F-15 Eagle takes off at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, during Operation Southern Watch An F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot assigned to the 363rd Air Expeditionary Wing, prepares for takeoff before a mission from a forward-deployed location in Southwest Asia on 27 March 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 363d Air Expeditionary Wing (363 AEW) was activated on 1 December 1998 and replaced the 4404th Wing (Provisional) when the United States Air Force inactivated all MAJCOM wings.Globalsecurity.org, Joint Task Force Southwest Asia. Retrieved January 2009 The 363 AEW was the primary United States Air Force Air Expeditionary Wing responsible for Operation Southern Watch (OSW), which involved patrolling the Southern No-Fly Zone over Iraq below the 33rd Parallel. The Wing was inactivated after the onset of Operation Iraqi Freedom when all American combat forces left Saudi Arabia. Following Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, US forces began to pull out of Prince Sultan Air Base. On 28 April the CAOC was shifted from PSAB to Al-Udeid in Qatar. On 29 April, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that US forces would begin pulling out of Saudi Arabia and that forces in the country would be diverted to other locations. Rear Admiral David Nichols, the deputy commander of the coalition air operations center stated that much of the assets associated with the 363d AEW would be relocated by the end of the Summer 2003. The 363d AEW completed its last operational mission supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom on 28 May 2003 completing a 13-year, continuous mission USAF presence in Saudi Arabia. An E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System deployed to the 363d Expeditionary Airborne Air Control Squadron from Tinker Air Force Base, Okla., flew the wing's last operational mission supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. U.S. officials transferred control of portions of Prince Sultan Air Base to Saudi officials at a ceremony 26 August 2003. The ceremony also marked the inactivation of the 363d Air Expeditionary Wing. =363d Flying Training Group= On 12 March 2007, Air Combat Command designated and organized the 363d Flying Training Group (Provisional) at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates to facilitate the training of airmen from various nations. On 1 June, this organization was made permanent when the 363d wing was redesignated the 363d Flying Training Group and activated, assuming the mission, personnel and equipment of the provisional group. On 21 July 2011, the 363d Flying Training Group was inactivated.Master Sergeant Chance Babin, AFCENT Stands Up Air Warfare Center, 380 AEW Public Affairs, 11 August 2011 Lt. Gen. Mike Hostage, the commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command, presided over a ceremony in which the AFCENT Air Warfare Center was activated and the 363d Flying Training Group was inactivated. =Return to reconnaissance mission= On 18 January 2015, the unit was activated again at Joint Base Langley-Eustis as the 363d Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing uniting several units into a single wing dedicated to providing targeting information for a variety of strike platforms. = 51st Intelligence Squadron at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina = The 51st Intelligence Squadron (51 IS), formerly known as the 21st Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, was reactivated in February 2015 after 31 years of inactivation. The 51 IS is considered a mission partner and is located at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina, falling under the command of the 363rd Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing. Its mission is to provide prompt, precise intelligence enabling warfighters to safely engage and achieve global objectives. Lt. Col. Ryan O'Neal officially assumed command of the 51 IS on 10 July 2015. Lt. Col. Jason Kulchar assumed command of the 51st IS on 10 July 2017. Lt. Col. Suzanne Barroqueiro assumed command of the 51st IS on 31 May 2019.

Youth Colman was born in the village of Tebicuarym√≠, a town close to Caballero, Paraguar√≠ Department, Paraguay. At the time of his birth, Tebicuarym√≠ belonged to the Guair√° Department. His father died when he was very young and since then he had to perform various activities to make sustainable life for his family, whose head was his mother. He died in Asuncion, capital of Paraguay on 14 July 1983. His musical style marched toward folk music popular in his country, from young and famous duos of the era, such as: Melgar-Chase and the Brothers Caceres. He served as a model to affirm their desire to become singers and songwriters. In 1952, he formed a duo that lead to success and significance that their teachers knew, the duo Vargas-Saldivar, composed by him and also interpreter and composer Andr√©s Cuenca Saldivar. Style A simple style that obviously is reflected in the numerous compositions created along his career, that style fully shows his conditions. Compositions like, \\"Mokoi Kogoe\\", \\"13 Tuyuti\\" and \\"Tupasy del Campo\\" are testimonies of his great artistic sensibility that served to bring music to the lyrics of great poets. First Steps Andres Cuenca Saldivar, their duet, recalls the following in a letter contained in the files of Authors Paraguayans Partners (APA): \\"When I came to Buenos Aires with the harpist Pedro Gamarra, I met Ramon Vargas Colman, with him, then, an official at the port of Asunci√≥n, in 1958, we recorded the first album, our first success was the song Vapor Cue, and our work recording took place at all times and on a regular basis. The last time was recorded in the year 1980 \\" said the artist. Career Indeed, the ultimate success and dedication nationally and internationally, would arrive with the characteristic composition and known as interpreted by the duo Vargas-Saldivar \\"Vapor Cue\\", which lyrics describe the deeds of the Paraguayan naval fleet during the Paraguayan War (also known as the War of the Triple Alliance). This theme was recorded in 1958 for the label \\"Columbia\\" Argentina, with the special participation in the interpretation of Harp, another enshrined in this instrument the artist Lorenzo Leguizam√≥n. In the 70's, the Duo-Vargas Saldivar was presented at numerous venues of Latin American countries in international tours, performing; had the opportunity to bring their art to many cities in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay and other countries of the South America. In 1972, they sang for ‚ÄúEl Mundo de Buenos Aires‚Äù a very important radio program.

The team is a member of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League, one of 11 leagues in the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball. In 2018, Southern Ohio won its first GLSCL Championship in franchise history. The Copperheads play their home games at Bob Wren Stadium, which is also the home of the Ohio Bobcats baseball team. The current General Manager of the Copperheads is Kayla Hunter and the Head Coach is Austin Dunfee. History =Early Roots= The inception of the Southern Ohio Copperheads baseball team began in the spring of 2002, with a conversation between two prominent Ohio University officials. Dr. Andy Kreutzer, director of the Sports Administration program at Ohio University and Alan Geiger, assistant to the president of Ohio University, began a discussion about summer in Athens, Ohio and the need for affordable, family entertainment. Their conversation slowly drifted to other university officials and civic leaders looking for activities in the summer and the idea of a baseball team in Athens started to gain momentum. It really picked up when Joe Carbone, head baseball coach Ohio University, recommended the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League because it was coming to town for a weekend in the summer of 2001. Bob Wren Stadium, the home park of Ohio University baseball), played host to an exhibition game between Team USA and the Great Lakes League All Stars on July 15, 2001. Nearly 1000 fans came out to enjoy a day of summer baseball, and the game was considered a great success. Following the game, Dr. Andy Kreutzer stated, ‚ÄúWe received a lot of really positive feedback from the all star game and the success led us to believe that southern Ohio would support a team.\\" Slowly, the small group started to grow through phone calls and recruitment. John Wharton, former Chairman of the Copperheads Board of Directors, was recruited because of his ties to Ohio University baseball. As a major fundraiser for the Bobcats, he was a natural supporter of a new initiative for summer baseball in Athens. Other board members came in slowly in the drive to make summer baseball a reality. Dave Palmer, current team general manager and owner of local radio station WXTQ/WATH, wasn't involved at the beginning, but after seeing the exhibition game he became convinced that a baseball team in Athens was a viable idea. \\"The summer months here are slower paced and more relaxed,\\" Palmer said. \\"I saw this as an opportunity to bring an athletic event to the summer months that will really enrich the region's life.\\" With a full roster of business, academic and community leaders in place, the group decided to come together formally at the end of the summer of 2001 and create an organizational structure. The non profit organization listed three goals for the team: Providing family entertainment in southern Ohio, offering a great opportunity for collegiate players to develop and improve their skill levels, and creating a laboratory learning environment for students at Ohio University. The next step was gaining acceptance into the Great Lakes League as a new franchise, and that word came in September 2001. With acceptance from the league, the board now had just over nine months to make baseball in Athens a reality. With a structure in place, the team needed a business plan, which they got by working in conjunction with the Ohio University Master's of Business Administration program. A group of eight students, which included three sports administration students, worked closely with the board for eight weeks and produced a 157-page business plan that the board has followed closely in building the team. As the winter months were passing, the team named Scott Googins, then an assistant coach of the Miami Redhawks baseball team, as its first head coach. Googins started to put his roster together for the new team, while the Board of Directors organized a contest to name the team and after two weeks of suggestions the Copperheads was chosen as the team's name. Local artist Tad Gallaugher was called upon to create the logo that would grace the team's uniforms, caps and merchandise. The team began to take shape, and work was being done around the clock, fitting in between business meetings and classes. The board continued its strong leadership and several sports administration students were called upon to take the lead in finding sponsorships, selling tickets and various other duties. To assist Andy Kreutzer, who was named the team's General Manager, a handful of sports administration students took positions with the team. Nathan Kievman, a second year sports administration graduate student, was named Assistant General Manager. Two first year students were also named Assistant Managers: Steve Frohwerk, Operations, and Chris Boggs, Merchandise and Concessions. =Inaugural Season= Under the leadership of Coach Googins, the newly formed team first took the field on June 12, 2002 against the now-defunct Youngstown Express. The team lost by a margin of 6-4, and followed up with another loss to the Pittsburgh Pandas. The Copperheads played their first home game at Bob Wren Stadium on June 15, 2002 in a doubleheader against the Delaware Cows, ultimately losing both games by scores of 4-2 and 14-3. On June 16, the team finally broke into the win column with a 7-6 victory over the Northern Ohio Baseball Club. The Copperheads ultimately ended with an 18-22 record, finishing in seventh place out of ten clubs. Five future professional players suited up for the 2002 Copperheads, including current White Sox pitch Adam Russell. =2003-2006: New Editions= The 2003 Copperheads were coached by University of Dayton Assistant Coach Todd Linklater. Paced by Ohio University star Anthony Gressick and his .353 batting average, the team finished with a 19-20 record and made the league playoffs for the first time in team history. Featuring 9 future professional players, the 2003 team would prove to be the best Copperheads squad until 2006. In 2004, the Copperheads also featured 9 future professional players, but struggled throughout most of the season with a 16-23 record. Despite finishing the season with a 5-game winning streak, the team just missed the playoffs and finished in eighth place out of nine teams. Coached by University of Kentucky assistant Brad Bohannon, the squad was led by current minor league stars Ryan Norwood, Victor Alvarez, and Joe Mihalics. The lowest point in Copperheads‚Äô franchise history was undoubtedly the 2005 season. Under the direction of current Ohio University assistant Andrew See, the team lumbered to a 17-25 finish that placed them seventh out of eight league teams. Featuring just five future professionals, the squad was led by Ohio University star and current Cincinnati Reds minor leaguer Matt Stiffler. The resurgence of the Copperheads began with the 2006. Winthrop University assistant coach Stas Swerdzewski brought in a talented group of players and coaches that led the team to its first winning record and a league playoff appearance. The Copperheads would go on to post a 21-19 record, and ultimately produced four professional players. The team once again was paced by Ohio University star Matt Stiffler, and also enjoyed the services of Appalachian State star pitcher David Rubenstein. =2007: A Near Miss= The Copperheads‚Äô 2007 squad proved to be the best in the brief history of the franchise. Led by Marietta College assistant coach Mike Deegan, the team finished 23-15, good for sixth place out of eleven league teams. For the third year in a row, Ohio University outfielder Matt Stiffler led the team in hitting, while John Karr and Chuck Boring paced the Copperheads‚Äô pitchers. The team ultimately advanced to the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League playoffs, winning its first two games over the Lima Locos and the Cincinnati Steam. A loss to eventual champion Columbus forced the Copperheads into a must-win game over the Delaware Cows, which they lost 9-8. Despite going into the ninth inning with an 8-3 lead, poor relief pitching by Kyle Cowden and a fielding error by Zach Hartle cost the team a spot in the league championship game. =2008: A Year of Promise and Disappointment= On paper, the 2008 season had the potential to be the best in Copperheads history. Esteemed Shawnee State University head coach Ted Tom led the team along with talented assistants Andrew Engebretson and Chris Moore. Featuring Northwestern University star outfielder Jake Goebbert, University of North Carolina at Asheville slugger Phillip Vaughn, and Ohio University pitcher Joe Stover, the squad started out the season strong. The Copperheads posted a 5-1 mark in their first six games, but faltered into a 7-game losing streak in early July. Proving resilient, however, Coach Tom's team posted a seven-game winning steak in late July to force their way back into playoff contention. Only needing to win one game of an August 3 doubleheader against Lima to enter the GLSCL playoffs, the Copperheads stumbled in both games to finish the season with a 19-21 record. Though tied for the sixth and final playoff berth, the squad lost the tiebreaker to Lake Erie through losing the season series 3-1. =2009-2010: The Florak Era= On October 30, 2008, Mike Florak was named the eighth manager of the Southern Ohio Copperheads. Florak coached the Youngstown State Penguins baseball team for nine years, leading the team to their first Horizon League title and NCAA Tournament appearance in 2004. Coach Florak came to the team with a litany of off-field accomplishments as well, including being the author of the critically acclaimed autobiography \\"Healthier than Normal\\". Detailing his struggle with Crohn's disease, battle with depression and life in baseball, it has led to Florak's budding career as a motivational speaker. Florak led the team to the best season in franchise history in 2009. The Copperheads' finished the regular season with an 18-16 record, including a season sweep of the Xenia Scouts and a 3-1 record against the league-leading Lima Locos. The Copperheads featured dominant starting pitching, led by Northwestern University pitcher Dave Jensen. Jensen set the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League ERA record, posting just a 0.30 ERA in 30.1 innings pitched. The Copperheads were also strong in the bullpen, featuring Marion Military Institute closer Jordan Langley and Marshall University set-up man Tyler Gatrell. The offense was led by Ohio University outfielder Jerod Yakubik, Southeast Missouri State infielder Trent Moses, and Sinclair Community College utilityman Justin Marerro. The Copperheads' first season under Florak was highlighted by a run in the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League Playoffs. The Copperheads defeated Licking County and Grand Lake to advance to their first- ever GLSCL title game. The team fell 4-2 to Cincinnati in a battle for the championship, finishing with a season record of 20-18. On August 12, 2009 it was reported by Athens radio station WATH that Mike Florak and assistants Chris Moore and Tim Culver would all return for the 2010 season. The 2010 Copperheads finished third in the league with a 24-16 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. =2011-2017: New Heights= For the 2011 season, Chris Moore, an assistant at Shawnee State University was brought on as manager. The 2011 Copperheads were the best team in franchise history, finishing atop the GLSCL standings with a 29-13 record. Despite the record-setting regular season, the team was unable to advance in the playoffs. Moore returned in 2012 and led the team to a 22-17 record and a second consecutive playoff appearance, again ending in a first round loss. The 2012 edition of the Copperheads were powered by catcher Blaise Salter who batted .319 and led the club with 7 home runs and 26 RBI. Justin Brantley led the pitching staff with 32.1 IP and a 5-1 record as a starter. 2012 would be Moore's last season in Athens, finishing his Copperheads career with a record of 51-30, best in team history. Jonathan Nichols, an assistant under Florak and Moore, took the reins in 2013 and extended the Copperheads winning tradition. Jesse Puscheck was an offensive machine all year for Southern Ohio, with a .321 average and 44 RBI. Jordan Peterson, Alex Winkleman, and Eddie Fitzpatrick were standouts on the mound, combining for 83 strikeouts and a 12-4 record. The team again finished first in the GLSCL standings, but were upset by the Lima Locos in the first round of the playoffs. The team would rebound in 2014 under Nichols, making the playoffs for the fourth straight season at 23-16. A balanced offense in which no player hit more than 3 home runs or 22 RBI and a pitching staff led by aces Brandyn Sittinger and Jake Miller took the Copperheads to the league championship series for the second time, and first since 2009. The Copperheads swept the Xenia Scouts in the league semifinals before falling to the Licking County Settlers in the finals. For the 2015 season, Nichols again returned as manager along with veteran copperheads Brett Impemba, Roscoe Blackburn, Grant Wruble, and Eddie Fitzpatrick. The team was led by Ohio University's Connor Callery, who batted .359 and was named 2nd Team All-GLSCL. Callery was joined by ace pitcher Andrew Gonzalez and reliever Zach Moore on the All-League team. Trent Astle was named a GLSCL All-Star and had a bare-handed grab featured on ESPN's \\"Top 10 Plays.\\" The Copperheads finished 4th in the league at 22-17 (unable to finish the final game due to rain) and fell in a one-game playoff to a familiar nemesis, the Settlers. Phil Butler took over for Nichols in 2016, going 20-22 in his first season. The Copperheads missed the GLSCL playoffs for the first time in seven years in Butler's first season, but are hopeful 2017, his second year at the helm, will be different. =2018: GLSCL Champions= The 2018 Southern Ohio Copperheads. The Copperheads capped off a historic season by bringing the first GLSCL Championship to Southern Ohio. Highlighted by a franchise record 31 regular season wins, the Copperheads, under the reign of GLSCL Coach of the Year Phil Butler, finished first in the Southern Division. With the leadership of returning players Ty Suntken of Bowling Green State University and 2018 GLSCL Most Valuable Player Blaine Crim of Mississippi College, the Copperheads swept both the Hamilton Joes and Saginaw Sugar Beets en route to claiming the elusive league title on August 8, 2018. At the conclusion of the 2018 season, seven Copperheads were presented with First Team GLSCL Honors: Michael Darrell-Hicks of Western Kentucky University, Gus Cunningham of Florida Southwestern State College, Blaine Crim of Mississippi College, Blake Holub of St. Edward's University, Joe Stewart of Michigan State University, Austin Weaver of St. Edward's University, and Thomas Zazzaro of Lee University. Zazzaro was also awarded the 2018 GLSCL All- Star Game MVP at the GLSCL All-Star Game on July 17, 2018.

Known as Rock Point Road, the state highway runs from MD 254 near Rock Point north to U.S. Route 301 in Newburg. MD 257 serves the Cobb Neck of southern Charles County between the Potomac River and Wicomico River, connecting the communities of Cobb Island, Issue, Tompkinsville, and Wayside with US 301. The state highway was originally the southernmost section of MD 3, which was constructed on the peninsula in the 1910s. The portion of MD 3 south of US 301 was rebuilt and renumbered as MD 257 in the 1950s. Route description View west at the east end of MD 257 at MD 254 near Rock Point MD 257 begins at an intersection with the northern end of MD 254 (Cobb Island Road) near Rock Point. Rock Point Road continues southeast as a county highway to the namesake promontory at the confluence of the Wicomico River and Potomac River. MD 257 heads northwest as a two-lane undivided road, passing through the hamlet of Issue, where Swan Point Road splits to the west toward the golf course- centered community of Swan Point. The state highway next passes through Tompkinsville, where the highway passes the southern end of Mount Victoria Road, which serves the village of Mount Victoria. MD 257 next passes through Wayside, where the highway crosses Piccowaxen Creek and intersects Morgantown Road, which leads to the Potomac River community of Morgantown. The state highway continues northwest to Newburg, where the highway meets the north end of Mount Victoria Road. MD 257 curves to the west and crosses over CSX's Pope's Creek Subdivision, whose southern terminus is at the nearby Morgantown Generating Station, before reaching a directional crossover intersection with US 301 (Robert Crain Highway) a short distance north of the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River. History Rock Point Road was the southernmost segment of the highway from Rock Point to Waldorf that was marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. That highway was designated MD 3 in 1927. The Cobb Neck portion of the state road was constructed as a gravel road between Wayside and Tompkinsville in 1913 and a concrete road from Tompkinsville to Rock Point in 1914. The highway was completed when the state road north of Wayside was built as a gravel road by 1919. MD 3 was widened and rebuilt with a bituminous concrete surface from Newburg to Tompkinsville in 1950 and from there to Rock Point in 1951. MD 3 was renumbered as MD 257 in 1959. MD 257 achieved its current length when the highway between MD 254 and Rock Point was transferred to Charles County around 1989.

The film was based on the James Hilton novel of the same title and tells the story of a reformer and the woman he marries in a fictional Lancashire mill town. Hilton also narrated. The movie, shot on location in England, is faithful to the novel in many particulars, but the motivations of the main female character and the tone of the ending are considerably altered. The first screening was in the Majestic Theatre in Macclesfield on 9 August 1947, after which the film disappeared. It was rediscovered some 60 years later in Tennessee, in the United States, by Muttley McLad of the band The Macc Lads. Plot At the end of the Second World War in the Lancashire mill town of Browdley George Boswell (John Mills), town councillor, newspaper editor and zealous reformer, recalls the past 26 years of his life. In 1919 he defends Olivia Channing (Martha Scott) when she applies for a library job. Her father, the cotton mill owner John Channing (Frederick Leister), had been sent to prison for almost 20 years for speculating with, and losing, many townspeople's money. George falls in love with Olivia, though it scandalises the townspeople, and eventually proposes to her. That night she has an argument with her father. He has Dr Richard Whiteside (Trevor Howard) drive him into town to speak to George, but they crash on a washed-out road and John is killed. Olivia then agrees to marry George. Trevor Mangin (Reginald Tate), Browdley's most influential businessman, asks George to run for Parliament. Seeing an opportunity to further his reforming efforts, George agrees, much to Olivia's delight. Whiteside brings George an alarming report about the danger of an epidemic in the town's filthy slums. Mangin, who owns many of them, produces a more optimistic report. Given that Whiteside has taken to drinking heavily since the accident, George accepts Mangin's report, causing the council to vote to do nothing. However, a diphtheria epidemic breaks out, just as Whiteside feared. A free clinic is opened to inoculate the healthy children and treat the sick. George tells Olivia to take their son there, but she cannot bear to do it, resulting in the child's death. After George drops out of the election because of Mangin's lies Olivia tells him that she is leaving him. George realises that she married him solely for his prospects. They go their separate ways. He eventually rises to mayor, while she remarries a rich man and has another son, Charles Winslow (Richard Carlson). Meanwhile, Whiteside takes in a baby girl, Julie Morgan (Patricia Roc), orphaned at birth. George helps to raise her. Many years pass. Early in the Second World War a widowed Olivia returns, takes up residence in her father's mansion and reopens the Channing mill. Her son becomes a flier in the Royal Air Force. On leave he meets Julie and they fall in love. However, Olivia does not want to relinquish her son. Charles is seriously injured in combat and his face is disfigured. This enables Olivia to isolate and retain control of him until George manages to convince him to break free and marry Julie. When Olivia arrives, looking for her son, George reveals that he has worked out that Olivia did nothing to prevent her father from driving to his death, though she must have known that the road was washed out. Whiteside had overheard the Channings' argument and knew that John Channing intended to warn George against her.

The villa grounds cover 6.6 hectares (16.3 acres). Villa Rosebery is situated in Naples and it is so named because it was owned by the British prime minister, The 5th Earl of Rosebery (Liberal, 1894-1895). History Originally built as a cottage in the grounds of the Belvedere (now the Palazzina Borbonica) in 1801 by Count Thurn, an Austrian officer in the service of the King of Naples. The original building was rebuilt under the ownership of Don Agostino Serra Terranova in the mid 19th century as the Casino Gaudiosa, achieving much of its current form. Sold after Don Agostino's death in 1857, the villa came into the ownership of Prince Louis de Bourbon, the commander of the Neapolitan Navy, who renamed the property La Brasiliana in honour of his sister's husband, the emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Following Garibaldi's revolution the villa was sold in 1860 to a businessman, Gustavo Delahente, who in turn sold it to Lord Rosebery, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in 1897. In 1909 Lord Rosebery presented the building to the British Government for the use of the British Ambassador to Italy. In 1932 the British Government in turn presented the building to the Italian State and the villa was used as a summer royal residence. From June 1944 until his abdication and exile in May 1946, the villa was the residence of King Victor Emmanuel III. From 1946 to 1949 it was used by the Accademia Aeronautica, and after a period of dis-use it became an official residence of the President of the Italian Republic in 1957.

Winans, 198 U.S. 371 (1905), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that held that the Treaty with the Yakima of 1855, negotiated and signed at the Walla Walla Council of 1855, as well as treaties similar to it, protected the Indians' rights to fishing, hunting and other privileges..  Background  The Winans brothers operated a fish wheel, like this one, on homesteaded land near Celilo Falls. In 1854 and 1855, the United States entered into a series of treaties with many of the Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest. In exchange for Indian interest in certain lands in what is today the State of Washington, the Indians reserved relatively small parcels of land for their exclusive use (hence the term \\"reservation\\"), were given compensation in monetary payments, and other guarantees. The Treaty with the Yakima, signed on June 9, 1855, guaranteed to the Yakama \\"the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with the citizens of the Territory\\"..DiCanio, Margaret, (2005). Encyclopedia of American Activism: 1960 to the Present, p.342. iUniverse, Inc. In the 1890s, Lineas and Audubon Winans operated a state-licensed fishing operation on homesteaded land near Celilo Falls.Montgomery, David (2004). King of Fish: The Thousand Year Run of Salmon, p.53. Basic Books. Celilo Falls, in the Columbia River Gorge, was essential to the fishing practices of the Umatilla, Yakama and Nez Perce tribes.Wilkinson, Charles, (2005). Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations, p.160. Norton, W.W. and Company, Inc. The Winans brothers obtained a license from the State of Washington to operate a fish wheel, a device that could catch salmon by the ton, thus depleting the Yakamas' fish supply.Wilkins, David E. and Lomawaima, K. Tsianina (2002). Uneven Ground: American Indian Sovereignty and Federal Law, p.125. University of Oklahoma Press. Most importantly for this case, the Winans brothers' actions also forcibly prevented the Yakama Indians from crossing the land recently purchased by the brothers, blocking their passage to the traditional fishing grounds of the tribe. The legal dispute revolved around the treaty language that secured to the Indians \\"the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with the citizens of the territory\\", Yakima Treaty of 1855, art. 3, ¬∂ 2, 12 Stat. 951. In 1905, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the off-reservation fishing rights possessed by the Yakama tribe: \\"The right to resort to the fishing places in controversy was a part of larger rights possessed by the Indians, upon the exercise of which there was not a shadow of impediment, and which were not much less necessary to the existence of the Indians than the atmosphere they breathed.\\"Winans, 198 U.S. at 381. Internationally recognized scholar on Native American issues, including tribal sovereignty, N. Bruce Duthu conveys that, although the arrival of settlers on Indian land called for a modification of rights Indians once possessed exclusively, the elimination of said rights was unlawful.Duthu, N. Bruce (2008). American Indians and the Law: The Penguin Library of American Indian History p.101. Penguin Group (USA). Where Congress has inhibited fishing rights reserved under the treaties, or land or mineral rights (also treaty- reserved rights) are limited by private or government actors, tribes are often awarded monetary relief by the courts. Where private projects have obstructed treaty fishing rights, courts within the Ninth Circuit, however, have refused to pay monetary compensation to the tribes. The Indians brought suit to enjoin the respondents from using the fish wheel. The United States Circuit Court for the District of Washington ruled for the respondents on the basis of their exclusive rights to private property. The Supreme Court reversed.  Legal analysis  The Court looked at the substance of the treaty and construed the disputed language as ‚Äúthat unlettered people understood it\\". In examining the negotiations with the Yakama nation, which was the largest of the Indian tribes, the District Court found that, \\"At the treaty council the United States negotiators promised, and the Indians understood, that the Yakamas would forever be able to continue the same off-reservation food gathering and fishing practices as to time, place, method, species and extent as they had or were exercising.\\"Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association, 443 U.S. at 668. In writing for the majority, Justice McKenna stated that a ‚ÄúTreaty between the United States and the Indians... is not a grant of rights to the Indians, but a grant of rights from them--a reservation of those granted.\\" This established for the first time the so- called \\"reserved rights\\" doctrine in American Indian law. The Court noted the historical and traditional importance of fishing and hunting to the Indians, and viewed these rights as part of a larger bundle of rights preserved under the treaty. The Court observed that the treaty foresaw the contingency of future ownership, and secured the Indians' rights and privileges both against the United States and its grantees and against the state and its grantees. Therefore, the grant of a license to operate a fish wheel gave the respondents no power to exclude the Indians from fishing. In other words, the State of Washington could not use common law property rights to absolutely exclude the Indians from fishing on the Columbia River. Relying on its earlier decision in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1 (1894), the Court also dismissed the argument that the Indians‚Äô treaty rights were subordinate to the powers acquired by the state upon its entry into the Union. The Court upheld the Indians' right of access to respondent's private property, thus protecting their privileges under the treaty.  Dissent  Justice White was the lone dissenter, but did not write a dissenting opinion.  Influence  United States v. Winans was an important case as it set two regulations regarding the way treaties would henceforth be interpreted. First, it was determined that a treaty must be analyzed as the Indians who had agreed to the treaty would have understood it and \\"as justice and reason demand.\\" In studying the negotiations made with the Yakama Nation, by far the largest of Indian nations, the District court found, \\"At the treaty council the United States negotiators promised, and the Indians understood, that the Yakamas would forever be able to continue the same off- reservation food gathering and fishing practices as to time, place, method, species and extent as they had or were exercising.\\" Through United States v. Winans, the Reserved Rights Doctrine was also established, which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians, but rather \\"a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them\\".Shultz, Jeffrey D. (2000). Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics, p.710. Greenwood Publishing Group. Dr. David E. Wilkins writes in Uneven Ground: American Indian Sovereignty and Federal Law, \\"Tribes do not exercise rights because Congress granted them rights. Tribes exercise rights based on their original and indigenous sovereignty.\\" These \\"reserved\\" rights, meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign, include property rights, which include the rights to fish, hunt and gather, and political rights. Political rights reserved to the Indian nations include the power to regulate domestic relations, tax, administer justice, or exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction.Wilkins, David E. and Lomawaima, K. Tsianina (2002). Uneven Ground: American Indian Sovereignty and Federal Law, p.125. University of Oklahoma Press. Salmon populations rapidly depleted and state officials further limited treaty fishing rights.  Ensuing opposition  For the early part of the 20th century, treaty fishing rights were met with little opposition. In the 1942 Tulee v. Washington case, native fishing rights met their first major contest. In the case, Sampson Tulee was convicted of catching salmon with a net, without having first obtained a state license. Because of a treaty made between the federal government and the Yakima nation, Tulee claimed that it was unlawful for the state to require him to obtain a fishing license. The case was brought before the Supreme Court and the opinion was delivered by Justice Black. It was determined that, while a state could not require Indians to pay a license fee, they did have the power to \\"impose on the Indians equally with others such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation as are necessary for the conservation of fish\\".. In the second half of the 20th century, processing technology improved and commercial canning operations emerged. These industries rapidly depleted the salmon runs and the Indians' garnering of the salmon. In 1963 through the case Washington v. McCoy, tribal fishing laws were even further limited as Indians became the scapegoat for the decline in salmon populations. The ruling in Washington v. McCoy stated that the State of Washington had the power to regulate tribal fishing for conservation purposes. By the early 1960s, state enforcement officials openly ignored the ruling and made numerous arrests, as well as confiscated boats and fishing equipment. Some Indians, in attempt to gain back their treaty fishing rights, ignored the new regulations laid down by the state. The Puyallup tribe of Washington were \\"primarily a piscatory people\\".Ruby, Robert H., Brown, John Arthur (1992). A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest, p.166. University of Oklahoma Press. Members of the Puyallup tribe, who ignored the regulations in attempt to gain back to fishing rights of their tribe were \\"met with arrests, beatings and confiscation of their gear and catch\\".  Indian response  In blatant defiance to the Winans ruling of 1905, Washington state courts closed the Nisqually River to Indian fisherman in 1964. That same year, in attempt to preserve off-reservation fishing rights dubbed \\"reserved\\" in the Winans case, Native Americans formed the protest organization known as Survival of American Indians Association (SAIA).Johnson, Troy R., Nagel, Joane, Champagne, Duane (1997). American Indian Activism: Alcatraz to the Longest Walk, p.15. University of Illinois Press. The SAIA organized protests, known as fish-ins, in which Native Americans as well as non-Indian activists illegally fished Washington waters, particularly at Frank's Landing on the Nisqually River.Rosier, Paul C. (2003). Native American Issues, p.34. Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc. Johnson, Nagel and Champagne write in American Indian Activism: Alcatraz to the Longest Walk, that \\"A large number of state and local law enforcement officers raided Frank's Landing in 1965, smashing boats and fishing gear, slashing nets, and attacking Indian people, including women and children.\\" Celebrities such as Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, and Dick Gregory contributed acts of civil disobedience and traveled to \\"Frank's Landing and other sites of protest in Washington State to lend their presence to the struggle.\\"  Self-determination era  President Lyndon B. Johnson makes address. In March 1966, Lyndon B. Johnson made a speech before the United States Senate in which he proposed a new era in regards to the nation's relationship with Native Americans. President Johnson asserted \\"a new goal for our Indian programs; a goal that ends the old debate about termination of Indian programs and stresses self-determination; a goal that erases old attitudes of paternalism and promotes partnership and self-help\\".

It stars Prendergast, as well as Lisa Kudrow, Teri Garr (in her final film role prior to retirement), Christine Taylor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Angela Sarafyan. Chris Parnell also appears in the film as a grocery store manager. Plot Leslie, whose husband is in Iraq, is in danger of losing her benefits if she does not return to work. Salman, her brother-in-law, arrives in her town to help watch over Leslie's two kids. In part this is due to Salman's having no other place to go. He seems a bit spacey and was fired from his last job at a copy shop because he enjoyed laminating so much that he laminated everything in the store that was laminatable (including the money in the till). Leslie's eldest son, Cameron, takes an instant dislike to Salman and threatens to kill him. Her other son Lincoln follows his lead. Salman's difficulty in handling the two hyperactive children does not impress Leslie, so she asks him to leave. Unfortunately that's not an option as Salman has no money and nowhere to go. So, struggling for answers and a way to keep things from falling apart, Leslie finds Salman a job at her company. They will trade off working and watching after the kids. Leslie does not realize that the job Salman gets is as a blue-costumed corporate mascot called \\"Kabluey\\". Salman's job as Kabluey is to hand out flyers (advertising office space) on the side of the road for her company, a faltering dot-com called BluNexion. The costume has its unique challenges, being extremely hot inside and having no fingers on the hands, forcing him to grip the flyers under his arms. Standing on the side of the road also seems completely pointless - as the only people who drive by are farmers who don't need office space. Kabluey (the mascot) also interacts with passing road workers, and an insane woman (who lost all of her money investing in BluNexion in an ENRON type scandal) who constantly drives by and even tries to kill Kabluey with her car. Despite all this, Salman finds strange confidence through his suit and alter ego - and his life begins to change. Salman is asked to entertain at a birthday party in the suit. He manages to gain the respect of Cameron and Lincoln in the process. He later discovers Leslie is having an affair with her boss Brad but is afraid to confront the issue. When he later discovers that Brad is sleeping with another woman, he attacks Brad (wearing the costume) while Brad is in a motel room with the other woman, but not before calling Leslie to the scene. Confronted with the reality of the situation, Leslie slaps Salman and walks away, but later breaks down in Salman's arms. She tells him that she never loved Brad and never planned on leaving her husband, that the situation had simply developed due to stress and as a way to keep money coming in. Leslie's husband returns home to a family happy to see him, and Salman disappears.

He was a hunter and is believed to had plucked his eyes to offer to Srikalahasteeswara linga, the presiding deity of Srikalahasti Temple. He is also considered one of the 63 Nayanars or holy Saivite saints, the staunch devotees of Shiva. According to historical chronicles, he was Arjuna of the Pandavas in his past life. Birth and Life Kannappa Nayanar is a Tamil saint also known as Thinnappan, Dinna, Kannappa, Tinnappan, Dheera, Bhakta Kannappa, Thinnan, Kannappan, Dinnayya, Kannayya, Kannappa Nayanar or Nayanmar, Kannan, Bhakta Kannappan and Dheeran. He was born in a vyadha (hunter) family, the son of Raja Naga Vyadha and his wife in Uduppura (modern Vutukuru) near Sri Kalahasti, in present-day Utukkuru, Rajampet Andhra Pradesh. He is an ancestor of the modern-day Mutharaiyar community. His father was a notable gerent among their hunting community and a great Shaiva devotee of Sri Kartikeya. He was named Dinna or Dheera by his parents, which is known to Tamil-speakers today as Thinnan or Dheeran respectively. His wife's name was Neela. History Kannappa stopped by Shiva as he tries to remove his second eye When Arjuna was meditating on Sri Shiva for Pasupathastra, to test him Sri Shiva entered that forest as an animal hunter and due to word war between Sri Shiva and Arjuna, a battle took place between both and finally impressed by Arjuna's efforts, Sri Mahashiva gave him the Pasupathasthra. However, because of his boastful nature of being the greatest warrior, he is born again as a devotee in the Kali Yuga as Kannappa Nayanar and finally got liberation. Thinna was a staunch devotee of the Vayu linga of SriKalahasti which he found in the forest while hunting. Being a hunter, he did not know how to properly worship Lord Shiva. It is said that he poured water from his mouth on the Shiva lingam which he brought from the nearby river Swarnamukhi. He also offered Lord Shiva whatever animal he hunted, including swine flesh. But Lord Shiva accepted his offerings since Thinna was pure at heart and his devotion was true. Once, Lord Shiva tested the unshakable devotion of Thinna. With his divine power, He created a tremor and the roof-tops of the temple began to fall. All the sages ran away from the scene except for Thinna who covered the linga with his body to prevent it from any damage. Hence he was named thereafter as Dheera (valiant one). Thinna noticed that one of the eyes of the Shiva linga was oozing blood and tears. Sensing that Lord Sri Bhalanetra's eye had been injured, Thinna proceeded to pluck his one eye out with one of his arrows and placed it in the spot of the bleeding eye of the Shiva linga. This stopped the bleeding in that eye of the linga. But to complicate matters further, he noticed that the other eye of the linga has also started oozing blood. So Thinna thought that if he were to pluck his other eye too, he would become blind to exactly know the spot where he has to place his own second eye over the bleeding second eye of the lingam. So he placed his great toe on the linga to mark the spot of the bleeding second eye and proceeded to pluck out his other and only eye. Moved by his extreme devotion, Lord Sri Priyabhakta appeared before Dinna and restored both his eyes. He made Thinna one of the Nayanmars and he was called as Kannappan or Kannappa Nayanar.

He was first portrayed by George Reinholt from 1968 to 1975 (Reinholt returned in 1989 for the show's 25th anniversary playing Steve as a ghost) and David Canary from 1981 to 1983. During the six-year gap between Reinholt and Canary, Steve was presumed dead in a helicopter crash in Australia. When David Canary assumed the role, it was explained that Steve had plastic surgery on his face but had amnesia all those years until he returned to Bay City. Character history Born in 1940 in Chadwell, Oklahoma, Steven Frame was one of eight children born to Henry and Jenny Frame. His siblings included sisters Emma Frame Ordway, Janice Frame and Sharlene Frame Watts, and brothers Vince Frame, Willis Frame, Jason Frame, and Henry Frame Jr. A self-made millionaire land developer and half-owner of the Bay City Bangles, the town's football team, Steven Frame first came to Bay City in 1967 on business and pretty much kept a low profile, but didn't make his society debut until the following year when he attended the wedding of District Attorney Walter Curtain to Lenore Moore on July 1, 1968. At the reception held at the Bay City Country Club, Steve introduced himself to Lenore's best friend and bridesmaid, Alice Matthews (Jacqueline Courtney). It was also at the reception that he met Alice's scheming, money-hungry sister-in-law Rachel Matthews (Robin Strasser). Steve and Alice were instantly smitten with each other and began dating. Steve fell head over heels for Alice, who was the only person to call to him by his full first name Steven. Alice was also delighted when he hired her father Jim to handle the accounting for Steve's Bay City office. Though she was encouraged by Rachel not to let her handsome and rich suitor get away, Alice was completely unaware at first of Rachel's true intentions: she wanted Steve for herself and was determined to have him, and even went as far as to find any excuse to double-date with Alice and Steve with her husband, Russ Matthews (Sam Groom), Alice's brother and a newly interned doctor. Rachel couldn't understand what Steve saw in Alice. She was too sweet and too nice. Rachel believed he needed a real woman, and she was determined to be that woman to him. Steve had something in common with Rachel that he didn't have with Alice: they both came from similarly poor backgrounds, though Steve's was far more impoverished than Rachel's (a 1972 flashback episode suggests that Steve grew up in a broken family in which his father was abusive). One night Rachel visited Steve in his apartment; he was depressed after a fight he had with Alice. Taking full advantage of Steve's vulnerability, Rachel seduced him. Rachel destroyed Steve and Alice's wedding plans when, on the night of Alice and Steve's engagement party, she confronted Alice and told her that not only did she love Steve but that she was carrying his baby. A cold and calm Alice later confronted Steve and asked him about his infidelity and if it was possible that he was the father of Rachel's baby. Steve finally admitted that it could be possible. Rachel gave birth to a boy and named him James Gerald \\"Jamie\\" Matthews and passed him off as Russ's child. Russ eventually found out the truth and divorced Rachel. As the 1970s ushered in, Steve and Alice finally married in September 1971. Their marriage lasted until June 1973 after endless obstacles ripped them apart. Rachel (now played by Victoria Wyndham) was still determined to have Steve for herself and happily used their son as a weapon. Alice suffered a miscarriage and left Bay City for New York City. There she found employment as a private nurse to a young boy named Dennis Carrington (Mike Hammett). Steve married Rachel in order to give Jamie (Robert Doran) a stable family, but he still longed for Alice. Alice had moved back to Bay City and Steve begged her not to marry Dennis's father, Eliot (James Douglas). Alice agreed to give him a second chance. Steve asked Rachel for a divorce, but she was would not give it to him. Desperate, Steve resorted to bribing Rachel's father, Gerald Davis, to testify on his behalf when he sued Rachel for divorce, which was eventually granted with her gaining full custody of Jamie. Bribing his father-in-law would soon come back to haunt Steve when Gerald mouthed off to John Randolph (Michael M. Ryan), Steve's attorney and brother-in-law (John's wife Pat was Alice's sister) that Steve bribed him to testify, thinking John was in on Steve's scheme. John informed the police of Gerald's accusation towards Steve. As a result of John's betrayal, Steve was arrested, but was given permission to remarry Alice on May 4, 1974 (Another World's 10th anniversary). Steve was ordered to report to prison the very next day after their wedding and serve a sentence of six months. Shortly after Steve's incarceration, Alice suffered a mental breakdown. She was eventually committed to a sanitarium and once released was determined to reunite with Steve. Rachel was still furious over Steve going back to Alice and threatened to kick Alice out of the home that Steve had built for her, believing she was entitled to live there as the mother of his son. Several months later when Rachel planned to move in, she was shocked to see Steve waiting for her, accompanied by her stepfather Gil McGowan (Dolph Sweet), the town police chief, in whose custody Steve was temporarily released into. Steve put an end to her moving in right then and there. When Steve was officially released from prison he then went to see Alice, but she rejected him. Rachel continued to scheme to keep them apart, but Steve and Alice eventually got back together. In May 1975, just as she and Steve were getting their lives back in order, Alice, and all of Bay City, received tragic news: Steve was presumed dead in a helicopter crash in Australia, where he had gone on business. It was also at this time that both women in Steve's life were undergoing major changes: Alice was in the process of adopting an orphaned girl named Sally Spencer, and Rachel, with the help of the love of her current husband, magazine publisher Mac Cory (Douglass Watson), was beginning to renounce her evil ways to become a compassionate and loving woman (though they had their own rocky relationship). Alice (now played by Susan Harney) tried her best to move on, but never really found true love. She left Bay City for a time, but eventually returned. Six years later, in October 1981, a mysterious businessman named Edward Black (David Canary) arrived in Bay City, studying pictures and news clippings on Alice (now played by Linda Borgeson). Alice was at that time engaged to Mac Cory, who was divorced from Rachel. But it soon became clear that Edward Black was not the man he claimed to be. At a formal party, Black dropped a bombshell that shocked all of Bay City: he was actually Steve Frame! Apparently Steve had survived the crash in Australia years earlier, but had suffered from amnesia and had plastic surgery on his face. He had returned not only to be with Alice and Jamie (now played by Richard Bekins), but also to resume his position as head of Frame Construction. Alice had broken off her engagement to Mac after Steve's return and they tried to resume their relationship, but after being trapped at one of his construction sites with Rachel, their attraction was resurrected and they reunited. Rachel and Steve were driving to the airport (on their way to get remarried) when they crashed their car. Steve was killed and Rachel survived, but was blinded. Six months later, having regained her sight and realizing that she never stopped loving Mac, Rachel remarried him for the third (and last) time in a double ceremony with Mac's son Sandy Cory (Christopher Rich) and Sandy's bride, Blaine Ewing (Laura Malone). Though Jamie loved Mac as a father, he never forgot Steve. When Jamie (now played by Laurence Lau) welcomed a son with his wife Vicky (Anne Heche), they named him Steven. Six years after Steve's death, he would return again, but as a ghost (George Reinholt reprised his role for Another World's 25th anniversary) to help Rachel, who was having an out-of-body experience while her body was lying unconscious, overcome with gas, in the engine room of a yacht where the 25th Anniversary party for Cory Publishing was being held. She was being enticed by the spirit of Steve's evil sister Janice Frame (Christine Jones) to die, but Steve arrived and told Rachel that it wasn't her time to die yet and that she needed to go back, which she did. Later, Steve visited Jamie, who was struggling over the fact Vicky had lied to him and that he might not be Steven's father. Steve gave Jamie some words of wisdom and told him how proud he was of the man he turned out to be. Steve told his only son he loved him and faded away forever into eternity.

While progressive rock is an appropriate overall genre for the band, much of their work delves into other genres including psychedelic music, jam band music, symphonic rock, space rock, jazz fusion, and new-age music. \\"Clearlight\\" consists of pianist and composer Cyrille Verdeaux alongside other musicians, who are usually guest participants with no compositional input, except on a couple of occasions, like the second album Forever Blowing Bubbles, where bassist Jo√´l Dugrenot had virtual co-leader status, composing two of the tracks, or Visions, which prominently featured Didier Malherbe (formerly of Gong) and Didier Lockwood (formerly of Magma and Zao) as soloists. In the mid to late 1970s the band was managed by Jacques Reland, now a lecturer at the London Metropolitan University and Head of European Research at the Global Policy Institute. The Rennes-born manager negotiated the band's first four album deals. Clearlight has rarely performed live. In 1975, Virgin sent a variation of the Forever Blowing Bubbles band on the road supporting Gong, but it broke up soon afterwards following Verdeaux's decision not to relocate to England as Virgin insisted he did - which ended his relationship with the label. In April 1978, a new version of the band was unveiled at the Olympia in Paris, a performance intended to be followed by a proper tour to promote Visions, but lack of interest from promoters dictated otherwise. In the 1980s, the name was largely retired as Verdeaux concentrated on albums released under his own name, although there was another one-off performance at an electronic music festival in 1988 featuring Verdeaux and regular collaborators Christian Boul√© and Tim Blake. In the 1990s, Verdeaux began recording under the Clearlight name again. His latest release, 2014's Impressionist Symphony, again features all three Gong members who had appeared on Clearlight Symphony.

It was intended for duties on branch lines and was delivered by almost all the locomotive building firms working for the Reichsbahn. From 1942 it was built in a simplified version as a 'transitional war locomotive' (√úbergangskriegslokomotive or √úK). The most obvious changes were the omission of the second side windows in the cab and the solid disc carrying wheels.  History  Almost all German locomotive factories took part in building these engines, 775 examples being produced in the period from 1928 to 1943. Its area of operations was predominantly the routes in Germany's Central Uplands (Mittelgebirge); as a result the first 10 units were given a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake. Twenty locomotives were destroyed during the Second World War; lightly damaged engines were repaired. Of the original 775 units, 175 went to the GDR railways, 385 to the Deutsche Bundesbahn, 29 to the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB), 44 to the PKP in Poland as the Class TKt3, 73 to the SZD and 62 to the CSD (6 of which later went to the SZD and 86 043 in 1958 to the GDR). On the last-mentioned 62 engines 28 became the CSD Class 455.2. Only 2 engines are still unaccounted for (86 016 and 86 469). The √ñBB began to retire them as early as 1945, but the last did not retire until 1972. However the Austrian engines had some of the most spectacular duties, including working double- headed on heavy, empty, ore trains with a DRB Class 52. TKt3-16 The Bundesbahn stationed most of its 86's in Nuremberg for the Franconian branch lines and the marshalling yards there. The locomotive shed at Hof, Germany was also renowned Class 86 territory. Short, semi-fast trains were also regularly hauled by the Class 86. The DB retired its last one in 1974. In the GDR railways the 86's were mainly stationed at Aue engine shed (with over 50 engines) for the surrounding Ore Mountain routes. Some DR engines stationed at Heringsdorf shed on the island of Usedom were even given smoke deflectors. One well-known service was a fast-stopping train with 7 Bghw coaches, but light express trains were also on their schedule in the Central Uplands. The Class 86's last (official) year in service in the DR was 1976, but several engines continued to run on into the 1980s. Since its inauguration in 1928, no. 86 001/86 1001 was under steam almost every day, but in its latter years was often just used as a heating engine. Its last duties were on the stub line from Schlettau to Crottendorf, where it ended its steam services in 1988. Together with 86 501 this loco was once again taken into scheduled service for a week in 1989 to celebrate the centenary of the route. With a service age of 60 years, it became the longest serving of all the standard locomotives to be placed in scheduled service by a national railway. Since 1999, no. 86 001 has been mothballed. No. 86 1056 met a tragic end in 1989 when she was the last victim of the GDR's scrapping madness and was converted into a mobile steam dispenser. Its driving gear and cylinders went into the furnace. Preserved locomotives Preserved engines include the 86 001 (Chemnitz), the oldest machine of its class, 86 049 (VSE Schwarzenberg), 86 056 (√ñGEG), 86 333, 86 457, 86 501 (√ñGEG), 86 607 (VMD loan to Adorf, a √úK variant) and 86 744 of the GDR. 86 056 and 86 501 (both GDR) were sold to Austria. Preserved DB engines include the 86 457 at the DB Museum, which unfortunately was badly damaged in the fire at the Nuremberg 1 locomotive shed (the museums depot of the Nuremberg Transport Museum). In all over 12 locomotives remain (excluding memorial ones), of which 9 are in Germany. In Poland no. 86 240 remains as no. Tkt3-16. No. 86 348 is being refurbished by the GES, but stood formerly as a monument in Breuningerland in Ludwigsburg/Tamm.

It is the first in a series of albums by a project led by pianist Cyrille Verdeaux with the participation of other musicians, including in this case three members of Gong on one side, and two other French musicians, Gilbert Artman (of Lard Free and later Urban Sax) and Christian Boul√© (formerly with Verdeaux in the band Babylone, and a later Steve Hillage sideman) on the other. Primarily psychedelic, but also serving as a forerunner of new-age music, the album's musical style manages to blend seemingly contrary elements: the symphonic rock concept is flexible enough to permit extensive jamming in both rock and jazz fusion styles. Recording and release The album was recorded for Virgin Records in 1973Cyrille Verdeaux's Clearlight 888 Music website and completed in 1974, after the label's first and highly successful release, Tubular Bells (1973) by Mike Oldfield, and was one of several subsequent Virgin albums that attempted to copy Tubular Bells' format of long pieces in a symphonic progressive rock style; in this case, exactly copying its structure of two pieces titled \\"part one\\" and \\"part two\\". Since the title Tubular Bells was initially better known to the general public than the name of its artist, Virgin Records decided that Clearlight Symphony would be a one-off album project with a title, but no artist name. Recording was initiated with a session in which Cyrille Verdeaux, alone, played two 20 minute piano solos, which became the basic tracks for the entire album. In later recording sessions at David Vorhaus' Kaleidophon studio (side one) and the Manor (side two), Verdeaux and other musicians overdubbed more instruments onto the piano solo to create a complex arrangement. The sides are not in the order Verdeaux intended. The side with Artman and Boul√© was to have been side one, and prior to the album's release, an alternate mix of an excerpt was issued on the Virgin Records compilation album V (1975) as \\"Clearlight Symphony ‚Äì extract from part 1\\". Sometime between the release of V and Clearlight Symphony Virgin Records decided that the side with Gong should become side one, partly to capitalise on Gong's growing reputation, and partly because it was closer in style to Tubular Bells with its symphonic structure (and like that album, contains no percussion in most sections), while the other side is closer to jamming rock music. In a later decade, Verdeaux obtained the rights to the album and re-issued it on CD with the parts in the intended order.

The word lower indicates that the LCST is a lower bound to a temperature interval of partial miscibility, or miscibility for certain compositions only. The phase behavior of polymer solutions is an important property involved in the development and design of most polymer- related processes. Partially miscible polymer solutions often exhibit two solubility boundaries, the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) and the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which both depend on the molar mass and the pressure. At temperatures below LCST, the system is completely miscible in all proportions, whereas above LCST partial liquid miscibility occurs.Charlet G, Delmas G (1981) Polymer 22:1181‚Äì1189Charlet G, Ducasse R, Delmas G (1981) Polymer 22:1190‚Äì1198 In the phase diagram of the mixture components, the LCST is the shared minimum of the concave up spinodal and binodal (or coexistence) curves. It is in general pressure dependent, increasing as a function of increased pressure. For small molecules, the existence of an LCST is much less common than the existence of an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), but some cases do exist. For example, the system triethylamine-water has an LCST of 19 ¬∞C, so that these two substances are miscible in all proportions below 19 ¬∞C but not at higher temperatures.P.W. Atkins and J. de Paula, \\"Atkins' Physical Chemistry\\" (8th edn, W.H. Freeman 2006) pp. 186-7M. A. White, Properties of Materials (Oxford University Press 1999) p. 175 The nicotine-water system has an LCST of 61 ¬∞C, and also a UCST of 210 ¬∞C at pressures high enough for liquid water to exist at that temperature. The components are therefore miscible in all proportions below 61 ¬∞C and above 210 ¬∞C (at high pressure), and partially miscible in the interval from 61 to 210 ¬∞C. Polymer-solvent mixtures A plot of typical polymer binary solution phase behavior including both an LCST and a UCST. Some polymer solutions have an LCST at temperatures higher than the UCST. As shown in the diagram, this means that there is a temperature interval of complete miscibility, with partial miscibility at both higher and lower temperatures.Cowie, J.M.G. \\"Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern Materials\\" (2nd edn, Blackie 1991) p.174‚Äì177 In the case of polymer solutions, the LCST also depends on polymer degree of polymerization, polydispersity and branchingS. Carter, B. Hunt, S. Rimmer, Macromolecules 38 4595 (2005);S. Rimmer, S. Carter, R. Rutkaite, J. W.Haycock, L. Swanson Soft Matter, 3 971 (2007) as well as on the polymer's composition and architecture.M. A. Ward, T. K. Georgiou, Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry 48 775 (2010) A prominent polymer possessing an LCST is Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in water, which undergoes a reversible collapse transition related to the LCST at 33 ¬∞C. Another monomer whose homo- and co-polymers exhibit LCST behavior in solution is 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate. The LCST depends on the polymer preparation and in the case of copolymers, the monomer ratios, as well as the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the polymer. To date, over 70 examples of non-ionic polymers with an LCST in aqueous solution have been found. Physical basis A key physical factor which distinguishes the LCST from other mixture behavior is that the LCST phase separation is driven by unfavorable entropy of mixing. Since mixing of the two phases is spontaneous below the LCST and not above, the Gibbs free energy change (ŒîG) for the mixing of these two phases is negative below the LCST and positive above, and the entropy change ŒîS = ‚Äì (dŒîG/dT) is negative for this mixing process. This is in contrast to the more common and intuitive case in which entropies drive mixing due to the increased volume accessible to each component upon mixing. In general, the unfavorable entropy of mixing responsible for the LCST has one of two physical origins. The first is associating interactions between the two components such as strong polar interactions or hydrogen bonds, which prevent random mixing. For example, in the triethylamine-water system, the amine molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other but only with water molecules, so in solution they remain associated to water molecules with loss of entropy. The mixing which occurs below 19 ¬∞C is due not to entropy but to the enthalpy of formation of the hydrogen bonds. The second physical factor which can lead to an LCST is compressibility effects, especially in polymer- solvent systems.Sanchez, IC and Stone, MT, \\"Statistical Thermodynamics of Polymer Solutions and Blends\\" in Polymer Blends Volume 1: Formulation. Edited by D.R. Paul and C. B. Bucknall, 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. For nonpolar systems such as polystyrene in cyclohexane, phase separation has been observed in sealed tubes (at high pressure) at temperatures approaching the liquid- vapor critical point of the solvent. At such temperatures the solvent expands much more rapidly than the polymer, whose segments are covalently linked. Mixing therefore requires contraction of the solvent for compatibility of the polymer, resulting in a loss of entropy. Theory Within statistical mechanics, the LCST may be modeled theoretically via the lattice fluid model, an extension of Flory‚ÄìHuggins solution theory, that incorporates vacancies, and thus accounts for variable density and compressibility effects. Prediction of Œ∏ (lower critical solution temperature) LCST  There are three groups of methods for correlating and predicting LCSTs. The first group proposes models that are based on a solid theoretical background using liquid‚Äìliquid or vapor‚Äìliquid experimental data. These methods require experimental data to adjust the unknown parameters, resulting in limited predictive ability .Chang BH, Bae CY (1998) Polymer 39:6449‚Äì6454 Another approach uses empirical equations that correlate Œ∏(LCST) with physicochemical properties such as density, critical properties etc., but suffers from the disadvantage that these properties are not always available. A new approach proposed by Liu and Zhong develops linear models for the prediction of Œ∏(LCST) using molecular connectivity indices, which depends only on the solvent and polymer structures. The latter approach has proven to be a very useful technique in quantitative structure‚Äìactivity/property relationships (QSAR/QSPR) research for polymers and polymer solutions. QSAR/QSPR studies constitute an attempt to reduce the trial-and-error element in the design of compounds with desired activity/properties by establishing mathematical relationships between the activity/property of interest and measurable or computable parameters, such as topological, physicochemical, stereochemistry, or electronic indices. More recently QSPR models for the prediction of the Œ∏ (LCST) using molecular (electronic, physicochemical etc.) descriptors have been published. Using validated robust QSPR models, experimental time and effort can be reduced significantly as reliable estimates of Œ∏(LCST) for polymer solutions can be obtained before they are actually synthesized in the laboratory.

It features musicians associated with the Clearlight project, most notably its leader, pianist Cyrille Verdeaux, and Musica Elettronica Viva member Ivan Coaquette, who joined forces to compose the soundtrack for the film Visa de Censure No. X by French actor Pierre Clementi. Recording details For the recording of the soundtrack in March 1975, Verdeaux and Coaquette each asked musician friends to join them at the Path√© Marconi studios in Boulogne, Paris. The results were released under the name Delired Cameleon Family by EMI Records who owned the film soundtrack rights. \\"Musique du film Visa de Censure No. X de Pierre Clementi\\" appears in small font at the top of the front cover, printed light blue on dark blue to reduce its prominence, and the film title is not mentioned at all on the label. The credits (in French) state: \\"produit par Path√© et Virgin\\" (Path√© Marconi was EMI's imprint name in France). While the participation of a number of musicians associated with the Clearlight project, including several who went on to play on the \\"Forever Blowing Bubbles\\" album, the music is logically quite different from that of Clearlight - looser in production and less symphonic, evoking psychedelic and new-age music with a strong emphasis on rock and jazz fusion jamming. The album is mostly instrumental, but with a few vocal pieces: two in French and one in English. \\"Raganesh\\" is in the form of an Indian raga, while other songs include jazz elements. The name Delired Cameleon Family was taken from a humorous \\"franglo\\" pun, \\"delire raide cam√© L√©on\\". This being an English language name for a French project, it contains, perhaps unintentionally, two words that do not exist in the English language: delired as the adjective form of delirium (\\"delirious\\" would have been correct), and cameleon is a misspelling of the lizard species chameleon (probably confused with the French spelling, cam√©l√©on). The controversial cover art shows a chameleon breaking out of a cube which could represent either a building or an LSD sugar cube, and foliage on the back cover composed of marijuana leaves. A whimsical attitude toward narcotics is also expressed in one of the song lyrics. Track listing Timings printed on the label are quite different from what the cover says.

Union forces were seeking to gain a foothold on the Red River as a prelude to besieging Port Hudson, a Confederate strong point on the Mississippi River. A second campaign, featuring a series of maneuvers in the same region from October until November 1863 is often referred to as the Second Bayou Teche campaign. First Bayou Teche campaign In March 1863, Union commander Nathaniel P. Banks, headquartered near New Orleans, wanted to drive back the Confederate forces in western Louisiana and secure a route to connect with the Mississippi River north of Confederate-held Port Hudson. Using a combined force of infantry and Union Navy vessels, Banks advanced up the Teche against Confederate units under the overall command of Richard Taylor, son of former U.S. President Zachary Taylor. Banks was successful in the Battle of Fort Bisland and Battle of Irish Bend. Taylor retreated from the Teche region, and Banks was able to capture the Confederate fort at Butte a la Rose and Alexandria. Second Bayou Teche campaign In the second half of 1863, Banks was under orders to gain a foothold in Texas. His first attempt had been repulsed at the Second Battle of Sabine Pass. In October, he ordered troops under Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin to move north- west from New Iberia and the Berwick Bay area to probe the land route toward Texas. The difficulty of the route, the resistance from Confederates, and the success of a coastal operation in Texas led to the termination of Franklin's advance.

All trams of this type were built by the Finnish metal industry corporation Valmet between the years 1983 and 1987. Between 1996 and 2005 all trams in the class were modernised by HKL and redesignated as Nr II+ class. From 2006 onwards all trams of this class will be rebuilt with a low-floor midsection. Currently, when all the units have been rebuilt with a low-floor midsection, the whole class has been redesignated as MLNRV II. History The Nr II class was a further development of the Nr I class built by Valmet for the HKL between 1973 and 1975 (the Nr I was in turn based on the popular D√ºwag-built GT6 class). The Nr I and Nr II classes are virtually identical in their exterior and interior designs, with exception of the tail lights.

The first three Nr II class trams were delivered to Helsinki City Transport (HKL) in 1983, followed by an additional 11 in both 1984 and 1985, further ten in 1986, and the final seven in 1987. The first tram in the class entered service for HKL in July 1983. Between 1996 and 2005, all trams in this class were modernised with updates to the technics, changes to the interior layout, addition of electronic displays displaying the name of the next stop, as well as replacement of the original seats with new ones. Following the modernisation, the class was re-designated as Nr II+. Number 72 was one of the three units rebuilt with a remodeled windshield following the accident in July 2003. On July 21, 2003, one of the Nr II-class trams derailed at high speed in the junction between Mannerheimintie and Aleksanterinkatu in central Helsinki, and collided with a motorcycle, which resulted in the death of the motorcyclist. An investigation into the causes of the accident revealed, that the driver of the tram had lost consciousness shortly before the collision due to extreme heat in the cockpit of the tram. As a result of the accident, HKL redesigned the windshield of the Nr II class trams, adding a large vizor that contains an air conditioning unit, which also shields the driver from direct sunlight. Trams 72, 95 and 109 were refitted with modified windshields in 2005. As of March 2009, they remain the only units with a rebuilt windshield. Interior of an Nr II tram after the 1996-2005 modernisation. Between 2004 and 2007, all trams in the class were built with new line displays in the front and side of the tram, displaying both the number and destination on the line. In 2006, tram number 80 was rebuilt with a new low-floor midsection, built by Verkehrs Industrie Systeme. As a result of the lengthening, the tram has a B‚Ä≤2‚Ä≤2‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ wheel arrangement, and can accommodate 30 additional passengers. To cope with the added weight of the midsection, the output of the traction motors was increased by approximately 20%. Experiences with the prototype lengthened tram were positive, and the rest of the Nr II class will be similarly rebuilt from late 2008 onwards. As of November 2009, trams with numbers 76, 80, 85, 86, 91, 98, 99, 101, 102, 110, 111 and 102 have been rebuilt with low-floor midsections. Future The Nr II class are expected to remain in service at least until 2025. Liveries Like the Nr I class, the first Nr II class trams were originally painted in an orange/grey colour scheme. In 1986 HKL decided to abandon the unpopular colour scheme, and from tram number 104 onwards the Nr II class trams were delivered in HKL's traditional green/yellow livery. By 1995 all units in the class had been repainted the green/yellow livery.

Its predecessor Clearlight Symphony having been released earlier in 1975, Cyrille Verdeaux was offered to record a follow-up effort. This time, he decided to work with a full band, using several musicians he had played with on the one-off Delired Cameleon Family project, most notably bassist Jo√´l Dugrenot (formerly of Zao), and during the summer of 1975 studio time was booked at Virgin's Manor studio in England. English musicians sat in alongside their French counterparts, including former King Crimson violinist David Cross and two of Hatfield and the North's occasional backing vocalists The Northettes. The album covers many contrasting genres including psychedelic, new age, folk, rock and jazz fusion jamming, and the closing track of abstract electronic music experimentation. Only two songs have vocals, and are sung in French. Following the release of the album, Clearlight embarked on a UK tour supporting Gong, with an altered line-up comprising Verdeaux, Dugrenot, Jeanneau, D'Agostini, and new members Coco Roussel (drums, ex Heldon, and later in Happy The Man), Jorge Pinchevsky (violin, later in Gong) and Francis Mandin (synthesizers). Cover art The cover depicts connections with previous albums, which became a trend in Clearlight album covers from this point onward. On the cover of Clearlight Symphony, cables connect an electrical box to a head, with one cable leading off in the distance, over the horizon. On the cover of Forever Blowing Bubbles, the same cable comes over the horizon, and ends in a disconnected DIN plug lying in the grass, blowing bubbles. The grass appears to be a redrawing of the marijuana leaves from the back cover of Delired Cameleon Family, but are now just ordinary lawn grass.

William Jackson Pope was born on 31 March 1870 in Hoxton to William (a saddler) and Alice (n√©e Hall). His parents were staunch and active Wesleyans who had eight children, of whom William was the eldest. In 1878 he entered the Central Foundation School, in London, where his ability to learn rapidly gave him leisure at the age of twelve to carry out simple chemical experiments in his bedroom. While at school he also developed great skill as a photographer‚Äîmany of his early photographs were in perfect condition fifty years later. From there he moved to the Finsbury Technical College, where he learned much from H E Armstrong; the two later became close friends. Pope studied crystallography under H. A. Miers, and most of his earlier research focussed on measuring crystallographic data with a goniometer. These studies had an important influence on the development of his chemical work, for they enhanced the natural faculty of visualising spatial relationships. This drew him into the field of stereochemistry where his most notable achievements were to resolve a series of asymmetric, optically active compounds of nitrogen, sulfur, tin and selenium. This led to his appointment in 1901 to a chair of chemistry at the Manchester Municipal School of Technology. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in June 1902, and then to the 1702 chair of chemistry at Cambridge University in 1908. During the First World War, Pope served on the Board of Invention and Research for the Admiralty and on the Chemical Warfare Committee at the Ministry of Munitions, where one of his contributions was a modified method for preparing mustard gas. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours and was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours, the only chemist to be knighted for service during World War I. Pope was president of the Chemical Society from 1917-19 and of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (1923-25). Sir William died, unmarried, in Cambridge on 17 October 1939, after a long illness. A memorial service was held for him at St John‚Äôs College Chapel.

Distribution Naso brevirostris is widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Another species, Naso maculatus, may also be called the spotted unicornfish. This species is listed as \\"least concern\\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and there are no observed declines as a result of commercial or recreational fishing. IUCN Habitat The short-nosed unicornfish dwells in mid-waters along steep outer lagoon, in rocky shore and seaward reef drop-offs, and prefers water temperatures ranging from 22.4 to 29¬∞ Celsius. The short-nosed unicornfish can be easily found in the coral reef area around Green Island, Taiwan Description Naso brevirostris can reach a maximum length of . These fishes have an elongate, oval body, with a short snout and a small, protrusible mouth. They are olivaceous brown to bluish grey in color, with a prominent horn, many small dark spots on head and short irregular lines on sides of body. The anterior part of the body is rather pale. The tail is whitish with dark blotch. The caudal knives are relatively larger in males (sexual dimorphism). These fishes have six dorsal spines, 27-29 dorsal soft rays and 27-30 anal soft rays. Subadults show dark spots on head and body, while juveniles lack the prominent horn. Biology This species forms spawning aggregations. Adults feed on algae and zooplankton, while juveniles mainly feed on benthic algae.

It is most abundant in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Brittany, Galicia, Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores, but is also found in other locations including France, Spain, Portugal and Italy.\\"Species Action Plan: Killarney Fern (Trichomanes speciosum)\\" BAP. Retrieved 26 June 2008. It is a relict endemic European species with a disjunct distribution, having had a much wider distribution before the climate changes of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. This fern has an unusual life cycle, with a perennial gametophyte phase with an active vegetative reproduction. The gametophyte has the ability to tolerate darker and drier habitats than does the sporophyte. The sporophyte form is found in only 16 locations in the UK although the gametophyte form is more widespread. Once found on Arran, it was thought to be extinct in Scotland due to the activities of Victorian collectors,Ratcliffe, Derek (1977) Highland Flora. Inverness. HIDB. page 40. but the species has been discovered on Skye in its gametophyte form.\\"Skye Flora\\". plant-identification.co.uk. Retrieved 25 May 2008. In the UK it is classed as vulnerable and it is considered one of Europe's most threatened plants.\\"Species Recovery Programme\\" English Nature. Retrieved 26 June 2008. It is found mostly near the western coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland and at scattered locations inland. Killarney fern is a medium-sized, long-lived fern with delicate, highly divided, bipinnate fronds arising from a creeping rhizome. It is one of only three European species with translucent leaves and requires a humid, frost-free environment. In Britain, it is largely restricted to damp, shady, sheltered locations such as ravines,\\"Killarney fern (Trichomanes speciosum)\\" Arkive. Retrieved 26 June 2008. although in Ireland it occupies a wider range of habitats. In Brittany, it grows on the stonework of a number of ancient wells. It became a protected species in the UK in 1975 under the Conservation of Wild Creatures and Wild Plants Act.

Returning again to France, Clearlight turned to conceptual space rock with science fiction lyrics. (The lyrics do not have anything to do with a mad monkey, however.) Les Contes du Singe Fou is the only Clearlight album in which vocals and lyrics play a significant role. In reverse of the previous album, the title is in French, but all lyrics are in English. This is not apparent from the cover, which contains no song titles on the outside. English Lyrics with French translations are printed on the cover's gatefold. Musically, the album contains psychedelic, new age, and jazz fusion elements. Cover art The cover has an elaborate fantasy illustration that makes reference to song titles, previous album covers, and a member of the group. The artist is not explicitly credited, but his signature, \\"Sol√©\\" is visible. The picture, which continues onto the back cover, shows a character on the front with a monkey's head on a human body, chest and one hand visible but otherwise wearing a fantastic multi-coloured suit with cape. On the back there is an unclothed monkey with a human's head, suggesting the heads of a human and a monkey have been exchanged. The character on the front is wearing skates, and the character on the back is holding a large key, referencing the two suite titles. The two characters are connected by a cable which is an electrical connection to a box on the front cover character's chest, similar to the box of dials and cables on the cover of Clearlight Symphony. The cable turns into an umbilical cord where it attaches to the character on the back cover. Other cables from the box lead to the monkey's head and ears, and some lead out of sight, as also seen on the covers of Clearlight Symphony and Forever Blowing Bubbles. Although planets appear to be suspended in space, the characters are sitting upon and hanging from crescent moons, and the front cover moon and one of the planets on the back are made of a substance that is dripping, suggesting there is gravity present in a downward direction. The crescent moons are physically crescent, rather than in shadow, making the whole cover look like a stage prop background. The monkey on the back holds a miniature planet Earth between its feet. A rainbow hangs impossibly in space, despite the supposed lack of atmosphere. (Rainbows appear on all Clearlight covers, with the exception of Delired Cameleon Family.) A bubble also floats in space, similar to those seen on Forever Blowing Bubbles. On the back, there is a planet made of bricks, and a keyhole in one brick exactly matches the key held by the monkey. A small moon inscribed with an aum symbol orbits the brick planet, almost touching it. Finally, the crescent moon on the back is sprouting a huge weed-like plant with berries, undoubtedly a reference to \\"Moonweed\\", Tim Blake's nickname.
